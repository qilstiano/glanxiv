A result of Duffus, Jacobson, and Gould from 1981 states that every\nconnected $\\{\\text{claw}, \\text{net}\\}$-free graph $G$ has a Hamiltonian path,\nthat is, $G$ has path eccentricity $0$. Several more recent works identified\nvarious classes of connected graphs with path eccentricity at most $1$, or,\nequivalently, graphs having a spanning caterpillar, including connected\n$P_5$-free graphs, AT-free graphs, and biconvex graphs. Generalizing all these\nresults, we apply the work on structural distance domination of Bacs\\'o and\nTuza [Discrete Math., 2012] and characterize, for every positive integer $k$,\ngraphs such that every connected induced subgraph has path eccentricity less\nthan $k$. More specifically, we show that every connected $\\{S_{k},\nT_{k}\\}$-free graph has a path eccentricity less than $k$, where $S_k$ and\n$T_k$ are two specific graphs of path eccentricity $k$ (a subdivided claw and\nthe line graph of such a graph). As a consequence, every connected $H$-free\ngraph has path eccentricity less than $k$ if and only if $H$ is an induced\nsubgraph of $3P_{k}$ or $P_{2k+1} + P_{k-1}$. For such cases, we also provide a\nrobust polynomial-time algorithm that finds a path witnessing the upper bound\non the path eccentricity.

In\nthis work, we develop a quantum sensing protocol to estimate a parameter\n$\\theta$, associated with a magnetic field, under full-rank Markovian noise.\nOur approach uses a probe state constructed from a CSS code that evolves under\nthe parameter's Hamiltonian for a short time, but without any active error\ncorrection. Then we measure the code's $\\hat{X}$ stabilizers to infer $\\theta$.\nGiven $N$ copies of the probe state, we derive the probability that all\nstabilizer measurements return $+1$, which depends on $\\theta$. The uncertainty\nin $\\theta$ (estimated from these measurements) is bounded by a new quantity,\nthe Robustness Bound, which characterizes how the structure of the quantum code\naffects the Quantum Fisher Information of the measurement. Using this bound, we\nestablish a strong no-go result: a nontrivial CSS code can achieve Heisenberg\nscaling if and only if the Hamiltonian is orthogonal to the span of the noise\nchannel's Lindblad operators. This result extends the well-known HNLS condition\nunder infinite rounds of error correction to the robust quantum sensing setting\nthat does not use active error correction.

KoGNER employs a two-step process: (1) Knowledge\nDistillation, where external knowledge sources are distilled into a lightweight\nrepresentation for seamless integration with NER models, and (2) Entity-Aware\nAugmentation, which integrates contextual embeddings that have been enriched\nwith knowledge graph information directly into GNN, thereby improving the\nmodel's ability to understand and represent entity relationships. Experimental\nresults on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KoGNER achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, outperforming finetuned NER models and LLMs by a significant\nmargin. These findings suggest that leveraging knowledge graphs as auxiliary\ninformation can significantly improve NER accuracy, making KoGNER a promising\ndirection for future research in knowledge-aware NLP.",

In sharp contrast to the existing\nliterature, we directly study the original system as opposed to an approximate\nlimiting system such as a diffusion approximation.

    "abstract": "Due to the limited accuracy of 4D Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in\nidentifying hemodynamics in cardiovascular diseases, the challenges in\nobtaining patient-specific flow boundary conditions, and the computationally\ndemanding and time-consuming nature of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)\nsimulations, it is crucial to explore new data assimilation algorithms that\noffer possible alternatives to these limitations. In the present work, we study\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets),\nand their Physics-Informed extensions (PI-DeepONets) in predicting vascular\nflow simulations in the context of a 3D Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)\nidealized model. PINN is a technique that combines deep neural networks with\nthe fundamental principles of physics, incorporating the physics laws, which\nare given as partial differential equations, directly into loss functions used\nduring the training process. On the other hand, DeepONet is designed to learn\nnonlinear operators from data and is particularly useful in studying parametric\npartial differential equations (PDEs), e.g., families of PDEs with different\nsource terms, boundary conditions, or initial conditions. Here, we adapt the\napproaches to address the particular use case of AAA by integrating the 3D\nNavier-Stokes equations (NSE) as the physical laws governing fluid dynamics. In\naddition, we follow best practices to enhance the capabilities of the models by\neffectively capturing the underlying physics of the problem under study. The\nadvantages and limitations of each approach are highlighted through a series of\nrelevant application cases. We validate our results by comparing them with CFD\nsimulations for benchmark datasets, demonstrating good agreements and\nemphasizing those cases where improvements in computational efficiency are\nobserved.",

    "abstract": "Given an arbitrary subgraph $H=H_n$ and $p=p_n \\in (0,1)$, the planted\nsubgraph model is defined as follows. A statistician observes the union a\nrandom copy $H^*$ of $H$, together with random noise in the form of an instance\nof an Erdos-Renyi graph $G(n,p)$. Their goal is to recover the planted $H^*$\nfrom the observed graph. Our focus in this work is to understand the minimum\nmean squared error (MMSE) for sufficiently large $n$.\n  A recent paper [MNSSZ23] characterizes the graphs for which the limiting MMSE\ncurve undergoes a sharp phase transition from $0$ to $1$ as $p$ increases, a\nbehavior known as the all-or-nothing phenomenon, up to a mild density\nassumption on $H$. In this paper, we provide a formula for the limiting MMSE\ncurve for any graph $H=H_n$, up to the same mild density assumption. This curve\nis expressed in terms of a variational formula over pairs of subgraphs of $H$,\nand is inspired by the celebrated subgraph expectation thresholds from the\nprobabilistic combinatorics literature [KK07]. Furthermore, we give a\npolynomial-time description of the optimizers of this variational problem. This\nallows one to efficiently approximately compute the MMSE curve for any dense\ngraph $H$ when $n$ is large enough. The proof relies on a novel graph\ndecomposition of $H$ as well as a new minimax theorem which may be of\nindependent interest.\n  Our results generalize to the setting of minimax rates of recovering\narbitrary monotone boolean properties planted in random noise, where the\nstatistician observes the union of a planted minimal element $A \\subseteq [N]$\nof a monotone property and a random $Ber(p)^{\\otimes N}$ vector. In this\nsetting, we provide a variational formula inspired by the so-called\n\"fractional\" expectation threshold [Tal10], again describing the MMSE curve (in\nthis case up to a multiplicative constant) for large enough $n$.",

Consequently, this drives the need for a multi-task SC system\nthat can handle new tasks without additional training, known as zero-shot\nlearning.

In particular, we investigate the\nbehavior of coordinated accounts within a large set of retweet-based\ninformation cascades identifying key differences between coordinated and\nnon-coordinated accounts in terms of position within the cascade, action delay\nand outreach. On average, coordinated accounts occupy higher positions of the\ninformation cascade (i.e., closer to the root), spread messages faster and\ninvolve a slightly higher number of users. When considering cascade metrics\nsuch as size, number of edges and height, we observe clear differences among\ninformation cascades that are associated to a systematically larger proportion\nof coordinated accounts, as confirmed by comparisons with statistical null\nmodels. To further characterize the activity of coordinated accounts we\nintroduce two new measures capturing their infectivity within the information\ncascade (i.e., their ability to involve other users) and their interaction with\nnon-coordinated accounts. Finally, we find that the interaction pattern between\nthe two classes of users follows a saturation-like process.

To study whether this creates difficulties in the patient trial\nmatching process, we design a new dataset and task, Natural Language Inference\nfor Patient Recruitment (NLI4PR), in which patient language profiles must be\nmatched to clinical trials.

We argue that the system\nachieves its asymptotic behavior through a trade-off between the relaxation\ntowards the stable attractors of the underlying deterministic system and the\nstochastic perturbations that non-trivially affect such a process.

    "abstract": "When placed in parallel magnetic and electric fields, the electron\ntrajectories of a classical hydrogen atom are chaotic. The classical escape\nrate of such a system can be computed with classical trajectory Monte Carlo\ntechniques, but these computations require enormous numbers of trajectories,\nprovide little understanding of the dynamical mechanisms involved, and must be\ncompletely rerun for any change of system parameter, no matter how small. We\ndemonstrate an alternative technique to classical trajectory Monte Carlo\ncomputations, based on classical periodic orbit theory. In this technique,\nescape rates are computed from a relatively modest number (a few thousand) of\nperiodic orbits of the system. One only needs the orbits' periods and stability\neigenvalues. A major advantage of this approach is that one does not need to\nrepeat the entire analysis from scratch as system parameters are varied; one\ncan numerically continue the periodic orbits instead. We demonstrate the\nperiodic orbit technique for the ionization of a hydrogen atom in applied\nparallel electric and magnetic fields. Using fundamental theories of phase\nspace geometry, we also show how to generate nontrivial symbolic dynamics for\nacquiring periodic orbits in physical systems. A detailed analysis of\nheteroclinic tangles and how they relate to bifurcations in periodic orbits is\nalso presented.",

These four approaches included the whole volume\nwithout BRS and with BRS, BRS with the selected lesion slices and lastly\noptimal volume with BRS. Preprocessing methods like augmentation and\noversampling were used to enhance the small dataset, data shape uniformity and\nimprove model performance. Optimal volume size were investigated by a precise\nprocess to ensure that all lesions existed in slices. To evaluate the model, a\nhybrid loss function including dice, focal and cross entropy along with 5-fold\ncross validation method were used and lastly a test dataset which was randomly\nsplit used to evaluate the model performance on unseen data for each of four\nmentioned approaches.\n  Results Results demonstrate that using BRS considerably improved model\nperformance and validation. Significant improvement in last approach -- optimal\nvolume with BRS -- compared to the approach without BRS counting around 50\npercent demonstrating how effective BRS has been in BLS.

Recent studies have found that neural\nnetworks (NNs) can map simulated multidimensional spectra to molecular-scale\nproperties with high accuracy. However, simulations often do not capture\nexperimental factors that influence real spectra, including noise and\nsuboptimal pulse resonance conditions, bringing into question the experimental\nutility of NNs trained on simulated data. Here, we show how factors associated\nwith experimental 2D spectral data influence the ability of NNs to map\nsimulated 2DES spectra onto underlying intermolecular electronic couplings. By\nsystematically introducing multisourced noise into a library of 356000\nsimulated 2D spectra, we show that noise does not hamper NN performance for\nspectra exceeding threshold signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (> 6.6 if background\nnoise dominates vs. > 2.5 for intensity-dependent noise). In stark contrast to\nhuman-based analyses of 2DES data, we find that the NN accuracy improves\nsignificantly (ca. 84% $\\rightarrow$ 96%) when the data are constrained by the\nbandwidth and center frequency of the pump pulses. This result is consistent\nwith the NN learning the optical trends described by Kasha's theory of\nmolecular excitons. Our findings convey positive prospects for adapting\nsimulation-trained NNs to extract molecular properties from inherently\nimperfect experimental 2DES data. More broadly, we propose that machine-learned\nperspectives of nonlinear spectroscopic data may produce unique and, perhaps,\ncounterintuitive guidelines for experimental design.",

Inference on such models,\nwhich is performed by conditioning on some observed variables, is typically\ndone approximately by optimizing a free energy, which is an instance of\nvariational inference.

We prove\nthe universal approximation property (UAP) of such shallow neural networks in\nthe space of continuous functions. Furthermore, we investigate the\napproximation properties of shallow neural networks whose parameters are\nrequired to satisfy some constraints. In particular, we constrain the Lipschitz\nconstant of the flow of the neural ODE to increase the stability of the shallow\nneural network, and we restrict the norm of the weight matrices of the linear\nlayers to one to make sure that the restricted expansivity of the flow is not\ncompensated by the increased expansivity of the linear layers. For this\nsetting, we prove approximation bounds that tell us the accuracy to which we\ncan approximate a continuous function with a shallow neural network with such\nconstraints. We prove that the UAP holds if we consider only the constraint on\nthe Lipschitz constant of the flow or the unit norm constraint on the weight\nmatrices of the linear layers.",

In this\npaper, we provide a direct comparison between SL and RL in terms of zero-shot\ngeneralization. Using the Habitat visual navigation task as a testbed, we\nevaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Behavior Cloning (BC) agents\nacross two levels of generalization: state-goal pair generalization within seen\nenvironments and generalization to unseen environments. Our experiments show\nthat PPO consistently outperforms BC across both zero-shot settings and\nperformance metrics-success rate and SPL. Interestingly, even though additional\noptimal training data enables BC to match PPO's zero-shot performance in SPL,\nit still falls significantly behind in success rate. We attribute this to a\nfundamental difference in how models trained by these algorithms generalize:\nBC-trained models generalize by imitating successful trajectories, whereas\nTD-based RL-trained models generalize through combinatorial experience\nstitching-leveraging fragments of past trajectories (mostly failed ones) to\nconstruct solutions for new tasks. This allows RL to efficiently find solutions\nin vast state space and discover novel strategies beyond the scope of human\nknowledge.

Our aim is to design efficient algorithms for the two robots to capture\nthe target. The target is captured only when both robots are co-located with\nit. The robots communicate with each other only face-to-face (F2F), meaning\nthey can exchange information only when co-located, while the target remains\noblivious and has no communication capabilities.\n  We design algorithms under various knowledge scenarios, which take into\naccount the prior knowledge the robots have about the starting distance $d$,\nthe direction of movement (either toward or away from the origin), and the\nspeed $v$ of the target. As a measure of the efficiency of the algorithms, we\nuse the competitive ratio, which is the ratio of the capture time of an\nalgorithm with limited knowledge to the capture time in the full-knowledge\nmodel.

Applying a transfeminist lens in combination with\na critical self-reflexivity methodology, I retroactively reinterpret findings\nfrom three empirical studies of AI governance practices in Canada and globally.\nIn three reflections on my findings, I show that large-scale AI governance\nsystems structurally prioritize the needs of industry over marginalized\ncommunities. As a result, AI governance is limited by power imbalances and\nexclusionary norms. This research shows that re-grounding AI governance in\ntransfeminist ethical principles can support AI governance researchers,\npractitioners, and organizers in addressing those limitations.",

    "abstract": "Traditional information retrieval is primarily concerned with finding\nrelevant information from large datasets without imposing a structure within\nthe retrieved pieces of data. However, structuring information in the form of\nnarratives--ordered sets of documents that form coherent storylines--allows us\nto identify, interpret, and share insights about the connections and\nrelationships between the ideas presented in the data. Despite their\nsignificance, current approaches for algorithmically extracting storylines from\ndata are scarce, with existing methods primarily relying on intricate\nword-based heuristics and auxiliary document structures. Moreover, many of\nthese methods are difficult to scale to large datasets and general contexts, as\nthey are designed to extract storylines for narrow tasks. In this paper, we\npropose Narrative Trails, an efficient, general-purpose method for extracting\ncoherent storylines in large text corpora. Specifically, our method uses the\nsemantic-level information embedded in the latent space of deep learning models\nto build a sparse coherence graph and extract narratives that maximize the\nminimum coherence of the storylines. By quantitatively evaluating our proposed\nmethods on two distinct narrative extraction tasks, we show the\ngeneralizability and scalability of Narrative Trails in multiple contexts while\nalso simplifying the extraction pipeline.",

We argue that considering the\nanisotropic propagation of cosmic rays within a realistically modeled Galactic\nmagnetic field enables an accurate description of the spectral break without\ninvoking a source-related cutoff energy, and naturally predicts a spatial\ndependence of this phenomenon. To demonstrate this, we constructed a 3D\ndiffusion propagation model with a diffusion tensor within a two-component\nmagnetic field and determined both the local cosmic-ray spectrum and the\nspectra for specific regions of the Milky Way. We found that the spectral break\nis well reproduced by the energy dependence of the diffusion tensor components\nand appears at different energies in various regions of the Galaxy due to the\ninclusion of the turbulent component of the magnetic field. Furthermore, the\nspectral slope is determined by the degree of anisotropy in cosmic-ray\ndiffusion. The model is based on the calculation of the diffusion tensor\ncomponents using the trajectory method and on the direct solution of the\nstationary diffusion equation with a fully anisotropic diffusion tensor that\nincludes all nine components in the global Galactic coordinate system,\naccounting for off-diagonal terms arising from the projection of locally\nfield-aligned diffusion. We calculated the integral flux of diffuse gamma rays\nin the inner and outer regions of the Galaxy based on the cosmic-ray proton and\nnuclei spectra obtained within our model, which features a spatially dependent\nposition of the knee. The resulting spectral shape of the diffuse gamma-ray\nflux is consistent with experimental data from LHAASO and Fermi-LAT.",

This approach was beneficial\nbecause it avoided case-specific transformations to a body-attached reference\nframe. Building on this, we now address the challenges of long time integration\nin velocity reconstruction and pressure recovery by extending this IBA\nframework with sequential learning strategies. Key difficulties for PINNs in\nlong time integration include temporal sparsity, long temporal domains and rich\nspectral content. To tackle these, a moving boundary-enabled PINN is developed,\nproposing two sequential learning strategies: - a time marching with gradual\nincrease in time domain size, however, this approach struggles with error\naccumulation over long time domains; and - a time decomposition which divides\nthe temporal domain into smaller segments, combined with transfer learning it\neffectively reduces error propagation and computational complexity. The key\nfindings for modelling of incompressible unsteady flows past a flapping airfoil\ninclude: - for quasi-periodic flows, the time decomposition approach with\npreferential spatio-temporal sampling improves accuracy and efficiency for\npressure recovery and aerodynamic load reconstruction, and, - for long time\ndomains, decomposing it into smaller temporal segments and employing multiple\nsub-networks, simplifies the problem ensuring stability and reduced network\nsizes.

Although existing monocular\nclothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often\nrely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free\nenvironment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these\nalgorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions.\nAdditionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage\ngeometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are\nextremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications.

Specifically, CHROME leverages a\nmultiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from\nthe occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly\nenforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is\nthen trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded\ninput and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive\nand accurate 3D representation.

    "abstract": "Stochastic systems have a control-theoretic interpretation in which noise\nplays the role of control. In the weak-noise limit, relevant at low\ntemperatures or in large populations, this leads to a precise mathematical\nmapping: the most probable trajectory between two states minimizes an action\nfunctional and corresponds to an optimal control strategy. In Langevin\ndynamics, the noise term itself serves as the control. For general Markov jump\nprocesses, such as chemical reaction networks or electronic circuits, we use\nthe Doi-Peliti formalism to identify the `response' (or `momentum') field $\\pi$\nas the control variable. This resolves a long-standing interpretational problem\nin the field-theoretic description of stochastic systems: although $\\pi$\nevolves backward in time, it has a clear physical role as the control that\nsteers the system along rare trajectories. This implies that Nature is\nconstantly sampling control strategies. We illustrate the mapping on\nmultistable chemical reaction networks, systems with unstable fixed points, and\nspecifically on stochastic resonance and Brownian ratchets. The noise-control\nmapping justifies agential descriptions of these phenomena, and builds\nintuition for otherwise puzzling phenomena of stochastic systems: why\nprobabilities are generically non-smooth functions of state out of thermal\nequilibrium; why biological mechanisms can work better in the presence of\nnoise; and how agential behavior emerges naturally without recourse to\nmysticism.",

An initial\nexploratory study involved ten participants, followed by an expanded dataset\ncomprising thirty stakeholders, including players, coaches, and staff from\nQatari football organizations. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to\nevaluate the relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,\npower distance, innovation receptiveness, integration complexity, and overall\nadoption. The results indicate that perceived usefulness, innovation\nreceptiveness, and lower power distance significantly drive EPTS adoption,\nwhile ease of use is marginally significant and integration complexity is\nnon-significant in this sample.

This thesis aims to build the foundation for building\nscene flow estimators with two important properties: they are scalable, i.e.\nthey improve with access to more data and computation, and they are flexible,\ni.e. they work out-of-the-box in a variety of domains and on a variety of\nmotion patterns without requiring significant hyperparameter tuning.\n  In this dissertation we present several concrete contributions towards this.\nIn Chapter 1 we contextualize scene flow and its prior methods. In Chapter 2 we\npresent a blueprint to build and scale feedforward scene flow estimators\nwithout requiring expensive human annotations via large scale distillation from\npseudolabels provided by strong unsupervised test-time optimization methods. In\nChapter 3 we introduce a benchmark to better measure estimate quality across\ndiverse object types, better bringing into focus what we care about and expect\nfrom scene flow estimators, and use this benchmark to host a public challenge\nthat produced significant progress. In Chapter 4 we present a state-of-the-art\nunsupervised scene flow estimator that introduces a new, full sequence problem\nformulation and exhibits great promise in adjacent domains like 3D point\ntracking. Finally, in Chapter 5 I philosophize about what's next for scene flow\nand its potential future broader impacts.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technology to enhance the\nfunctionality and reliability of large language models (LLMs) by retrieving\nrelevant information from reliable external knowledge (REK). RAG has gained\ninterest in radiology, and we previously reported the utility of NotebookLM, an\nLLM with RAG (RAG-LLM), for lung cancer staging. However, since the comparator\nLLM differed from NotebookLM's internal model, it remained unclear whether its\nadvantage stemmed from RAG or inherent model differences. To better isolate\nRAG's impact and assess its utility across different cancers, we compared\nNotebookLM with its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0 Flash, in a pancreatic cancer\nstaging experiment.\n  Materials and Methods: A summary of Japan's pancreatic cancer staging\nguidelines was used as REK. We compared three groups - REK+/RAG+ (NotebookLM\nwith REK), REK+/RAG- (Gemini 2.0 Flash with REK), and REK-/RAG- (Gemini 2.0\nFlash without REK) - in staging 100 fictional pancreatic cancer cases based on\nCT findings. Staging criteria included TNM classification, local invasion\nfactors, and resectability classification. In REK+/RAG+, retrieval accuracy was\nquantified based on the sufficiency of retrieved REK excerpts.\n  Results: REK+/RAG+ achieved a staging accuracy of 70%, outperforming\nREK+/RAG- (38%) and REK-/RAG- (35%). For TNM classification, REK+/RAG+ attained\n80% accuracy, exceeding REK+/RAG- (55%) and REK-/RAG- (50%). Additionally,\nREK+/RAG+ explicitly presented retrieved REK excerpts, achieving a retrieval\naccuracy of 92%.\n  Conclusion: NotebookLM, a RAG-LLM, outperformed its internal LLM, Gemini 2.0\nFlash, in a pancreatic cancer staging experiment, suggesting that RAG may\nimprove LLM's staging accuracy. Furthermore, its ability to retrieve and\npresent REK excerpts provides transparency for physicians, highlighting its\napplicability for clinical diagnosis and classification.",

    "abstract": "Automatically adapting novels into screenplays is important for the TV, film,\nor opera industries to promote products with low costs. The strong performances\nof large language models (LLMs) in long-text generation call us to propose a\nLLM based framework Reader-Rewriter (R$^2$) for this task. However, there are\ntwo fundamental challenges here. First, the LLM hallucinations may cause\ninconsistent plot extraction and screenplay generation. Second, the\ncausality-embedded plot lines should be effectively extracted for coherent\nrewriting. Therefore, two corresponding tactics are proposed: 1) A\nhallucination-aware refinement method (HAR) to iteratively discover and\neliminate the affections of hallucinations; and 2) a causal plot-graph\nconstruction method (CPC) based on a greedy cycle-breaking algorithm to\nefficiently construct plot lines with event causalities. Recruiting those\nefficient techniques, R$^2$ utilizes two modules to mimic the human screenplay\nrewriting process: The Reader module adopts a sliding window and CPC to build\nthe causal plot graphs, while the Rewriter module generates first the scene\noutlines based on the graphs and then the screenplays. HAR is integrated into\nboth modules for accurate inferences of LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate\nthe superiority of R$^2$, which substantially outperforms three existing\napproaches (51.3%, 22.6%, and 57.1% absolute increases) in pairwise comparison\nat the overall win rate for GPT-4o.",

Developers can\noff-load their computations and verify executions cryptographically.\nFurthermore, Acurast offers a modular execution layer, taking advantage of\nsecure hardware and trusted execution environments, removing the trust required\nin third parties, and reducing them to cryptographic hardness assumptions. With\nthis modular architecture, Acurast serves as a decentralized and serverless\ncloud, allowing confidential and verifiable compute backed by the hardware of\nsecurity and performance mobile devices.",

This study examines the elevated D/H ratios in methane on these\nKBOs in the context of protosolar nebula dynamics and chemistry, and proposes a\nprimordial origin for the methane, in contrast to previous hypotheses\nsuggesting abiotic production by internal heating. A time-dependent disk model\ncoupled with a deuterium chemistry module was used to simulate the isotopic\nexchange between methane and hydrogen. Observational constraints, including the\nD/H ratio measured in methane in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, were used to\nrefine the primordial D/H abundance. The simulations show that the observed D/H\nratios in methane on Eris and Makemake are consistent with a primordial origin.\nThe results suggest that methane on these KBOs likely originates from the\nprotosolar nebula, similar to cometary methane, and was sequestered in solid\nform -- either as pure condensates or clathrates -- within their building\nblocks prior to accretion. These results provide a { simple} explanation for\nthe high D/H ratios in methane on Eris and Makemake, without the need to invoke\ninternal production mechanisms.",

However, existing tools often lack\nfull automation and exhibit inconsistent accuracy, limiting their potential for\nintegration into clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we developed\nSMAART-AI (Skeletal Muscle Assessment-Automated and Reliable Tool-based on AI),\nan end-to-end automated pipeline powered by deep learning models (nnU-Net 2D)\ntrained on mid-third lumbar level CT images with 5-fold cross-validation,\nensuring generalizability and robustness.

We combined the SMA, skeletal muscle index, BMI,\nand clinical data to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model designed to\npredict cachexia at the time of cancer diagnosis. Tested on the\ngastroesophageal cancer dataset, SMAART-AI achieved a Dice score of 97.80% +/-\n0.93%, with SMA estimated across all four datasets in this study at a median\nabsolute error of 2.48% compared to manual annotations with SliceOmatic.\nUncertainty metrics-variance, entropy, and coefficient of variation-strongly\ncorrelated with SMA prediction errors (0.83, 0.76, and 0.73 respectively).

State-of-the-art cancelable schemes generate pseudo-identifiers by\ntransforming the original template using either user-specific salting or\nmany-to-one transformations. In addition to the performance concerns, most of\nsuch schemes are modality-specific and prone to reconstruction attacks as there\nare chances for unauthorized access to security-critical transformation keys. A\nnovel, modality-independent cancelable biometric scheme is proposed to overcome\nthese limitations. In this scheme, a cancelable template (pseudo identifier) is\ngenerated as a distance vector between multiple random transformations of the\nbiometric feature vector. These transformations were done by grouping feature\nvector components based on a set of user-specific random vectors. The proposed\nscheme nullifies the possibility of template reconstruction as the generated\ncancelable template contains only the distance values between the different\nrandom transformations of the feature vector and it does not store any details\nof the biometric template. The recognition performance of the proposed scheme\nis evaluated for face and fingerprint modalities. Equal Error Rate (EER) of 1.5\nis obtained for face and 1.7 is obtained for the fingerprint in the worst case.",

In addition to the large nonlinearities expected in\nthe superconducting state, we find an extended regime of large normal state THz\nnonlinearity.

These\nprocesses suppress the quasiparticle excitation threshold down to\n$2\\varepsilon_g < 2\\Delta$, potentially placing the longitudinal mode within\nthe continuum spectrum. Despite this, we show that the algebraically decaying\noscillations persist, taking the form $\\sim \\sin(2\\varepsilon_g t)/t^2$. The\nSchmid-Higgs mode becomes truly overdamped and exponentially decaying only in\nthe gapless superconductors with $\\varepsilon_g=0$.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a surge of experimental and theoretical interest\nin controlling the properties of matter, such as its chemical reactivity, by\nconfining it in optical cavities, where the enhancement of the light-matter\ncoupling strength leads to the creation of hybrid light-matter states known as\npolaritons. However, ab initio calculations that account for the quantum nature\nof both the electromagnetic field and matter are challenging and have only\nstarted to be developed in recent years. We introduce a deep learning\nvariational quantum Monte Carlo method to solve the electronic and photonic\nSchr\\\"odinger equation of molecules trapped in optical cavities. We extend\ntypical electronic neural network wavefunction ansatzes to describe joint\nfermionic and bosonic systems, i.e. electron-photon systems, in a quantum Monte\nCarlo framework. We apply our method to hydrogen molecules in a cavity,\ncomputing both ground and excited states. We assess their energy, dipole\nmoment, charge density shift due to the cavity, the state of the photonic\nfield, and the entanglement developed between the electrons and photons. When\npossible, we compare our results with more conventional quantum chemistry\nmethods proposed in the literature, finding good qualitative agreement, thus\nextending the range of scientific problems that can be tackled using machine\nlearning techniques.",

We rigorously derive effective classical kinematics under\nsuch measurements, demonstrating that when the volume of the coarse-grained\nslot in phase space significantly exceeds Planck's constant, quantum states can\nbe effectively described by classical probability distributions. Furthermore,\nwe show that the dynamics, derived under coarse-grained observations and the\nlinear approximation of the quantum Hamiltonian around its classical values\nwithin the slots, is effectively described by a classical Hamiltonian following\nLiouville dynamics. The classical Hamiltonian obtained through this process is\nequivalent to the one from which the underlying quantum Hamiltonian is derived\nvia the (Dirac) quantization procedure, completing the quantization-classical\nlimit loop. The Ehrenfest time, marking the duration within which classical\nbehavior remains valid, is analyzed for various physical systems. The\nimplications of these findings are discussed in the context of both macroscopic\nand microscopic systems, revealing the mechanisms behind their observed\nclassicality. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding\nthe quantum-to-classical transition and addresses foundational questions about\nthe consistency of the quantization-classical limit cycle.",

By\nfitting a finite element model to angle-dependent core level measurements,\nsimilar amounts of Sb and Ni were found within the first few atomic layers to\nindicate a near-surface composition similar to the bulk alloy NiSb.

We give sufficient conditions for such states to be exact\nzero energy eigenstates of a local Hamiltonian. The conditions are naturally\nsatisfied in many models which have a global U(1) symmetry. These models\ninclude well known integrable models such as the XX model, the Bariev model,\nthe folded XXZ model, and also a variety of non-integrable models.

In such cases, the deployment of heavy models becomes\nimpractical due to constraints on memory, computational resources, and latency.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel, training-free plug-and-play\nframework that leverages the strengths of pre-trained text recognizers while\nminimizing redundant computations. Our approach uses context-based\nunderstanding and introduces an attention-based segmentation stage, which\nrefines candidate text regions at the pixel level, improving downstream\nrecognition. Instead of performing traditional text detection that follows a\nblock-level comparison between feature map and source image and harnesses\ncontextual information using pretrained captioners, allowing the framework to\ngenerate word predictions directly from scene context.Candidate texts are\nsemantically and lexically evaluated to get a final score. Predictions that\nmeet or exceed a pre-defined confidence threshold bypass the heavier process of\nend-to-end text STR profiling, ensuring faster inference and cutting down on\nunnecessary computations.

We implement\nthree unique language encoders with logistic regression, and provide a\ndeployability analysis on 385 real student explanations from the 2023\nIntroduction to Physics course at Tufts University.

Detecting state elevations in social anxiety\nwould be especially useful given this phenomenon is highly prevalent and\nimpairing, but often not disclosed. Although anxiety is highly dynamic,\nfluctuating rapidly over the course of minutes, most work to date has examined\nanxiety at a scale of hours, days, or longer. In the present work, we explore\nthe feasibility of detecting fluctuations in state social anxiety among N = 46\nundergraduate students with elevated symptoms of trait social anxiety.\nParticipants engaged in two dyadic and two group social interactions via Zoom.\nWe evaluated participants' state anxiety levels as they anticipated,\nimmediately after experiencing, and upon reflecting on each social interaction,\nspanning a time frame of 2-6 minutes. We collected biobehavioral features\n(i.e., PPG, EDA, skin temperature, and accelerometer) via Empatica E4 devices\nas they participated in the varied social contexts (e.g., dyadic vs. group;\nanticipating vs. experiencing the interaction; experiencing varying levels of\nsocial evaluation). We additionally measured their trait mental health\nfunctioning. Mixed-effect logistic regression and leave-one-subject-out machine\nlearning modeling indicated biobehavioral features significantly predict state\nfluctuations in anxiety, though balanced accuracy tended to be modest (59%).\nHowever, our capacity to identify instances of heightened versus low state\nanxiety significantly increased (with balanced accuracy ranging from 69% to 84%\nacross different operationalizations of state anxiety) when we integrated\ncontextual data alongside trait mental health functioning into our predictive\nmodels..

The discrete residues introduced by Chen and Singer in\n2012 enjoy the obstruction-theoretic property that a rational function is\nsummable if and only if all its discrete residues vanish. However, these\ndiscrete residues are defined in terms of the data in the complete partial\nfraction decomposition of the given rational function, which cannot be accessed\ncomputationally in general. We explain how to efficiently compute (a rational\nrepresentation of) the discrete residues of any rational function, relying only\non gcd computations, linear algebra, and a black box algorithm to compute the\nautodispersion set of the denominator polynomial.

    "abstract": "The European Space Agency's Euclid mission will observe approximately 14,000\n$\\rm{deg}^{2}$ of the extragalactic sky and deliver high-quality imaging for\nmany galaxies. The depth and high spatial resolution of the data will enable a\ndetailed analysis of stellar population properties of local galaxies. In this\nstudy, we test our pipeline for spatially resolved SED fitting using synthetic\nimages of Euclid, LSST, and GALEX generated from the TNG50 simulation. We apply\nour pipeline to 25 local simulated galaxies to recover their resolved stellar\npopulation properties. We produce 3 types of data cubes: GALEX + LSST + Euclid,\nLSST + Euclid, and Euclid-only. We perform the SED fitting tests with two SPS\nmodels in a Bayesian framework. Because the age, metallicity, and dust\nattenuation estimates are biased when applying only classical formulations of\nflat priors, we examine the effects of additional priors in the forms of\nmass-age-$Z$ relations, constructed using a combination of empirical and\nsimulated data. Stellar-mass surface densities can be recovered well using any\nof the 3 data cubes, regardless of the SPS model and prior variations. The new\npriors then significantly improve the measurements of mass-weighted age and $Z$\ncompared to results obtained without priors, but they may play an excessive\nrole compared to the data in determining the outcome when no UV data is\navailable. The spatially resolved SED fitting method is powerful for mapping\nthe stellar populations of galaxies with the current abundance of high-quality\nimaging data. Our study re-emphasizes the gain added by including\nmultiwavelength data from ancillary surveys and the roles of priors in Bayesian\nSED fitting. With the Euclid data alone, we will be able to generate complete\nand deep stellar mass maps of galaxies in the local Universe, thus exploiting\nthe telescope's wide field, NIR sensitivity, and high spatial resolution.",

An additional dynamic gating mechanism enables the model to\nmore easily switch between the visual inputs and unrelated conversation topics.\nTo reduce training costs, we design a simple one-stage, parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning pipeline in which we leverage a mixture of image-text (i.e.,\n\"speechless\") and image-speech samples. We evaluate the model on downstream\nvisual understanding tasks with both audio and text prompts, and report\nqualitative samples of interactions with MoshiVis.

In an early attempt to\nshed light on the fundamental mechanisms of failure, Gent and Park presented a\nsystematic experimental study examining the field that develops near rigid\nbeads that are embedded in the material and describe two distinct failure\nphenomena: cavitation that occurs near the bead in the bulk of the material,\nand debonding at the bead-rubber interface [Gent, A.N. and Park, B., 1984.\nJournal of Materials Science, 19, pp.1947-1956]. Although the interpretation of\ntheir results has not been challenged, several questions stemming from their\nwork remain unresolved -- specifically, the reported dependence of the\ncavitation stress on the diameter of the bead and the counterintuitive\nrelationship between the delamination threshold and the material stiffness. In\nthis work, we revisit the work of Gent and Park and consider an alternative\nexplanation of their observations, interfacial cavitation. A numerically\nvalidated semi-analytical model shows that in presence of surface tension,\ndefects at the bead-rubber interface may be prone to cavitate at lower\npressures compared to bulk cavitation, and that surface tension can explain the\nreported length-scale effects. A phase-map portrays the distinct regions of\n`cavitation dominated' and `delamination dominated' failure and confirms that\nfor the expected range of material properties of the rubbers used by Gent and\nPark, interfacial cavitation is a likely explanation. Crucially, this result\noffers a new avenue to tune and optimize the performance of reinforced polymers\nand other multi-material systems.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) systems become central to critical decision-making,\nconcerns over fairness and potential biases have increased. To address this,\nthe software engineering (SE) field has introduced bias mitigation techniques\naimed at enhancing fairness in ML models at various stages. Additionally,\nrecent research suggests that standard ML engineering practices can also\nimprove fairness; these practices, known as fairness-aware practices, have been\ncataloged across each stage of the ML development life cycle. However, fairness\nremains context-dependent, with different domains requiring customized\nsolutions. Furthermore, existing specific bias mitigation methods may sometimes\ndegrade model performance, raising ongoing discussions about the trade-offs\ninvolved.\n  In this paper, we empirically investigate fairness-aware practices from two\nperspectives: contextual and cost-effectiveness. The contextual evaluation\nexplores how these practices perform in various application domains,\nidentifying areas where specific fairness adjustments are particularly\neffective. The cost-effectiveness evaluation considers the trade-off between\nfairness improvements and potential performance costs. Our findings provide\ninsights into how context influences the effectiveness of fairness-aware\npractices. This research aims to guide SE practitioners in selecting practices\nthat achieve fairness with minimal performance costs, supporting the\ndevelopment of ethical ML systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has highlighted\nthe critical roles of both the visual backbone and the underlying language\nmodel. While prior work has primarily focused on scaling these components to\nbillions of parameters, the trade-offs between model size, architecture, and\nperformance remain underexplored. Additionally, inconsistencies in training\ndata and evaluation protocols have hindered direct comparisons, making it\ndifficult to derive optimal design choices. In this paper, we introduce\nLLaVA-MORE, a new family of MLLMs that integrates recent language models with\ndiverse visual backbones. To ensure fair comparisons, we employ a unified\ntraining protocol applied consistently across all architectures. Our analysis\nsystematically explores both small- and medium-scale LLMs -- including Phi-4,\nLLaMA-3.1, and Gemma-2 -- to evaluate multimodal reasoning, generation, and\ninstruction following, while examining the relationship between model size and\nperformance. Beyond evaluating the LLM impact on final results, we conduct a\ncomprehensive study of various visual encoders, ranging from CLIP-based\narchitectures to alternatives such as DINOv2, SigLIP, and SigLIP2. Additional\nexperiments investigate the effects of increased image resolution and\nvariations in pre-training datasets. Overall, our results provide insights into\nthe design of more effective MLLMs, offering a reproducible evaluation\nframework that facilitates direct comparisons and can guide future model\ndevelopment.

    "abstract": "The large language model (LLM)-as-judge paradigm has been used to meet the\ndemand for a cheap, reliable, and fast evaluation of model outputs during AI\nsystem development and post-deployment monitoring. While judge models -- LLMs\nfinetuned to specialize in assessing and critiquing model outputs -- have been\ntouted as general purpose evaluators, they are typically evaluated only on\nnon-contextual scenarios, such as instruction following. The omission of\ncontextual settings -- those where external information is used as context to\ngenerate an output -- is surprising given the increasing prevalence of\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and summarization use cases. Contextual\nassessment is uniquely challenging, as evaluation often depends on practitioner\npriorities, leading to conditional evaluation criteria (e.g., comparing\nresponses based on factuality and then considering completeness if they are\nequally factual). To address the gap, we propose ContextualJudgeBench, a judge\nbenchmark with 2,000 challenging response pairs across eight splits inspired by\nreal-world contextual evaluation scenarios. We build our benchmark with a\nmulti-pronged data construction pipeline that leverages both existing human\nannotations and model-based perturbations. Our comprehensive study across 11\njudge models and 9 general purpose models, reveals that the contextual\ninformation and its assessment criteria present a significant challenge to even\nstate-of-the-art models. For example, OpenAI's o1, the best-performing model,\nbarely reaches 55% consistent accuracy.",

However, our analysis reveals that autoencoder accuracy on\nsegmentation mask using quantized embeddings (e.g. VQ-VAE) is 8% lower than\ncontinuous-valued embeddings (e.g. KL-VAE). Motivated by this, we propose a\ncontinuous-valued embedding framework for semantic segmentation. By\nreformulating semantic mask generation as a continuous image-to-embedding\ndiffusion process, our approach eliminates the need for discrete latent\nrepresentations while preserving fine-grained spatial and semantic details. Our\nkey contribution includes a diffusion-guided autoregressive transformer that\nlearns a continuous semantic embedding space by modeling long-range\ndependencies in image features. Our framework contains a unified architecture\ncombining a VAE encoder for continuous feature extraction, a diffusion-guided\ntransformer for conditioned embedding generation, and a VAE decoder for\nsemantic mask reconstruction. Our setting facilitates zero-shot domain\nadaptation capabilities enabled by the continuity of the embedding space.\nExperiments across diverse datasets (e.g., Cityscapes and domain-shifted\nvariants) demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness to distribution shifts,\nincluding adverse weather (e.g., fog, snow) and viewpoint variations. Our model\nalso exhibits strong noise resilience, achieving robust performance ($\\approx$\n95% AP compared to baseline) under gaussian noise, moderate motion blur, and\nmoderate brightness/contrast variations, while experiencing only a moderate\nimpact ($\\approx$ 90% AP compared to baseline) from 50% salt and pepper noise,\nsaturation and hue shifts.

At low redshift, it is generally\nthought that the starburst initiating the post-starburst phase is\nmerger-driven, however, not all post-starburst galaxies show evidence of a\nmerger, and recent studies suggested that post-starburst galaxies may be\nproduced by multiple distinct mechanisms. This study examines whether multiple\ntypes of post-starburst galaxies actually exist, that is, whether the\nproperties of post-starburst galaxies are multimodal. We used uniform manifold\napproximation and projection (UMAP) to cluster post-starburst galaxies based on\nspectroscopic data. The results suggest that there are three types of\npost-starburst galaxies that have dissimilar stacked spectral energy\ndistributions and are separated by a combination of their H$\\alpha$ and\n[OII]$\\lambda$3727 line strengths with an accuracy of 91%. A comparison of\nvarious galaxy properties (e.g., emission line strengths, mass and age\ndistributions, and morphologies) indicates that the grouping is not just an age\nsequence, but may be correlated to the merger-histories of the galaxies. It\nsuggested that the three post-starburst galaxy types have different origins,\nsome of which may not be merger-driven, and that all typical galaxies go\nthrough the post-starburst phase at turnoff.",

However, a\nlargely underutilized probe of PBH abundance is the temperature of the\nintergalactic medium (IGM), inferred from the thermal broadening of absorption\nlines in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra. PBHs inject energy into\nthe IGM via Hawking radiation, altering its thermal evolution. In this work, we\nconstrain this energy injection by self-consistently modeling its interplay\nwith the cosmological ultraviolet background from galaxies and supermassive\nblack holes. Leveraging IGM temperature measurements spanning the past twelve\nbillion years ($z \\sim 0$ to $6$), we derive one of the most stringent\nconstraints on PBH-induced heating from light PBHs within the mass range\n$10^{15}\\unicode{x2013}10^{17}$ g.

We run a large suite of $N$-body\nsimulations to model the infall of a Sgr-like dwarf, exploring how the presence\nof dark matter self interactions impacts its evolution. For a scattering cross\nsection of $\\sigma/m_\\chi = 30 \\text{ cm}^2\\text{/g}$ (at orbital velocity\nscales), these interactions result in significantly less stellar mass and\nlittle to no dark matter bound to the progenitor at the present day. To isolate\nthe cause of this mass loss, we introduce a novel technique for controlling\nwhich pairs of dark matter simulation particles can interact. This enables us\nto identify ram-pressure evaporation - the scattering of satellite and host\ndark matter particles - as the primary source of the enhanced mass loss. The\nrapid disintegration of the Sgr progenitor when self interactions are allowed\nalters some key properties of the resulting stellar stream, most dramatically\nsuppressing the presence of a \"spur\" on the apocenter of the trailing stream\narm that correlates with the mass of the satellite at last pericenter. We\ndemonstrate how the effects on the Sgr system scale with the particular choice\nof self-interaction cross section, which affects the degree of ram-pressure\nevaporation. These findings generalize beyond the Sgr system, underscoring that\ndwarf stellar streams and dwarf galaxies with close passages may serve as\nsensitive probes for dark matter self interactions.",

One approach to overcoming this trade-off is\ncomputational imaging: the co-development of optics designed to encode the\ntarget images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, with\nalgorithms that compensate by inverting the optical coding to recover a larger\nor higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for\nraster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition\n(NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopy video by subsampling\nonly a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each\nframe. NORA mitigates the loss of information by 1) extending the point-spread\nfunction in the slow-scan direction to effectively integrate the fluorescence\nof several lines into a single set of measurements and 2) imaging different,\nrandomly selected, lines at each frame. Rather than reconstruct the video\nframe-by-frame, NORA recovers full video sequences via nuclear-norm\nminimization on the pixels-by-time matrix, for which we prove theoretical\nguarantees on recovery. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and\nOptical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulator, and used the simulations to\ndemonstrate that NORA can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at\nsubsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions. As\nNORA requires minimal changes to current microscopy systems, our results\nindicate that NORA can provide a promising avenue towards fast imaging of\nneural circuits.",

Our approach, scaling to over 1B parameters, outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple benchmarks,\nestablishing a new SOTA zero-shot performance on ImageNet-1K, delivering up to\na $2\\times$ enhancement over SigLIP on RxRx1 in linear probing for few-shot\nclassification, and improving vision-language models, achieving over $3\\times$\nhigher scores than SigLIP on MMVP.

    "abstract": "Modelling human variation in rating tasks is crucial for enabling AI systems\nfor personalization, pluralistic model alignment, and computational social\nscience. We propose representing individuals using value profiles -- natural\nlanguage descriptions of underlying values compressed from in-context\ndemonstrations -- along with a steerable decoder model to estimate ratings\nconditioned on a value profile or other rater information. To measure the\npredictive information in rater representations, we introduce an\ninformation-theoretic methodology. We find that demonstrations contain the most\ninformation, followed by value profiles and then demographics. However, value\nprofiles offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and\nsteerability due to their compressed natural language format. Value profiles\neffectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (>70%\ninformation preservation). Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify\nsimilarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most\npredictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show\nthat the decoder models interpretably change ratings according to semantic\nprofile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level\ndisagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate\nthat value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual\nvariation beyond demographics or group information.",

    "abstract": "Finding good quantum codes for a particular hardware application and\ndetermining their error thresholds is central to quantum error correction. The\nthreshold defines the noise level where a quantum code switches between a\ncoding and a no-coding \\emph{phase}. Provided sufficiently frequent error\ncorrection, the quantum capacity theorem guarantees the existence of an optimal\ncode that provides a maximum communication rate. By viewing a system\nexperiencing repeated error correction as a novel form of matter, this optimal\ncode, in analogy to Jaynes's maximum entropy principle of quantum statistical\nmechanics, \\emph{defines a phase}. We explore coding phases from this\nperspective using the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), which is a quantum\ncircuit with depolarizing and dephasing channels. Using numerical optimization,\nwe find this model hosts three phases: a maximally mixed phase, a ``$Z_2$\ncode'' that breaks its U(1) gauge symmetry down to $Z_2$, and a no-coding phase\nwith first-order transitions between them and a novel \\emph{zero capacity\nmulti-critical point} where all three phases meet. For the $Z_2$ code, we\nprovide two practical error correction procedures that fall short of the\noptimal codes and qualitatively alter the phase diagram, splitting the\nmulti-critical point into two second-order coding no-coding phase transitions.\nCarrying out our approach on current noisy devices could provide a systematic\nway to construct quantum codes for robust computation and communication.",

The simplest quantized neural network\ncorresponds to applying single-qubit rotations, with the rotation angles being\ndependent on the weights and measurement outcomes of the previous layer. This\nrealization has the advantage of being smoothly tunable from the purely\nclassical limit with no quantum uncertainty (thereby reproducing the classical\nneural network exactly) to a quantum case, where superpositions introduce an\nintrinsic uncertainty in the network. We benchmark this architecture on a\nsubset of the standard MNIST dataset and find a regime of \"quantum advantage,\"\nwhere the validation error rate in the quantum realization is smaller than that\nin the classical model. We also consider another approach where quantumness is\nintroduced via weak measurements of ancilla qubits entangled with the neuron\nqubits. This quantum neural network also allows for smooth tuning of the degree\nof quantumness by controlling an entanglement angle, $g$, with $g=\\frac\\pi 2$\nreplicating the classical regime. We find that validation error is also\nminimized within the quantum regime in this approach. We also observe a quantum\ntransition, with sharp loss of the quantum network's ability to learn at a\ncritical point $g_c$. The proposed quantum neural networks are readily\nrealizable in present-day quantum computers on commercial datasets.",

Geologic processes such as serpentinization and bombardment by\nchondritic material during the late veneer might have been very active, shaping\nan atmospheric composition reducing enough to allow efficient photochemical\nsynthesis of HCN, one of the key precursors of prebiotic molecules. HCN can\nrain out and accumulate in warm little ponds (WLPs), forming prebiotic\nmolecules such as nucleobases and the sugar ribose. These molecules could\ncondense to nucleotides, the building blocks of RNA molecules, one of the\ningredients of life. Here, we perform a systematic study of potential sources\nof reducing gases on Hadean Earth and calculate the concentrations of prebiotic\nmolecules in WLPs based on a comprehensive geophysical and atmospheric model.\nWe find that in a reduced H$_2$-dominated atmosphere, carbonaceous bombardment\ncan produce enough HCN to reach maximum WLP concentrations of $\\sim\n1-10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ for nucleobases and, in the absence of seepage, $\\sim\n10-100\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$ for ribose. If the Hadean atmosphere was initially\noxidized and CO$_2$-rich ($90\\,\\%$), we find serpentinization alone can reduce\nthe atmosphere, resulting in WLP concentrations of an order of magnitude lower\nthan the reducing carbonaceous bombardment case. In both cases, concentrations\nare sufficient for nucleotide synthesis, as shown in experimental studies.

To study this, we first introduce a new benchmark,\nColBench, where an LLM agent interacts with a human collaborator over multiple\nturns to solve realistic tasks in backend programming and frontend design.\nBuilding on this benchmark, we propose a novel RL algorithm, SWEET-RL (RL with\nStep-WisE Evaluation from Training-time information), that uses a carefully\ndesigned optimization objective to train a critic model with access to\nadditional training-time information. The critic provides step-level rewards\nfor improving the policy model.

While this quality is primarily\nevaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures\nwhat makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from\nan optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a\nreward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective\nsuffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward\nmodel can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate\nmodels that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward\nmodel that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance,\nand thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a\nfundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or\nindependently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up\nto 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between\nreward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings\nhighlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient\nvariance for efficient optimization.",

An\nenhanced rotational diffusion at the walls is used as a control parameter for\nwetting transitions. Increasing the wall rotational diffusion destabilizes\ncomplete wetting, and the aggregate shows morphological transitions. We observe\na sequence of morphological transitions with an increase in wall rotational\ndiffusion: symmetric complete wetting (SCW), asymmetric complete wetting (ACW),\npartial wetting (PW) with droplet formation, and drying. In the PW state, we\ncompute the contact angle as a function of activity and rotational noise.

We\npropose a procedural data generation pipeline that efficiently samples training\ndata with diverse topologies on the fly. We use it, along with a novel skeleton\nrepresentation, to train our model on articulated shapes spanning a large space\nof textures and topologies. Then during fine-tuning, our model rapidly adapts\nto unseen target characters and generalizes well to rendering new poses, both\nfor realistic and more stylized cartoon appearances. To better evaluate\nperformance on this novel and challenging task, we create the first 2D video\ndataset that contains both humanoid and non-humanoid subjects with per-frame\nkeypoint annotations. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior\nquality of our results. Project page: https://traindragondiffusion.github.io/",

WASP-178b is one such ultra-hot Jupiter that was recently found to\nexhibit enormous NUV absorption between 0.2 and 0.4 $\\mu$m from some\ncombination of Fe+, Mg, and SiO. Here, we present new infrared observations of\nWASP-178b with HST/WFC3 and JWST/NIRSpec/G395H, providing novel measurements of\nthe volatile species H$_2$O and CO in WASP-178b's atmosphere. Atmospheric\nretrievals find a range of compositional interpretations depending on which\ndataset is retrieved, the type of chemistry assumed, and the temperature\nstructure parametrization used due to the combined effects of thermal\ndissociation, the lack of volatile spectral features besides H$_2$O and CO, and\nthe relative weakness of H$_2$O and CO themselves. Taken together with a new\nstate-of-the-art characterization of the host star, our retrieval analyses\nsuggests a solar to super-solar [O/H] and [Si/H], but sub-solar [C/H], perhaps\nsuggesting rock-laden atmospheric enrichment near the H$_2$O iceline.

    "abstract": "Until the second half of the 19th century, two or more brief appearances of\nbright comets, such as the ones in 1668 and 1702, alike in aspect and motion,\nseen with a tail near the Sun, were almost universally believed to be periodic\nreturns of a single object. It is likely that the exceptional story of Halley's\ncomet was the compelling precedent for this school of thought. Application to\nsungrazers was discredited by the observed fragmentation of the nucleus of the\ngiant sungrazer of 1882 shortly after perihelion. Generally, separations and\norbital periods of the Kreutz comets are known to be governed in such events by\nthe solar tidal force, while the range in the longitude of the nodal line is\nlinked to the pyramidal architecture caused by nontidal, cascading\nfragmentation along the entire orbit and described by an updated contact-binary\nmodel. Perception of the sungrazer system was changed dramatically by\ncoronagraphic imaging from space, which led to discovery of up to ten\npopulations of dwarf comets. Past fragmentation patterns have been used to\ntentatively predict the arrivals of two bright Kreutz sungrazers -- a\nPopulation II member around 2027 (and before 2040) and a Population I member\naround 2050.",

    "abstract": "Storm-relative helicity (SRH) is an important ingredient in supercell\ndevelopment, as well as mesocyclone intensity, and is linked to tornadogenesis\nand tornado potential. Derived from the storm-relative wind profile, SRH is\ncomposed of both the vertical wind shear and storm-relative flow. Recent\nstudies have come to conflicting findings regarding whether shallower or deeper\nlayers of SRH have more skill in tornado forecasting. Possible causes of this\ndiscrepancy include the use of observed versus model-based proximity soundings,\nas well as whether the storm-relative wind profile is determined via observed\nversus estimated storm motions. This study uses a new dataset of objectively\nidentified supercells, with observed storm motions, paired with high-resolution\nmodel analyses to address the discrepancies among prior studies. Unlike in\nprevious model-based tornado environmental datasets, the present approach\nreveals substantive differences in storm-relative flow, vertical wind shear,\nand SRH within the low-to-mid-levels between nontornadic and tornadic\nsupercells. Using observed storm motions for storm-relative variables further\nmagnifies differences in the low-to-mid-level storm-relative winds between\nnontornadic and tornadic supercells, ultimately leading to deeper layers of SRH\nhaving more forecast skill than near-ground SRH. Thus, the combination of a\nhigher-resolution model analysis, which better represents the near-storm\nenvironment, with observed storm motions appears to explain why many past\ntornado climatologies using model-based environmental analyses have failed to\nfind significant differences in the storm-relative wind profile. These results\nhelp bridge the gap between previous studies that employed coarser model-based\nanalyses and those that aggregated observed soundings from field projects.",

However, the large computational cost and model footprint of DMs\nhinders practical deployment, especially on edge devices. Post-training\nquantization (PTQ) is a lightweight method to alleviate these burdens without\nthe need for training or fine-tuning. While recent DM PTQ methods achieve W4A8\non integer-based PTQ, two key limitations remain: First, while most existing DM\nPTQ methods evaluate on classical DMs like Stable Diffusion XL, 1.5 or earlier,\nwhich use convolutional U-Nets, newer Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models like\nthe PixArt series, Hunyuan and others adopt fundamentally different transformer\nbackbones to achieve superior image synthesis. Second, integer (INT)\nquantization is prevailing in DM PTQ but doesn't align well with the network\nweight and activation distribution, while Floating-Point Quantization (FPQ) is\nstill under-investigated, yet it holds the potential to better align the weight\nand activation distributions in low-bit settings for DiT. In response, we\nintroduce FP4DiT, a PTQ method that leverages FPQ to achieve W4A6 quantization.\nSpecifically, we extend and generalize the Adaptive Rounding PTQ technique to\nadequately calibrate weight quantization for FPQ and demonstrate that DiT\nactivations depend on input patch data, necessitating robust online activation\nquantization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that FP4DiT\noutperforms integer-based PTQ at W4A6 and W4A8 precision and generates\nconvincing visual content on PixArt-$\\alpha$, PixArt-$\\Sigma$ and Hunyuan in\nterms of several T2I metrics such as HPSv2 and CLIP.",

The mask size, and\nconsequently the lateral dimensions of the pillars, is precisely controlled\nthrough a chemical mechanical polishing step, obviating the need for any\nadditional lithography step for creating the pillar. This fabrication technique\noffers several key advantages, including precise control over the pillar sites,\nand fully deterministic embedding of QD structures.

While there\nare several research works on energy optimization, they often fail to address\nthe complexities of real-time fluctuations and the cyclic pattern of energy\nconsumption. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of\npredictive models by employing sinusoidal encoding on periodic features of\ntime-series data. To demonstrate the increase in performance, several\nstatistical and ensemble machine learning models were trained on an energy\ndemand dataset, using the proposed sinusoidal encoding. The performance of\nthese models was then benchmarked against identical models trained on\ntraditional encoding methods. The results demonstrated a 12.6% improvement of\nRoot Mean Squared Error (from 0.5497 to 0.4802) and a 7.8% increase in the R^2\nscore (from 0.7530 to 0.8118), indicating that the proposed encoding better\ncaptures the cyclic nature of temporal patterns than traditional methods.

The grasping performance of existing limbs/fingers is far inferior\nto that of human hands. Human hands can detect onset of slip through tactile\nfeedback originating from tactile receptors during the grasping process,\nenabling precise and automatic regulation of grip force. The frictional\ninformation is perceived by humans depending upon slip happening between finger\nand object. Enhancing this capability in extra-robotic limbs or fingers used by\nhumans is challenging. To address this challenge, this paper introduces novel\napproach to communicate frictional information to users through encoded\nvibrotactile cues. These cues are conveyed on onset of incipient slip thus\nallowing users to perceive friction and ultimately use this information to\nincrease force to avoid dropping of object. In a 2-alternative forced-choice\nprotocol, participants gripped and lifted a glass under three different\nfrictional conditions, applying a normal force of 3.5 N. After reaching this\nforce, glass was gradually released to induce slip. During this slipping phase,\nvibrations scaled according to static coefficient of friction were presented to\nusers, reflecting frictional conditions. The results suggested an accuracy of\n94.53 p/m 3.05 (mean p/mSD) in perceiving frictional information upon lifting\nobjects with varying friction. The results indicate effectiveness of using\nvibrotactile feedback for sensory feedback, allowing users of extra-robotic\nlimbs or fingers to perceive frictional information. This enables them to\nassess surface properties and adjust grip force according to frictional\nconditions, enhancing their ability to grasp, manipulate objects more\neffectively.",

    "abstract": "In order to explore whether environmental liability insurance has an\nimportant impact on industrial emission reduction, this paper selects\nprovincial (city) level panel data from 2010 to 2020 and constructs a two-way\nfixed effect model to analyze the impact of environmental liability insurance\non carbon emissions from both direct and indirect levels. The empirical\nanalysis results show that: at the direct level, the development of\nenvironmental liability insurance has the effect of reducing industrial carbon\nemissions, and its effect is heterogeneous. At the indirect level, the role of\nenvironmental liability insurance is weaker in areas with developed financial\nindustry and underdeveloped financial industry. Further heterogeneity analysis\nshows that in the industrial developed areas, the effect of environmental\nliability insurance on carbon emissions is more obvious. Based on this,\ncountermeasures and suggestions are put forward from the aspects of expanding\nthe coverage of environmental liability insurance, innovating the development\nof environmental liability insurance and improving the level of\nindustrialization.",

Finally, we establish that\none-dimensional instead of two-dimensional moir\\'e structures can serve as\nefficient surrogate systems for validating MLIPs, allowing for a practical\nmodel validation protocol against explicit DFT calculations. Applying our\nframework to HfS2/GaS bilayers reveals that accurate structural predictions\ndirectly translate into reliable electronic properties. Our model-agnostic\napproach integrates seamlessly with various intralayer and interlayer\ninteraction models, enabling computationally tractable relaxation of moir\\'e\nmaterials, from bilayer to complex multilayers, with rigorously validated\naccuracy.",

These axiomatic Id-types only satisfy\nbeta-reduction rule as a propositional equality, and appear in cubical type\ntheory, as well as axiomatic type theory (type theory without definitional\nequality). Path categories take inspiration from homotopy theory and simplify\nthe structure of type theory using a primitive notion of equivalence. Our\nbiequivalence allows us to turn path categories into actual models of type\ntheory: we turn them into weak models, where substitution is only specified up\nto isomorphism, which we can in turn strictify using the left adjoint\nsplitting. In addition, we introduce a more fine-grained notion: that of a\ndisplay path category, and prove a similar biequivalence. These display path\ncategories still model axiomatic Id-types, but not the intensional notion of\nSigma-types. We show how they can be extended with axiomatic notions of\nSigma-types and Pi-types, allowing us to model axiomatic type theory.",

In campus networks, the\nultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) service category is of major\ninterest for applications with strict latency and high-reliability\nrequirements. One way to achieve high reliability in a shared infrastructure is\nthrough resource isolation, whereby network slicing can be optimized to\nadequately reserve computation and transmission capacity. This paper proposes\nan approach for vertical slicing the radio access network (RAN) to enable the\ndeployment of multiple and isolated campus networks to accommodate URLLC\nservices. To this end, we model RAN function placement as a mixed integer\nlinear programming problem with URLLC-related constraints. We demonstrate that\nour approach can find optimal solutions in real-world scenarios. Furthermore,\nunlike existing solutions, our model considers the user traffic flow from a\nknown source node on the network's edge to an unknown \\textit{a priori}\ndestination node. This flexibility could be explored in industrial campus\nnetworks by allowing dynamic placement of user plane functions (UPFs) to serve\nthe URLLC.",

Utilizing a\nMarkov Switching Vector Auto regression (MS-VAR) model, the study examines data\nfrom 2000 to 2023, considering three economic regimes: the initial shock, the\npeak crisis, and the recovery phase. The results indicate that the COVID-19\nshock led to a sharp decline in household consumption and income in all three\ncountries, with Slovenia facing the most severe immediate impact. Hungary,\nhowever, showed the strongest recovery, driven by effective fiscal measures\nsuch as subsidies and increased government spending, which significantly\nboosted both household consumption and income. The Czech Republic demonstrated\na more gradual recovery, with improvements observed in future-oriented\nconsumption (IMPC). In conclusion, the study underscores the critical role of\ntargeted fiscal interventions in mitigating the adverse effects of crises.

This limitation arises from two\nkey factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult\nto associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their\nfeature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained\nspatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these\nissues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt\n(VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two\ncomplementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor\nonto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP\nincorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To\neffectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce\nVPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples.\nDesigned in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is\nsignificantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in\nMiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting\nmodel, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual\ngrounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to\nchallenging unseen datasets.

Four\nNSBH candidates have been identified and followed-up by more than fifty\ninstruments since the start of the fourth GW Observing Run (O4), in May 2023,\nup to July 2024; however, no confirmed associated KN has been detected. This\nstudy evaluates ejecta properties from multi-messenger observations to\nunderstand the absence of detectable KN: we use GW public information and joint\nobservations taken from 05.2023 to 07.2024 (LVK, ATLAS, DECam, GECKO, GOTO,\nGRANDMA, SAGUARO, TESS, WINTER, ZTF). First, our analysis on follow-up\nobservation strategies shows that, on average, more than 50% of the simulated\nKNe associated with NSBH mergers reach their peak luminosity around one day\nafter merger in the $g,r,i$- bands, which is not necessarily covered for each\nNSBH GW candidate. We also analyze the trade-off between observation efficiency\nand the intrinsic properties of the KN emission, to understand the impact on\nhow these constraints affect our ability to detect the KN, and underlying\nejecta properties for each GW candidate. In particular, we can only confirm the\nkilonova was not missed for 1% of the GW230529 and S230627c sky localization\nregion, given the large sky localization error of GW230529 and the large\ndistance for S230627c and, their respective KN faint luminosities. More\nconstraining, for S230518h, we infer the dynamical ejecta and post-merger disk\nwind ejecta $m_{dyn}, m_{wind}$ $<$ $0.03$ $M_\\odot$ and the viewing angle\n$\\theta>25^\\circ$. Similarly, the non-astrophysical origin of S240422ed is\nlikely further confirmed by the fact that we would have detected even a faint\nKN at the time and presumed distance of the S240422ed event candidate, within a\nminimum 45% credible region of the sky area, that can be larger depending on\nthe KN scenario.",

Additionally, we introduce ReLIFT, an\nenhanced variant of LIFT that incorporates residual connections and expressive\nfrequency encodings. With this straightforward approach, ReLIFT effectively\naddresses the convergence-capacity gap found in comparable methods, providing\nan efficient yet powerful solution to improve capacity and speed up\nconvergence. Empirical results show that LIFT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance in generative modeling and classification tasks, with notable\nreductions in computational costs. Moreover, in single-task settings, the\nstreamlined ReLIFT architecture proves effective in signal representations and\ninverse problem tasks.",

The asymmetric growth\nis the result of a positive feedback mechanism that amplifies the effect of\nthermal fluctuations in the coverage of surfactants on the growing crystalline\nfacets. Within our simple model, we are able to understand the kinetic and\nthermodynamic factors involved in both the onset of symmetry breaking and the\npersistence of anisotropic growth. We demonstrate that the mechanism is general\nby studying models with increasing complexity. We argue that this mechanism of\nsymmetry breaking underpins observations of colloidal, seed-mediated syntheses\nof single crystalline metal nanorods capped with strongly interacting\nsurfactants. The parameters within our model are related to experimental\nobservables such as the concentration, hydrophobicity, and binding strength of\nthe surfactants, which suggests a potential route to optimize the yield of\nasymmetric products in colloidal nanoparticle syntheses.",

For many new, molecularly\ntargeted therapies, however, tumor response may not be the most reliable\nendpoint for measuring anti-tumor activity. Increasingly, time-to-event\nendpoints, such as progression-free survival (PFS), are used in the phase II\nsetting. When such endpoints are the primary measure of efficacy, a randomized\nconcurrently controlled study design is usually required. Given limited\nresources for phase II, studies are often underpowered with relatively large\ntype I and II error rates, and it is sometimes unavoidable to have a \"gray\"\ndecision zone after phase II where a clear decision regarding further\ndevelopment actions cannot be made without additional information. Compared\nwith an underpowered standard two-outcome study, a three-outcome design prompts\nclinical trialists to contemplate the likelihood of landing in the \"gray\" zone\nat the trial design stage and choose study design parameters more\nappropriately.

However, the future performance of bulk storage technologies is\ncurrently highly uncertain. Due to the urgency of decarbonization targets,\nenergy park projects must be designed and begun now. But, as uncertainty in\nstorage performance reduces, a different technology than identified during\ninitial design may turn out cheaper. Enabling flexibility so that design\nadaptations can be made as better information becomes available would lower the\ncost of decarbonizing industry. But having this flexibility is itself costly.\nThis raises the question, \"Is it worth it?\"\n  This study quantifies the benefit of retaining flexibility to adapt energy\npark designs and optionality over storage technology choice as uncertainty\nreduces, to determine whether it is economically worthwhile. It applies the\nValue of Information analysis framework to the sizing of wind, solar, and\nstorage in an illustrative energy park model based on a real-world proposal\nnear Rotterdam, considering uncertainty in storage efficiency, lifetime, and\ncapital cost.\n  Updating asset sizings after storage uncertainty reduced is found to reduce\ntotal costs by 18% on average. Having the option to switch storage technology\nchoice as well reduces costs by a further 13%, which is substantially greater\nthan the cost of providing storage optionality. Using two storage technologies\nin the energy park reduces costs by 14%, and in this case storage optionality\nis not worthwhile.

Traditionally, federated\nlearning methods assume a fixed setting in which client data and learning\nobjectives remain constant. However, in real-world scenarios, new clients may\njoin, and existing clients may expand the segmentation label set as task\nrequirements evolve. In such a dynamic federated analysis setup, the\nconventional federated communication strategy of model aggregation per\ncommunication round is suboptimal. As new clients join, this strategy requires\nretraining, linearly increasing communication and computation overhead. It also\nimposes requirements for synchronized communication, which is difficult to\nachieve among distributed clients. In this paper, we propose a federated\ncontinual learning strategy that employs a one-time model aggregation at the\nserver through multi-model distillation. This approach builds and updates the\nglobal model while eliminating the need for frequent server communication. When\nintegrating new data streams or onboarding new clients, this approach\nefficiently reuses previous client models, avoiding the need to retrain the\nglobal model across the entire federation. By minimizing communication load and\nbypassing the need to put unchanged clients online, our approach relaxes\nsynchronization requirements among clients, providing an efficient and scalable\nfederated analysis framework suited for real-world applications.

In this paper, we seek to understand and address the effect\nof scale ambiguity when used to train generative novel view synthesis methods\n(GNVS). In GNVS, new views of a scene or object can be minimally synthesized\ngiven a single image and are, thus, unconstrained, necessitating the use of\ngenerative methods. The generative nature of these models captures all aspects\nof uncertainty, including any uncertainty of scene scales, which act as\nnuisance variables for the task. We study the effect of scene scale ambiguity\nin GNVS when sampled from a single image by isolating its effect on the\nresulting models and, based on these intuitions, define new metrics that\nmeasure the scale inconsistency of generated views. We then propose a framework\nto estimate scene scales jointly with the GNVS model in an end-to-end fashion.\nEmpirically, we show that our method reduces the scale inconsistency of\ngenerated views without the complexity or downsides of previous scale\nnormalization methods.

For precise\nappearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture\nadapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the\ninput image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local\nappearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings\nindependently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized\nimages. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating\nhigh-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation\nstudies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual\nPersona across various downstream tasks.",

A typical approach to improving adversarial\ntransferability is by refining the surrogate model. However, existing work on\nViTs has restricted their surrogate refinement to backward propagation. In this\nwork, we instead focus on Forward Propagation Refinement (FPR) and specifically\nrefine two key modules of ViTs: attention maps and token embeddings. For\nattention maps, we propose Attention Map Diversification (AMD), which\ndiversifies certain attention maps and also implicitly imposes beneficial\ngradient vanishing during backward propagation. For token embeddings, we\npropose Momentum Token Embedding (MTE), which accumulates historical token\nembeddings to stabilize the forward updates in both the Attention and MLP\nblocks. We conduct extensive experiments with adversarial examples transferred\nfrom ViTs to various CNNs and ViTs, demonstrating that our FPR outperforms the\ncurrent best (backward) surrogate refinement by up to 7.0\\% on average.

However, its deployment is often\nlimited by the extreme low-power constraints of the target embedded systems.\nHere, we explore the Temporal Difference Encoder (TDE) performance in keyword\nspotting. This recent neuron model encodes the time difference in instantaneous\nfrequency and spike count to perform efficient keyword spotting with\nneuromorphic processors. We use the TIdigits dataset of spoken digits with a\nformant decomposition and rate-based encoding into spikes. We compare three\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs) architectures to learn and classify\nspatio-temporal signals. The proposed SNN architectures are made of three\nlayers with variation in its hidden layer composed of either (1) feedforward\nTDE, (2) feedforward Current-Based Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CuBa-LIF), or (3)\nrecurrent CuBa-LIF neurons. We first show that the spike trains of the\nfrequency-converted spoken digits have a large amount of information in the\ntemporal domain, reinforcing the importance of better exploiting temporal\nencoding for such a task. We then train the three SNNs with the same number of\nsynaptic weights to quantify and compare their performance based on the\naccuracy and synaptic operations. The resulting accuracy of the feedforward TDE\nnetwork (89%) is higher than the feedforward CuBa-LIF network (71%) and close\nto the recurrent CuBa-LIF network (91%). However, the feedforward TDE-based\nnetwork performs 92% fewer synaptic operations than the recurrent CuBa-LIF\nnetwork with the same amount of synapses. In addition, the results of the TDE\nnetwork are highly interpretable and correlated with the frequency and\ntimescale features of the spoken keywords in the dataset. Our findings suggest\nthat the TDE is a promising neuron model for scalable event-driven processing\nof spatio-temporal patterns.",

We\npropose a meta-algorithm, denoted as $\\mathsf{RTB}$, featuring Real-Time\nBoosting, where the core idea is as follows. Consider a bipartite graph\n$G=(I,J,E)$, where $I$ and $J$ represent the sets of offline and online nodes,\nrespectively. Let $\\mathbf{x}=(x_{ij}) \\in [0,1]^{|E|}$, where $x_{ij}$ for\n$(i,j) \\in E$ represents the probability that edge $(i,j)$ is matched in an\noffline optimal policy (a.k.a. a clairvoyant optimal policy), typically\nobtained by solving a benchmark linear program (LP). Upon the arrival of an\nonline node $j$ at some time $t \\in [0,1]$, $\\mathsf{RTB}$ samples a safe\n(available) neighbor $i \\in I_{j,t}$ with probability $x_{ij}/\\sum_{i' \\in\nI_{j,t}} x_{i'j}$ and matches it to $j$, where $I_{j,t}$ denotes the set of\nsafe offline neighbors of $j$.\n  In this paper, we showcase the power of Real-Time Boosting by demonstrating\nthat $\\mathsf{RTB}$, when fed with $\\mathbf{X}^*$, achieves a competitive ratio\nof $(2e^4 - 8e^2 + 21e - 27) / (2e^4) \\approx 0.7341$, where $\\mathbf{X}^* \\in\n\\{0,1/3,2/3\\}^{|E|}$ is a random vector obtained by applying a customized\ndependent rounding technique due to Brubach et al.

Notably, this improvement does not stem from the algorithm\nitself but from a new competitive analysis methodology: We introduce an\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE) system-based approach that enables a\n{holistic} analysis of $\\mathsf{RTB}$.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based foundation models (FMs) have recently demonstrated\nremarkable performance in medical image segmentation. However, scaling these\nmodels is challenging due to the limited size of medical image datasets within\nisolated hospitals, where data centralization is restricted due to privacy\nconcerns. These constraints, combined with the data-intensive nature of FMs,\nhinder their broader application. Integrating federated learning (FL) with\nfoundation models (FLFM) fine-tuning offers a potential solution to these\nchallenges by enabling collaborative model training without data sharing, thus\nallowing FMs to take advantage of a diverse pool of sensitive medical image\ndata across hospitals/clients. However, non-independent and identically\ndistributed (non-IID) data among clients, paired with computational and\ncommunication constraints in federated environments, presents an additional\nchallenge that limits further performance improvements and remains inadequately\naddressed in existing studies. In this work, we propose a novel FLFM\nfine-tuning framework, \\underline{\\textbf{Fed}}erated tuning with\n\\underline{\\textbf{S}}imilarity-guided \\underline{\\textbf{C}}ollaborative\n\\underline{\\textbf{A}}ggregation (FedSCA), encompassing all phases of the FL\nprocess. This includes (1) specially designed parameter-efficient fine-tuning\n(PEFT) for local client training to enhance computational efficiency; (2)\npartial low-level adapter transmission for communication efficiency; and (3)\nsimilarity-guided collaborative aggregation (SGCA) on the server side to\naddress non-IID issues. Extensive experiments on three FL benchmarks for\nmedical image segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nFedSCA, establishing new SOTA performance.",

    "abstract": "In solid acid solid electrolytes CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, mechanisms of\nfast proton conduction have long been debated and attributed to either local\nproton hopping or polyanion rotation. However, the precise role of polyanion\nrotation and its interplay with proton hopping remained unclear.\nNanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, driven by equivariant neural\nnetwork force fields, reveal a nuanced proton slingshot mechanism: protons are\ninitially carried by rotating polyanions, followed by O$-$H bond reorientation,\nand the combined motion enables long-range jumps. This challenges the\nconventional revolving paddlewheel model and reveals significant independent\nproton motion that is assisted by limited rotations. Despite structural\nsimilarities, we identify qualitative differences in transport mechanisms\nbetween CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and CsHSO$_4$, caused by different proton concentrations.\nCsH$_2$PO$_4$ exhibits two distinct rates of rotational motions with different\nactivation energies, contrasting with CsHSO$_4$'s single-rate behavior. The\nhigher proton concentration in CsH$_2$PO$_4$ correlates with frustrated PO$_4$\npolyanion orientations and slower rotations compared to SO$_4$ in CsHSO$_4$.\nAdditionally, we reveal a correlation between O-sharing and proton transport in\nCsH$_2$PO$_4$, a unique feature due to extra proton per polyanion compared to\nCsHSO$_4$. Our findings suggest that reducing proton concentration could\naccelerate rotations and enhance conductivity. This work provides a unified\nframework for understanding and optimizing ionic mobility in solid-acid\ncompounds, offering new insights into the interplay between proton hopping and\ndisordered dynamics in polyanion rotation.",

    "abstract": "Photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) has emerged as a promising imaging\ntechnique, enabling spectral imaging and material decomposition (MD). However,\nimages typically suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio due to constraints\nsuch as low photon counts and sparse-view settings which provoke artifacts. To\nprevent this, variational methods minimize a data-fit function coupled with\nhandcrafted regularizers which mimics a prior by enforcing image properties\nsuch as the sparsity of the gradient. In the last few years, diffusion models\n(DMs) became predominant in the field of generative models and have been used\nas a learned prior for image reconstruction. This work investigates the use of\nDMs as regularizers for MD tasks in PCCT, specifically using diffusion\nposterior sampling (DPS) guidance. Three DPS-based approaches, i.e.,\nimage-domain two-step DPS (im-TDPS), projection-domain two-step DPS\n(proj-TDPS), and one-step DPS (ODPS), are evaluated. The first two methods\nperform MD in two steps by performing reconstruction and MD separately. The\nlast method, ODPS, samples the material images directly from the measurement\ndata. The results indicate that ODPS achieves superior performance compared to\nim-TDPS and proj-TDPS, providing sharper, noise-free and crosstalk-free images.\nFurthermore, we introduce a novel hybrid ODPS method for scenarios involving\nmaterials absent from the training dataset. This methods combine DM priors with\nstandard variational handcrafted regularizers for the materials unknown to the\nDM. This hybrid method demonstrates improved MD quality compared to a standard\nvariational method and does not require additional training of the DM neural\nnetwork (NN).",

The total polarizability of\nthe system is assumed to arise from contributions of both the monomer unit and\nintermolecular interactions. The generalized bond-polarizability model (GBPM),\ninspired by the classic bond-polarizability model, effectively describes the\nelectronic polarizability of a monomer. To account for the electronic\npolarizability arising from intermolecular interactions, we use a basis set of\nrapidly decaying functions of interatomic distances. We apply this model to\ncalculate the electronic polarizability and Raman spectra of water clusters\n((H2O)r, r = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and liquid water. The computational results are\ncompared with the results of quantum-mechanical calculations for clusters and\nto experimental data for the liquid. It is demonstrated that this simple and\nphysically motivated model, which relies on a small number of parameters,\nperforms well for clusters at both low and high temperatures, capturing strong\nanharmonic effects. Moreover, its high transferability suggests its\napplicability to other water clusters. These results suggest that a\nhierarchical approach based on the Jacob's ladder of increasingly sophisticated\nand accurate atomistic polarizability models incorporating additional effects\ncan be used for efficient modeling of Raman spectra from MD simulations of\nclusters, liquids and solids.",

The well-posedness problem is formulated as a free\nboundary problem, where initial discontinuities propagate along linearly\ndegenerate characteristics. To address vacuum degeneracy, a condition at\ndensity jump points is introduced, ensuring a uniform lower bound for density.\nThe Lagrangian coordinate transformation is applied to fix the contact\ndiscontinuity.The well-posedness of contact discontinuity solutions is\nestablished, showing that compressive initial data leads to finite-time blow-up\nof the velocity gradient, while rarefactive initial data ensures global\nexistence. For the vanishing pressure limit, uniform estimates of velocity\ngradients and density are derived via level set argument. The contact\ndiscontinuity solutions of the Aw-Rascle system are shown to converge to those\nof the pressureless Euler equations, with matched convergence rates for\ncharacteristic triangles and discontinuity lines. Furthermore, under the\nconditions of pressure, enhanced regularity in non-discontinuous regions yields\nconvergence of blow-up times.",

    "abstract": "Background: Patient recruitment in clinical trials is hindered by complex\neligibility criteria and labor-intensive chart reviews. Prior research using\ntext-only models have struggled to address this problem in a reliable and\nscalable way due to (1) limited reasoning capabilities, (2) information loss\nfrom converting visual records to text, and (3) lack of a generic EHR\nintegration to extract patient data.\n  Methods: We introduce a broadly applicable, integration-free, LLM-powered\npipeline that automates patient-trial matching using unprocessed documents\nextracted from EHRs. Our approach leverages (1) the new reasoning-LLM paradigm,\nenabling the assessment of even the most complex criteria, (2) visual\ncapabilities of latest LLMs to interpret medical records without lossy\nimage-to-text conversions, and (3) multimodal embeddings for efficient medical\nrecord search. The pipeline was validated on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection\ndataset (288 diabetic patients) and a real-world dataset composed of 485\npatients from 30 different sites matched against 36 diverse trials.\n  Results: On the n2c2 dataset, our method achieved a new state-of-the-art\ncriterion-level accuracy of 93\\%. In real-world trials, the pipeline yielded an\naccuracy of 87\\%, undermined by the difficulty to replicate human\ndecision-making when medical records lack sufficient information. Nevertheless,\nusers were able to review overall eligibility in under 9 minutes per patient on\naverage, representing an 80\\% improvement over traditional manual chart\nreviews.\n  Conclusion: This pipeline demonstrates robust performance in clinical trial\npatient matching without requiring custom integration with site systems or\ntrial-specific tailoring, thereby enabling scalable deployment across sites\nseeking to leverage AI for patient matching.",

In this\npaper, we propose an automatic pruning method for large vision-language models\nto enhance the efficiency of multimodal reasoning. Conventional methods rely on\nthe training data of the original model to select the proper pruning ratio for\ndifferent network components. However, these methods are impractical for large\nvision-language models due to the unaffordable search costs caused by web-scale\ntraining corpus. In contrast, our approach only leverages a small number of\nsamples to search for the desired pruning policy by maximizing its\ngeneralization ability on unknown training data while maintaining the model\naccuracy, which enables the achievement of an optimal trade-off between\naccuracy and efficiency for large visual language models. Specifically, we\nformulate the generalization gap of the pruning strategy using the structural\nrisk minimization principle. Based on both task performance and generalization\ncapability, we iteratively search for the optimal pruning policy within a given\nsearch space and optimize the vision projector to evolve the search space with\nhigher upper bound of performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nScienceQA, Vizwiz, MM-vet, and LLaVA-Bench datasets for the task of visual\nquestion answering.

Due to\ntriboelectrification during collisions, solid particles often acquire\nsignificant charges. However, the impacts of the resulting electrostatic\ninteraction on particle dynamics remain less understood. In this study, we\npresent four-way coupled simulations to investigate the deposition of charged\nparticles onto a grounded metal substrate through a fully developed turbulent\nboundary layer. Our numerical method tracks the dynamics of individual\nparticles under the influence of turbulence, electrostatic forces, and\ncollisions. We first report a more pronounced near-wall accumulation and an\nincreased wall-normal particle velocity due to particle charging. In addition,\ncontrary to predictions from the classic Eulerian model, the wall-normal\ntransport rate of inertial particles is significantly enhanced by electrostatic\nforces. A statistical approach is then applied to quantify the contributions\nfrom turbophoresis, biased sampling, and electrostatic forces. For charged\nparticles, a sharper gradient in wall-normal particle fluctuation velocity is\nobserved, which substantially enhances turbophoresis and serves as the primary\ndriving force of near-wall particle accumulation. Furthermore, charged\nparticles are found to sample upward-moving fluids less frequently than neutral\nparticles, thereby weakening the biased sampling effect that typically pushes\nparticles away from the wall. Finally, the wall-normal electric field is shown\nto depend on the competition between particle-wall and particle-particle\nelectrostatic interactions, which helps to identify the dominant electrostatic\nforce across a wide range of scenarios.",

Existing embeddings-based clustering methods rely on a few labeled\nexamples or unsupervised fine-tuning to optimize results for each new dataset,\nwhich makes them less generalizable to multiple datasets. Our goal is to make\nthese existing embedders more generalizable to new domain datasets without\nfurther fine-tuning. Inspired by our theoretical derivation and simulation\nresults on the effectiveness of sampling and pooling techniques, we view the\nclustering task as a small-scale selection problem. A good solution to this\nproblem is associated with better clustering performance. Accordingly, we\npropose a two-stage approach: First, for each utterance (referred to as the\nseed), we derive its embedding using an existing embedder. Then, we apply a\ndistance metric to select a pool of candidates close to the seed. Because the\nembedder is not optimized for new datasets, in the second stage, we use an LLM\nto further select utterances from these candidates that share the same intent\nas the seed. Finally, we pool these selected candidates with the seed to derive\na refined embedding for the seed. We found that our method generally\noutperforms directly using an embedder, and it achieves comparable results to\nother state-of-the-art studies, even those that use much larger models and\nrequire fine-tuning, showing its strength and efficiency. Our results indicate\nthat our method enables existing embedders to be further improved without\nadditional fine-tuning, making them more adaptable to new domain datasets.\nAdditionally, viewing the clustering task as a small-scale selection problem\ngives the potential of using LLMs to customize clustering tasks according to\nthe user's goals.",

Understanding how a magneto-rotational-instability (MRI)-active\ndisk connects to a protostar's surface remains a significant challenge. To\ninvestigate the mechanisms of mass and angular momentum transfer, we develop a\nglobal, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model of boundary layer accretion\naround a magnetized, convective low-mass protostar. Our results reveal that\nangular momentum transport mechanisms transition significantly from the outer\nMRI-active disk to the protostellar surface. Various mechanisms--MRI, spiral\nshocks, coronal accretion, jets, and disk winds--contribute to angular momentum\ntransfer, resulting in three distinct disk structures: (1) the MRI-active disk,\n(2) the transition layer, and (3) the boundary layer. The simulated protostar\nis strongly magnetized due to the accumulation of the disk fields, wrapping by\ndisk toroidal fields, and stellar dynamo activity. Magnetic concentrations\nanalogous to starspots form on the protostar and interact with the rotating\ndisk gas to generate spiral shocks. These shocks play a key role in driving\naccretion. These findings demonstrate the necessity of global MHD models for a\ncomprehensive understanding of angular momentum transport. Additionally, we\nidentify explosive events triggered by magnetic reconnection in both the\nprotostar and the disk atmosphere.

While various\naspects of their crystal and electronic structure have been studied, we\nidentify a fundamental property previously overlooked that may significantly\nimpact their efficiency. We demonstrate that halide perovskites realize a\nthree-dimensional (3D) Lieb lattice, giving rise to a gapped 3D Dirac cone of\nspin-1 fermions. This leads to a fivefold reduction in effective mass compared\nto a conventional cubic structure and suppressed carrier backscattering due to\nKlein tunneling. Our conclusions are supported by band structure calculations\nand angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy from CsPbBr$_3$ and CsSnBr$_3$.\nIn particular, we reveal the transformation of the flat band of the Lieb\nlattice and the emergence of a dark corridor effect in photoemission from the\nDirac cone, which increases as the band gap is decreased from CsPbBr$_3$ to\nCsSnBr$_3$.",

Current fake image detection methods predominantly rely on binary\nclassification models that focus on accuracy while often neglecting\ninterpretability, leaving users without clear insights into why an image is\ndeemed real or fake. To bridge this gap, we introduce TruthLens, a novel\ntraining-free framework that reimagines deepfake detection as a visual\nquestion-answering (VQA) task. TruthLens utilizes state-of-the-art large\nvision-language models (LVLMs) to observe and describe visual artifacts and\ncombines this with the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs)\nlike GPT-4 to analyze and aggregate evidence into informed decisions. By\nadopting a multimodal approach, TruthLens seamlessly integrates visual and\nsemantic reasoning to not only classify images as real or fake but also provide\ninterpretable explanations for its decisions. This transparency enhances trust\nand provides valuable insights into the artifacts that signal synthetic\ncontent. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms\nconventional methods, achieving high accuracy on challenging datasets while\nmaintaining a strong emphasis on explainability.

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been demonstrated as an effective\ntechnique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs) in the context of code generation. However, existing CoT methods\noften exhibit a tendency toward \"overthinking\", where the LLM consistently\napplies reasoning strategies without adequately considering the task's\nunderlying complexity. This results in the LLMs allocating excessive\ncomputational resources, in terms of tokens, to relatively simple tasks or\nproblems where the correct answer is already evident. Additionally, this\noverthinking may lead LLMs down incorrect reasoning paths, resulting in\nincorrect code generation. In this paper, we introduce UnCertainty-Aware\nChain-of-Thought (UnCert-CoT), an LLM-based approach designed to enhance code\ngeneration by incorporating an uncertainty-aware CoT reasoning mechanism, which\nfocuses computational resources on targeting points where LLMs are more prone\nto error. We propose two confidence-based uncertainty measures: Entropy-based\nand Probability Differential-based methods. When uncertainty is high,\nUnCert-CoT activates CoT-decoding to generate multiple reasoning paths and\nselects the final code that exhibits the highest likelihood of correctness. In\ncontrast, LLM directly generates the code when uncertainty is low. This\nuncertainty judgment mechanism allows LLMs to prioritize complex tasks and\navoid unnecessary steps in simpler cases, thereby improving overall efficiency\nand accuracy in code generation. Our experimental results demonstrate that\nUnCert-CoT significantly enhances code generation accuracy on challenging\nbenchmark MHPP(Mostly Hard Python Problems), it achieves improvements up to\n6.1% on PassRate accuracy, particularly in situations where traditional LLMs\nare prone to errors.",

The coupling between the rotational and translational motion\ninduced by stratification rotates the spheroid's centerline, creating a variety\nof rotational and translational dynamics dependent upon the particle's aspect\nratio, $\\kappa$, and the component of the stratification unit vector in the\ngravity direction, $d_g$.

The detection module\nmonitors user prompts and intermediate generation steps to identify features\nindicative of copyrighted content before they manifest in the final output.

    "abstract": "The Euclid Q1 fields were selected for calibration purposes in cosmology and\nare therefore relatively devoid of nearby galaxies. However, this is precisely\nwhat makes them interesting fields in which to search for dwarf galaxies in\nlocal density environments. We take advantage of the unprecedented depth,\nspatial resolution, and field of view of the Euclid Quick Release (Q1) to build\na census of dwarf galaxies in these regions. We have identified dwarfs in a\nrepresentative sample of 25 contiguous tiles in the Euclid Deep Field North\n(EDF-N), covering an area of 14.25 sq. deg. The dwarf candidates were\nidentified using a semi-automatic detection method, based on properties\nmeasured by the Euclid pipeline and listed in the MER catalogue. A selection\ncut in surface brightness and magnitude was used to produce an initial dwarf\ncandidate catalogue, followed by a cut in morphology and colour. This catalogue\nwas visually classified to produce a final sample of dwarf candidates,\nincluding their morphology, number of nuclei, globular cluster (GC) richness,\nand presence of a blue compact centre. We identified 2674 dwarf candidates,\ncorresponding to 188 dwarfs per sq. deg. The visual classification of the\ndwarfs reveals a slightly uneven morphological mix of 58% ellipticals and 42%\nirregulars, with very few potentially GC-rich (1.0%) and nucleated (4.0%)\ncandidates but a noticeable fraction (6.9%) of dwarfs with blue compact\ncentres. The distance distribution of 388 (15%) of the dwarfs with\nspectroscopic redshifts peaks at about 400 Mpc. Their stellar mass distribution\nconfirms that our selection effectively identifies dwarfs while minimising\ncontamination. The most prominent dwarf overdensities are dominated by dEs,\nwhile dIs are more evenly distributed. This work highlights Euclid's remarkable\nability to detect and characterise dwarf galaxies across diverse masses,\ndistances, and environments.",

    "abstract": "We report on serendipitous Euclid observations of previously known\ntransients, using the Euclid Q1 data release. By cross-matching with the\nTransient Name Server (TNS) we identify 164 transients that coincide with the\ndata release. Although the Euclid Q1 release only includes single-epoch data,\nwe are able to make Euclid photometric measurements at the location of 161 of\nthese transients. Euclid obtained deep photometric measurements or upper limits\nof these transients in the $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, and $H_E$ bands at various\nphases of the transient light-curves, including before, during, and after the\nobservations of ground-based transient surveys. Approximately 70\\% of known\ntransients reported in the six months before the Euclid observation date and\nwith discovery magnitude brighter than 24 were detected in Euclid $\\IE$ images.\nOur observations include one of the earliest near-infrared detections of a\nType~Ia supernova (SN 2024pvw) 15 days prior to its peak brightness, and the\nlate-phase (435.9 days post peak) observations of the enigmatic core-collapse\nSN 2023aew. Euclid deep photometry provides valuable information on the nature\nof these transients such as their progenitor systems and power sources, with\nlate time observations being a uniquely powerful contribution. In addition,\nEuclid is able to detect the host galaxies of some transients that were\npreviously classed as hostless. The Q1 data demonstrate the power of the Euclid\ndata even with only single-epoch observations available, as will be the case\nfor much larger areas of sky in the Euclid Wide Survey.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy morphologies and shape orientations are expected to correlate with\ntheir large-scale environment, since they grow by accreting matter from the\ncosmic web and are subject to interactions with other galaxies. Cosmic\nfilaments are extracted in projection from the Euclid Quick Data Release 1\n(covering 63.1 $\\mathrm{deg}^2$) at $0.5<z<0.9$ in tomographic slices of 170\ncomoving $h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ using photometric redshifts. Galaxy morphologies\nare accurately retrieved thanks to the excellent resolution of VIS data. The\ndistribution of massive galaxies ($M_* > 10^{10} M_\\odot$) in the projected\ncosmic web is analysed as a function of morphology measured from VIS data.\nSpecifically, the 2D alignment of galaxy shapes with large-scale filaments is\nquantified as a function of S\\'ersic indices and masses. We find the known\ntrend that more massive galaxies are closer to filament spines. At fixed\nstellar masses, morphologies correlate both with densities and distances to\nlarge-scale filaments. In addition, the large volume of this data set allows us\nto detect a signal indicating that there is a preferential alignment of the\nmajor axis of massive early-type galaxies along projected cosmic filaments.\nOverall, these results demonstrate our capabilities to carry out detailed\nstudies of galaxy environments with Euclid, which will be extended to higher\nredshift and lower stellar masses with the future Euclid Deep Survey.",

    "abstract": "The matter distribution around galaxy clusters is distributed over several\nfilaments, reflecting their positions as nodes in the large-scale cosmic web.\nThe number of filaments connected to a cluster, namely its connectivity, is\nexpected to affect the physical properties of clusters. Using the first Euclid\ngalaxy catalogue from the Euclid Quick Release 1 (Q1), we investigate the\nconnectivity of galaxy clusters and how it correlates with their physical and\ngalaxy member properties. Around 220 clusters located within the three fields\nof Q1 (covering $\\sim 63 \\ \\text{deg}^2$), are analysed in the redshift range\n$0.2 < z < 0.7$. Due to the photometric redshift uncertainty, we reconstruct\nthe cosmic web skeleton, and measure cluster connectivity, in 2-D projected\nslices with a thickness of 170 comoving $h^{-1}.\\text{Mpc}$ and centred on each\ncluster redshift, by using two different filament finder algorithms on the most\nmassive galaxies ($M_*\\ > 10^{10.3} \\ M_\\odot$). In agreement with previous\nmeasurements, we recover the mass-connectivity relation independently of the\nfilament detection algorithm, showing that the most massive clusters are, on\naverage, connected to a larger number of cosmic filaments, consistent with\nhierarchical structure formation models. Furthermore, we explore possible\ncorrelations between connectivities and two cluster properties: the fraction of\nearly-type galaxies and the S\\'ersic index of galaxy members. Our result\nsuggests that the clusters populated by early-type galaxies exhibit higher\nconnectivity compared to clusters dominated by late-type galaxies. These\npreliminary investigations highlight our ability to quantify the impact of the\ncosmic web connectivity on cluster properties with Euclid.",

    "abstract": "Euclid will detect tens of thousands of clusters and protoclusters at\n$z$>1.3. With a total coverage of 63.1deg$^2$, the Euclid Quick Data Release 1\n(Q1) is large enough to detect tens of clusters and hundreds of protoclusters\nat these early epochs. The Q1 photometric redshift catalogue enables us to\ndetect clusters out to $z$ < 1.5; however, infrared imaging from Spitzer\nextends this limit to higher redshifts by using high local projected densities\nof Spitzer-selected galaxies as signposts for cluster and protocluster\ncandidates. We use Spitzer imaging of the Euclid Deep Fields (EDFs) to derive\ndensities for a sample of Spitzer-selected galaxies at redshifts $z$ > 1.3,\nbuilding Spitzer IRAC1 and IRAC2 photometric catalogues that are 95% complete\nat a magnitude limit of IRAC2=22.2, 22.6, and 22.8 for the EDF-S, EDF-F, and\nEDF-N, respectively. We apply two complementary methods to calculate galaxy\ndensities: (1) aperture and surface density; and (2) the Nth-nearest-neighbour\nmethod. When considering a sample selected at a magnitude limit of IRAC2 <\n22.2, at which all three EDFs are 95% complete, our surface density\ndistributions are consistent among the three EDFs and with the SpUDS blank\nfield survey. We also considered a deeper sample (IRAC2 < 22.8), finding that\n2% and 3% of the surface densities in the North and Fornax fields are 3$\\sigma$\nhigher than the average field distribution and similar to densities found in\nthe CARLA cluster survey. Our surface densities are also consistent with\npredictions from the GAEA semi-analytical model. Using combined Euclid and\nground-based i-band photometry we show that our highest Spitzer-selected galaxy\noverdense regions, found at $z$~1.5, also host high densities of passive\ngalaxies. This means that we measure densities consistent with those found in\nclusters and protoclusters at $z$>1.3.",

    "abstract": "We present the first catalogue of strong lensing galaxy clusters identified\nin the Euclid Quick Release 1 observations (covering $63.1\\,\\mathrm{deg^2}$).\nThis catalogue is the result of the visual inspection of 1260 cluster fields.\nEach galaxy cluster was ranked with a probability,\n$\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{lens}}$, based on the number and plausibility of the\nidentified strong lensing features. Specifically, we identified 83\ngravitational lenses with $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{lens}}>0.5$, of which 14 have\n$\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{lens}}=1$, and clearly exhibiting secure strong lensing\nfeatures, such as giant tangential and radial arcs, and multiple images.\nConsidering the measured number density of lensing galaxy clusters,\napproximately $0.3\\,\\mathrm{deg}^{-2}$ for $\\mathcal{P}_{\\mathrm{lens}}>0.9$,\nwe predict that \\Euclid\\ will likely see more than 4500 strong lensing clusters\nover the course of the mission. Notably, only three of the identified\ncluster-scale lenses had been previously observed from space. Thus, \\Euclid has\nprovided the first high-resolution imaging for the remaining $80$ galaxy\ncluster lenses, including those with the highest probability. The identified\nstrong lensing features will be used for training deep-learning models for\nidentifying gravitational arcs and multiple images automatically in \\Euclid\nobservations. This study confirms the huge potential of \\Euclid for finding new\nstrong lensing clusters, enabling exciting new discoveries on the nature of\ndark matter and dark energy and the study of the high-redshift Universe.",

    "abstract": "The Euclid mission aims to survey around 14000 deg^{2} of extragalactic sky,\nproviding around 10^{5} gravitational lens images. Modelling of gravitational\nlenses is fundamental to estimate the total mass of the lens galaxy, along with\nits dark matter content. Traditional modelling of gravitational lenses is\ncomputationally intensive and requires manual input. In this paper, we use a\nBayesian neural network, LEns MOdelling with Neural networks (LEMON), for\nmodelling Euclid gravitational lenses with a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass\nprofile. Our method estimates key lens mass profile parameters, such as the\nEinstein radius, while also predicting the light parameters of foreground\ngalaxies and their uncertainties. We validate LEMON's performance on both mock\nEuclid data sets, real Euclidised lenses observed with Hubble Space Telescope\n(hereafter HST), and real Euclid lenses found in the Perseus ERO field,\ndemonstrating the ability of LEMON to predict parameters of both simulated and\nreal lenses. Results show promising accuracy and reliability in predicting the\nEinstein radius, axis ratio, position angle, effective radius, S\\'ersic index,\nand lens magnitude for simulated lens galaxies. The application to real data,\nincluding the latest Quick Release 1 strong lens candidates, provides\nencouraging results, particularly for the Einstein radius. We also verified\nthat LEMON has the potential to accelerate traditional modelling methods, by\ngiving to the classical optimiser the LEMON predictions as starting points,\nresulting in a speed-up of up to 26 times the original time needed to model a\nsample of gravitational lenses, a result that would be impossible with randomly\ninitialised guesses. This work represents a significant step towards efficient,\nautomated gravitational lens modelling, which is crucial for handling the large\ndata volumes expected from Euclid.",

    "abstract": "The Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) is expected to identify of order $100\\,000$\ngalaxy-galaxy strong lenses across $14\\,000$deg$^2$. The Euclid Quick Data\nRelease (Q1) of $63.1$deg$^2$ Euclid images provides an excellent opportunity\nto test our lens-finding ability, and to verify the anticipated lens frequency\nin the EWS. Following the Q1 data release, eight machine learning networks from\nfive teams were applied to approximately one million images. This was followed\nby a citizen science inspection of a subset of around $100\\,000$ images, of\nwhich $65\\%$ received high network scores, with the remainder randomly\nselected. The top scoring outputs were inspected by experts to establish\nconfident (grade A), likely (grade B), possible (grade C), and unlikely lenses.\nIn this paper we combine the citizen science and machine learning classifiers\ninto an ensemble, demonstrating that a combined approach can produce a purer\nand more complete sample than the original individual classifiers. Using the\nexpert-graded subset as ground truth, we find that this ensemble can provide a\npurity of $52\\pm2\\%$ (grade A/B lenses) with $50\\%$ completeness (for context,\ndue to the rarity of lenses a random classifier would have a purity of\n$0.05\\%$). We discuss future lessons for the first major Euclid data release\n(DR1), where the big-data challenges will become more significant and will\nrequire analysing more than $\\sim300$ million galaxies, and thus time\ninvestment of both experts and citizens must be carefully managed.",

    "abstract": "Strong gravitational lensing systems with multiple source planes are powerful\ntools for probing the density profiles and dark matter substructure of the\ngalaxies. The ratio of Einstein radii is related to the dark energy equation of\nstate through the cosmological scaling factor $\\beta$. However, galaxy-scale\ndouble-source-plane lenses (DSPLs) are extremely rare. In this paper, we report\nthe discovery of four new galaxy-scale double-source-plane lens candidates in\nthe Euclid Quick Release 1 (Q1) data. These systems were initially identified\nthrough a combination of machine learning lens-finding models and subsequent\nvisual inspection from citizens and experts. We apply the widely-used {\\tt\nLensPop} lens forecasting model to predict that the full \\Euclid survey will\ndiscover 1700 DSPLs, which scales to $6 \\pm 3$ DSPLs in 63 deg$^2$, the area of\nQ1. The number of discoveries in this work is broadly consistent with this\nforecast. We present lens models for each DSPL and infer their $\\beta$ values.\nOur initial Q1 sample demonstrates the promise of \\Euclid to discover such rare\nobjects.",

    "abstract": "Strong gravitational lensing has the potential to provide a powerful probe of\nastrophysics and cosmology, but fewer than 1000 strong lenses have been\nconfirmed so far. With a 0.16'' resolution covering a third of the sky, the\nEuclid telescope will revolutionise the identification of strong lenses, with\n170 000 lenses forecasted to be discovered amongst the 1.5 billion galaxies it\nwill observe. We present an analysis of the performance of five\nmachine-learning models at finding strong gravitational lenses in the quick\nrelease of Euclid data (Q1) covering 63 deg2. The models have been validated by\ncitizen scientists and expert visual inspection. We focus on the\nbest-performing network: a fine-tuned version of the Zoobot pretrained model\noriginally trained to classify galaxy morphologies in heterogeneous\nastronomical imaging surveys. Of the one million Q1 objects that Zoobot was\ntasked to find strong lenses within, the top 1000 ranked objects contain 122\ngrade A lenses (almost-certain lenses) and 41 grade B lenses (probable lenses).\nA deeper search with the five networks combined with visual inspection yielded\n250 (247) grade A (B) lenses, of which 224 (182) are ranked in the top 20 000\nby Zoobot. When extrapolated to the full Euclid survey, the highest ranked one\nmillion images will contain 75 000 grade A or B strong gravitational lenses.",

    "abstract": "We present a search for strong gravitational lenses in Euclid imaging with\nhigh stellar velocity dispersion ($\\sigma_\\nu > 180$ km/s) reported by SDSS and\nDESI. We performed expert visual inspection and classification of $11\\,660$\n\\Euclid images. We discovered 38 grade A and 40 grade B candidate lenses,\nconsistent with an expected sample of $\\sim$32. Palomar spectroscopy confirmed\n5 lens systems, while DESI spectra confirmed one, provided ambiguous results\nfor another, and help to discard one. The \\Euclid automated lens modeler\nmodelled 53 candidates, confirming 38 as lenses, failing to model 9, and ruling\nout 6 grade B candidates. For the remaining 25 candidates we could not gather\nadditional information. More importantly, our expert-classified non-lenses\nprovide an excellent training set for machine learning lens classifiers. We\ncreate high-fidelity simulations of \\Euclid lenses by painting realistic lensed\nsources behind the expert tagged (non-lens) luminous red galaxies. This\ntraining set is the foundation stone for the \\Euclid galaxy-galaxy strong\nlensing discovery engine.",

    "abstract": "We present a catalogue of 497 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses in the Euclid Quick\nRelease 1 data (63 deg$^2$). In the initial 0.45\\% of Euclid's surveys, we\ndouble the total number of known lens candidates with space-based imaging. Our\ncatalogue includes 250 grade A candidates, the vast majority of which (243)\nwere previously unpublished. Euclid's resolution reveals rare lens\nconfigurations of scientific value including double-source-plane lenses,\nedge-on lenses, complete Einstein rings, and quadruply-imaged lenses. We\nresolve lenses with small Einstein radii ($\\theta_{\\rm E} < 1''$) in large\nnumbers for the first time. These lenses are found through an initial sweep by\ndeep learning models, followed by Space Warps citizen scientist inspection,\nexpert vetting, and system-by-system modelling. Our search approach scales\nstraightforwardly to Euclid Data Release 1 and, without changes, would yield\napproximately 7000 high-confidence (grade A or B) lens candidates by late 2026.\nFurther extrapolating to the complete Euclid Wide Survey implies a likely yield\nof over 100000 high-confidence candidates, transforming strong lensing science.",

    "abstract": "Recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have revealed a\npopulation of sources with a compact morphology and a `v-shaped' continuum,\nnamely blue at rest-frame $\\lambda<4000$A and red at longer wavelengths. The\nnature of these sources, called `little red dots' (LRDs), is still debated,\nsince it is unclear if they host active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their number\nseems to drastically drop at z<4. We utilise the 63 $deg^2$ covered by the\nquick Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) to extend the search for LRDs to brighter\nmagnitudes and to lower z than what has been possible with JWST to have a\nbroader view of the evolution of this peculiar galaxy population. The selection\nis done by fitting the available photometric data (Euclid, Spitzer/IRAC, and\nground-based griz data) with two power laws, to retrieve the rest-frame optical\nand UV slopes consistently over a large redshift range (i.e, z<7.6). We exclude\nextended objects and possible line emitters, and perform a visual inspection to\nremove imaging artefacts. The final selection includes 3341 LRD candidates from\nz=0.33 to z=3.6, with 29 detected in IRAC. Their rest-frame UV luminosity\nfunction, in contrast with previous JWST studies, shows that the number density\nof LRD candidates increases from high-z down to z=1.5-2.5 and decreases at even\nlower z. Less evolution is apparent focusing on the subsample of more robust\nLRD candidates having IRAC detections, which is affected by low statistics and\nlimited by the IRAC resolution. The comparison with previous quasar UV\nluminosity functions shows that LRDs are not the dominant AGN population at\nz<4. Follow-up studies of these LRD candidates are key to confirm their nature,\nprobe their physical properties and check for their compatibility with JWST\nsources, since the different spatial resolution and wavelength coverage of\nEuclid and JWST could select different samples of compact sources.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of cosmic star-formation at $z>3$ used to largely rely on\nrest-frame UV observations. However, these observations overlook dusty and\nmassive sources, resulting in an incomplete census of early star-forming\ngalaxies. Recently, infrared data from Spitzer and the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) have revealed a hidden population at $z\\sim$3-6 with extreme\nred colours. Taking advantage of the overlap between imaging in the Euclid Deep\nFields (EDFs), covering $\\sim$ 60 deg$^2$, and ancillary Spitzer observations,\nwe identified 27000 extremely red objects with $H_E-{\\rm IRAC}2>2.25$ (dubbed\nHIEROs) down to a $10\\sigma$ completeness magnitude limit of IRAC2 $=$ 22.5 AB.\nAfter a visual inspection to discard artefacts and objects with troubling\nphotometry, we ended up with a final sample of 3900 candidates. We retrieved\nthe physical parameter estimates for these objects from the SED-fitting tool\nCIGALE. Our results confirm that HIERO galaxies may populate the high-mass end\nof the stellar mass function at $z>3$, with some reaching extreme stellar\nmasses ($M_*>10^{11}M_\\odot$) and exhibiting high dust attenuation ($A_V>3$).\nHowever, we consider stellar mass estimates unreliable for $z>3.5$, favouring a\nlower-z solution. The challenges faced by SED-fitting tools in characterising\nthese objects highlight the need for further studies, incorporating\nshorter-wavelength and spectroscopic data. Euclid spectra will help resolve\ndegeneracies and better constrain the physical properties of the brightest\ngalaxies. Given the extreme nature of this population, characterising these\nsources is crucial for understanding galaxy evolution. This work demonstrates\nEuclid's potential to provide statistical samples of rare, massive,\ndust-obscured galaxies at $z>3$, which will be prime targets for JWST, ALMA,\nand ELT.",

    "abstract": "Light emission from galaxies exhibit diverse brightness profiles, influenced\nby factors such as galaxy type, structural features and interactions with other\ngalaxies. Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while\nspiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their\nstructural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from\ngas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic\nlight, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN\nemission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has\nbeen discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength\nobservations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO\nfrom a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the\nmachine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday\nobjects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we\ncreated a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any\nsource pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light\ndistributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We\ncondition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the\ncentral few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the\ndiffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that\ndeviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few\ncentral pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using\nVIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN\nand QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.",

    "abstract": "We present a catalogue of candidate active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the\n$Euclid$ Quick Release (Q1) fields. For each $Euclid$ source we collect\nmulti-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy information from Galaxy Evolution\nExplorer (GALEX), $Gaia$, Dark Energy Survey (DES), Wise-field Infrared Survey\nExplorer (WISE), $Spitzer$, Dark Energy Survey (DESI), and Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS), including spectroscopic redshift from public compilations. We\ninvestigate the AGN contents of the Q1 fields by applying selection criteria\nusing $Euclid$ colours and WISE-AllWISE cuts finding respectively 292,222 and\n65,131 candidates. We also create a high-purity QSO catalogue based on $Gaia$\nDR3 information containing 1971 candidates. Furthermore, we utilise the\ncollected spectroscopic information from DESI to perform broad-line and\nnarrow-line AGN selections, leading to a total of 4392 AGN candidates in the Q1\nfield. We investigate and refine the Q1 probabilistic random forest QSO\npopulation, selecting a total of 180,666 candidates. Additionally, we perform\nSED fitting on a subset of sources with available $z_{\\text{spec}}$, and by\nutilizing the derived AGN fraction, we identify a total of 7766 AGN candidates.\nWe discuss purity and completeness of the selections and define two new colour\nselection criteria ($JH$_$I_{\\text{E}}Y$ and $I_{\\text{E}}H$_$gz$) to improve\non purity, finding 313,714 and 267,513 candidates respectively in the Q1 data.\nWe find a total of 229,779 AGN candidates equivalent to an AGN surface density\nof 3641 deg$^{-2}$ for $18<I_{\\text{E}}\\leq 24.5$, and a subsample of 30,422\ncandidates corresponding to an AGN surface density of 482 deg$^{-2}$ when\nlimiting the depth to $18<I_{\\text{E}}\\leq 22$. The surface density of AGN\nrecovered from this work is in line with predictions based on the AGN X-ray\nluminosity functions.",

    "abstract": "Red quasars constitute an important but elusive phase in the evolution of\nsupermassive black holes, where dust obscuration can significantly alter their\nobserved properties. They have broad emission lines, like other quasars, but\ntheir optical continuum emission is significantly reddened, which is why they\nwere traditionally identified based on near- and mid-infrared selection\ncriteria. This work showcases the capability of the \\Euclid space telescope to\nfind a large sample of red quasars, using \\Euclid near infrared (NIR)\nphotometry. We first conduct a forecast analysis, comparing a synthetic\ncatalogue of red QSOs with COSMOS2020. Using template fitting, we reconstruct\n\\Euclid-like photometry for the COSMOS sources and identify a sample of\ncandidates in a multidimensional colour-colour space achieving $98\\%$\ncompleteness for mock red QSOs with $30\\%$ contaminants. To refine our\nselection function, we implement a probabilistic Random Forest classifier, and\nuse UMAP visualisation to disentangle non-linear features in colour-space,\nreaching $98\\%$ completeness and $88\\%$ purity. A preliminary analysis of the\ncandidates in the \\Euclid Deep Field Fornax (EDF-F) shows that, compared to\nVISTA+DECAm-based colour selection criteria, \\Euclid's superior depth,\nresolution and optical-to-NIR coverage improves the identification of the\nreddest, most obscured sources. Notably, the \\Euclid exquisite resolution in\nthe $I_E$ filter unveils the presence of a candidate dual quasar system,\nhighlighting the potential for this mission to contribute to future studies on\nthe population of dual AGN. The resulting catalogue of candidates, including\nmore the 150 000 sources, provides a first census of red quasars in \\Euclid Q1\nand sets the groundwork for future studies in the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS),\nincluding spectral follow-up analyses and host morphology characterisation.",

    "abstract": "Active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in galaxy evolution but are\nchallenging to identify due to their varied observational signatures.\nFurthermore, understanding their impact requires quantifying their strength\nrelative to their host galaxies. We developed a deep learning (DL) model for\nidentifying AGN in imaging data by deriving the contribution of the central\npoint source. Trained on Euclidised mock galaxy images with injected AGN\nlevels, in the form of varying contributions of the point-spread function\n(PSF), our model can precisely and accurately recover the injected AGN\ncontribution fraction $f_{\\rm PSF}$, with a mean difference between the\npredicted and true $f_{\\rm PSF}$ of $-0.0078$ and an overall root mean square\nerror (RMSE) of 0.051. This method moves beyond binary AGN classification,\nenabling precise AGN contribution measurements. Applying our model to a\nstellar-mass-limited sample ($M_{\\ast} \\ge 10^{9.8} M_{\\odot}$, $0.5 \\le z \\le\n2.0$) from the first \\Euclid quick data release (Q1), we identify $48,840 \\pm\n78$ AGN over 63.1 deg$^2$ ($7.8\\pm0.1$%) using a threshold of $f_{\\rm PSF} >\n0.2$. We compare our DL-selected AGN with those identified in X-ray,\nmid-infrared (MIR), and optical spectroscopy and investigate their overlapping\nfractions depending on different thresholds on the PSF contribution. We find\nthat the overlap increases with increasing X-ray or bolometric AGN luminosity.\nThe AGN luminosity in the $I_{\\rm E}$ filter correlates with host galaxy\nstellar mass, suggesting faster supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in more\nmassive galaxies. Moreover, the mean relative contribution of the AGN is higher\nin quiescent galaxies than in star-forming ones. Starburst galaxies and the\nmost massive galaxies (across the star-formation main sequence) tend to host\nthe most luminous AGN, indicating concomitant assembly of the SMBH and the host\ngalaxy.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy major mergers are a key pathway to trigger AGN. We present the first\ndetection of major mergers in the Euclid Deep Fields and analyse their\nconnection with AGN. We constructed a stellar-mass-complete\n($M_*>10^{9.8}\\,M_{\\odot}$) sample of galaxies from the first quick data\nrelease (Q1), in the redshift range z=0.5-2. We selected AGN using X-ray data,\noptical spectroscopy, mid-infrared colours, and processing \\IE observations\nwith an image decomposition algorithm. We used CNNs trained on cosmological\nsimulations to classify galaxies as mergers and non-mergers. We found a larger\nfraction of AGN in mergers compared to the non-merger controls for all AGN\nselections, with AGN excess factors ranging from 2 to 6. Likewise, a generally\nlarger merger fraction ($f_{merg}$) is seen in active galaxies than in the\nnon-active controls. We analysed $f_{merg}$ as a function of the AGN bolometric\nluminosity ($L_{bol}$) and the contribution of the point-source to the total\ngalaxy light in the \\IE-band ($f_{PSF}$) as a proxy for the relative AGN\ncontribution fraction. We uncovered a rising $f_{merg}$, with increasing\n$f_{PSF}$ up to $f_{PSF}=0.55$, after which we observed a decreasing trend. We\nthen derived the point-source luminosity ($L_{PSF}$) and showed that $f_{merg}$\nmonotonically increases as a function of $L_{PSF}$ at z<0.9, with\n$f_{merg}>$50% for $L_{PSF}>2\\,10^{43}$ erg/s. At z>0.9, $f_{merg}$ rises as a\nfunction of $L_{PSF}$, though mergers do not dominate until $L_{PSF}=10^{45}$\nerg/s. For X-ray and spectroscopic AGN, we computed $L_{bol}$, which has a\npositive correlation with $f_{merg}$ for X-ray AGN, while shows a less\npronounced trend for spectroscopic AGN due to the smaller sample size. At\n$L_{bol}>10^{45}$ erg/s, AGN mostly reside in mergers. We concluded that\nmergers are strongly linked to the most powerful, dust-obscured AGN, associated\nwith rapid supermassive black hole growth.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxy\nevolution, it is crucial to achieve a complete and pure AGN census. X-ray\nsurveys are key to this, but identifying their counterparts (CTPs) at other\nwavelengths remains challenging due to their larger positional uncertainties\nand limited availability of deeper, uniform ancillary data. Euclid is\nrevolutionising this effort, offering extensive coverage of nearly the entire\nextragalactic sky, particularly in the near-infrared bands, where AGN are more\neasily detected. With the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we identifyed,\nclassifyed, and determined the redshifts of Euclid CTPs to known point-like\nsources from major X-ray surveys, including XMM-Newton, Chandra, and eROSITA.\nUsing Bayesian statistics, combined with machine learning (ML), we identify the\nCTPs to 11 286 X-ray sources from the three X-ray telescopes. For the large\nmajority of 10 194 sources, the associations are unique, with the remaining\n$\\sim$ 10% of multi-CTP cases equally split between XMM-Newton and eROSITA. ML\nis then used to distinguish between Galactic (8%) and extragalactic (92%)\nsources. We computed photo-zs using deep learning for the 8617 sources detected\nin the 10th data release of the DESI Legacy Survey, reaching an accuracy and a\nfraction of outliers of about 5%. Based on their X-ray luminosities, over 99%\nof CTPs identified as extragalactic are classified as AGN, most of which appear\nunobscured given their hardness ratios. With this paper, we release our\ncatalogue, which includes identifiers, basic X-ray properties, the details of\nthe associations, and additional features such as Galactic/extragalactic\nclassifications and photometric/spectroscopic redshifts. We also provide\nprobabilities for sub-selecting the sample based on purity and completeness,\nallowing users to tailor the sample according to their specific needs.",

    "abstract": "Investigating the drivers of the quenching of star formation in galaxies is\nkey to understanding their evolution. The Euclid mission will provide rich\nspatial and spectral data from optical to infrared wavelengths for millions of\ngalaxies, enabling precise measurements of their star formation histories.\nUsing the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we developed a probabilistic\nclassification framework, that combines the average specific star-formation\nrate ($\\rm sSFR_\\tau$) inferred over two timescales ($\\tau={10^8,10^9}$ yr), to\ncategorize galaxies as `Ageing' (secularly evolving), `Quenched' (recently\nhalted star formation), or `Retired' (dominated by old stars). We validated\nthis methodology using synthetic observations from the IllustrisTNG simulation.\nTwo classification methods were employed: a probabilistic approach, integrating\nposterior distributions, and a model-driven method optimizing sample purity and\ncompleteness using IllustrisTNG. At $z<0.1$ and $M_\\ast \\gtrsim 3\\times10^{8}\\,\nM_\\odot$, we obtain Euclid class fractions of 68-72%, 8-17%, and 14-19% for\nAgeing, Quenched, and Retired populations, respectively, consistent with\nprevious studies. The evolution with redshift shows increasing/decreasing\nfraction of Ageing/Retired galaxies. The fraction of quenched systems shows a\nweaker dependence on stellar mass and redshift, varying between 5% and 15%. We\nanalysed the mass-size-metallicity relation for each population. Ageing\ngalaxies generally exhibit disc morphologies and low metallicities. Retired\ngalaxies show compact structures and enhanced chemical enrichment, while\nQuenched galaxies form an intermediate population, more compact and chemically\nevolved than Ageing systems. This work demonstrates Euclid's great potential\nfor elucidating the physical nature of the quenching mechanisms that govern\ngalaxy evolution.",

    "abstract": "The star-forming main sequence (SFMS) is a tight relation observed between\nstellar masses and star formation rates (SFR) in a population of galaxies. This\nrelation is observed at different redshifts, in various morphological, and\nenvironmental domains, and is key to understanding the underlying relations\nbetween a galaxy budget of cold gas and its stellar content. Euclid Quick Data\nRelease 1 (Q1) gives us the opportunity to investigate this fundamental\nrelation in galaxy formation and evolution. We complement the Euclid release\nwith public IRAC observations of the Euclid Deep Fields, improving the quality\nof recovered photometric redshifts, stellar masses, and SFRs, as is shown both\nwith simulations and a comparison with available spectroscopic redshifts. From\nQ1 data alone, we recover more than $\\sim 30\\,\\mathrm{k}$ galaxies with\n$\\log_{10} (M_\\ast/M_\\odot) > 11$, giving a precise constraint of the SFMS at\nthe high-mass end. We investigated the SFMS, in a redshift interval between\n$0.2$ and $3.0$, comparing our results with the existing literature and fitting\nthem with a parameterisation taking into account the presence of a bending of\nthe relation at the high-mass end, depending on the bending mass, $M_0$. We\nfind good agreement with previous results in terms of $M_0$ values, and an\nincreasing trend for the relation scatter at higher stellar masses. We also\ninvestigate the distribution of physical (e.g. dust absorption, $A_V$, and\nformation age) and morphological properties (e.g., S\\'ersic index and radius)\nin the SFR--stellar mass plane, and their relation with the SFMS. These results\nhighlight the potential of Euclid in studying the fundamental scaling relations\nthat regulate galaxy formation and evolution in anticipation of the forthcoming\nData Release 1.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which the environment affects galaxy evolution has been under\nscrutiny by researchers for decades. With the first data from Euclid, we can\nbegin to study a wide range of environments and their effects as a function of\nredshift, using 63 sq deg of space-based data. In this paper, we present\nresults from the Euclid Q1 Release, where we measure the passive-density and\nmorphology-density relations at $z=0.25$-1. We determine if a galaxy is passive\nusing the specific star-formation rate, and we classify the morphologies of\ngalaxies using the S\\'ersic index n and the u-r colours. We measure the local\nenvironmental density of each galaxy using the Nth-nearest neighbour method. We\nfind that at fixed stellar mass, the quenched fraction increases with\nincreasing density up to $z=0.75$. This result shows the separability of the\neffects from the stellar mass and the environment, at least at $z<0.75$. At\n$z>0.75$, we observe weak environmental effects, with most high mass galaxies\nbeing quenched independently of environment. Up to $z=0.75$, the ETG fraction\nincreases with density at fixed stellar mass, meaning the environment also\ntransforms the morphology of the galaxy independently of stellar mass, at low\nmass. For high mass galaxies, almost all galaxies are early-types, with low\nimpact from the environment. At $z>0.75$, the morphology depends mostly on\nstellar mass, with only low-mass galaxies being affected by the environment.\nGiven that the morphology classifications use u-r colours, these are correlated\nto the star-formation rate, and as such our morphology results should be taken\nwith caution; future morphology classifications should verify these results. To\nsummarise, we identify the passive-density and morphology-density relations at\n$z<0.75$, but at $z>0.75$ the relations are less strong. At $z>0.75$, the\nuncertainties are large, and future Euclid data releases are key to confirm\nthese trends.",

    "abstract": "Modern astronomical surveys, such as the Euclid mission, produce\nhigh-dimensional, multi-modal data sets that include imaging and spectroscopic\ninformation for millions of galaxies. These data serve as an ideal benchmark\nfor large, pre-trained multi-modal models, which can leverage vast amounts of\nunlabelled data. In this work, we present the first exploration of Euclid data\nwith AstroPT, an autoregressive multi-modal foundation model trained on\napproximately 300 000 optical and infrared Euclid images and spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) from the first Euclid Quick Data Release. We compare\nself-supervised pre-training with baseline fully supervised training across\nseveral tasks: galaxy morphology classification; redshift estimation;\nsimilarity searches; and outlier detection. Our results show that: (a) AstroPT\nembeddings are highly informative, correlating with morphology and effectively\nisolating outliers; (b) including infrared data helps to isolate stars, but\ndegrades the identification of edge-on galaxies, which are better captured by\noptical images; (c) simple fine-tuning of these embeddings for photometric\nredshift and stellar mass estimation outperforms a fully supervised approach,\neven when using only 1% of the training labels; and (d) incorporating SED data\ninto AstroPT via a straightforward multi-modal token-chaining method improves\nphoto-z predictions, and allow us to identify potentially more interesting\nanomalies (such as ringed or interacting galaxies) compared to a model\npre-trained solely on imaging data.",

    "abstract": "Stellar bars are key structures in disc galaxies, driving angular momentum\nredistribution and influencing processes such as bulge growth and star\nformation. Quantifying the bar fraction as a function of redshift and stellar\nmass is therefore important for constraining the physical processes that drive\ndisc formation and evolution across the history of the Universe. Leveraging the\nunprecedented resolution and survey area of the Euclid Q1 data release combined\nwith the Zoobot deep-learning model trained on citizen-science labels, we\nidentify 7711 barred galaxies with $M_* \\gtrsim 10^{10}M_\\odot$ in a\nmagnitude-selected sample $I_E < 20.5$ spanning $63.1 deg^2$. We measure a mean\nbar fraction of $0.2-0.4$, consistent with prior studies. At fixed redshift,\nmassive galaxies exhibit higher bar fractions, while lower-mass systems show a\nsteeper decline with redshift, suggesting earlier disc assembly in massive\ngalaxies. Comparisons with cosmological simulations (e.g., TNG50, Auriga)\nreveal a broadly consistent bar fraction, but highlight overpredictions for\nhigh-mass systems, pointing to potential over-efficiency in central stellar\nmass build-up in simulations. These findings demonstrate Euclid's\ntransformative potential for galaxy morphology studies and underscore the\nimportance of refining theoretical models to better reproduce observed trends.\nFuture work will explore finer mass bins, environmental correlations, and\nadditional morphological indicators.",

    "abstract": "We present the results of the single-component S\\'ersic profile fitting for\nthe magnitude-limited sample of \\IE$<23$ galaxies within the 63.1 deg$^2$ area\nof the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1). The associated morphological catalogue\nincludes two sets of structural parameters fitted using\n\\texttt{SourceXtractor++}: one for VIS \\IE images and one for a combination of\nthree NISP images in \\YE, \\JE and \\HE bands. We compare the resulting S\\'ersic\nparameters to other morphological measurements provided in the Q1 data release,\nand to the equivalent parameters based on higher-resolution \\HST imaging. These\ncomparisons confirm the consistency and the reliability of the fits to Q1 data.\nOur analysis of colour gradients shows that NISP profiles have systematically\nsmaller effective radii ($R_{\\rm e}$) and larger S\\'ersic indices ($n$) than in\nVIS. In addition, we highlight trends in NISP-to-VIS parameter ratios with both\nmagnitude and $n_{\\rm VIS}$. From the 2D bimodality of the $(u-r)$\ncolour-$\\log(n)$ plane, we define a $(u-r)_{\\rm lim}(n)$ that separates early-\nand late-type galaxies (ETGs and LTGs). We use the two subpopulations to\nexamine the variations of $n$ across well-known scaling relations at $z<1$.\nETGs display a steeper size--stellar mass relation than LTGs, indicating a\ndifference in the main drivers of their mass assembly. Similarly, LTGs and ETGs\noccupy different parts of the stellar mass--star-formation rate plane, with\nETGs at higher masses than LTGs, and further down below the Main Sequence of\nstar-forming galaxies. This clear separation highlights the link known between\nthe shutdown of star formation and morphological transformations in the Euclid\nimaging data set. In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates both the robustness\nof the S\\'ersic fits available in the Q1 morphological catalogue and the wealth\nof information they provide for studies of galaxy evolution with Euclid.",

    "abstract": "The SPE processing function (PF) of the \\Euclid pipeline is dedicated to the\nautomatic analysis of one-dimensional spectra to determine redshifts, line\nfluxes, and spectral classifications. The first \\Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1)\ndelivers these measurements for all $H_\\mathrm{E}<22.5$ objects identified in\nthe photometric survey. In this paper, we present an overview of the SPE PF\nalgorithm and assess its performance by comparing its results with high-quality\nspectroscopic redshifts from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)\nsurvey in the Euclid Deep Field North. Our findings highlight remarkable\naccuracy in successful redshift measurements, with a bias of less than $3\n\\times 10^{-5}$ in $(z_{\\rm SPE}-z_{\\rm DESI})/(1+z_{\\rm DESI})$ and a high\nprecision of approximately $10^{-3}$. The majority of spectra have only a\nsingle spectral feature or none at all. To avoid spurious detections, where\nnoise features are misinterpreted as lines or lines are misidentified, it is\ntherefore essential to apply well-defined criteria on quantities such as the\nredshift probability or the \\ha\\ flux and signal-to-noise ratio. Using a\nwell-tuned quality selection, we achieve an 89\\% redshift success rate in the\ntarget redshift range for cosmology ($0.9<z<1.8$), which is well covered by\nDESI for $z<1.6$. Outside this range where the \\ha\\ line is observable,\nredshift measurements are less reliable, except for sources showing specific\nspectral features (e.g., two bright lines or strong continuum). Ongoing\nrefinements along the entire chain of PFs are expected to enhance both the\nredshift measurements and the spectral classification, allowing us to define\nthe large and reliable sample required for cosmological analyses. Overall, the\nQ1 SPE results are promising, demonstrating encouraging potential for\ncosmology.",

    "abstract": "The Euclid space mission aims to investigate the nature of dark energy and\ndark matter by mapping the large-scale structure of the Universe. A key\ncomponent of Euclid's observational strategy is slitless spectroscopy,\nconducted using the Near Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP). This\ntechnique enables the acquisition of large-scale spectroscopic data without the\nneed for targeted apertures, allowing precise redshift measurements for\nmillions of galaxies. These data are essential for Euclid's core science\nobjectives, including the study of cosmic acceleration and the evolution of\ngalaxy clustering, as well as enabling many non-cosmological investigations.\nThis study presents the SIR processing function (PF), which is responsible for\nprocessing slitless spectroscopic data. The objective is to generate\nscience-grade fully-calibrated one-dimensional spectra, ensuring high-quality\nspectroscopic data. The processing function relies on a source catalogue\ngenerated from photometric data, effectively corrects detector effects,\nsubtracts cross-contaminations, minimizes self-contamination, calibrates\nwavelength and flux, and produces reliable spectra for later scientific use.\nThe first Quick Data Release (Q1) of Euclid's spectroscopic data provides\napproximately three million validated spectra for sources observed in the\nred-grism mode from a selected portion of the Euclid Wide Survey. We find that\nwavelength accuracy and measured resolving power are within requirements,\nthanks to the excellent optical quality of the instrument. The SIR PF\nrepresents a significant step in processing slitless spectroscopic data for the\nEuclid mission. As the survey progresses, continued refinements and additional\nfeatures will enhance its capabilities, supporting high-precision cosmological\nand astrophysical measurements.",

    "abstract": "The ESA Euclid mission will measure the photometric redshifts of billions of\ngalaxies in order to provide an accurate 3D view of the Universe at optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths. Photometric redshifts are determined by the PHZ\nprocessing function on the basis of the multi-wavelength photometry of Euclid\nand ground-based observations. In this paper, we describe the PHZ processing\nused for the Euclid Quick Data Release, the output products, and their\nvalidation. The PHZ pipeline is responsible for the following main tasks:\nsource classification into star, galaxy, and QSO classes based on photometric\ncolours; determination of photometric redshifts and of physical properties of\ngalaxies. The classification is able to provide a star sample with a high level\nof purity, a highly complete galaxy sample, and reliable probabilities of\nbelonging to those classes. The identification of QSOs is more problematic:\nphotometric information seems to be insufficient to accurately separate QSOs\nfrom galaxies. The performance of the pipeline in the determination of\nphotometric redshifts has been tested using the COSMOS2020 catalogue and a\nlarge sample of spectroscopic redshifts. The results are in line with\nexpectations: the precision of the estimates are compatible with Euclid\nrequirements, while, as expected, a bias correction is needed to achieve the\naccuracy level required for the cosmological probes. Finally, the pipeline\nprovides reliable estimates of the physical properties of galaxies, in good\nagreement with findings from the COSMOS2020 catalogue, except for an\nunrealistically large fraction of very young galaxies with very high specific\nstar-formation rates. The application of appropriate priors is, however,\nsufficient to obtain reliable physical properties for those problematic\nobjects. We present several areas for improvement for future Euclid data\nreleases.",

    "abstract": "The Euclid satellite is an ESA mission that was launched in July 2023.\n\\Euclid is working in its regular observing mode with the target of observing\nan area of $14\\,000~\\text{deg}^2$ with two instruments, the Visible Camera\n(VIS) and the Near IR Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) down to $I_{\\rm E} =\n24.5~\\text{mag}$ ($10\\, \\sigma$) in the Euclid Wide Survey. Ground-based\nimaging data in the \\textit{ugriz} bands complement the \\Euclid data to enable\nphoto-$z$ determination and VIS PSF modeling for week lensing analysis. Euclid\ninvestigates the distance-redshift relation and the evolution of cosmic\nstructures by measuring shapes and redshifts of galaxies and clusters of\ngalaxies out to $z\\sim 2$. Generating the multi-wavelength catalogues from\n\\Euclid and ground-based data is an essential part of the \\Euclid data\nprocessing system. In the framework of the \\Euclid Science Ground Segment\n(SGS), the aim of the MER Processing Function (PF) pipeline is to detect\nobjects in the \\Euclid imaging data, measure their properties, and MERge them\ninto a single multi-wavelength catalogue. The MER PF pipeline performs source\ndetection on both visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) images and offers four\ndifferent photometric measurements: Kron total flux, aperture photometry on\nPSF-matched images, template fitting photometry, and S\\'ersic fitting\nphotometry. Furthermore, the MER PF pipeline measures a set of ancillary\nquantities, spanning from morphology to quality flags, to better characterise\nall detected sources. In this paper, we show how the MER PF pipeline is\ndesigned, detailing its main steps, and we show that the pipeline products meet\nthe tight requirements that Euclid aims to achieve on photometric accuracy. We\nalso present the other measurements (e.g. morphology) that are included in the\nOU-MER output catalogues and we list all output products coming out of the MER\nPF pipeline.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the near-infrared processing function (NIR PF) that\nprocesses near-infrared images from the Near-Infrared Spectrometer and\nPhotometer (NISP) instrument onboard the Euclid satellite. NIR PF consists of\nthree main components: (i) a common pre-processing stage for both photometric\n(NIR) and spectroscopic (SIR) data to remove instrumental effects; (ii)\nastrometric and photometric calibration of NIR data, along with catalogue\nextraction; and (iii) resampling and stacking. The necessary calibration\nproducts are generated using dedicated pipelines that process observations from\nboth the early performance verification (PV) phase in 2023 and the nominal\nsurvey operations. After outlining the pipeline's structure and algorithms, we\ndemonstrate its application to Euclid Q1 images. For Q1, we achieve an\nastrometric accuracy of 9-15 mas, a relative photometric accuracy of 5 mmag,\nand an absolute flux calibration limited by the 1% uncertainty of the Hubble\nSpace Telescope (HST) CALSPEC database. We characterise the point-spread\nfunction (PSF) that we find very stable across the focal plane, and we discuss\ncurrent limitations of NIR PF that will be improved upon for future data\nreleases.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes the VIS Processing Function (VIS PF) of the Euclid\nground segment pipeline, which processes and calibrates raw data from the VIS\ncamera. We present the algorithms used in each processing element, along with a\ndescription of the on-orbit performance of VIS PF, based on Performance\nVerification (PV) and Q1 data. We demonstrate that the principal performance\nmetrics (image quality, astrometric accuracy, photometric calibration) are\nwithin pre-launch specifications. The image-to-image photometric scatter is\nless than $0.8\\%$, and absolute astrometric accuracy compared to Gaia is $5$\nmas Image quality is stable over all Q1 images with a full width at half\nmaximum (FWHM) of $0.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}16$. The stacked images (combining four\nnominal and two short exposures) reach $I_\\mathrm{E} = 25.6$ ($10\\sigma$,\nmeasured as the variance of $1.\\!^{\\prime\\prime}3$ diameter apertures). We also\ndescribe quality control metrics provided with each image, and an appendix\nprovides a detailed description of the provided data products. The excellent\nquality of these images demonstrates the immense potential of Euclid VIS data\nfor weak lensing. VIS data, covering most of the extragalactic sky, will\nprovide a lasting high-resolution atlas of the Universe.",

    "abstract": "The first Euclid Quick Data Release, Q1, comprises 63.1 sq deg of the Euclid\nDeep Fields (EDFs) to nominal wide-survey depth. It encompasses visible and\nnear-infrared space-based imaging and spectroscopic data, ground-based\nphotometry in the u, g, r, i and z bands, as well as corresponding masks.\nOverall, Q1 contains about 30 million objects in three areas near the ecliptic\npoles around the EDF-North and EDF-South, as well as the EDF-Fornax field in\nthe constellation of the same name. The purpose of this data release -- and its\nassociated technical papers -- is twofold. First, it is meant to inform the\ncommunity of the enormous potential of the Euclid survey data, to describe what\nis contained in these data, and to help prepare expectations for the\nforthcoming first major data release DR1. Second, it enables a wide range of\ninitial scientific projects with wide-survey Euclid data, ranging from the\nearly Universe to the Solar System. The Q1 data were processed with early\nversions of the processing pipelines, which already demonstrate good\nperformance, with numerous improvements in implementation compared to\npre-launch development. In this paper, we describe the sky areas released in\nQ1, the observations, a top-level view of the data processing of Euclid and\nassociated external data, the Q1 photometric masks, and how to access the data.\nWe also give an overview of initial scientific results obtained using the Q1\ndata set by Euclid Consortium scientists, and conclude with important caveats\nwhen using the data. As a complementary product, Q1 also contains observations\nof a star-forming area in Lynd's Dark Nebula 1641 in the Orion~A Cloud,\nobserved for technical purposes during Euclid's performance-verification phase.\nThis is a unique target, of a type not commonly found in Euclid's nominal sky\nsurvey.",

    "abstract": "Repository-level code completion aims to complete code based on the long\ncontexts of the repository. Existing studies extract long contexts from the\nrepository as inputs and leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate\ncode. However, we reveal a severe limitation of LLMs, i.e., LLMs may ignore the\ninformation within long contexts in code completion. In other words, even the\ncontexts contain useful information (e.g., relevant APIs or similar code), LLMs\nmay fail to utilize this information. We think this limitation is caused by an\ninherent bias in LLMs, i.e., relying on nearby contexts and ignoring long-range\ncontexts. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach named CoLT.\nThe core idea of CoLT is to provide explicit supervision signals, which\nemphasize that long-range contexts may hold relevant information. Specifically,\nCoLT proposes a reinforcement learning-based training, which explicitly\nencourages models to utilize the information within long contexts and punishes\nmodels for ignoring long contexts. To support CoLT, we release CoLT-132K, a\nlarge-scale dataset with 132k samples across four languages, each containing\nlong-context inputs. We apply CoLT to a popular LLM - aiXcoder-7B and release\naiXcoder-7B-v2. We conduct extensive experiments on CoLT-132K and a public\nbenchmark - CrossCodeEval. Our experiments yield the results: 1. Effectiveness.\nCoLT substantially improves aiXcoder-7B. aiXcoder-7B-v2 outperforms aiXcoder-7B\nby up to 44% in exact match. aiXcoder-7B-v2 becomes the state-of-the-art 7B\nmodel in code completion and even surpasses larger models. 2. Generalizability.\nThe capability learned by CoLT can generalize to new languages. Besides, CoLT\nis model-agnostic and effectively improves multiple LLMs. 3. Enhanced Context\nUtilization Capability. CoLT significantly improves the capability of LLMs in\nutilizing the relevant information within long contexts.",

While a few studies hint at this possibility, none has\nclearly defined or demonstrated this phenomenon. We first propose a formal\ndefinition of knowledge, quantifying it for a given question as the fraction of\ncorrect-incorrect answer pairs where the correct one is ranked higher. This\ngives rise to external and internal knowledge, depending on the information\nused to score individual answer candidates: either the model's observable\ntoken-level probabilities or its intermediate computations. Hidden knowledge\narises when internal knowledge exceeds external knowledge. We then present a\ncase study, applying this framework to three popular open-weights LLMs in a\nclosed-book QA setup. Our results indicate that: (1) LLMs consistently encode\nmore factual knowledge internally than what they express externally, with an\naverage relative gap of 40%. (2) Surprisingly, some knowledge is so deeply\nhidden that a model can internally know an answer perfectly, yet fail to\ngenerate it even once, despite large-scale repeated sampling of 1,000 answers.\nThis reveals fundamental limitations in the generation capabilities of LLMs,\nwhich (3) put a practical constraint on scaling test-time compute via repeated\nanswer sampling in closed-book QA: significant performance improvements remain\ninaccessible because some answers are practically never sampled, yet if they\nwere, we would be guaranteed to rank them first.",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of new application areas such as cyber-physical systems\nand human-in-the-loop applications ensuring a specific level of end-to-end\nnetwork latency with high reliability (e.g., 99.9%) is becoming increasingly\ncritical. To align wireless links with these reliability requirements, it is\nessential to analyze and control network latency in terms of its full\nprobability distribution. However, in a wireless link, the distribution may\nvary over time, making this task particularly challenging. We propose\npredicting the latency distribution using state-of-the-art data-driven\ntechniques that leverage historical network information. Our approach tokenizes\nnetwork state information and processes it using temporal deep-learning\narchitectures-namely LSTM and Transformer models-to capture both short- and\nlong-term delay dependencies. These models output parameters for a chosen\nparametric density via a mixture density network with Gaussian mixtures,\nyielding multi-step probabilistic forecasts of future delays. To validate our\nproposed approach, we implemented and tested these methods using a\ntime-synchronized, SDR-based OpenAirInterface 5G testbed to collect and\npreprocess network-delay data. Our experiments show that the Transformer model\nachieves lower negative log-likelihood and mean absolute error than both LSTM\nand feed-forward baselines in challenging scenarios, while also providing\ninsights into model complexity and training/inference overhead. This framework\nenables more informed decision-making for adaptive scheduling and resource\nallocation, paving the way toward enhanced QoS in evolving 5G and 6G networks.",

    "abstract": "Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to cultivate an object detector that\ncan continuously localize and recognize novel classes while preserving its\nperformance on previous classes. Existing methods achieve certain success by\nimproving knowledge distillation and exemplar replay for transformer-based\ndetection frameworks, but the intrinsic forgetting mechanisms remain\nunderexplored. In this paper, we dive into the cause of forgetting and discover\nforgetting imbalance between localization and recognition in transformer-based\nIOD, which means that localization is less-forgetting and can generalize to\nfuture classes, whereas catastrophic forgetting occurs primarily on\nrecognition. Based on these insights, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Amnesia\n(DCA) strategy, which redesigns the transformer-based IOD into a\nlocalization-then-recognition process. DCA can well maintain and transfer the\nlocalization ability, leaving decoupled fragile recognition to be specially\nconquered. To reduce feature drift in recognition, we leverage semantic\nknowledge encoded in pre-trained language models to anchor class\nrepresentations within a unified feature space across incremental tasks. This\ninvolves designing a duplex classifier fusion and embedding class semantic\nfeatures into the recognition decoding process in the form of queries.\nExtensive experiments validate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, especially for long-term incremental scenarios. For example, under\nthe four-step setting on MS-COCO, our DCA strategy significantly improves the\nfinal AP by 6.9%.",

Particle-based methods offer high\nflexibility and can approximate posterior probability density functions of the\nmobile agent state and the map feature states, (i.e., VA states) with complex\nshapes.

Implementing this generalized MOST in numerical models,\nhowever, requires understanding the key drivers of turbulence anisotropy across\nvarious terrain conditions. This study therefore employs random forest models\ntrained on measurement data from both flat and complex terrain and including\nupstream terrain features, to predict turbulence anisotropy. Two approaches\nwere compared: using dimensional variables directly or employing\nnon-dimensional groups as model input. To address cross-correlation among\nfeatures, we developed a new selection method, Recursive Effect Elimination.\nFinally, interpretability methods were used to identify the most influential\nvariables. Contrary to expectations, variables related to terrain influence\nwere not found to significantly impact turbulence anisotropy. Instead,\nnon-dimensional groups of common turbulence length, time and velocity scales\nproved more robust than dimensional variables in isolating anisotropy drivers,\nenhancing model performance over complex terrain and reducing location\ndependence. A ratio of integral and turbulence memory length scales was found\nto correlate well with turbulence anisotropy in both daytime and nighttime\nconditions, both over flat and complex terrain.

Models that omit\nmultiple perspectives and data threaten model quality, whether created by\nhumans or with the assistance of AI. To reduce uncertainty about how well AI\ncan build SD models, we introduce two metrics for evaluation of AI-generated\ncausal maps: technical correctness (causal translation) and adherence to\ninstructions (conformance).\n  Approach: We developed an open source project called sd-ai to provide a basis\nfor collaboration in the SD community, aiming to fully harness the potential of\nAI based tools like ChatGPT for dynamic modeling. Additionally, we created an\nevaluation theory along with a comprehensive suite of tests designed to\nevaluate any such tools developed within the sd-ai ecosystem.\n  Results: We tested 11 different LLMs on their ability to do causal\ntranslation as well as conform to user instruction. gpt-4.5-preview was the top\nperformer, scoring 92.9% overall, excelling in both tasks. o1 scored 100% in\ncausal translation. gpt-4o identified all causal links but struggled with\npositive polarity in decreasing terms. While gpt-4.5-preview and o1 are most\naccurate, gpt-4o is the cheapest.\n  Discussion: Causal translation and conformance tests applied to the sd-ai\nengine reveal significant variations across lLLMs, underscoring the need for\ncontinued evaluation to ensure responsible development of AI tools for dynamic\nmodeling. To address this, an open collaboration among tool developers,\nmodelers, and stakeholders is launched to standardize measures for evaluating\nthe capacity of AI tools to improve the modeling process.",

To help end users without programming background to\nbetter understand the logic of smart contracts, previous studies have proposed\nmodels for automatically translating smart contract source code into their\ncorresponding code summaries. However, in practice, only 13% of smart contracts\ndeployed on the Ethereum blockchain are associated with source code. The\npractical usage of these existing tools is significantly restricted.\nConsidering that bytecode is always necessary when deploying smart contracts,\nin this paper, we first introduce the task of automatically generating smart\ncontract code summaries from bytecode. We propose a novel approach, named\nSmartBT (Smart contract Bytecode Translator) for automatically translating\nsmart contract bytecode into fine-grained natural language description\ndirectly. Two key challenges are posed for this task: structural code logic\nhidden in bytecode and the huge semantic gap between bytecode and natural\nlanguage descriptions. To address the first challenge, we transform bytecode\ninto CFG (Control-Flow Graph) to learn code structural and logic details.\nRegarding the second challenge, we introduce an information retrieval component\nto fetch similar comments for filling the semantic gap. Then the structural\ninput and semantic input are used to build an attentional sequence-to-sequence\nneural network model. The copy mechanism is employed to copy rare words\ndirectly from similar comments and the coverage mechanism is employed to\neliminate repetitive outputs. The automatic evaluation results show that\nSmartBT outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, and the human\nevaluation results show the effectiveness and potential of SmartBT in producing\nmeaningful and accurate comments for smart contract code from bytecode\ndirectly.",

To address these challenges, we\npropose DeepMesh, a framework that optimizes mesh generation through two key\ninnovations: (1) an efficient pre-training strategy incorporating a novel\ntokenization algorithm, along with improvements in data curation and\nprocessing, and (2) the introduction of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into 3D\nmesh generation to achieve human preference alignment via Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO). We design a scoring standard that combines human evaluation\nwith 3D metrics to collect preference pairs for DPO, ensuring both visual\nappeal and geometric accuracy. Conditioned on point clouds and images, DeepMesh\ngenerates meshes with intricate details and precise topology, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods in both precision and quality.

While offering powerful tools that enhance convenience,\nthey also pose significant social concerns. As defenders, current synthetic\nimage detection methods often lack artifact-level textual interpretability and\nare overly focused on image manipulation detection, and current datasets\nusually suffer from outdated generators and a lack of fine-grained annotations.\nIn this paper, we introduce SynthScars, a high-quality and diverse dataset\nconsisting of 12,236 fully synthetic images with human-expert annotations. It\nfeatures 4 distinct image content types, 3 categories of artifacts, and\nfine-grained annotations covering pixel-level segmentation, detailed textual\nexplanations, and artifact category labels. Furthermore, we propose LEGION\n(LEarning to Ground and explain for Synthetic Image detectiON), a multimodal\nlarge language model (MLLM)-based image forgery analysis framework that\nintegrates artifact detection, segmentation, and explanation. Building upon\nthis capability, we further explore LEGION as a controller, integrating it into\nimage refinement pipelines to guide the generation of higher-quality and more\nrealistic images. Extensive experiments show that LEGION outperforms existing\nmethods across multiple benchmarks, particularly surpassing the second-best\ntraditional expert on SynthScars by 3.31% in mIoU and 7.75% in F1 score.\nMoreover, the refined images generated under its guidance exhibit stronger\nalignment with human preferences.

The\nstate-of-the-art methods have unsatisfactory error rates or computation times.\nTo address these outstanding issues, we propose new maximum likelihood\nestimation (MLE) and maximum a posterior estimation (MAPE) based device\nactivity detection methods for known and unknown pathloss that achieve superior\nerror rate and computation time tradeoffs using optimization and deep learning\ntechniques. Specifically, we investigate four non-convex optimization problems\nfor MLE and MAPE in the two pathloss cases, with one MAPE problem being\nformulated for the first time. For each non-convex problem, we develop an\ninnovative parallel iterative algorithm using the parallel successive convex\napproximation (PSCA) method. Each PSCA-based algorithm allows parallel\ncomputations, uses up to the objective function's second-order information,\nconverges to the problem's stationary points, and has a low per-iteration\ncomputational complexity compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Then, for\neach PSCA-based iterative algorithm, we present a deep unrolling neural network\nimplementation, called PSCA-Net, to further reduce the computation time. Each\nPSCA-Net elegantly marries the underlying PSCA-based algorithm's parallel\ncomputation mechanism with the parallelizable neural network architecture and\neffectively optimizes its step sizes based on vast data samples to speed up the\nconvergence.

    "abstract": "Analyzing violations of forwarding properties is a classic networking\nproblem. However, existing work is either tailored to the steady state -- and\nnot to transient states during iBGP convergence -- or does analyze transient\nviolations but with inaccurate proxies, like control-plane convergence, or\nwithout precise control over the different impact factors.\n  We address this gap with a measurement framework that controllably and\naccurately measures transient violation times in realistic network deployments.\nThe framework relies on a programmable switch to flexibly emulate diverse\ntopologies and gain traffic visibility at all links -- enabling accurately\ninferring violation times of any forwarding property. Using the framework, we\nanalyze 50 network scenarios on a topology with 12 real routers, and show how\nfactors like the network configuration and BGP event affect transient violation\ntimes. Further, we shed light on less-known aspects of BGP convergence,\nincluding that transient violations can start before the trigger event, or that\nkeeping a backup route advertised at all times can increase violation times.",

    "abstract": "Neglecting non-functional requirements (NFRs) early in software development\ncan lead to critical challenges. Despite their importance, NFRs are often\noverlooked or difficult to identify, impacting software quality. To support\nrequirements engineers in eliciting NFRs, we developed a framework that\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive quality-driven NFRs from\nfunctional requirements (FRs). Using a custom prompting technique within a\nDeno-based pipeline, the system identifies relevant quality attributes for each\nfunctional requirement and generates corresponding NFRs, aiding systematic\nintegration. A crucial aspect is evaluating the quality and suitability of\nthese generated requirements. Can LLMs produce high-quality NFR suggestions?\nUsing 34 functional requirements - selected as a representative subset of 3,964\nFRs-the LLMs inferred applicable attributes based on the ISO/IEC 25010:2023\nstandard, generating 1,593 NFRs. A horizontal evaluation covered three\ndimensions: NFR validity, applicability of quality attributes, and\nclassification precision. Ten industry software quality evaluators, averaging\n13 years of experience, assessed a subset for relevance and quality. The\nevaluation showed strong alignment between LLM-generated NFRs and expert\nassessments, with median validity and applicability scores of 5.0 (means: 4.63\nand 4.59, respectively) on a 1-5 scale. In the classification task, 80.4% of\nLLM-assigned attributes matched expert choices, with 8.3% near misses and 11.3%\nmismatches. A comparative analysis of eight LLMs highlighted variations in\nperformance, with gemini-1.5-pro exhibiting the highest attribute accuracy,\nwhile llama-3.3-70B achieved higher validity and applicability scores. These\nfindings provide insights into the feasibility of using LLMs for automated NFR\ngeneration and lay the foundation for further exploration of AI-assisted\nrequirements engineering.",

By considering correlations within in the radar\nsignal due to closely spaced objects and jointly estimating nuisance\nparameters, the proposed method achieves robust performance for close-by\nobjects and in low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Our numerical\nevaluation based on MIMO-radar signals demonstrate that our VMP-based\ndirect-MOT method outperforms a detect-then-track (DTT) pipeline comprising a\nsuper-resolution sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based estimation stage followed\nby classical MOT using global nearest neighbour data association and a Kalman\nfilter.",

The\nmodel further predicts a linear dependence of the photocurrent versus anodic\nvoltage, an observation whose origin has been strongly debated in the\nliterature in the case of hematite photoanodes.

It searches for the ground state of the Ising model,\nwhich corresponds to the optimal solution of a given combinatorial optimization\nproblem. The guiding principle of quantum annealing is the adiabatic theorem in\nquantum mechanics, which guarantees that a system remains in the ground state\nof its Hamiltonian if the time evolution is sufficiently slow. According to the\nadiabatic theorem, the runtime required for quantum annealing to satisfy the\nadiabaticity scales is inverse to the square of the minimum energy gap between\nthe ground state and the first excited state during time evolution. As a\nresult, finding the ground state becomes significantly more difficult when the\nenergy gap is small, creating a major bottleneck in quantum annealing.\nExpanding the energy gap is one strategy to improve the performance of quantum\nannealing; however, its implementation in actual hardware remains challenging.\nThis study proposes a method for efficiently solving instances with small\nenergy gaps by introducing additional local terms to the Hamiltonian and\nexploiting the diabatic transition remaining in the small energy gap. The\nproposed method achieves an approximate square speed up in time-to-solution\ncompared to the conventional quantum annealing.

However, the two leading measurement techniques for the\nneutron lifetime currently yield incompatible results, a discrepancy referred\nto as the neutron lifetime puzzle. To address the systematic uncertainties\narising from neutron interactions with material walls, the $\\tau$SPECT\nexperiment employs a fully magnetic trap for ultra-cold neutrons (UCNs).\n  UCNs are extremely low-energy neutrons with typical velocities below\n$8\\,\\textrm{m/s}$, which can be manipulated using magnetic fields, gravity, and\nsuitable material guides, whose surface can reflect them at any angle of\nincidence. To precisely study and characterize UCN behavior during production,\nguidance, storage, and detection in $\\tau$SPECT, we have developed a dedicated\nsimulation framework. This framework is built upon the externally developed UCN\nMonte Carlo software package PENTrack and is enhanced with two companion tools:\none for flexible and parametrizable upstream configuration of PENTrack such\nthat the simulation's input settings can be adjusted to reproduce the\nexperimental observations. The second package is used for analyzing,\nvisualizing, and animating simulation data.\n  The simulation results align well with experimental data obtained with\n$\\tau$SPECT at the Paul Scherrer Institute and serve as a powerful resource for\nidentifying systematic uncertainties and guiding future improvements to the\ncurrent experimental setup.",

We develop a comprehensive analysis pipeline that\nenables us to detect beacon scanning capabilities, inject wireless events to\ntrigger app behaviors, and monitor runtime execution on instrumented devices.\nOur findings show that 86% of apps integrating these SDKs collect at least one\nsensitive data type, including device and user identifiers such as AAID, email,\nalong with GPS coordinates, WiFi and Bluetooth scan results. We uncover\nwidespread SDK-to-SDK data sharing and evidence of ID bridging, where\npersistent and resettable identifiers are shared and synchronized within SDKs\nembedded in applications to potentially construct detailed mobility profiles,\ncompromising user anonymity and enabling long-term tracking. We provide\nevidence of key actors engaging in these practices and conclude by proposing\nmitigation strategies such as stronger SDK sandboxing, stricter enforcement of\nplatform policies, and improved transparency mechanisms to limit unauthorized\ntracking.",

    "abstract": "Different annotators often assign different labels to the same sample due to\nbackgrounds or preferences, and such labeling patterns are referred to as\ntendency. In multi-annotator scenarios, we introduce a novel task called\nMulti-annotator Tendency Learning (MATL), which aims to capture each annotator\ntendency. Unlike traditional tasks that prioritize consensus-oriented learning,\nwhich averages out annotator differences and leads to tendency information\nloss, MATL emphasizes learning each annotator tendency, better preserves\ntendency information. To this end, we propose an efficient baseline method,\nQuery-based Multi-annotator Tendency Learning (QuMATL), which uses lightweight\nquery to represent each annotator for tendency modeling. It saves the costs of\nbuilding separate conventional models for each annotator, leverages shared\nlearnable queries to capture inter-annotator correlations as an additional\nhidden supervisory signal to enhance modeling performance. Meanwhile, we\nprovide a new metric, Difference of Inter-annotator Consistency (DIC), to\nevaluate how effectively models preserve annotators tendency information.\nAdditionally, we contribute two large-scale datasets, STREET and AMER,\nproviding averages of 4300 and 3118 per-annotator labels, respectively.\nExtensive experiments verified the effectiveness of our QuMATL.",

    "abstract": "Explainability is a critical factor influencing the wide deployment of deep\nvision models (DVMs). Concept-based post-hoc explanation methods can provide\nboth global and local insights into model decisions. However, current methods\nin this field face challenges in that they are inflexible to automatically\nconstruct accurate and sufficient linguistic explanations for global concepts\nand local circuits. Particularly, the intrinsic polysemanticity in semantic\nVisual Concepts (VCs) impedes the interpretability of concepts and DVMs, which\nis underestimated severely. In this paper, we propose a Chain-of-Explanation\n(CoE) approach to address these issues. Specifically, CoE automates the\ndecoding and description of VCs to construct global concept explanation\ndatasets. Further, to alleviate the effect of polysemanticity on model\nexplainability, we design a concept polysemanticity disentanglement and\nfiltering mechanism to distinguish the most contextually relevant concept\natoms. Besides, a Concept Polysemanticity Entropy (CPE), as a measure of model\ninterpretability, is formulated to quantify the degree of concept uncertainty.\nThe modeling of deterministic concepts is upgraded to uncertain concept atom\ndistributions. Finally, CoE automatically enables linguistic local explanations\nof the decision-making process of DVMs by tracing the concept circuit. GPT-4o\nand human-based experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CPE and the\nsuperiority of CoE, achieving an average absolute improvement of 36% in terms\nof explainability scores.",

To bridge this gap, we take an initial\nstep to study this unexplored yet practical setting - when developers code with\na less common library, they often refer to its API documentation; likewise,\nwhen LLMs are allowed to look up API documentation via RAG, to what extent can\nLLMs be advanced? To mimic such a setting, we select four less common\nopen-source Python libraries with a total of 1017 eligible APIs.

The most popular benchmarks for automated issue solving are\nSWE-bench and its human-filtered subset SWE-bench Verified. These benchmarks\nleverage testing to validate generated patches. However, because testing is\nrarely exhaustive, a patch may pass the tests but nevertheless fail to match\nthe developers' expectations. Unfortunately, it is currently unclear to what\nextent evaluations performed with SWE-bench suffer from such plausible but\nincorrect patches. This paper presents an in-depth empirical study of the\ncorrectness of plausible patches generated by three state-of-the-art\nissue-solving tools evaluated on SWE-bench Verified. We extensively test and\ninspect generated patches, and compare them against human-written ground truth\npatches. The core of our methodology is a novel technique PatchDiff for\ndifferential patch testing, which automatically exposes behavioral\ndiscrepancies between two patches. Our findings reveal critical weaknesses in\nSWE-bench's patch validation mechanism, which causes 7.8% of all patches to\ncount as correct while failing the developer-written test suite. Moreover, our\nnovel automated technique reveals that even more (29.6%) plausible patches\ninduce different behavior than the ground truth patches. These behavioral\ndifferences are often due to similar, but divergent implementations (46.8%) and\ndue to generated patches that adapt more behavior than the ground truth patches\n(27.3%). Our manual inspection shows that 28.6% of behaviorally divergent\npatches are certainly incorrect. Combined, the different weaknesses lead to an\ninflation of reported resolution rates by 6.2 absolute percent points.

We investigate whether this popularity aligns with actual\nmodel performance and how the comprehensiveness of model documentation\ncorrelates with both popularity and performance. In our study, we evaluated a\ncomprehensive set of 500 Sentiment Analysis models on Hugging Face. This\nevaluation involved massive annotation efforts, with human annotators\ncompleting nearly 80,000 annotations, alongside extensive model training and\nevaluation. Our findings reveal that model popularity does not necessarily\ncorrelate with performance. Additionally, we identify critical inconsistencies\nin model card reporting: approximately 80% of the models analyzed lack detailed\ninformation about the model, training, and evaluation processes. Furthermore,\nabout 88% of model authors overstate their models' performance in the model\ncards. Based on our findings, we provide a checklist of guidelines for users to\nchoose good models for downstream tasks.",

While significant advances\nhave been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from\nelectronic health records, the potential of foundation models for patient\nbehavior monitoring through personal digital devices remains underexplored. The\ndata generated by these devices are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and\noften exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper\nintroduces a novel foundation model based on a modified vector quantized\nvariational autoencoder, specifically designed to process real-world data from\nsmartphones and wearable devices. We leveraged the discrete latent\nrepresentation of this model to effectively perform two downstream tasks,\nsuicide risk assessment and emotional state prediction, on different held-out\nclinical cohorts without the need of fine-tuning.

The splittings of the masses of the $D-\\bar D$ ($B-\\bar B)$,\nas well as $D_s-\\bar {D_s} (B_s-\\bar {B_s})$ in the hadronic medium are due to\nthe odd part of the spectral function.

Currently, many studies focus on\nimproving either generalization or robustness in isolation, without methods\naddressing both aspects simultaneously, which presents a significant challenge\nin developing LMs that are both robust and generalized. In this paper, we\npropose a bi-stage optimization framework to uniformly enhance both the\ngeneralization and robustness of LMs, termed UEGR. Specifically, during the\nforward propagation stage, we enrich the output probability distributions of\nadversarial samples by adaptive dropout to generate diverse sub models, and\nincorporate JS divergence and adversarial losses of these output distributions\nto reinforce output stability. During backward propagation stage, we compute\nparameter saliency scores and selectively update only the most critical\nparameters to minimize unnecessary deviations and consolidate the model's\nresilience. Theoretical analysis shows that our framework includes gradient\nregularization to limit the model's sensitivity to input perturbations and\nselective parameter updates to flatten the loss landscape, thus improving both\ngeneralization and robustness. The experimental results show that our method\nsignificantly improves the generalization and robustness of LMs compared to\nother existing methods across 13 publicly available language datasets,\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.",

Our method leverages the\ngeneralized distance-weighted discriminant technique, making it robust to both\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions across clients. In particular,\nwe develop a new optimization algorithm based on the Majorization-Minimization\nprinciple, integrated with a renewable estimation procedure, enabling efficient\nmodel updates without full retraining. We provide a theoretical guarantee for\nthe convergence of our estimator, proving its consistency and asymptotic\nnormality under standard regularity conditions. In addition, we establish that\nour method achieves Bayesian risk consistency, ensuring its reliability for\nclassification tasks in federated environments.

However, conventional NN architectures, despite their widespread\nadoption in state-of-the-art methods, primarily function as black-box problem\nsolvers. This lack of interpretability significantly limits their capacity to\nextract and convey meaningful insights into learned data patterns, posing a\nmajor barrier to their broader adoption in critical modeling tasks. This work\nintroduces, for the first time, Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) for the\ntransistor - a groundbreaking NN architecture that seamlessly integrates\ninterpretability with high precision in physics-based function modeling. We\nsystematically evaluate the performance of KAN and Fourier KAN for FinFET\ncompact modeling, benchmarking them against the golden industry-standard\ncompact model and the widely used MLP architecture. Our results reveal that KAN\nand FKAN consistently achieve superior prediction accuracy for critical figures\nof merit, including gate current, drain charge, and source charge. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate and improve the unique ability of KAN to derive symbolic\nformulas from learned data patterns - a capability that not only enhances\ninterpretability but also facilitates in-depth transistor analysis and\noptimization. This work highlights the transformative potential of KAN in\nbridging the gap between interpretability and precision in NN-driven transistor\ncompact modeling.

To address this, we propose DiST-4D,\nthe first disentangled spatiotemporal diffusion framework for 4D driving scene\ngeneration, which leverages metric depth as the core geometric representation.\nDiST-4D decomposes the problem into two diffusion processes: DiST-T, which\npredicts future metric depth and multi-view RGB sequences directly from past\nobservations, and DiST-S, which enables spatial NVS by training only on\nexisting viewpoints while enforcing cycle consistency. This cycle consistency\nmechanism introduces a forward-backward rendering constraint, reducing the\ngeneralization gap between observed and unseen viewpoints. Metric depth is\nessential for both accurate reliable forecasting and accurate spatial NVS, as\nit provides a view-consistent geometric representation that generalizes well to\nunseen perspectives.

We show that these come canonically equipped with a structure\nof a $2$-periodic crystal of categories (\\ie an action of the dg-category of\n$2$-periodic $D$-modules on $X$) compatible with a relative Thom--Sebastiani\ntheorem expressing the equivariance under the action of quadratic bundles.\n  As our main theorem we show that the locally defined categories\n$MF^\\infty(U,f)$ can be glued along $X$ as a sheaf of crystals of 2-periodic\ndg-categories ``up to isotopy'', under the prescription of orientation data\ncontrolled by three obstruction classes. This result generalizes the gluing of\nthe Joyce's perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles and partially answers\nconjectures by Kontsevich--Soibelman and Toda in motivic Donaldson--Thomas\ntheory.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in\nsynthesis tasks; however, there is a growing concern about their potential\nmisuse in creating harmful content. To mitigate these risks, post-hoc model\nintervention techniques, such as concept unlearning and safety guidance, have\nbeen developed. However, fine-tuning model weights or adapting the hidden\nstates of the diffusion model operates in an uninterpretable way, making it\nunclear which part of the intermediate variables is responsible for unsafe\ngeneration. These interventions severely affect the sampling trajectory when\nerasing harmful concepts from complex, multi-concept prompts, thus hindering\ntheir practical use in real-world settings. In this work, we propose the safe\ngeneration framework Detect-and-Guide (DAG), leveraging the internal knowledge\nof diffusion models to perform self-diagnosis and fine-grained self-regulation\nduring the sampling process. DAG first detects harmful concepts from noisy\nlatents using refined cross-attention maps of optimized tokens, then applies\nsafety guidance with adaptive strength and editing regions to negate unsafe\ngeneration. The optimization only requires a small annotated dataset and can\nprovide precise detection maps with generalizability and concept specificity.\nMoreover, DAG does not require fine-tuning of diffusion models, and therefore\nintroduces no loss to their generation diversity. Experiments on erasing sexual\ncontent show that DAG achieves state-of-the-art safe generation performance,\nbalancing harmfulness mitigation and text-following performance on\nmulti-concept real-world prompts.",

Observability estimations and characterisation of\nthe atmospheric emission of 55 Cnc e have mostly remained limited to low\nspectral resolution space-based studies. Here, we aim to examine ground-based\nhigh-resolution observabilities of a diverse set of mineral atmospheres\nproduced across a grid of mantle $f$O$_2$s varying over 12 orders of magnitude.\nWe assume a Bulk Silicate Earth mantle composition and a substellar dayside\ntemperature of T = 2500K in the near infrared wavelength (NIR) region. This\nspectral range is often featureless for this class of atmospheres at\nlow-resolution. Coupling our newly developed simulator for synthesising\nrealistic observations from high-resolution ground-based spectrographs (Ratri)\nto a pre-developed high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS)\nanalysis pipeline (Upamana), we find that this array of mineral atmospheres\nwould all be detectable with 11 hours of observing time of the dayside of 55\nCnc e with CARMENES and each individual scenario can be correctly\ndifferentiated within 1$\\sigma$.

While transformer-based models have shown promise in time series\nanalysis, most are designed for forecasting tasks and fail to fully exploit the\nunique characteristics of MedTS. In this paper, we introduce MedSpaformer, a\ntransformer-based framework tailored for MedTS classification. It incorporates\na sparse token-based dual-attention mechanism that enables global context\nmodeling and token sparsification, allowing dynamic feature refinement by\nfocusing on informative tokens while reducing redundancy. This mechanism is\nintegrated into a multi-granularity cross-channel encoding scheme to capture\nintra- and inter-granularity temporal dependencies and inter-channel\ncorrelations, enabling progressive refinement of task-relevant patterns in\nmedical signals. The sparsification design allows our model to flexibly\naccommodate inputs with variable lengths and channel dimensions. We also\nintroduce an adaptive label encoder to extract label semantics and address\ncross-dataset label space misalignment. Together, these components enhance the\nmodel's transferability across heterogeneous medical datasets, which helps\nalleviate the challenge of label scarcity. Our model outperforms 13 baselines\nacross 7 medical datasets under supervised learning. It also excels in few-shot\nlearning and demonstrates zero-shot capability in both in-domain and\ncross-domain diagnostics.

Low-mass galaxies have low baryonic fractions which\nincrease to a maximum for masses near $10^{12}\\ M_{\\odot}$, and decreases\nthereafter with increasing galaxy mass. This trend is generally attributed to\nthe action of feedback from star formation at the low end and of active\ngalactic nuclei at the high-mass end. An alternative is that the baryonic\nfraction is at least partially due to the ability of galaxies to competitively\naccrete gas in a group or clustered environment. Most galaxies in a group\nincluding those of lower masses, orbit the cluster centre at significant speeds\nand hence their accretion is limited by a Bondi-Hoyle type process,\n$\\dot{M}_{acc} \\propto M_{DM}^2$. In contrast, the few high-mass galaxies\nreside in the core of the cluster and accrete in a tidal accretion process,\n$\\dot{M}_{acc} \\propto M_{DM}^{2/3}$. These two mechanisms result in a baryonic\nmass fraction that increases as $M_{DM}$ at low masses and decreases as\n$M_{DM}^{-1/3}$ at high masses.

Deep Learning offers promising\nsolutions. BirdNET, a widely used bird identification model, has shown success\nin many study systems but is limited at local scale due to biases in its\ntraining data, which focus on specific locations and target sounds rather than\nentire soundscapes. A key challenge in bird species identification is that many\nrecordings either lack target species or contain overlapping vocalizations,\ncomplicating automatic identification. To address these problems, we developed\na multi-stage pipeline for automatic bird vocalization identification in\nDo\\~nana National Park (SW Spain), a wetland of high conservation concern. We\ndeployed AudioMoth recorders in three main habitats across nine locations and\nmanually annotated 461 minutes of audio, resulting in 3749 labeled segments\nspanning 34 classes. We first applied a Bird Song Detector to isolate bird\nvocalizations using spectrogram-based image processing. Then, species were\nclassified using custom models trained at the local scale.

The turnover in the quenching\ntimescale as a function of stellar mass is a direct consequence of the maximum\nin the star formation efficiency (or equivalently the minimum in the total --\nstellar plus AGN -- feedback efficiency) at the same stellar mass. We can\ndiscern the direct stripping of the ISM by ram pressure and/or tides in the\nsimulations; these mechanisms modulate the quenching timescale but do not drive\nits overall scaling with satellite stellar mass.

For many practical\napplications, it is crucial to access the full distribution of possible states,\nfrom which relevant statistics (e.g., RMS and two-point correlations) can be\nderived. Here, we propose a graph-based latent diffusion (or alternatively,\nflow-matching) model that enables direct sampling of states from their\nequilibrium distribution, given a mesh discretization of the system and its\nphysical parameters. This allows for the efficient computation of flow\nstatistics without running long and expensive numerical simulations. The\ngraph-based structure enables operations on unstructured meshes, which is\ncritical for representing complex geometries with spatially localized high\ngradients, while latent-space diffusion modeling with a multi-scale GNN allows\nfor efficient learning and inference of entire distributions of solutions. A\nkey finding is that the proposed networks can accurately learn full\ndistributions even when trained on incomplete data from relatively short\nsimulations. We apply this method to a range of fluid dynamics tasks, such as\npredicting pressure distributions on 3D wing models in turbulent flow,\ndemonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency in challenging\nscenarios.

We\nsystematically compare various machine learning algorithms, including Linear\nRegression, Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM, on a\ncomprehensive food delivery dataset specific to Indian urban contexts.

Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieves\nsuperior predictive accuracy, with an R2 score of 0.76 and Mean Squared Error\n(MSE) of 20.59, outperforming traditional baseline approaches. Our study thus\nprovides actionable insights for improving logistics strategies in complex\nurban environments.

We develop a decoupled majorization minimization (DMM)\nalgorithm to solve the proposed multi-constrained optimization problem. In\ncontrast to the existing approaches, the proposed algorithm transforms the\ndifficult optimization problem involving two variables into two parallel\nsub-problems with one variable, thus significantly speeding up the convergence\nrate. Furthermore, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is introduced to compute the\nclosed-form solution of each sub-problem, giving rise to a greatly reduced\ncomputation complexity.

This problem inherently\nincludes highly nonlinear and nonconvex aspects due to gas physics, and\ndiscrete aspects due to the control decisions of active network elements.\nObtaining even locally optimal solutions for this problem presents significant\nmathematical and computational challenges for system operators. In this paper,\nwe formulate the gas transportation and storage problem as a nonconvex\nmixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) through disjunctions on the flow\ndirections. Moreover, we study the nonconvex sets induced by gas physics and\npropose mixed-integer second-order cone programming relaxations for the\nnonconvex MINLP problem. The proposed relaxations are based on the convex hull\nrepresentations of two nonconvex sets: Firstly, we give the convex hull\nrepresentation of the nonconvex set for pipes and show that it is second-order\ncone representable. Secondly, we also give a complete characterization of the\nextreme points of the nonconvex set for compressors and show that the convex\nhull of the extreme points is power cone representable. Moreover, for practical\napplications, we propose a second-order cone outer-approximation for the\nnonconvex set for compressors. To obtain (near) globally optimal solutions, we\ndevelop an algorithmic framework based on our convex hull results. We evaluate\nour framework through extensive computational experiments on various GasLib\nnetworks in comparison with the convex relaxations from the literature and a\nstate-of-the-art global solver. Our results highlight the computational\nefficiency and convergence performance of our convex relaxation method compared\nto other methods. Moreover, our method also consistently provides (near) global\nsolutions as well as high-quality warm-starting points for local solvers.",

    "abstract": "Object-centric representation learning has recently been successfully applied\nto real-world datasets. This success can be attributed to pretrained\nnon-object-centric foundation models, whose features serve as reconstruction\ntargets for slot attention. However, targets must remain frozen throughout the\ntraining, which sets an upper bound on the performance object-centric models\ncan attain. Attempts to update the target encoder by bootstrapping result in\nlarge performance drops, which can be attributed to its lack of object-centric\ninductive biases, causing the object-centric model's encoder to drift away from\nrepresentations useful as reconstruction targets. To address these limitations,\nwe propose Object-CEntric Pretraining by Target Encoder BOotstrapping, a\nself-distillation setup for training object-centric models from scratch, on\nreal-world data, for the first time ever. In OCEBO, the target encoder is\nupdated as an exponential moving average of the object-centric model, thus\nexplicitly being enriched with object-centric inductive biases introduced by\nslot attention while removing the upper bound on performance present in other\nmodels. We mitigate the slot collapse caused by random initialization of the\ntarget encoder by introducing a novel cross-view patch filtering approach that\nlimits the supervision to sufficiently informative patches. When pretrained on\n241k images from COCO, OCEBO achieves unsupervised object discovery performance\ncomparable to that of object-centric models with frozen non-object-centric\ntarget encoders pretrained on hundreds of millions of images.

CCA identifies hidden\nlinks by deriving linear projections of features maximally correlating\ndatasets. For standard CCA, observations must be independent of each other.

This approach addresses the\ncorrelation of repeated measurements while drawing latent paths, focusing on\ndynamics in the correlation structures. To aid interpretability and\ncomputational efficiency, we implement a penalty to enforce fixed sparsity\nlevels.\n  We estimate these trajectories fitting longitudinal models to the low\ndimensional latent variables, leveraging the clustered structure of high\ndimensional datasets, thus exploring shared longitudinal latent mechanisms.\nFurthermore, modeling time in the latent space significantly reduces\ncomputational burden. We validate our models performance using simulated data\nand show its real world applicability with data from the Human Microbiome\nProject.\n  Our CCA method for repeated measurements enables efficient estimation of\ncanonical correlations across measurements for clustered data.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, pose a\ngrowing global health burden. Prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) has emerged as a\npotential therapeutic target in these diseases. Recent studies have shown that\ndirect interaction between PREP and pathological proteins, such as\n$\\alpha$-synuclein and Tau, influences protein aggregation and neuronal\nfunction. While most known PREP inhibitors primarily target its enzymatic\nfunctions, a new class of ligands, known as HUPs, specifically modulates\nprotein-protein interactions (PPIs), which are crucial in neurodegenerative\ndiseases. These structurally distinct ligands exhibit diverse binding\nbehaviors, highlighting the importance of understanding their binding pathways.\nIn this study, we analyzed the binding pathways and stability of diverse\nligands using molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling techniques.\nTraditional inhibitors, such as KYP-2047, target the active site between the\ncatalytic domains of PREP and the $\\beta$-propeller domain, while HUP ligands\nbind to alternative regions, such as the hinge site, potentially disrupting\nnon-enzymatic PPIs. We demonstrated that structural variations among ligands\nlead to distinct binding and unbinding pathways. Free-energy profiles from\numbrella sampling revealed key kinetic bottlenecks and differences in pathways.\nFor example, HUP-55 exhibits pathway hopping, characterized by diffuse\nexploration of binding regions before selecting an exit, while KYP-2047 prefers\nthe central tunnel of the $\\beta$-propeller domain even under perturbations.\nThese results suggest that the dynamic interaction between ligands and PREP\nplays a critical role in their mechanism. The ability of HUPs to interact with\nmultiple binding sites and adapt to PREP's conformational changes may be\nessential for their PPI-targeting effects.",

(2) Visual Inconsistency:\nExisting approaches struggle with maintaining visual consistency across shots.\nOur identity-aware cross-shot propagation generates identity-preserving\nportrait (IPP) tokens that maintain character fidelity while allowing trait\nvariations (expressions, aging) dictated by the storyline. (3) Transition\nArtifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent\ntransition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process\nadjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow\nwhile preserving narrative continuity.

To address this, we propose a Text-Derived Relational Graph-Enhanced\nNetwork (TRG-Net) that leverages prior graphs generated by Large Language\nModels (LLM) to enhance both modeling and supervision. For modeling, the\nDynamic Spatio-Temporal Fusion Modeling (DSFM) method incorporates Text-Derived\nJoint Graphs (TJG) with channel- and frame-level dynamic adaptation to\neffectively model spatial relations, while integrating spatio-temporal core\nfeatures during temporal modeling. For supervision, the Absolute-Relative\nInter-Class Supervision (ARIS) method employs contrastive learning between\naction features and text embeddings to regularize the absolute class\ndistributions, and utilizes Text-Derived Action Graphs (TAG) to capture the\nrelative inter-class relationships among action features.

A critical bottleneck is selecting the most\nrelevant data to maximize task-specific performance. Existing data selection\napproaches include unstable influence-based methods and more stable\ndistribution alignment methods, the latter of which critically rely on the\nunderlying sample representation. In practice, most distribution alignment\nmethods, from shallow features (e.g., BM25) to neural embeddings (e.g., BGE,\nLLM2Vec), may fail to capture how the model internally processes samples. To\nbridge this gap, we adopt a model-centric strategy in which each sample is\nrepresented by its neuronal activation pattern in the model, directly\nreflecting internal computation. However, directly using raw neuron activations\nleads to spurious similarity between unrelated samples due to neuron\npolysemanticity, where a single neuron may respond to multiple, unrelated\nconcepts. To address this, we employ sparse autoencoders to disentangle\npolysemantic activations into sparse, monosemantic representations, and\nintroduce a dedicated similarity metric for this space to better identify\ntask-relevant data. Comprehensive experiments across multiple instruction\ndatasets, models, tasks, and selection ratios show that our approach\nconsistently outperforms existing data selection baselines in both stability\nand task-specific performance.",

Thus, this `food' given to the\nalgorithm have to be repaired in order to produce unbiased results for all. As\na simple, but frequent case, two different subgroups will be considered, the\nprivileged and the unprivileged groups. Assuming that results should not depend\non such characteristic dividing the data, the rest of attributes in each group\nhave to be moved (transported) so that its underlying distribution can be\nconsidered similar.

Through causal\ninterventions, we trace and determine which neuron hidden states are essential\nfor the prediction of the model. By performing interventions and restorations\non each component of an LLM, we identify the importance of these components for\naspect-based sentiment classification. Our findings reveal that a distinct set\nof mid-layer representations is essential for detecting the sentiment polarity\nof given aspect words. Leveraging these insights, we develop a model editing\napproach that focuses exclusively on these critical parts of the LLM, leading\nto a more efficient method for adapting LLMs. Our in-domain and out-of-domain\nexperiments demonstrate that this approach achieves competitive results\ncompared to the currently strongest methods with significantly fewer trainable\nparameters, highlighting a more efficient and interpretable fine-tuning\nstrategy.",

Until now,\nthis dichotomy is established for the major meteorite groups, representing\nabout 36 distinct parent bodies. Ungrouped meteorites represent an even larger\nnumber of additional and so far mostly unexplored parent bodies. Here, the\ngenetics and chronology of 26 ungrouped iron meteorites are investigated. The\nungrouped irons confirm the NC-CC dichotomy for Mo, where NC and CC meteorites\ndefine two distinct, subparallel s-process mixing lines. All ungrouped NC irons\nfall on the NC-line, which is now precisely defined for 41 distinct parent\nbodies. The ungrouped CC irons show scatter around the CC-line indicative of\nsmall r-process Mo heterogeneities among these samples. These r-process Mo\nisotope variations correlate with O isotope anomalies, most likely reflecting\nmixing of CI chondrite-like matrix, chondrule precursors and Ca-Al-rich\ninclusions. This implies that CC iron meteorite parent bodies accreted the same\nnebular components as the later-formed carbonaceous chondrites. The Hf-W model\nages of core formation for the ungrouped irons reveal a narrow age peak at ~3.3\nMa after Ca-Al-rich inclusions for the CC irons. By contrast, the NC irons\ndisplay more variable ages, including younger ages indicative of impact-induced\nmelting events, which seem absent among the CC irons. This is attributed to the\nmore fragile and porous nature of the CC bodies, making impact-induced melting\non their surfaces difficult. The chemical characteristics of all iron\nmeteorites together reveal slightly more oxidizing conditions during core\nformation for CC compared to NC irons. More strikingly, strong depletions in\nmoderately volatile elements, typical of many iron meteorite parent bodies,\npredominantly occur among CC irons.",

Recent efforts typically adopt the Masked Video\nModeling (MVM) paradigm, leading to significant progress on multiple video\ntasks.

To address these challenges jointly, we propose a\nself-supervised framework that leverages Temporal Correspondence for video\nRepresentation learning (T-CoRe). For challenge 1), we propose a sandwich\nsampling strategy that selects two auxiliary frames to reduce reconstruction\nuncertainty in a two-side-squeezing manner.

    "abstract": "Existing methods for obtaining flat field rely on observed data collected\nunder specific observation conditions to determine the flat field. However, the\ntelescope pointing and the column fixed pattern noise of the CMOS detector\nchange during actual observations, causing residual signals in real time\nobservation data after flat field correction, such as interference fringes and\ncolumn fixed pattern noise. In actual observations, the slight wobble of the\ntelescope caused by the wind leads to shifts in the observed data. In this\npaper, a method of extracting the flat field from the real time solar\nobservation data is proposed. Firstly, the average flat field obtained by\nmulti-frame averaging is used as the initial value. A set of real-time\nobservation data is input into the KLL method to calculate the correction\namount for the average flat field. Secondly, the average flat field is\ncorrected using the calculated correction amount to obtain the real flat field\nfor the current observation conditions. To overcome the residual solar\nstructures caused by atmospheric turbulence in the correction amount, real-time\nobservation data are grouped to calculate the correction amounts. These\nresidual solar structures are suppressed by averaging multiple groups,\nimproving the accuracy of the correction amount. The test results from space\nand ground-based simulated data demonstrate that our method can effectively\ncalculate the correction amount for the average flat field. The NVST 10830 A/Ha\ndata were also tested. High-resolution reconstruction confirms that the\ncorrection amount effectively corrects the average flat field to obtain the\nreal flat field for the current observation conditions. Our method works for\nchromosphere and photosphere data.",

One critical factor is beam density, as inference on sparse,\ncost-effective LiDAR sensors is often preferred in real-world applications.\nDespite previous work addressing the beam-density-induced domain gap,\nsubstantial knowledge gaps remain, particularly concerning dense 128-beam\nsensors in cross-domain scenarios. To gain better understanding of the impact\nof beam density on domain gaps, we conduct a comprehensive investigation that\nincludes an evaluation of different object detection architectures. Our\narchitecture evaluation reveals that combining voxel- and point-based\napproaches yields superior cross-domain performance by leveraging the strengths\nof both representations. Building on these findings, we analyze\nbeam-density-induced domain gaps and argue that these domain gaps must be\nevaluated in conjunction with other domain shifts. Contrary to conventional\nbeliefs, our experiments reveal that detectors benefit from training on denser\ndata and exhibit robustness to beam density variations during inference.",

    "abstract": "Classical Cellular Automata (CCAs) are a powerful computational framework\nwidely used to model complex systems driven by local interactions. Their\nsimplicity lies in the use of a finite set of states and a uniform local rule,\nyet this simplicity leads to rich and diverse dynamical behaviors. CCAs have\nfound applications in numerous scientific fields, including quantum computing,\nbiology, social sciences, and cryptography. However, traditional CCAs assume\ncomplete certainty in the state of all cells, which limits their ability to\nmodel systems with inherent uncertainty. This paper introduces a novel\ngeneralization of CCAs, termed Cellular Automata on Measures (CAMs), which\nextends the classical framework to incorporate probabilistic uncertainty. In\nthis setting, the state of each cell is described by a probability measure, and\nthe local rule operates on configurations of such measures. This generalization\nencompasses the traditional Bernoulli measure framework of CCAs and enables the\nstudy of more complex systems, including those with spatially varying\nprobabilities. We provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for CAMs,\ndemonstrate their applicability through concrete examples, and explore their\npotential to model the dynamics of random graphs. Additionally, we establish\nconnections between CAMs and symbolic dynamics, presenting new avenues for\nresearch in random graph theory. This study lays the groundwork for future\nexploration of CAMs, offering a flexible and robust framework for modeling\nuncertainty in cellular automata and opening new directions for both\ntheoretical analysis and practical applications.",

Following this landmark\nevent, another KN was detected in association with the second-brightest\ngamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, GRB 230307A, and subsequently confirmed\nby observations of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work, we\nconduct an end-to-end simulation to analyze the temporal evolution of the KN AT\n2023vfi associated with GRB 230307A, and constrain the abundances of superheavy\nelements produced. We find that the temporal evolution of AT 2023vfi is similar\nto AT 2017gfo in the first week post-burst. Additionally, the\n\\textit{r}-process nuclide abundances of lanthanide-rich ejecta, derived from\nnumerical relativity simulations of BNS mergers, can also successfully\ninterpret the temporal evolution of the KN with the lanthanide-rich ejecta mass\nof $0.02 M_\\odot$, which is consistent with the mass range of dynamical ejecta\nfrom numerical simulations in literature. Both findings strongly suggest the\nhypothesis that GRB 230307A originated from a BNS merger, similar to AT\n2017gfo. Based on the first time observation of the KN for JWST, we are able to\nconstrain the superheavy elements of another KN following AT 2017gfo. The\npre-radioactive-decay abundances of the superheavy nuclides: $^{222}$Rn,\n$^{223}$Ra, $^{224}$Ra and $^{225}$Ac, are estimated to be at least on the\norder of $1 \\times 10^{-5}$.

Integrating these\napproaches proves challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity between expert\npolicies and human motion datasets. To address this, we introduce StyleLoco, a\nnovel two-stage framework that bridges this gap through a Generative\nAdversarial Distillation (GAD) process.

This approach effectively combines the agility of\nreinforcement learning with the natural fluidity of human-like movements while\nmitigating the instability issues commonly associated with adversarial\ntraining. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we\ndemonstrate that StyleLoco enables humanoid robots to perform diverse\nlocomotion tasks with the precision of expertly trained policies and the\nnatural aesthetics of human motion, successfully transferring styles across\ndifferent movement types while maintaining stable locomotion across a broad\nspectrum of command inputs.",

The origin of these systems is debatable, and most members of\nthis population are poorly characterized. We have compiled all available\nhigh-angular resolution imaging archival data of VWBA systems from large\nground- and space-based telescopes. We measure the astrometric positions of the\nsatellite relative to the primary and analyze the dynamics of the satellites\nusing the Genoid genetic algorithm. Additionally, we use a NEATM thermal model\nto estimate the diameters of two systems, and we model the orbit of Litva's\ninner satellite using photometric lightcurve observations. We determine the\neffective diameters of binary systems Christophedumas and Alconrad to be 4.7 +\n0.4km and 5.2 + 0.3km respectively. We determine new orbital solutions for five\nsystems, Huenna, Litva, (3548) Eurybates, Pauling, and Alconrad. We find a\nsignificantly eccentric best-fit orbital solution for the outer satellite of\nLitva, a moderately eccentric solution for Alconrad, and a nearly circular\nsolution for Pauling. We also confirm previously reported orbital solutions for\n(379) Huenna and Eurybates. It is unlikely that BYORP expansion could be solely\nresponsible for the formation of VWBAs. It is possible that the satellites of\nthese systems were formed through YORP spin-up and then later scattered onto\nvery wide orbits. Additionally, we find that some members of the population are\nunlikely to have formed satellites through YORP spin-up, and a collisional\nformation history is favored. In particular, this applies to VWBAs within large\ndynamical families, or large VWBA systems such as Huenna and NASA's Lucy\nmission target Eurybates.",

By\ninvestigating the radio continuum spectra and maps of the starburst dwarf\ngalaxies, we aim to draw conclusions on their magnetic field strengths and\nconfigurations, as well as the dynamics of cosmic ray (CR) transport. We\nperform a radio continuum polarimetry study of two of the brightest starburst\nIRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS) dwarf galaxies, NGC 3125 and IC 4662.\nBy combining data of the Australian Telescope Compact Array (2.1 GHz) and\nMeerKAT (1.28 GHz), we analyse the underlying emission mechanism and the CR\ntransport in these systems. We find flat spectra in those dwarf galaxies over\nthe entire investigated frequency range, which sharply contrasts with\nobservations of massive spiral galaxies. Because the expected cooling time of\nCR electrons is much shorter than their escape time, we would expect a\nsteepened steady-state CR electron spectrum. The flat observed spectra suggest\na substantial contribution from free-free emission at high frequencies and\nabsorption at low frequencies, which may solve this puzzle.

Wave optics effects, such as\ndiffraction, make the lensing effect sensitive to the structure around the\nFresnel scale, which depends on the gravitational wave frequency and is\ntypically sub-Galactic for realistic observations. Contrary to this common\nlore, we show that wave optics can, in principle, probe matter perturbations\neven below the Fresnel scale. This is achieved by introducing a new quantity\nderived from the amplification factor, which characterizes the lensing effect,\nand analyzing its correlation function. Our results demonstrate that this\nquantity defines an effective Fresnel scale: a characteristic scale that can be\narbitrarily small, even when observational frequencies are bounded. In\npractice, the effective Fresnel scale is constrained by the observation time\n$T$ and is suppressed by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{fT}$ relative to the standard\nFresnel scale at frequency $f$. Nevertheless, it remains significantly smaller\nthan the conventional Fresnel scale for $fT \\gg 1$; for instance, in one-year\nobservations of mHz GWs, the effective Fresnel scale can be as small as 1 pc.\nThis approach opens new avenues for probing the fine-scale structure of the\nuniverse and the nature of dark matter.",

These issues can lead to numerical errors, such as inaccurate\ncrack predictions and potential simulation failure. The proposed framework\nthoroughly analyses the reason for the surface effect by demonstrating that FPD\nexhibits only first order accuracy within a horizon radius (delta) from the\nsurface but introduces residual stresses within a larger range of 2 delta with\nsignificant surface effect. To mitigate this, a divergence formulation of the\nnon-local differential operator (NDO) is applied to enforce a reasonable stress\ngradient within a 2 delta subregion, alongside a traction boundary condition\nconsistent with the divergence of stress. Additionally, a loading balance\ncorrection algorithm is introduced to enhance the conventional explicit time\nintegration process. The model is validated by integrating it with a modified\nhyperbolic-hardening Drucker-Prager model, where the stress integration is\nperformed using the closest point projection method (CMMP).

    "abstract": "While representation learning and generative modeling seek to understand\nvisual data, unifying both domains remains unexplored. Recent Unified\nSelf-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods have started to bridge the gap between\nboth paradigms. However, they rely solely on semantic token reconstruction,\nwhich requires an external tokenizer during training -- introducing a\nsignificant overhead. In this work, we introduce Sorcen, a novel unified SSL\nframework, incorporating a synergic Contrastive-Reconstruction objective. Our\nContrastive objective, \"Echo Contrast\", leverages the generative capabilities\nof Sorcen, eliminating the need for additional image crops or augmentations\nduring training. Sorcen \"generates\" an echo sample in the semantic token space,\nforming the contrastive positive pair. Sorcen operates exclusively on\nprecomputed tokens, eliminating the need for an online token transformation\nduring training, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead.\nExtensive experiments on ImageNet-1k demonstrate that Sorcen outperforms the\nprevious Unified SSL SoTA by 0.4%, 1.48 FID, 1.76%, and 1.53% on linear\nprobing, unconditional image generation, few-shot learning, and transfer\nlearning, respectively, while being 60.8% more efficient. Additionally, Sorcen\nsurpasses previous single-crop MIM SoTA in linear probing and achieves SoTA\nperformance in unconditional image generation, highlighting significant\nimprovements and breakthroughs in Unified SSL models.",

    "abstract": "Massive star formation is associated with energetic processes that may\ninfluence the physics and chemistry of parental molecular clouds and impact\ngalaxy evolution. The high-mass protostar DR21 Main in Cygnus X possesses one\nof the largest and most luminous outflows ever detected in the Galaxy, but the\norigin of its structure and driving mechanisms is still debated. Our aim is to\nspatially resolve the far-infrared line emission from DR21 Main and to\ninvestigate the gas physical conditions, energetics, and current mass loss\nrates along its outflow. Far-infrared SOFIA FIFI-LS spectra covering selected\nhigh-J CO lines, OH, [O I], [CII] and [O III] lines are analyzed across the\nalmost full extent of the DR21 Main outflow using 2.00' x 3.75' mosaic. The\nspatial extent of far-infrared emission follows closely the well-known outflow\ndirection of DR21 Main in case of high-J CO, [O I] 63.18 um, and the OH line at\n163.13 um. On the contrary, the emission from the [C II] 157.74 um and [O I]\n145.53 um lines arises mostly from the eastern part of the outflow, and it is\nlikely linked with a photodissociation region. Comparison of non-LTE radiative\ntransfer models with the observed [O I] line ratios suggest H2 densities of\n~10^5 cm^(-3) in the western part of the outflow and ~10^4 cm^(-3) in the East.\nSuch densities are consistent with the predictions of UV-irradiated\nnon-dissociative shock models for the observed ratios of CO and [O I] along the\nDR21 Main. Main outflow. Assuming that the bulk of emission arises in shocks,\nthe outflow power of DR21 Main of 4.3-4.8x10^2 Lsol and the mass-loss rate of\n3.3-3.7x10^(-3) Msol/yr are determined. Observations provide strong support for\nits origin in outflow shocks, and the stratification of physical conditions\nalong the outflow. The total line cooling provides additional evidence that\nDR21 Main drives one of the most energetic outflows in the Milky Way.",

In this context, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\nhave proved to be a powerful framework for harmonization, framing it as a\nstyle-transfer problem. However, GAN-based approaches still face limitations in\ncapturing complex relationships within the images, which are essential for\neffective harmonization. In this work, we propose a novel texture-aware StarGAN\nfor CT data harmonization, enabling one-to-many translations across different\nreconstruction kernels. Although the StarGAN model has been successfully\napplied in other domains, its potential for CT data harmonization remains\nunexplored. Furthermore, our approach introduces a multi-scale texture loss\nfunction that embeds texture information across different spatial and angular\nscales into the harmonization process, effectively addressing kernel-induced\ntexture variations. We conducted extensive experimentation on a publicly\navailable dataset, utilizing a total of 48667 chest CT slices from 197 patients\ndistributed over three different reconstruction kernels, demonstrating the\nsuperiority of our method over the baseline StarGAN.",

However, when the initial electron energy approaches $\\sim100$\nTeV, the discrete nature of ICS becomes prominent, and the energy of evolved\nelectrons should be considered as a broad distribution rather than a\ndeterministic value. By simulating the evolution paths of individual electrons\nunder ICS, we capture this discrete nature and demonstrate that when the\nelectron injection spectrum exhibits a high-energy cutoff, the correct discrete\ntreatment yields a higher cutoff energy in the evolved spectrum compared to the\ncontinuous approximation. Applying the discrete ICS treatment to interpret the\ngamma-ray spectrum of the Geminga pulsar halo measured by HAWC, we find that\nthe inferred cutoff energy of the injection spectrum is correspondingly lower\nthan that derived using the continuous approximation at a $95\\%$ confidence\nlevel. This suggests that the systematic bias introduced by the approximation\nhas exceeded the measurement precision. We also expect the application of the\ndiscrete ICS correction in the PeV regime using the ultra-high-energy gamma-ray\nsource 1LHAASO J1954+2836u as a case study, pointing out that adopting the\ncontinuous approximation may considerably overestimate the electron\nacceleration capability of the source.",

    "abstract": "We address the enumeration of Eulerian orientations of 4-valent planar maps\naccording to three parameters: the number of vertices, the number of\nalternating vertices (having in/out/in/out incident edges), and the number of\nclockwise oriented faces. This is a refinement of the six vertex model studied\nby Kostov, then Zinn-Justin and Elvey Price, where one only considers the first\ntwo parameters. Via a bijection of Ambjorn and Budd, our problem is equivalent\nto the enumeration of Eulerian partial orientations of general planar maps,\ncounted by the number of edges, the number of undirected edges, and the number\nof vertices.\n  We first derive from combinatorial arguments a system of functional equations\ncharacterising the associated trivariate series $Q(t,\\omega,v)$. We then derive\nfrom this system a compact characterisation of this series. We use it to\ndetermine $Q(t,\\omega,v)$ in three two-parameter cases. The first two cases\ncorrespond to setting the variable $\\omega$ counting alternating vertices (or\nundirected edges after the AB bijection) to $0$ or $1$: when $\\omega=0$ we\ncount Eulerian orientations of general planar maps by edges and vertices, and\nwhen $\\omega=1$ we count Eulerian orientations of quartic maps by vertices and\nclockwise faces. The final forms of these two series, namely $Q(t,0, v)$ and\n$Q(t,1,v)$, refine those obtained by the authors in an earlier paper for $v=1$.\nThe third case that we solve, namely $v=1$ (but $\\omega$ arbitrary), is the\nstandard six-vertex model, for which we provide a new proof of the formula of\nElvey Price and Zinn-Justin involving Jacobi theta functions.\n  This new derivation remains purely in the world of formal power series, not\nrelying on complex analysis. Our results also use a more direct approach to\nsolving the functional equations, in contrast to the guess and check approaches\nused in previous work.",

The present paper revisits this finding from completely\ndifferent viewpoint. Namely, we show how a theoretical study of\n\\emph{estimation in sup-norm} can be reduced to the analysis of \\emph{plug-in\nsemiparametric estimation}. For the latter, we adopt and extend the general\napproach from \\cite{Sp2024} to high-dimensional estimation and inference. The\nmain tool of the analysis is a theory of \\emph{perturbed marginal optimization}\nwhen an objective function depends on a low-dimensional target parameter along\nwith a high-dimensional nuisance parameter. A particular focus of the study is\nthe critical dimension condition. Full-dimensional estimation requires in\ngeneral the condition \\( \\mathbbmsl{N} \\gg \\mathbb{p} \\) between the effective\nparameter dimension \\( \\mathbb{p} \\) and the effective sample size \\(\n\\mathbbmsl{N} \\) corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of the Fisher\ninformation matrix \\( \\mathbbmsl{F} \\).

Under independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) errors with continuous density around the quantile of\ninterest, we establish a general Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for the quantile\nregression estimator under normalization using $\\Delta_n^{-1}$, yielding\nasymptotic normality with variance $\\tau(1-\\tau)/f^2(0) \\cdot D_0^{-1}$. In the\nspecific case of polynomial regressors, we show that the design structure\ninduces a Hilbert matrix in the asymptotic covariance, and we derive explicit\nscaling rates for each coefficient. This generalizes Pollard's and Koenker's\nearlier results on LAD regression to arbitrary quantile levels $\\tau \\in (0,\n1)$. We also examine the convergence behavior of the estimators and propose a\nrelaxation of the standard CLT-based confidence intervals, motivated by a\ntheoretical inclusion principle. This relaxation replaces the usual $T^{j+1/2}$\nscaling with $T^\\alpha$, for $\\alpha < j + 1/2$, to improve finite-sample\ncoverage. Through extensive simulations under Laplace, Gaussian, and Cauchy\nnoise, we validate this approach and highlight the improved robustness and\nempirical accuracy of relaxed confidence intervals.

Despite\nsignificant progress in protein structure prediction, approximating\nconformational ensembles at physiological conditions remains a fundamental open\nproblem. This paper presents a novel perspective on the problem by directly\ntargeting continuous compact representations of protein motions inferred from\nsparse experimental observations. We develop a task-specific loss function\nenforcing data symmetries, including scaling and permutation operations.

We then characterize an indirect dipolar spin exchange, i.e., the\noff-diagonal part of the van der Waals effective Hamiltonian that couples the\nstates $nS$ and $(n+1)S$.

We theoretically analyze DRoPE's\ncorrectness and efficiency, demonstrating its capability to simultaneously\noptimize trajectory generation accuracy, time complexity, and space complexity.\nEmpirical evaluations compared with various state-of-the-art trajectory\ngeneration models, confirm DRoPE's good performance and significantly reduced\nspace complexity, indicating both theoretical soundness and practical\neffectiveness.

We identify proximity-induced\nsuperconductivity in the interfacial TiO$_2$ layer of STO, due to hybridization\nbetween Fe $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. This hybridization results in a fivefold\nincrease in the superconducting gap width and confines superconducting states\nto the $M$ point in the Brillouin Zone. This is in contrast to ML FeSe, where\nsuperconductivity emerges at both the $\\Gamma$ and $M$ points. Furthermore, the\nsubstrate modifies the orbital character of the states responsible for\nsuperconductivity, which change from Fe $d_{z^2}$ in ML FeSe to Fe\n$d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ in FeSe/STO. In both systems, we demonstrate an anisotropic\nsuperconducting gap with multiple coherence peaks, originating at different\nk-points in the Brillouin Zone. Additionally, in FeSe/STO, we identify emerging\nstates unique to the superconducting phase arising from electron-hole\nhybridization at $M$, in agreement with experiments.

Our strategy is based on a new\ncomponentwise forward error analysis that explains the propagation of errors in\nthe forward pass of neural networks. Specifically, our analysis shows that the\nerror in each component of the output of a layer is proportional to the\ncondition number of the inner product between the weights and the input,\nmultiplied by the condition number of the activation function. These condition\nnumbers can vary widely from one component to the other, thus creating a\nsignificant opportunity to introduce mixed precision: each component should be\naccumulated in a precision inversely proportional to the product of these\ncondition numbers. We propose a practical algorithm that exploits this\nobservation: it first computes all components in low precision, uses this\noutput to estimate the condition numbers, and recomputes in higher precision\nonly the components associated with large condition numbers.

    "abstract": "This study presents a shaped reset feedback control strategy to enhance the\nperformance of precision motion systems. The approach utilizes a phase-lead\ncompensator as a shaping filter to tune the phase of reset instants, thereby\nshaping the nonlinearity in the first-order reset control. {The design achieves\neither an increased phase margin while maintaining gain properties or improved\ngain without sacrificing phase margin, compared to reset control without the\nshaping filter.} Then, frequency-domain design procedures are provided for both\nClegg Integrator (CI)-based and First-Order Reset Element (FORE)-based reset\ncontrol systems. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is\ndemonstrated through two experimental case studies on a precision motion stage.\nIn the first case, the shaped reset control leverages phase-lead benefits to\nachieve zero overshoot in the transient response. In the second case, the\nshaped reset control strategy enhances the gain advantages of the previous\nreset element, resulting in improved steady-state performance, including better\ntracking precision and disturbance rejection, while reducing overshoot for an\nimproved transient response.",

To address these challenges, this paper investigates\na novel framework for 4D-PSG generation that leverages rich 2D visual scene\nannotations to enhance 4D scene learning.

The center problem asks to find a center, i.e., a vertex of\n$G$ that minimizes $r_\\pi$. We here study some local properties of radius\nfunctions in graphs, and their algorithmic implications; our work is inspired\nby the nice property that in Euclidean spaces every local minimum of every\nradius function $r_\\pi$ is a center. We study a discrete analogue of this\nproperty for graphs, which we name $G^p$-unimodality: specifically, every\nvertex that minimizes the radius function in its ball of radius $p$ must be a\ncentral vertex. While it has long been known since Dragan (1989) that graphs\nwith $G$-unimodal radius functions $r_\\pi$ are exactly the Helly graphs, the\nclass of graphs with $G^2$-unimodal radius functions has not been studied\ninsofar. We prove the latter class to be much larger than the Helly graphs,\nsince it also comprises (weakly) bridged graphs, graphs with convex balls, and\nbipartite Helly graphs.\n  Recently, using the $G$-unimodality of radius functions $r_\\pi$, a randomized\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{n}m)$-time local search algorithm for the center\nproblem on Helly graphs was proposed by Ducoffe (2023). Assuming the Hitting\nSet Conjecture (Abboud et al., 2016), we prove that a similar result for the\nclass of graphs with $G^2$-unimodal radius functions is unlikely.

Deep CNNs and\nvision-transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated individually promising initial\nperformance. However, challenges related to model complexity and contrast,\ntexture, and tumor morphology variations introduce uncertainties that hinder\nthe effectiveness of current methods. This study introduces a novel hybrid\nframework, CB-Res-RBCMT, combining customized residual CNNs and new ViT\ncomponents for detailed BUSI cancer analysis. The proposed RBCMT uses stem\nconvolution blocks with CNN Meet Transformer (CMT) blocks, followed by new\nRegional and boundary (RB) feature extraction operations for capturing contrast\nand morphological variations. Moreover, the CMT block incorporates global\ncontextual interactions through multi-head attention, enhancing computational\nefficiency with a lightweight design. Additionally, the customized inverse\nresidual and stem CNNs within the CMT effectively extract local texture\ninformation and handle vanishing gradients. Finally, the new channel-boosted\n(CB) strategy enriches the feature diversity of the limited dataset by\ncombining the original RBCMT channels with transfer learning-based residual\nCNN-generated maps. These diverse channels are processed through a spatial\nattention block for optimal pixel selection, reducing redundancy and improving\nthe discrimination of minor contrast and texture variations. The proposed\nCB-Res-RBCMT achieves an F1-score of 95.57%, accuracy of 95.63%, sensitivity of\n96.42%, and precision of 94.79% on the standard harmonized stringent BUSI\ndataset, outperforming existing ViT and CNN methods.

A key challenge is integrating these\nmodalities of different shapes while maintaining SE(3) equivariance for 3D\ncoordinates. To achieve this, existing approaches typically maintain separate\nlatent spaces for invariant and equivariant modalities, reducing efficiency in\nboth training and sampling. In this work, we propose \\textbf{U}nified\nVariational \\textbf{A}uto-\\textbf{E}ncoder for \\textbf{3D} Molecular Latent\nDiffusion Modeling (\\textbf{UAE-3D}), a multi-modal VAE that compresses 3D\nmolecules into latent sequences from a unified latent space, while maintaining\nnear-zero reconstruction error. This unified latent space eliminates the\ncomplexities of handling multi-modality and equivariance when performing latent\ndiffusion modeling.

In this work we propose TransCaGNet, a modified version of\nthe zero-shot model CaGNet. We exchange the segmentation backbone with the\narchitecture of Trans4Trans to be capable of segmenting transparent objects.\nSince some glasses are rarely captured, we use zeroshot learning to be able to\ncreate semantic segmentations of glass categories not given during training. We\npropose a novel synthetic dataset covering a diverse set of different\nenvironmental conditions. Additionally we capture a real-world evaluation\ndataset since most applications take place in the real world.

Our evaluation emphasizes\nthat distinguishing between different classes is challenging for the models due\nto similarity, points of view, or coverings. Taking this behavior into account,\nwe assign glasses multiple possible categories.

We\nsupport our claim by modeling the near-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectral\nenergy distribution, which revealed a close similarity between the fundamental\nparameters and the mass-loss rate of the burning white dwarf during the 2019\nV1047 Cen outburst and those measured during Z And-type outbursts in symbiotic\nstars. All parameters are in agreement with the theoretical prediction when the\naccretion rate exceeds the stable burning limit for white dwarfs with masses\nless than 0.7 solar units. Our analysis showed that after a nova explosion, the\nZ And-type outburst can occur not only in symbiotic binaries but also in\nshort-period cataclysmic variables, when the accretion-powered system changes\nto a nuclear-powered one, as a consequence of the donor's reaction to the nova\nexplosion.

However, realizing of\nperfect Weyl semimetals and double Kagome bands remains challenging. Here, we\nreport a new class of distorted armchair-type fully sp2-hybridized carbon\nnetworks, termed DACN-n. The DACN-n family is characterized by only six pairs\nof Weyl points on the $k_z=0$ plane near the Fermi level. We calculated the\nchirality of these Weyl points and found that each carries a topological charge\nof $\\pm$1. Notably, DACN-5 exhibits a double Kagome band, where the Weyl points\narise from the intersection between Dirac-type bands in the two sets of Kagome\nbands. The structural stability of DACN-n is confirmed by phonon spectra, ab\ninitio molecular dynamics simulations, and elastic constant calculations.\nAdditionally, we investigated the surface states of the (001) surface and found\nthat its nontrivial topological properties are attributed to the Fermi arcs\nconnecting a pair of Weyl points with opposite chirality. We also simulated\nx-ray diffraction patterns to guide experimental synthesis.

    "abstract": "Hybridizing different physical systems or degrees of freedom offers\nsignificant advantages for realizing practical, universal, scalable, and\nfault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). Here, we propose optical FTQC\nschemes with low squeezing thresholds by leveraging the strengths of both\ndiscrete-variable (DV) and continuous-variable (CV) systems while utilizing\nfrequency, time, and orbital angular momentum degrees of freedom. First, we\ndesign an optical entanglement generator (OEG) capable of producing various\ntypes of entangled pairs, including cluster pairs, hybrid entangled pairs, and\nGKP Bell pairs, which can be flexibly chosen by adjusting the measurement\nbasis. Additionally, the OEG features extra ports for directly inputting\n(outputting) data (result) states via quantum teleportation, eliminating the\nneed for optical switches. Secondly, large-scale one-dimensional,\ntwo-dimensional, and three-dimensional (3D) hybrid cluster states, composed of\nDV Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits and CV squeezed states, are\ndeterministically generated using the entangled pairs passed through a\ntime-delay system. Moreover, we optimize the surface-GKP code to further reduce\nlogical errors during the stabilizer measurements in the surface code. By\ncombining the 3D cubic hybrid cluster state with the modified surface-GKP code\nand accounting for full circuit-level noise, FTQC is achieved with a squeezing\nthreshold of 10 dB. Moreover, our method can also generate a 3D macronode\nRaussendorf-Harrington-Goyal (RHG) cluster state, facilitating an alternative\nFTQC scheme via the RHG-GKP code.

The\ncurrent Triton starts at the workgroup (aka threadblock) level, and directly\nlowers to per-thread level.

Semi-supervised medical image segmentation\n(SSMIS) offers a viable alternative, driven by advancements in CNNs and ViTs.\nHowever, these networks often rely on single fixed activation functions and\nlinear modeling patterns, limiting their ability to effectively learn robust\nrepresentations. Given the limited availability of labeled date, achieving\nrobust representation learning becomes crucial. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetworks (KANs), we propose Semi-KAN, which leverages the untapped potential of\nKANs to enhance backbone architectures for representation learning in SSMIS.\nOur findings indicate that: (1) compared to networks with fixed activation\nfunctions, KANs exhibit superior representation learning capabilities with\nfewer parameters, and (2) KANs excel in high-semantic feature spaces. Building\non these insights, we integrate KANs into tokenized intermediate\nrepresentations, applying them selectively at the encoder's bottleneck and the\ndecoder's top layers within a U-Net pipeline to extract high-level semantic\nfeatures. Although learnable activation functions improve feature expansion,\nthey introduce significant computational overhead with only marginal\nperformance gains. To mitigate this, we reduce the feature dimensions and\nemploy horizontal scaling to capture multiple pattern representations.\nFurthermore, we design a multi-branch U-Net architecture with uncertainty\nestimation to effectively learn diverse pattern representations. Extensive\nexperiments on four public datasets demonstrate that Semi-KAN surpasses\nbaseline networks, utilizing fewer KAN layers and lower computational cost,\nthereby underscoring the potential of KANs as a promising approach for SSMIS.",

    "abstract": "Urban traffic forecasting is a commonly encountered problem, with\nwide-ranging applications in fields such as urban planning, civil engineering\nand transport. In this paper, we study the enhancement of traffic forecasting\nwith pre-training, focusing on spatio-temporal graph methods. While various\nmachine learning methods to solve traffic forecasting problems have been\nexplored and extensively studied, there is a gap of a more contextual approach:\nstudying how relevant non-traffic data can improve prediction performance on\ntraffic forecasting problems. We call this data spatial context. We introduce a\nnovel method of combining road and traffic information through the notion of a\ntraffic quotient graph, a quotient graph formed from road geometry and traffic\nsensors. We also define a way to encode this relationship in the form of a\ngeometric encoder, pre-trained using contrastive learning methods and enhanced\nwith OpenStreetMap data. We introduce and discuss ways to integrate this\ngeometric encoder with existing graph neural network (GNN)-based traffic\nforecasting models, using a contrastive pre-training paradigm. We demonstrate\nthe potential for this hybrid model to improve generalisation and performance\nwith zero additional traffic data.

To\naddress this problem, we propose a temporal contrastive memory network\ncomprising image and mask encoders to learn feature representations, a temporal\ncontrastive memory bank that aligns embeddings from adjacent frames while\npushing apart distant ones to explicitly model inter-frame relationships and\nstores these features, and a decoder that fuses encoded image features and\nmemory readouts for segmentation.

The binding process can be modeled by an additive random functional\ncorresponding to the canonical construction of a `killed' diffusion Markov\nprocess. We study the problem of conducting inference on the\ninfinite-dimensional diffusion parameter from a histogram plot of the `killing'\npositions of the process. We show first that these positions follow a Poisson\npoint process whose intensity measure is determined by the solution of a\ncertain Schr\\\"odinger equation.

This observation is in the form of instantaneous velocity\nmeasurements, which are sampled at localized sensors in the physical domain.\nTwo objectives are targeted.

In order to reduce the computational costs\nrequired for this analysis, a hyper-localization procedure (HLEnKF) is proposed\nand it is integrated in the library CONES, tailored to perform fast online DA.\nThe proposed strategy performs a satisfactory calibration of the inlet\nconditions, and its robustness is assessed using two different prior\ndistributions for the free parameters optimized in this task. DA state\nestimation is efficient in obtaining accurate local synchronization of the\ninferred velocity fields with the observed data.

    "abstract": "The linear regression (LR) method offers the advantage that optimal\nparameters can be calculated relatively easily, although its representation\ncapability is limited than that of the deep learning technique. To improve deep\nreinforcement learning, the Least Squares Deep Q Network (LS-DQN) method was\nproposed by Levine et al., which combines Deep Q Network (DQN) with LR method.\nHowever, the LS-DQN method assumes that the actions are discrete. In this\nstudy, we propose the Double Least Squares Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient\n(DLS-DDPG) method to address this limitation. This method combines the LR\nmethod with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) technique, one of the\nrepresentative deep reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous action\ncases. For the LR update of the critic network, DLS-DDPG uses an algorithm\nsimilar to the Fitted Q iteration, the method which LS-DQN adopted. In\naddition, we calculated the optimal action using the quasi-Newton method and\nused it as both the agent's action and the training data for the LR update of\nthe actor network.

    "abstract": "Pansharpening, a pivotal task in remote sensing for fusing high-resolution\npanchromatic and multispectral imagery, has garnered significant research\ninterest. Recent advancements employing diffusion models based on stochastic\ndifferential equations (SDEs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance.\nHowever, the inherent multi-step sampling process of SDEs imposes substantial\ncomputational overhead, hindering practical deployment. While existing methods\nadopt efficient samplers, knowledge distillation, or retraining to reduce\nsampling steps (e.g., from 1,000 to fewer steps), such approaches often\ncompromise fusion quality. In this work, we propose the Optimal Transport Flow\nMatching (OTFM) framework, which integrates the dual formulation of unbalanced\noptimal transport (UOT) to achieve one-step, high-quality pansharpening. Unlike\nconventional OT formulations that enforce rigid distribution alignment, UOT\nrelaxes marginal constraints to enhance modeling flexibility, accommodating the\nintrinsic spectral and spatial disparities in remote sensing data. Furthermore,\nwe incorporate task-specific regularization into the UOT objective, enhancing\nthe robustness of the flow model. The OTFM framework enables simulation-free\ntraining and single-step inference while maintaining strict adherence to\npansharpening constraints. Experimental evaluations across multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that OTFM matches or exceeds the performance of previous\nregression-based models and leading diffusion-based methods while only needing\none sampling step.

We conducted experiments with two groups fluent in English and either\nTamil (n = 557) or Arabic (n = 539) across six visualization types, each\nvarying in annotation volume and semantic content. Full-text annotations\nyielded the highest comprehension accuracy across all languages, while\npreferences diverged: English readers favored highly annotated charts, whereas\nTamil/Arabic readers preferred full-text or minimally annotated versions.\nSemantic variations in annotations (L1-L4) did not significantly affect\ncomprehension, demonstrating the robustness of text comprehension across\nlanguages. English annotations were generally preferred, with a tendency to\nthink technically in English linked to greater aversion to non-English\nannotations, though this diminished among participants who regularly switched\nlanguages internally. Non-English annotations incorporating visual or external\nknowledge were less favored, particularly in titles. Our findings highlight\ncultural and educational factors influencing perceptions of visual information,\nunderscoring the need for inclusive annotation practices for diverse linguistic\naudiences.

By\nleveraging contrastive learning across diverse modalities, large-scale\nmultimodal data enhances representational quality.

We define this problem as Continual Multimodal Contrastive Learning\n(CMCL), an underexplored yet crucial research direction at the intersection of\nmultimodal and continual learning. In this paper, we formulate CMCL through two\nspecialized principles of stability and plasticity. We theoretically derive a\nnovel optimization-based method, which projects updated gradients from dual\nsides onto subspaces where any gradient is prevented from interfering with the\npreviously learned knowledge. Two upper bounds provide theoretical insights on\nboth stability and plasticity in our solution. Beyond our theoretical\ncontributions, we conduct experiments on multiple datasets by comparing our\nmethod against advanced continual learning baselines.

However, most existing methods\nconcentrate primarily on full-body movements and often overlook subtle hand\nmotions that are critical for distinguishing fine-grained actions. Recent work\nleverages a unified graph representation that combines body, hand, and foot\nkeypoints to capture detailed body dynamics. Yet, these models often blur fine\nhand details due to the disparity between body and hand action characteristics\nand the loss of subtle features during the spatial-pooling. In this paper, we\npropose BHaRNet (Body-Hand action Recognition Network), a novel framework that\naugments a typical body-expert model with a hand-expert model. Our model\njointly trains both streams with an ensemble loss that fosters cooperative\nspecialization, functioning in a manner reminiscent of a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE). Moreover, cross-attention is employed via an expertized branch method\nand a pooling-attention module to enable feature-level interactions and\nselectively fuse complementary information.

    "abstract": "The area of quantum circuit simulation has attracted a lot of attention in\nrecent years. However, due to the exponentially increasing computational costs,\nassessing and validating these models on large datasets poses significant\nobstacles. Despite plenty of research in quantum simulation, issues such as\nmemory management, system adaptability, and execution efficiency remain\nunresolved. In this study, we introduce QEA, a state vector-based hardware\naccelerator that overcomes these difficulties with four key improvements:\noptimized memory allocation management, open PE, flexible ALU, and simplified\nCX swapper. To evaluate QEA's capabilities, we implemented and evaluated it on\nthe AMD Alveo U280 board, which uses only 0.534 W of power. Experimental\nresults show that QEA is extremely flexible, supporting a wide range of quantum\ncircuits, has excellent fidelity, making it appropriate for standard quantum\nemulators, and outperforms powerful CPUs and related works up to 153.16x better\nin terms of normalized gate speed. This study has considerable potential as a\nuseful approach for quantum emulators in future works.",

In\nthis context, we introduce the Unified Segmentation Attention Mechanism Network\n(USAM-Net), a novel convolutional neural network that integrates stereo image\ninputs with semantic segmentation maps and attention to enhance depth\nestimation performance. USAM-Net employs a dual-pathway architecture, which\ncombines a pre-trained segmentation model (SAM) and a depth estimation model.\nThe segmentation pathway preprocesses the stereo images to generate semantic\nmasks, which are then concatenated with the stereo images as inputs to the\ndepth estimation pathway. This integration allows the model to focus on\nimportant features such as object boundaries and surface textures which are\ncrucial for accurate depth perception. Empirical evaluation on the\nDrivingStereo dataset demonstrates that USAM-Net achieves superior performance\nmetrics, including a Global Difference (GD) of 3.61\\% and an End-Point Error\n(EPE) of 0.88, outperforming traditional models such as CFNet, SegStereo, and\niResNet.

Using a Panel Vector Error Correction Model\n(VECM), we assess the impact of the Paris Agreement (2015) on emissions while\nconducting cointegration tests to confirm long-run equilibrium relationships.\nThe findings reveal a strong long-run relationship among the variables, with\nenergy use as the dominant driver of emissions, while GDP per capita has a\nmoderate impact. However, the Paris Agreement has not significantly altered\nemissions trends in middle-income economies. Granger causality tests indicate\nthat energy use strongly causes emissions, but GDP per capita and population do\nnot exhibit significant short-run causal effects. Variance decomposition\nconfirms that energy shocks have the most persistent effects, and impulse\nresponse functions (IRFs) show emissions trajectories are primarily shaped by\neconomic activity rather than climate agreements. Robustness checks, including\nautocorrelation tests, polynomial root stability, and Yamagata-Pesaran slope\nhomogeneity tests, validate model consistency.

However, existing methods face several significant\nlimitations: 1) requiring task- or dataset-specific models; 2) neglecting\nreal-world image degradations (\\textit{e.g.}, noise), which causes failure when\nprocessing degraded inputs; 3) operating in pixel space, where attention\nmechanisms are computationally expensive; and 4) lacking user interaction\ncapabilities.

Our framework\nincludes two key components: 1) a practical degradation pipeline that simulates\nreal-world image degradations and generates interactive prompts to guide the\nmodel; 2) an all-in-one Diffusion Transformer (DiT) operating in latent space,\nwhich fuses a clean image conditioned on both the degraded inputs and the\ngenerated prompts. Furthermore, we introduce principled modifications to the\noriginal DiT architecture to better suit the fusion task. Based on this\nframework, we develop two versions of the model: Regression-based and Flow\nMatching-based variants.

To comprehensively assess the motion understanding ability of\nexisting MLLMs, we introduce FAVOR-Bench, comprising 1,776 videos with\nstructured manual annotations of various motions. Our benchmark includes both\nclose-ended and open-ended tasks. For close-ended evaluation, we carefully\ndesign 8,184 multiple-choice question-answer pairs spanning six distinct\nsub-tasks. For open-ended evaluation, we develop both a novel cost-efficient\nLLM-free and a GPT-assisted caption assessment method, where the former can\nenhance benchmarking interpretability and reproducibility. Comprehensive\nexperiments with 21 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations in\ntheir ability to comprehend and describe detailed temporal dynamics in video\nmotions.

However, adapting these\nmodels to specialized domains using private datasets stored on\nresource-constrained edge devices, such as smartphones and personal computers,\nremains challenging due to significant privacy concerns and limited\ncomputational resources. Existing model adaptation methods either compromise\ndata privacy by requiring data transmission or jeopardize model privacy by\nexposing proprietary LLM parameters. To address these challenges, we propose\nPrada, a novel privacy-preserving and efficient black-box LLM adaptation system\nusing private on-device datasets. Prada employs a lightweight proxy model\nfine-tuned with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) locally on user devices. During\ninference, Prada leverages the logits offset, i.e., difference in outputs\nbetween the base and adapted proxy models, to iteratively refine outputs from a\nremote black-box LLM. This offset-based adaptation approach preserves both data\nprivacy and model privacy, as there is no need to share sensitive data or\nproprietary model parameters. Furthermore, we incorporate speculative decoding\nto further speed up the inference process of Prada, making the system\npractically deployable on bandwidth-constrained edge devices, enabling a more\npractical deployment of Prada. Extensive experiments on various downstream\ntasks demonstrate that Prada achieves performance comparable to centralized\nfine-tuning methods while significantly reducing computational overhead by up\nto 60% and communication costs by up to 80%.",

Previous works on drug jargon detection were limited\nto extracting a list of terms, but these approaches have fundamental problems\nin practical application.

Tool- Bench includes\ndiverse changes from popular open-source Python GitHub projects, where UTFix\nsuccessfully repaired 89.2% of assertion failures and achieved 100% code\ncoverage for 96 tests out of 369 tests. On the real-world benchmarks, UTFix\nrepairs 60% of assertion failures while achieving 100% code coverage for 19 out\nof 30 unit tests. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive\nstudy focused on unit test in evolving Python projects. Our contributions\ninclude the development of UTFix, the creation of Tool-Bench and real-world\nbenchmarks, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of LLM-based methods in\naddressing unit test failures due to software evolution.",

This paper presents a novel method that\nleverages causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning for optimizing system\npersuasion capability and outcomes. We employ the Greedy Relaxation of the\nSparsest Permutation (GRaSP) algorithm to identify causal relationships between\nuser and system utterance strategies, treating user strategies as states and\nsystem strategies as actions. GRaSP identifies user strategies as causal\nfactors influencing system responses, which inform Bidirectional Conditional\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (BiCoGAN) in generating counterfactual\nutterances for the system. Subsequently, we use the Dueling Double Deep\nQ-Network (D3QN) model to utilize counterfactual data to determine the best\npolicy for selecting system utterances. Our experiments with the\nPersuasionForGood dataset show measurable improvements in persuasion outcomes\nusing our approach over baseline methods.

Current fire suppression strategies rely heavily on\nwater, chemical fire retardants, and water-enhancing gels, which use\nsuperabsorbent polymers to retain water and adhere to substrates, offering\nextended fire protection compared to water alone. However, their effectiveness\nis limited by evaporation and degradation under extreme heat and wind\nconditions.

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown excellent performance in\ngraph-structured tasks such as node classification and graph classification.\nHowever, recent research has shown that GCNs are vulnerable to a new type of\nthreat called the backdoor attack, where the adversary can inject a hidden\nbackdoor into the GCNs so that the backdoored model performs well on benign\nsamples, whereas its prediction will be maliciously changed to the\nattacker-specified target label if the hidden backdoor is activated by the\nattacker-defined trigger. Clean-label backdoor attack and semantic backdoor\nattack are two new backdoor attacks to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), they are\nmore imperceptible and have posed new and serious threats. The semantic and\nclean-label backdoor attack is not fully explored in GCNs. In this paper, we\npropose a semantic and clean-label backdoor attack against GCNs under the\ncontext of graph classification to reveal the existence of this security\nvulnerability in GCNs. Specifically, SCLBA conducts an importance analysis on\ngraph samples to select one type of node as semantic trigger, which is then\ninserted into the graph samples to create poisoning samples without changing\nthe labels of the poisoning samples to the attacker-specified target label. We\nevaluate SCLBA on multiple datasets and the results show that SCLBA can achieve\nattack success rates close to 99% with poisoning rates of less than 3%, and\nwith almost no impact on the performance of model on benign samples.",

This framework has proven to be an invaluable tool for quantitatively\nmodeling the macroscopic dynamics of agents striving to minimize specific costs\nin complex systems, such as crowd dynamics, financial markets, traffic flows,\nand social networks.\n  The study of MFGs has traditionally focused on forward problems, where the\ngoal is to determine the equilibrium behavior of agents given a set of model\nparameters, such as cost functions, interaction mechanisms, and initial\nconditions. However, the inverse problems for MFGs -- which seek to infer these\nunderlying parameters from observed data -- have received comparatively less\nattention in the literature. This book seeks to address this gap by delving\ninto the fundamental aspects of MFG inverse problems, with a particular\nemphasis on issues of unique identifiability, stability, and reconstruction of\nunknown parameters. These problems are not only mathematically challenging but\nalso of immense practical significance, as they enable the calibration and\nvalidation of MFG models using real-world data.\n  This book is intended to serve as a valuable resource for researchers\ninterested in the theory and applications of MFGs, particularly in inverse\nproblems.

However, there is still an ongoing\ndebate whether the sensitivity advantage is negated by an increase in\nfundamental noise - especially when active elements induce self-oscillations.\nIn this case, nonlinearities are crucial in stabilizing amplifying modes and\nmitigating noise effects. A drawback is the formation of hysteresis loops that\nsignal a transition to unstable modes. This can only be alleviated by precise\ncavity symmetry management. Here, utilizing two coupled nonlinear RLC tanks\nwith balanced amplification and attenuation, we demonstrate that an explicit\nsymmetry violation, induced by sweeping the resonant detuning of the RLC tanks,\nreveals a hysteresis loop near the EPD whose width scales sublinearly with the\ninter-tank coupling.

New transverse\nvelocities from Gaia show two dynamically distinct stellar populations in\nCircinus East; their velocity distribution is consistent with an active\ncloud-cloud collision between material ejected by the formation of O and B\nstars in ASCC~79 and a dynamically similar interloping cloud. Given the similar\ndistances to Circinus West and East, and the presence in both of HH objects --\na phenomenon associated with stellar ages of ~1 Myr -- it is likely that these\nclouds are nominally related, but only Circinus East is subject to substantial\nfeedback from the central cluster in the parent complex.

However, obtaining a\ncomprehensive, multi-plane annotated fetal US dataset remains challenging,\nparticularly for rare or complex anomalies owing to their low incidence and\nnumerous subtypes. This poses difficulties in training novice radiologists and\ndeveloping robust AI models, especially for detecting abnormal fetuses. In this\nstudy, we introduce a Flexible Fetal US image generation framework (FetalFlex)\nto address these challenges, which leverages anatomical structures and\nmultimodal information to enable controllable synthesis of fetal US images\nacross diverse planes. Specifically, FetalFlex incorporates a pre-alignment\nmodule to enhance controllability and introduces a repaint strategy to ensure\nconsistent texture and appearance. Moreover, a two-stage adaptive sampling\nstrategy is developed to progressively refine image quality from coarse to fine\nlevels. We believe that FetalFlex is the first method capable of generating\nboth in-distribution normal and out-of-distribution abnormal fetal US images,\nwithout requiring any abnormal data. Experiments on multi-center datasets\ndemonstrate that FetalFlex achieved state-of-the-art performance across\nmultiple image quality metrics. A reader study further confirms the close\nalignment of the generated results with expert visual assessments. Furthermore,\nsynthetic images by FetalFlex significantly improve the performance of six\ntypical deep models in downstream classification and anomaly detection tasks.\nLastly, FetalFlex's anatomy-level controllable generation offers a unique\nadvantage for anomaly simulation and creating paired or counterfactual data at\nthe pixel level.

We extend our previous studies by including the kinetic\nterm of the center-of-mass motion as well as the kinetic term for the relative\nmotions constructed by the area derivatives. This inclusion gives rise to\nanother scalar Nambu-Goldstone mode in the broken phase, enriching the phase\nstructures of $p$-brane. For example, when the higher-form global symmetries\nare discrete ones, we show that the low-energy effective theory in the broken\nphase is described by a topological field theory of the axion $\\varphi(X)$ and\n$p$-form field $A_p^{}(X)$ with multiple (emergent) higher-form global\nsymmetries. After the mean-field analysis, we investigate the propagation of\n$p$-brane in the present framework. We find the (functional) plane-wave\nsolutions for the kinetic terms and derive a path-integral representation of\nthe brane propagator. This representation motivates us to study the brane\npropagation within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, where the volume of\n$p$-brane is treated as constant. In the volume-less limit (i.e. point-particle\nlimit), the propagator reduces to the ordinary propagator of relativistic\nparticle, whereas it describes the propagation of the area elements in the\nlarge-volume limit. Correspondingly, it is shown that the Hausdorff dimension\nof $p$-brane varies from $2$ to $2(p+1)$ as we increase the $p$-brane volume\nwithin the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Although these results are quite\nintriguing, we also point out that the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is\ninvalid in the point-particle limit, highlighting the quantum nature of\n$p$-brane as an extended object in spacetime.",

We paid special attention to gas\ncontamination in the dust polarization using these data. As a result, we find\nthe maximum polarization degree $P_max=31.21 +- 0.05 %, 33.52 +- 0.06 %, 35.12\n+- 0.01 %, 37.57 +- 0.01 %, and 35.35 +- 0.01 % in the Rc-, Ic-, J-, H-, and\nKs-bands, respectively. Although dust polarization shows a red slope at shorter\nwavelengths and can peak around 1.6 um, the phase angle at which maximum\npolarization occurs exhibits less dependence on wavelength (alpha_max ~ 90 deg\n- 95 deg). Although only a few historically bright comets, such as West,\nHalley, and Hale-Bopp, have undergone such extensive dust-polarization\nobservations, our measurements are generally consistent with those of two\ncomets that possibly originated from the Oort Cloud (West and Halley). From\nthese results, we conjecture that the optical properties and growth processes\nof dust in the presolar nebula, which formed these cometary nuclei, were likely\nuniform.",

The transformed HR-MSI\nand LR-HSI pairs are then processed by a pre-trained network to reconstruct the\ntarget HR-HSI.

    "abstract": "Scaling dense retrievers to larger large language model (LLM) backbones has\nbeen a dominant strategy for improving their retrieval effectiveness. However,\nthis has substantial cost implications: larger backbones require more expensive\nhardware (e.g. GPUs with more memory) and lead to higher indexing and querying\ncosts (latency, energy consumption). In this paper, we challenge this paradigm\nby introducing PromptPRF, a feature-based pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF)\nframework that enables small LLM-based dense retrievers to achieve\neffectiveness comparable to much larger models.\n  PromptPRF uses LLMs to extract query-independent, structured and unstructured\nfeatures (e.g., entities, summaries, chain-of-thought keywords, essay) from\ntop-ranked documents. These features are generated offline and integrated into\ndense query representations via prompting, enabling efficient retrieval without\nadditional training. Unlike prior methods such as GRF, which rely on online,\nquery-specific generation and sparse retrieval, PromptPRF decouples feedback\ngeneration from query processing and supports dense retrievers in a fully\nzero-shot setting.\n  Experiments on TREC DL and BEIR benchmarks demonstrate that PromptPRF\nconsistently improves retrieval effectiveness and offers favourable\ncost-effectiveness trade-offs. We further present ablation studies to\nunderstand the role of positional feedback and analyse the interplay between\nfeature extractor size, PRF depth, and model performance. Our findings\ndemonstrate that with effective PRF design, scaling the retriever is not always\nnecessary, narrowing the gap between small and large models while reducing\ninference cost.",

Despite various attempts to mitigate this issue through\ncompression techniques, prior works have not explicitly formalized the problem\nof KV-cache compression in this context. In this work, we take the first step\nin formally defining the KV-cache compression problem for Visual Autoregressive\ntransformers. We then establish a fundamental negative result, proving that any\nmechanism for sequential visual token generation under attention-based\narchitectures must use at least $\\Omega(n^2 d)$ memory, when $d = \\Omega(\\log\nn)$, where $n$ is the number of tokens generated and $d$ is the embedding\ndimensionality. This result demonstrates that achieving truly sub-quadratic\nmemory usage is impossible without additional structural constraints. Our proof\nis constructed via a reduction from a computational lower bound problem,\nleveraging randomized embedding techniques inspired by dimensionality reduction\nprinciples. Finally, we discuss how sparsity priors on visual representations\ncan influence memory efficiency, presenting both impossibility results and\npotential directions for mitigating memory overhead.",

    "abstract": "Optical flow estimation is essential for video processing tasks, such as\nrestoration and action recognition. The quality of videos is constantly\nincreasing, with current standards reaching 8K resolution. However, optical\nflow methods are usually designed for low resolution and do not generalize to\nlarge inputs due to their rigid architectures. They adopt downscaling or input\ntiling to reduce the input size, causing a loss of details and global\ninformation. There is also a lack of optical flow benchmarks to judge the\nactual performance of existing methods on high-resolution samples. Previous\nworks only conducted qualitative high-resolution evaluations on hand-picked\nsamples. This paper fills this gap in optical flow estimation in two ways. We\npropose DPFlow, an adaptive optical flow architecture capable of generalizing\nup to 8K resolution inputs while trained with only low-resolution samples. We\nalso introduce Kubric-NK, a new benchmark for evaluating optical flow methods\nwith input resolutions ranging from 1K to 8K. Our high-resolution evaluation\npushes the boundaries of existing methods and reveals new insights about their\ngeneralization capabilities. Extensive experimental results show that DPFlow\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the MPI-Sintel, KITTI 2015, Spring, and\nother high-resolution benchmarks.",

To achieve this, a binary variable is incorporated into the\nobjective function of the primal SVM formulation, replacing the traditional\nslack variable. Furthermore, each misclassified sample is assigned a priority\nand an associated constraint. The resulting formulation is a mixed-integer\nprogramming model, efficiently solved using Benders decomposition.

These hypotheses were evaluated using a Wilcoxon test across\nmultiple publicly available datasets from the OpenML repository. The results\nsupported both hypotheses (\\( p < 0.05 \\)).

The inherent\nfrequency dependence of meta-atom resonances degrades performance as operating\nconditions change, making real-time, frequency-agnostic metasurface property\nprediction crucial for practical deployment. Yet, accurately predicting\nmetasurface behavior across different frequencies remains challenging.\nTraditional simulations struggle with complexity, while standard deep learning\nmodels often overfit or generalize poorly. To address this, we introduce\nMetaFAP (Meta-Learning for Frequency-Agnostic Prediction), a novel framework\nbuilt on the meta-learning paradigm for predicting metasurface properties. By\ntraining on diverse frequency tasks, MetaFAP learns broadly applicable\npatterns. This allows it to adapt quickly to new spectral conditions with\nminimal data, solving key limitations of existing methods. Experimental\nevaluations demonstrate that MetaFAP reduces prediction errors by an order of\nmagnitude in MSE and MAE while maintaining high Pearson correlations.\nRemarkably, it achieves inference in less than a millisecond, bypassing the\ncomputational bottlenecks of traditional simulations, which take minutes per\nunit cell and scale poorly with array size. These improvements enable real-time\nRIS optimization in dynamic environments and support scalable,\nfrequency-agnostic designs. MetaFAP thus bridges the gap between intelligent\nelectromagnetic systems and practical deployment, offering a critical tool for\nnext-generation wireless networks.",

As the\ntimescale defining bursts increases, individual events are sequentially merged\nto become small bursts and then bigger ones, eventually leading to the single\nburst containing all events. Such a merging pattern has been depicted by a tree\nthat fully reveals the hierarchical structure of bursts, thus called a burst\ntree. The burst-tree structure can be simply characterized by a burst-merging\nkernel that dictates which bursts are merged together as the timescale\nincreases.

To\nreview vulnerabilities detected by ML predictions, developers manually assess\nsuspicious lines in their interpretations. However, studies have revealed that\nthese models often learn and predict based on irrelevant features frequently\nappearing in vulnerable code. This leads to predictions that may correctly flag\nvulnerable functions but for the wrong reasons, which we call untrustworthy.\nThese predictions can mislead developers, hindering them from locating the\nvulnerabilities. This increases the efforts of manual assessment and, worse,\nrisks creating flawed patches that fail to address existing vulnerabilities and\neven introduce new ones. Hence, automated approaches are needed to detect\nuntrustworthy predictions, preventing overlooked vulnerabilities and\nalleviating the burden of manual assessment.\n  We propose UntrustVul, the first automated approach to identify untrustworthy\nvulnerability predictions. Given a vulnerability prediction during inference,\nUntrustVul systematically assesses whether suspicious lines annotated by the\nprediction are vulnerability-unrelated. It simulates developers' rationales,\nconsidering a line unrelated if (1) it is absent from historical\nvulnerabilities and (2) it cannot reach any vulnerabilities in execution flows.\nUntrustVul assesses (1) by analysing its syntactic meaning using deep\nrepresentations to determine whether it is syntax-benign.

The continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD)\noffers the potential advantage of achieving a higher secret key rate (SKR)\nwithin a metro area, as well as being compatible with the mature telecom\nindustry. However, the SKR and transmission distance of state-of-the-art CV-QKD\nsystems are currently limited. Here, based on the novelly proposed\northogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) CV-QKD protocol, we\ndemonstrate for the first time a high-rate multi-carrier (MC) CV-QKD with a 10\nGHz symbol rate that chieves Gbps SKR within 10km and Mbps SKR over 100 km in\nthe finite-size regime under composable security against collective attacks.\nThe record-breaking results are achieved by suitable optimization of subcarrier\nnumber and modulation variance, well-controlled excess noise induced by both\nOFDM mechanism and efficient DSP scheme, and high-performance post-processing\ncapacity realized by heterogeneous computing scheme. The composable finite-size\nSKR reaches 1779.45 Mbps@5km, 1025.49 Mbps@10km, 370.50 Mbps@25km, 99.93\nMbps@50km, 25.70 Mbps@75km,and 2.25 Mbps@100km, which improves the SKR by two\norders of magnitude and quintuples the maximal transmission distance compared\nto most recently reported CV-QKD results [Nature Communications, 13, 4740\n(2022)]. Interestingly, it is experimentally verified that the SKR of the\nproposed MC CV-QKD can approach five times larger than that of the\nsingle-carrier CV-QKD with the same symbol rate without additional hardware\ncosts.

However, it's\nchallenging to determine a suitable threshold to distinguish extreme conflicts\nin an objective way. The subjective and arbitrary selection of the threshold in\nthe peak over threshold approach can result in biased estimation outcomes. This\nstudy proposes a Bayesian hierarchical hybrid modeling (BHHM) framework for the\nthreshold estimation in the peak over threshold approach. Specifically, BHHM is\nbased on a piecewise function to model the general conflicts with specific\ndistribution while model the extreme conflicts with generalized Pareto\ndistribution (GPD). The Bayesian hierarchical structure is used to combine\ntraffic conflicts from different sites, incorporating covariates and\nsite-specific unobserved heterogeneity. Five non-stationary BHHM models,\nincluding Normal-GPD, Cauchy-GPD, Logistic-GPD, Gamma-GPD, and Lognormal-GPD\nmodels, were developed and compared. Traditional graphical diagnostic and\nquantile regression approaches were also used for comparison. Traffic conflicts\ncollected from three signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British\nColumbia were used for the study. The results show that the proposed BHHM\napproach could estimate the threshold parameter objectively. The Lognormal-GPD\nmodel is superior to the other four BHHM models in terms of crash estimation\naccuracy and model fit. The crash estimates using the threshold determined by\nthe BHHM outperform those estimated based on the graphical diagnostic and\nquantile regression approaches, indicating the superiority of the proposed\nthreshold determination approach.

However, traditional methods often treat them as\nseparate tasks, leading to suboptimal performance, spatio-temporal\ninconsistencies, and inefficiency in complex scenarios due to the absence of\ninformation sharing. This paper proposes a multi-task SemanticFlow framework to\nsimultaneously predict scene flow and instance segmentation of full-resolution\npoint clouds. The novelty of this work is threefold: 1) developing a\ncoarse-to-fine prediction based multi-task scheme, where an initial coarse\nsegmentation of static backgrounds and dynamic objects is used to provide\ncontextual information for refining motion and semantic information through a\nshared feature processing module; 2) developing a set of loss functions to\nenhance the performance of scene flow estimation and instance segmentation,\nwhile can help ensure spatial and temporal consistency of both static and\ndynamic objects within traffic scenes; 3) developing a self-supervised learning\nscheme, which utilizes coarse segmentation to detect rigid objects and compute\ntheir transformation matrices between sequential frames, enabling the\ngeneration of self-supervised labels. The proposed framework is validated on\nthe Argoverse and Waymo datasets, demonstrating superior performance in\ninstance segmentation accuracy, scene flow estimation, and computational\nefficiency, establishing a new benchmark for self-supervised methods in dynamic\nscene understanding.",

We argue that the key to solving this\nproblem lies in supplementing missing information for these areas. To this end,\nwe propose DP-Recon, which employs diffusion priors in the form of Score\nDistillation Sampling (SDS) to optimize the neural representation of each\nindividual object under novel views.

Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) and\nprivacy-enhancing technologies, particularly federated learning (FL), have\nemerged in recent years as innovative solutions to balance privacy protection\nwith data utility; however, they also suffer from inherent privacy\nvulnerabilities. Gradient inversion attacks constitute major threats to data\nsharing in federated learning. Researchers have proposed many defenses against\ngradient inversion attacks. However, current defense methods for healthcare\ndata lack generalizability, i.e., existing solutions may not be applicable to\ndata from a broader range of populations. In addition, most existing defense\nmethods are tested using non-healthcare data, which raises concerns about their\napplicability to real-world healthcare systems. In this study, we present a\ndefense against gradient inversion attacks in federated learning. We achieve\nthis using latent data perturbation and minimax optimization, utilizing both\ngeneral and medical image datasets. Our method is compared to two baselines,\nand the results show that our approach can outperform the baselines with a\nreduction of 12.5% in the attacker's accuracy in classifying reconstructed\nimages. The proposed method also yields an increase of over 12.4% in Mean\nSquared Error (MSE) between the original and reconstructed images at the same\nlevel of model utility of around 90% client classification accuracy. The\nresults suggest the potential of a generalizable defense for healthcare data.",

To\naddress this gap, we introduce Poly-FEVER, a large-scale multilingual fact\nverification benchmark specifically designed for evaluating hallucination\ndetection in LLMs. Poly-FEVER comprises 77,973 labeled factual claims spanning\n11 languages, sourced from FEVER, Climate-FEVER, and SciFact.

    "abstract": "The traditional paradigm to update retrieval models requires re-computing the\nembeddings of the gallery data, a time-consuming and computationally intensive\nprocess known as backfilling. To circumvent backfilling, Backward-Compatible\nLearning (BCL) has been widely explored, which aims to train a new model\ncompatible with the old one. Many previous works focus on effectively aligning\nthe embeddings of the new model with those of the old one to enhance the\nbackward-compatibility. Nevertheless, such strong alignment constraints would\ncompromise the discriminative ability of the new model, particularly when\ndifferent classes are closely clustered and hard to distinguish in the old\nfeature space. To address this issue, we propose to relax the constraints by\nintroducing perturbations to the old feature prototypes. This allows us to\nalign the new feature space with a pseudo-old feature space defined by these\nperturbed prototypes, thereby preserving the discriminative ability of the new\nmodel in backward-compatible learning. We have developed two approaches for\ncalculating the perturbations: Neighbor-Driven Prototype Perturbation (NDPP)\nand Optimization-Driven Prototype Perturbation (ODPP). Particularly, they take\ninto account the feature distributions of not only the old but also the new\nmodels to obtain proper perturbations along with new model updating.

We further demonstrate the possibility of backwards deflection for\nsquare particles with backward orientation under steep impact angles, which is\nnot possible for round particles under the same conditions.

Specifically,\n(i) theoretically, we formulate the impact of fine-grained preferences on model\nstability as a Lipschitz constrain; (ii) empirically, we discover that scaling\nthe supervision bandwidth can act as an implicit Lipschitz regularizer, stably\noptimizing existing CTR models to achieve better generalizability. Extensive\nexperiments show that this scaled supervision significantly and consistently\nimproves the optimization process and the performance of existing CTR models,\neven without the need for additional hyperparameter tuning.",

A tablet-based interface\nwas developed for a user study by implementing the concepts introduced in the\nframework, where operators guided a robotic swarm in a single-target search\ntask, marking hazardous cells unknown to the swarm. Both subjective and\nobjective situation awareness measures were used, with task performance\nevaluated based on how close the robots were to the target. The framework\nenabled a structured investigation of the role of situation awareness in human\nswarm interaction, leading to key findings such as improved task performance\nacross attempts, showing the interface was learnable, centroid active robot\nposition proved to be a useful task performance metric for assessing situation\nawareness, perception and projection played a key role in task performance,\nhighlighting their importance in interface design and objective situation\nawareness influenced both subjective situation awareness and task performance,\nemphasizing the need for interfaces that emphasise objective situation\nawareness. These findings validate our framework as a structured approach for\nintegrating situation awareness concepts into human swarm interaction studies,\noffering a systematic way to assess situation awareness and task performance.\nThe framework can be applied to other swarming studies to evaluate interface\nlearnability, identify meaningful task performance metrics, and refine\ninterface designs to enhance situation awareness, ultimately improving human\nswarm interaction in dynamic environments.",

Existing hierarchical approaches often\ntarget discrete settings and do not generalize across tasks. We propose a\nhierarchical reinforcement learning approach that addresses these limitations\nby dynamically planning over the expert-specified abstraction to generate\nsubgoals to learn a goal-conditioned policy. To overcome the challenges of\nlearning under sparse rewards, we shape the reward based on the optimal state\nvalue in the abstract model. This structured decision-making process enhances\nsample efficiency and facilitates zero-shot generalization.

The Ta-on-Si platform comprises a simple material stack\nthat can potentially be fabricated at wafer scale, and therefore can be readily\ntranslated to large-scale quantum processors.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread consumption of AI-generated content, there has been an\nincreased focus on developing automated tools to verify the factual accuracy of\nsuch content. However, prior research and tools developed for fact verification\ntreat it as a binary classification or a linear regression problem. Although\nthis is a useful mechanism as part of automatic guardrails in systems, we argue\nthat such tools lack transparency in the prediction reasoning and diversity in\nsource evidence to provide a trustworthy user experience. We develop\nFacts&Evidence - an interactive and transparent tool for user-driven\nverification of complex text. The tool facilitates the intricate\ndecision-making involved in fact-verification, presenting its users a breakdown\nof complex input texts to visualize the credibility of individual claims along\nwith an explanation of model decisions and attribution to multiple, diverse\nevidence sources. Facts&Evidence aims to empower consumers of machine-generated\ntext and give them agency to understand, verify, selectively trust and use such\ntext.",

    "abstract": "The adversarial Bandit with Knapsack problem is a multi-armed bandits problem\nwith budget constraints and adversarial rewards and costs. In each round, a\nlearner selects an action to take and observes the reward and cost of the\nselected action. The goal is to maximize the sum of rewards while satisfying\nthe budget constraint. The classical benchmark to compare against is the best\nfixed distribution over actions that satisfies the budget constraint in\nexpectation. Unlike its stochastic counterpart, where rewards and costs are\ndrawn from some fixed distribution (Badanidiyuru et al., 2018), the adversarial\nBwK problem does not admit a no-regret algorithm for every problem instance due\nto the \"spend-or-save\" dilemma (Immorlica et al., 2022).\n  A key problem left open by existing works is whether there exists a weaker\nbut still meaningful benchmark to compare against such that no-regret learning\nis still possible. In this work, we present a new benchmark to compare against,\nmotivated both by real-world applications such as autobidding and by its\nunderlying mathematical structure. The benchmark is based on the Earth Mover's\nDistance (EMD), and we show that sublinear regret is attainable against any\nstrategy whose spending pattern is within EMD $o(T^2)$ of any sub-pacing\nspending pattern.\n  As a special case, we obtain results against the \"pacing over windows\"\nbenchmark, where we partition time into disjoint windows of size $w$ and allow\nthe benchmark strategies to choose a different distribution over actions for\neach window while satisfying a pacing budget constraint. Against this\nbenchmark, our algorithm obtains a regret bound of\n$\\tilde{O}(T/\\sqrt{w}+\\sqrt{wT})$. We also show a matching lower bound, proving\nthe optimality of our algorithm in this important special case. In addition, we\nprovide further evidence of the necessity of the EMD condition for obtaining a\nsublinear regret.",

    "abstract": "Observational data is often readily available in large quantities, but can\nlead to biased causal effect estimates due to the presence of unobserved\nconfounding. Recent works attempt to remove this bias by supplementing\nobservational data with experimental data, which, when available, is typically\non a smaller scale due to the time and cost involved in running a randomised\ncontrolled trial. In this work, we prove a theorem that places fundamental\nlimits on this ``best of both worlds'' approach. Using the framework of\nimpossible inference, we show that although it is possible to use experimental\ndata to \\emph{falsify} causal effect estimates from observational data, in\ngeneral it is not possible to \\emph{validate} such estimates. Our theorem\nproves that while experimental data can be used to detect bias in observational\nstudies, without additional assumptions on the smoothness of the correction\nfunction, it can not be used to remove it. We provide a practical example of\nsuch an assumption, developing a novel Gaussian Process based approach to\nconstruct intervals which contain the true treatment effect with high\nprobability, both inside and outside of the support of the experimental data.\nWe demonstrate our methodology on both simulated and semi-synthetic datasets\nand make the \\href{https://github.com/Jakefawkes/Obs_and_exp_data}{code\navailable}.",

    "abstract": "We study the Hodge filtrations of Schmid and Vilonen on unipotent\nrepresentations of real reductive groups. We show that for various well-defined\nclasses of unipotent representations (including, for example, the oscillator\nrepresentations of metaplectic groups, the minimal representations of all\nsimple groups, and all unipotent representations of complex groups) the Hodge\nfiltration coincides with the quantization filtration predicted by the Orbit\nMethod. We deduce a number of longstanding conjectures about such\nrepresentations, including a proof that they are unitary and a description of\ntheir $K$-types in terms of co-adjoint orbits. The proofs rely heavily on\ncertain good homological properties of the Hodge filtrations on weakly\nunipotent representations, which are established using a Hodge-theoretic\nupgrade of the Beilinson-Bernstein theory of intertwining functors for\n$\\mathcal{D}$-modules on the flag variety. The latter consists of an action of\nthe affine Hecke algebra on a category of filtered monodromic\n$\\mathcal{D}$-modules, which we use to compare Hodge filtrations coming from\ndifferent localizations of the same representation. As an application of the\nsame methods, we also prove a new cohomology vanishing theorem for mixed Hodge\nmodules on partial flag varieties.",
