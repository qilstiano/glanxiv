    "abstract": "Extracting optical flow from videos remains a core computer vision problem.\nMotivated by the success of large general-purpose models, we ask whether frozen\nself-supervised video models trained only for future frame prediction can be\nprompted, without fine-tuning, to output flow. Prior work reading out depth or\nillumination from video generators required fine-tuning, which is impractical\nfor flow where labels are scarce and synthetic datasets suffer from a\nsim-to-real gap. Inspired by the Counterfactual World Model (CWM) paradigm,\nwhich can obtain point-wise correspondences by injecting a small tracer\nperturbation into a next-frame predictor and tracking its propagation, we\nextend this idea to generative video models. We explore several popular\narchitectures and find that successful zero-shot flow extraction in this manner\nis aided by three model properties: (1) distributional prediction of future\nframes (avoiding blurry or noisy outputs); (2) factorized latents that treat\neach spatio-temporal patch independently; and (3) random-access decoding that\ncan condition on any subset of future pixels. These properties are uniquely\npresent in the recent Local Random Access Sequence (LRAS) architecture.\nBuilding on LRAS, we propose KL-tracing: a novel test-time procedure that\ninjects a localized perturbation into the first frame, rolls out the model one\nstep, and computes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between perturbed and\nunperturbed predictive distributions. Without any flow-specific fine-tuning,\nour method outperforms state-of-the-art models on real-world TAP-Vid DAVIS\ndataset (16.6% relative improvement for endpoint error) and synthetic TAP-Vid\nKubric (4.7% relative improvement). Our results indicate that counterfactual\nprompting of controllable generative video models is a scalable and effective\nalternative to supervised or photometric-loss approaches for high-quality flow.",

The preservation of\nbiodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the\nsustainability of ecosystems.

Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local\nand global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and\nconservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation\nModels (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by\nleveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to\nvarious downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity\nconservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model\ntailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst\nemploys a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal\ndatasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators,\nclimate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability,\nallowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species\ndistribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species\ndetection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's\nperformance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability\ncompared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two\ndistinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological\nforecasting.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method of executable steganography using the\nalpha transparency layer of ICO image files to embed and deliver\nself-decompressing JavaScript payloads within web browsers. By targeting the\nleast significant bit (LSB) of non-transparent alpha layer image values, the\nproposed method successfully conceals compressed JavaScript code inside a\nfavicon image without affecting visual fidelity. Global web traffic loads 294\nbillion favicons daily and consume 0.9 petabytes of network bandwidth. A\nproof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that a 64x64 ICO image can embed\nup to 512 bytes uncompressed, or 0.8 kilobyte when using lightweight two-fold\ncompression. On page load, a browser fetches the favicon as part of standard\nbehavior, allowing an embedded loader script to extract and execute the payload\nentirely in memory using native JavaScript APIs and canvas pixel access. This\ncreates a two-stage covert channel requiring no additional network or user\nrequests. Testing across multiple browsers in both desktop and mobile\nenvironments confirms successful and silent execution of the embedded script.\nWe evaluate the threat model, relate it to polymorphic phishing attacks that\nevade favicon-based detection, and analyze evasion of content security policies\nand antivirus scanners. We map nine example MITRE ATT&CK Framework objectives\nto single line JavaScript to execute arbitrarily in ICO files. Existing\nsteganalysis and sanitization defenses are discussed, highlighting limitations\nin detecting or neutralizing alpha-channel exploits. The results demonstrate a\nstealthy and reusable attack surface that blurs traditional boundaries between\nstatic images and executable content. Because modern browsers report silent\nerrors when developers specifically fail to load ICO files, this attack surface\noffers an interesting example of required web behaviors that in turn compromise\nsecurity.",

This was\nseen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that\ndescribes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay\ndepends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir\ncorrelations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the\nLiouvillian will be different.

Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian\nreveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the\nthermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase.

    "abstract": "Given $n \\geq 3$, a combinatorial object called a \\textit{ pedigree } is\ndefined using $3$-element subsets from $[n]$ obeying certain conditions. The\nconvex hull of pedigrees is called the pedigree polytope for $n$. Pedigrees are\nin $1-1$ correspondence with Hamiltonian cycles. Properties of pedigrees,\npedigree polytopes, adjacency structure of the graph of the pedigree polytope\nand their implication on the adjacency structure of the Symmetric Travelling\nSalesman problem (STSP) polytope have been studied earlier in the literature by\nthe author.\n  The question: Given $X$, does it belong to the pedigree polytope for $n$? is\ncalled the membership problem. This article provides proof that the membership\nproblem for pedigree polytopes can be solved efficiently. Due to the pedigree's\nstem property, we can check the membership problem sequentially for $ k \\in [4,\nn]$. One constructs a layered network, recursively, to check membership in the\npedigree polytope. Proof of the proposed framework's validity is given. This\narticle's significant and far-reaching contribution is that the membership\nproblem has a strongly polynomial-time framework.\n  Since the polynomial solvability of the membership problem implies that one\ncan solve efficiently any linear optimisation problem over the pedigree\npolytope. And a specific linear optimisation over the pedigree polytope (the\nmultistage insertion formulation) solves the STSP.\n  The consequence of this result is that we have proof of $NP = P$. A recent\nbook by the author entitled \\textit{Pedigree Polytopes} brings together\npublished results on pedigrees and some new results, mainly in Chapters 5 and\n6. The primary purpose of this article is to present the latest results from\nthat book in a self-contained fashion so that experts can vet the same.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal\nextensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding.\nHowever, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and\ncomprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent\nefforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for\nextreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and\nVideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive\ncontexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant\ncomputational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual\ntokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence,\ntracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended\nperiods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning\nsystems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical,\nalbeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video\nUnderstanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand,\nand reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We\nargue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research\nobjective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI,\nresearch communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming\narchitectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive\nrepresentations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms.\nDrawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and\nseveral closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research\ndirections towards achieving this transformative capability.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of quantum computing presents profound challenges to existing\ncryptographic infrastructures, whilst the development of central bank digital\ncurrencies (CBDCs) has raised concerns regarding privacy preservation and\nexcessive centralisation in digital payment systems. This paper proposes the\nQuantum-Resilient Privacy Ledger (QRPL) as an innovative token-based digital\ncurrency architecture that incorporates National Institute of Standards and\nTechnology (NIST)-standardised post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with hash-based\nzero-knowledge proofs to ensure user sovereignty, scalability, and transaction\nconfidentiality. Key contributions include adaptations of ephemeral proof\nchains for unlinkable transactions, a privacy-weighted Proof-of-Stake (PoS)\nconsensus to promote equitable participation, and a novel zero-knowledge\nproof-based mechanism for privacy-preserving selective disclosure. QRPL aims to\naddress critical shortcomings in prevailing CBDC designs, including risks of\npervasive surveillance, with a 10-20 second block time to balance security and\nthroughput in future monetary systems. While conceptual, empirical prototypes\nare planned. Future work includes prototype development to validate these\nmodels empirically.",

Here we use a\ncombination of scaled down laboratory experiments and direct numerical\nsimulations (DNS) to assess the flow patterns and infection risks in a\nsimplified waiting line setting. We observed the presence of fluid dynamical\ncountercurrents, due to the competing effects of line kinematics and thermal\ngradients, which can either heighten or suppress the risks of transmission.\nDepending on the walking speed, an intermediate ambient temperature range can\npotentially heighten the infection risks by allowing the breath plume to linger\nin the air for extended durations; however, colder and warmer ambients both\nsuppress the spread. The current guideline of increasing physical separation\nhas limited impact on reducing transmission in the waiting line setting.

While imitation learning in discrete\nsettings such as autoregressive language modeling has seen immense success and\npopularity in recent years, imitation in physical settings such as autonomous\ndriving and robot learning has proven comparably more complex due to the\ncompounding errors problem, often requiring elaborate set-ups to perform\nstably.

To this end, we present minimal interventions that provably\nmitigate compounding errors in continuous state-and-action imitation learning.\nWhen the system is open-loop stable, we prescribe \"action chunking,\" i.e.,\npredicting and playing sequences of actions in open-loop; when the system is\npossibly unstable, we prescribe \"noise injection,\" i.e., adding noise during\nexpert demonstrations.

In addition to establishing parameter identifiability, we\npresent scalable computing via a combination of elliptical slice sampling, fast\ncirculant embedding techniques, and smoothing of hard constraints, leading to\nstraightforward estimation of parameters, and state occupation and transition\nprobabilities.

Centrality metrics have long\nbeen pivotal in understanding the dynamics of information flow, particularly in\nthe context of health misinformation. However, the increasing complexity and\ndynamism of online networks, especially during crises, highlight the\nlimitations of these traditional approaches. This study introduces and compares\nthree novel centrality metrics: dynamic influence centrality (DIC), health\nmisinformation vulnerability centrality (MVC), and propagation centrality (PC).\nThese metrics incorporate temporal dynamics, susceptibility, and multilayered\nnetwork interactions. Using the FibVID dataset, we compared traditional and\nnovel metrics to identify influential nodes, propagation pathways, and\nmisinformation influencers. Traditional metrics identified 29 influential\nnodes, while the new metrics uncovered 24 unique nodes, resulting in 42\ncombined nodes, an increase of 44.83%. Baseline interventions reduced health\nmisinformation by 50%, while incorporating the new metrics increased this to\n62.5%, an improvement of 25%. To evaluate the broader applicability of the\nproposed metrics, we validated our framework on a second dataset, Monant\nMedical Misinformation, which covers a diverse range of health misinformation\ndiscussions beyond COVID-19. The results confirmed that the advanced metrics\ngeneralised successfully, identifying distinct influential actors not captured\nby traditional methods.

    "abstract": "Anisotropic anomalous dust diffusion in microgravity dusty plasma is\ninvestigated using experimental data from the Plasmakristall-4 (PK-4) facility\non board the International Space Station. The PK-4 experiment uses video\ncameras to track individual dust particles, which allows for the collection of\nlarge amounts of statistical information on the dust particle positions and\nvelocities. In Part One of this paper, these statistics were used to quantify\nanomalous dust diffusion caused by anisotropies in the plasma-mediated\ndust-dust interactions in PK-4. Here we use scaling relations to convert\nstatistical parameters extracted from data into input parameters for a\nHamiltonian spectral model. The kinetic energy term of the Hamiltonian\n(modeling anomalous diffusion) is informed from the dust displacement\ndistribution functions, while the potential energy term (modeling\nstochasticity) is informed from fluctuations in the dust positions. The\nspectrum of energy states for each Hamiltonian is studied to assess probability\nfor extended states (i.e., a continuous portion of the spectrum). The spectral\nmodel shows that the combination of nonlocality and stochasticity leads to high\nprobability for transport at certain scales in Hilbert space, which coincide\nwith the characteristic spatial scales of dust particle jumps observed in the\nexperiments. Lastly, we discuss how this spectral approach is generalizable to\nmany complex systems, such as electron transport in 2D materials where\nstatistical models are not feasible.",

The method requires\nthe evolution of only a few additional quantities characterizing the\ncomposition, of which the nuclear rates of change are obtained at each location\nand time step from neural networks trained by a large set of trajectories from\nfull nuclear-network calculations. The scheme is tested by comparing\nspherically symmetric wind simulations and long-term simulations of NSMs using\nRHINE with post-processing results from nucleosynthesis calculations, where we\nfind very good agreement. In our NSM models on average about 2.3MeV, 0.7MeV,\nand 2.1MeV are released per baryon in dynamical ejecta, NS-torus ejecta, and\nblack-hole (BH) torus ejecta, respectively. The strongest velocity boost is\nobserved for BH-torus ejecta, which also become 40% more massive with r-process\nheating. The nucleosynthesis yields are only mildly affected by r-process\nheating, but the kilonova gets significantly brighter once the BH-torus ejecta\nbecome visible. RHINE can be readily implemented in existing hydrodynamics\ncodes using pre-trained machine-learning data and routines for source-term\nprediction that we provide online.",

To address this, we propose a novel reformulation of requirements\nextraction as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task based on the\nsequence-to-sequence (Seq2seq) generation approach. With this aim, we propose a\nSeq2seq framework, incorporating a BiLSTM encoder and an LSTM decoder, enhanced\nwith a self-attention mechanism, GloVe embeddings, and a CRF model.

While overdispersion has been extensively studied,\nconditional underdispersion -- where latent structure renders data more regular\nthan Poisson -- remains underexplored, in part due to the lack of tractable\nmodeling tools. We introduce a new class of models based on discrete order\nstatistics, where observed counts are assumed to be an order statistic (e.g.,\nminimum, median, maximum) of i.i.d. draws from some discrete parent, such as\nthe Poisson or negative binomial. We develop a general data augmentation scheme\nthat is modular with existing tools tailored to the parent distribution,\nenabling parameter estimation or posterior inference in a wide range of such\nmodels. We characterize properties of Poisson and negative binomial order\nstatistics, exposing interpretable knobs on their dispersion. We apply our\nframework to four case studies -- i.e., to commercial flight times, COVID-19\ncase counts, Finnish bird abundance, and RNA sequencing data -- and illustrate\nthe flexibility and generality of the proposed framework.

    "abstract": "We propose Lizard, a linearization framework that transforms pretrained\nTransformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) into flexible, subquadratic\narchitectures for infinite-context generation. Transformer-based LLMs face\nsignificant memory and computational bottlenecks as context lengths increase,\ndue to the quadratic complexity of softmax attention and the growing key-value\n(KV) cache. Lizard addresses these limitations by introducing a subquadratic\nattention mechanism that closely approximates softmax attention while\npreserving the output quality. Unlike previous linearization methods, which are\noften limited by fixed model structures and therefore exclude gating\nmechanisms, Lizard incorporates a gating module inspired by recent\nstate-of-the-art linear models. This enables adaptive memory control, supports\nconstant-memory inference, offers strong length generalization, and allows more\nflexible model design. Lizard combines gated linear attention for global\ncontext compression with sliding window attention enhanced by meta memory,\nforming a hybrid mechanism that captures both long-range dependencies and\nfine-grained local interactions. Moreover, we introduce a hardware-aware\nalgorithm that accelerates the training speed of our models. Extensive\nexperiments show that Lizard achieves near-lossless recovery of the teacher\nmodel's performance across standard language modeling tasks, while\nsignificantly outperforming previous linearization methods. On the 5-shot MMLU\nbenchmark, Lizard improves over prior models by 18 points and shows significant\nimprovements on associative recall tasks.",

These are credentials\nthat are managed throughout the key lifecycle by an authenticator on behalf of\nthe user and offer strong security guarantees.\n  Passwords remain the dominant mode of SSH authentication, despite their well\nknown flaws such as phishing and reuse. SSH's custom key-based authentication\nprotocol can alleviate these issues but remains vulnerable to key theft.\nAdditionally, it has poor usability, with even knowledgeable users leaking key\nmaterial and failing to verify fingerprints. Hence, effective key management\nremains a critical open area in SSH security. In contrast, WebAuthn is a modern\nauthentication standard designed to replace passwords, managing keys on behalf\nof the user. As a web API, this standard cannot integrate with SSH directly.\n  We propose a framework to integrate WebAuthn with SSH servers, by using UNIX\npluggable authentication modules (PAM). Our approach is backwards-compatible,\nsupports stock SSH servers and requires no new software client-side. It offers\nprotection for cryptographic material at rest, resistance to key leaks,\nphishing protection, privacy protection and attestation capability. None of\nthese properties are offered by passwords nor traditional SSH keys. We validate\nthese advantages with a structured, conceptual security analysis.\n  We develop a prototype implementation and conduct a user study to quantify\nthe security advantages of our proposal, testing our prototype with 40 SSH\nusers. The study confirms the security problems of SSH-keys, including 20% of\nthe cohort leaking their private keys. Our SSH-passkeys effectively address\nthese problems: we find a 90% reduction in critical security errors, while\nreducing authentication time by 4x on average.",

However, our systematic analysis\nreveals that current evaluation methodologies frequently exhibit fundamental\nflaws, often manifesting as common evaluation anti-patterns that obscure true\nperformance characteristics and impede scientific progress. Through a\ncomprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring\nanti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup,\nand Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM\ninference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode\noperations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict\ntemporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common\nanti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate\nengineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to\nrepresent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial\nperformance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions.\nTo address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from\nour analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these\nanti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the\npractical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing\nspeculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is\neasily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these\nanti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation\nmethodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results,\nand ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving\nbeyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements.",

Strong imagers described complex, naturalistic content, while\nweak imagers reported simple geometric patterns. Embeddings from vision\nlanguage models better captured these differences than text-only language\nmodels, and participants with stronger imagery used language with richer\nsensorimotor associations. These findings may reflect individual variation in\ncoordination between early visual areas and higher-order regions relevant for\nthe imagery spectrum.",

Using NeRF, we reconstruct\nthe 3D geometry from the initial multi-view images, leveraging its capability\nto synthesize novel viewpoints and capture intricate surface details. The\nreconstructed geometry is then used to initialize material point positions for\nthe MPM simulation, where the friction angle remains unknown.

By employing Bayesian optimization, we minimize the image loss to\nestimate the best-fitting friction angle.

The observed behavior is consistent with\ntwo possible scenarios: (i) a delayed spherical outflow launched about 620 days\npost-disruption with a velocity of ~0.3c and an energy of ~10^50 erg, and (ii)\na highly off-axis (~80-90 deg) relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of Gamma\n~8 and E_K ~ 10^52 erg. Continued radio observations to capture the light curve\npeak, as well as VLBI observations, could distinguish between these scenarios.",

We develop a\nphysics-constrained machine learning framework that augments transport models\nand boundary conditions to extend the applicability of continuum solvers in\nnonequilibrium hypersonic regimes. We employ deep learning PDE models (DPMs)\nfor the viscous stress and heat flux embedded in the governing PDEs and trained\nvia adjoint-based optimization. We evaluate these for two-dimensional\nsupersonic flat-plate flows across a range of Mach and Knudsen numbers.\nAdditionally, we introduce a wall model based on a mixture of skewed Gaussian\napproximations of the particle velocity distribution function. This wall model\nreplaces empirical slip conditions with physically informed, data-driven\nboundary conditions for the streamwise velocity and wall temperature. Our\nresults show that a trace-free anisotropic viscosity model, paired with the\nskewed-Gaussian distribution function wall model, achieves significantly\nimproved accuracy, particularly at high-Mach and high-Knudsen number regimes.\nStrategies such as parallel training across multiple Knudsen numbers and\ninclusion of high-Mach data during training are shown to enhance model\ngeneralization.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in developing Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs) capable of processing both textual and visual inputs. These\nmodels have demonstrated impressive performance, leading to their widespread\nadoption in various applications. However, this widespread raises serious\nconcerns regarding user privacy, particularly when models inadvertently process\nor expose private visual information. In this work, we frame the preservation\nof privacy in VLMs as an adversarial attack problem. We propose a novel attack\nstrategy that selectively conceals information within designated Region Of\nInterests (ROIs) in an image, effectively preventing VLMs from accessing\nsensitive content while preserving the semantic integrity of the remaining\nimage. Unlike conventional adversarial attacks that often disrupt the entire\nimage, our method maintains high coherence in unmasked areas. Experimental\nresults across three state-of-the-art VLMs namely LLaVA, Instruct-BLIP, and\nBLIP2-T5 demonstrate up to 98% reduction in detecting targeted ROIs, while\nmaintaining global image semantics intact, as confirmed by high similarity\nscores between clean and adversarial outputs. We believe that this work\ncontributes to a more privacy conscious use of multimodal models and offers a\npractical tool for further research, with the source code publicly available\nat: https://github.com/hbrachemi/Vlm_defense-attack.",

Although this sparsity\npresents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it\nrequires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct\nprediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast\nnumber of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and\nutilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation\npattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently,\nwe group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative\nclusters.

With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our\napproach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness\nin preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By\npredicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future\nmodels can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids.\nWe detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing\nmeaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve\nsparse computation efficiency.

Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using\nPoisson regression models.

Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though\nmale patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased\nstigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25),\nwith similar patterns of doubt markers.

This paper theoretically\nanalyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role\nof guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling\n(when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage\nguidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation\nfor empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The\nanalysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These\nimplementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as\nunmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the\nquality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the\nanalysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically\napplicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the\ntransport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform)\ndistribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method\nis achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is\nempirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete\ndiffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).",

    "abstract": "Results of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of porous-wall turbulent flows\nin open channels with conjugate heat transfer are reported in this work. For\nthe conductive porous walls considered here, the change in heat transfer is not\nmonotonic. The heat flux initially decreases when going from a conductive\nsmooth wall to slightly porous walls. In this initial porous-wall turbulence\nregime, the near-wall flow remains smooth-wall like and the heat transfer is\ndominated by molecular diffusion. As such, a reduction of the more favorably\nconducting solid material diminishes the overall heat transfer performance.\nBeyond a certain level of permeability however, the near-wall flow transitions\nto the K-H-like regime marked by the presence of cross-stream rollers, and the\nheat flux undergoes an increasing trend until it eventually surpasses that of\nsmooth-wall turbulence. Neglecting the thermal behavior of the solid material\ncan therefore result in overestimation of any gains in heat transfer.\nAdditionally, thermal performance is assessed in terms of the Reynolds analogy\nbreakdown, which is the disparity between the fractional increases in the\nStanton number, $St$, and the fractional increases in the skin-friction\ncoefficient, $C_f$, relative to smooth-wall flow. Similar to rough walls, the\nbreakdown is unfavorable for porous walls. The unfavorable breakdown in\nReynolds analogy is due to growing dissimilarities between the transfer of\nmomentum and heat in the vicinity of the porous wall as it becomes more\npermeable. Turbulent sweep and ejection type events contribute more\nsignificantly to momentum transfer across the permeable surface than they do to\nheat transfer. However, unlike for rough walls, a saturation limit for heat\ntransfer is not observed for the porous walls considered here. How much of a\nmaximum increase in heat transfer can be achieved is something that remains to\nbe determined.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present the first implementation of the face-centered cubic\n(FCC) lattice model for protein structure prediction with a quantum algorithm.\nOur motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the\nFCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures\nin proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square\ndeviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a\npolynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver\nwith constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods\nare successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2\n(ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state\nconfigurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative\nanalysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant\nenhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a\nthree-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal\nsolution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture,\nhighlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.",

Many popular and emerging FaaS applications such as machine learning\nand scientific computing can benefit from GPU acceleration. However, FaaS\nframeworks (such as OpenWhisk) are not capable of providing this acceleration\nbecause of the impedance mismatch between GPUs and the FaaS programming model,\nwhich requires virtualization and sandboxing of each function. The challenges\nare amplified due to the highly dynamic and heterogeneous FaaS workloads. This\npaper presents the design and implementation of a FaaS system for providing GPU\nacceleration in a black-box manner (without modifying function code). Running\nsmall functions in containerized sandboxes is challenging due to limited GPU\nconcurrency and high cold-start overheads, resulting in heavy queueing of\nfunction invocations. We show how principles from I/O scheduling, such as fair\nqueuing and anticipatory scheduling, can be translated to function scheduling\non GPUs.

A Boosted Trees\nmodel was trained to predict AHF based on measurements of segmented cardiac and\npulmonary structures from acute thoracic CT scans. Diagnostic labels for\ntraining and testing were extracted from radiology reports. Structures were\nsegmented with TotalSegmentator.

Due to a combination\nof observational biases, cluster evolution and lensing efficiency, most of the\nknown cluster lenses lie typically at $z_{l}\\sim0.2-0.7$, with only a few\nprominent examples at higher redshifts. Here we report a first strong-lensing\nanalysis of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0546-5345 at a redshift\n$z_l=1.07$. This cluster was first detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich\neffect, with a high estimated mass for its redshift of $M_{200,c} = (7.95 \\pm\n0.92) \\times 10^{14}\\,M_{\\odot}$. Using recent JWST/NIRCam and archival HST\nimaging, we identify at least 10 secure and 6 candidate sets of multiply imaged\nbackground galaxies, which we use to constrain the mass distribution in the\ncluster. We derive effective Einstein radii of $\\theta_{E}= 18.1 \\pm 1.8 ''$\nfor a source at $z_{s}=3$, and $\\theta_{E}= 27.9 \\pm 2.8 ''$ for a source at\n$z_{s}=9$.

Using data on\ndaily frequencies of the ten most capitalized cryptocurrencies from 2020 to\n2025, we compare two automated investment strategies.

The results show that the dynamic\noptimization strategy achieves significantly better performance in terms of\nrisk-adjusted returns, both in-sample and out-of-sample. This highlights the\nbenefits of adaptive techniques in portfolio management, particularly in\nvolatile markets such as cryptocurrency markets.

Specifically a series of publications\nstudied SBLA absorption systems with Lyman-$\\alpha$ flux transmission, $F_{Ly\n\\alpha} < 0.25$ on scales of 138 km s$^{-1}$ in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS). In order to better understand the connection between halos and these\nSBLAs, we make use of several million synthetic absorption spectra from the\nTNG50 cosmological simulation, at z=2 and z=3. We explore spectra with\nSDSS-like resolution in order to understand the nature of SBLAs as defined thus\nfar, as well as with high resolution (or 'resolved') spectra to generalise and\noptimise SBLAs as halo finders. For the SDSS SBLAs, we find that up to 78% of\nthese absorption systems reside in hlaos, where the stronger the absorption and\nthe lower the redshift, the higher the probability. We also manage to recover a\nmean halo mass of $10^{12.25} M_{\\odot}$, in line with what is measured in\nobservations. For the resolved SBLAs, we expand on the previous definition and\nallow the SBLA spectra size to vary between 54 km s$^{-1}$ and 483 km s$^{-1}$.\nWe find that the largest absorbers have the highest probability of finding\nhalos. When applying a hierarchical framework, where we allow the largest SBLAs\nto consume the smaller ones, we find that the halo mass distributions for each\nSBLA spectral size becomes narrower with respect to the non-hierarchical case.\nWe are also able to probe halo masses from $M_h \\approx 10^{9.5} M_{\\odot}$\n(for 100 km s$^{-1}$ SBLAs) to $M_h \\approx 10^{11.5} M_{\\odot}$ (for 450 km\ns$^{-1}$ SBLAs).

Interactions between anyons\ncan lead to emergent phenomena, such as anyon superconductivity as well as\nanyon condensation which allows for a hierarchical construction of quantum Hall\nstates. In this work, we study how quasihole anyons in a $\\nu=1/3$ Laughlin\nfractional quantum Hall state can be bound together by a sufficiently strong\nattractive impurity potential. The competition between the repulsive\ninteraction between the quasiholes themselves and the attractive interaction\nbetween the quasiholes and the impurity leads to states with different numbers\nof quasiholes bound to the impurity. Tuning the chemical potential via gating\nwhile remaining within a quantum Hall plateau changes the number of quasiholes\nbound to the impurity. We propose methods for studying these states\nexperimentally, for example using scanning tunneling microscopy and exciton\nspectroscopy. While the impurities in traditional platforms such as GaAs\nheterostructures are typically too weak to observe the binding of anyons, the\nrecently discovered zero-field fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$\noffer a platform which may realize the strong-impurity regime.",

Additionally, we test a variety of exponential\nmodels and show that none of them can simultaneously reproduce all three line\nprofiles with physically plausible parameters. The inadequacy of these models\nfor the Rosetta Stone implies that the scenario of electron scattering by an\nionized medium surrounding the BLR is not universally applicable to LRDs and\nAGN, and therefore provides a counterexample to the claim of a universal and\nsystematic overestimation of black hole masses.",

    "abstract": "The concept of causal abstraction got recently popularised to demystify the\nopaque decision-making processes of machine learning models; in short, a neural\nnetwork can be abstracted as a higher-level algorithm if there exists a\nfunction which allows us to map between them. Notably, most interpretability\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work.",

Existing autoregressive video generators either diverge from\nstandard LLM architectures, depend on bulky external text encoders, or incur\nprohibitive latency due to next-token decoding. In this paper, we introduce\nLumos-1, an autoregressive video generator that retains the LLM architecture\nwith minimal architectural modifications. To inject spatiotemporal correlations\nin LLMs, we identify the efficacy of incorporating 3D RoPE and diagnose its\nimbalanced frequency spectrum ranges. Therefore, we propose MM-RoPE, a RoPE\nscheme that preserves the original textual RoPE while providing comprehensive\nfrequency spectra and scaled 3D positions for modeling multimodal\nspatiotemporal data. Moreover, Lumos-1 resorts to a token dependency strategy\nthat obeys intra-frame bidirectionality and inter-frame temporal causality.\nBased on this dependency strategy, we identify the issue of frame-wise loss\nimbalance caused by spatial information redundancy and solve it by proposing\nAutoregressive Discrete Diffusion Forcing (AR-DF). AR-DF introduces temporal\ntube masking during training with a compatible inference-time masking policy to\navoid quality degradation. By using memory-efficient training techniques, we\npre-train Lumos-1 on only 48 GPUs, achieving performance comparable to EMU3 on\nGenEval, COSMOS-Video2World on VBench-I2V, and OpenSoraPlan on VBench-T2V.

    "abstract": "Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies\nthat minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations\ncaused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads\nto conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in\nconverging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or,\nin some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an\nexploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic\n(ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper\nconfidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a\nlocal lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value\nfunction. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value\nis increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint\nvalue. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the\nenvironment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety\nconstraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach\nprevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the\nreward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as\nSafety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment\nCityLearn.",

As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear\nsolutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not,\nin general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale\nStructure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark\nmatter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound\nspeed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible\nand devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the\nevaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe\nmixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a\nfirst application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the\nenergy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS\ndata.

      "Apashanka Das",

    ],
    "abstract": "Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the\nuniverse, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and\nmechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its\ninfluence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment\nremains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star\nformation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample\nmatched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven\nenvironmental effects, quantified through the $\\Delta$SFR offset defined as the\ndifference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched\ncontrols. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\\%$ of\nAGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\\%$ exhibit\nenhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the\ntrends are statistically robust and consistent across the population.\nSuppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos,\nconsistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear\nin low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally\ntrigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN\nfeedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such\nmodels can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings\ndemonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting\nneighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent\nmanner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often\noverlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale\nstructures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale\nenvironmental regulation.",

We investigate how well the component spins may be constrained, whether\nany eccentricity may be measured, what quasi-normal modes (QNMs) may be\ndetected in the post-merger signal, how well the black hole area theorem may be\nconstrained, and what constraints may be expected on sub-dominant\ninspiral-merger-ringdown modes.

In this\npaper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic\ntheories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not\nlimited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or\naxions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such\nas those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and\nphenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the\nnon-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for\nsystems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The\nlatter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains\ndominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally,\nwe establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar\nfield, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound\nspeed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account\nfor the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating\nultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions.

Here, we report the first Hanle\neffect demonstration in single InAs(P)/InP QDs emitting in the telecom C-band\nleading to experimental determination of electron spin dephasing time. Using\npolarization-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy, we identified excitonic\ncomplexes and confirmed the presence of a negatively charged trion, exhibiting\na degree of circular polarization (DOCP) of $-36\\%$ under quasi--resonant\nexcitation. From the analysis of Hanle linewidth and employing a previously\nreported value of the electron $g$-factor, we extracted an electron spin\ndephasing time of $T_2^{\\ast} = 1.59 \\pm 0.49~\\mathrm{ns}$. Despite the large\nindium nuclear spin, the obtained $T_2^{\\ast}$ is comparable to values reported\nfor GaAs-based QDs, which we attribute to the larger volume of the InAs(P)/InP\nQDs.

    "abstract": "Solving quantum field theories at strong coupling remains a challenging task.\nThe main issue is that the usual perturbative series are asymptotic series\nwhich can be useful at weak coupling but break down completely at strong\ncoupling. In this work, we show that if the limits of integration in the path\nintegral are finite, the perturbative series is remarkably an absolutely\nconvergent series which works well at strong coupling. For now, we apply this\nperturbative approach to $\\lambda \\,\\phi^4$ theory in 0+0 dimensions (a basic\nintegral) and 0+1 dimensions (quantum anharmonic oscillator). For the basic\nintegral, we show that finite integral limits yields a convergent series whose\nvalues are in agreement with exact analytical results at any coupling. This\nworked even when the asymptotic series was not Borel summable. It is well known\nthat the perturbative series expansion in powers of the coupling for the energy\nof the anhaorminic oscillator yields an asymptotic series and hence fails at\nstrong coupling. In quantum mechanics, if one is interested in the energy, it\nis often easier to use Schr\\\"odinger's equation to develop a perturbative\nseries than path integrals. Finite path integral limits are then equivalent to\nplacing infinite walls at positions -L and L in the potential where L is\npositive, finite and can be arbitrarily large. With walls, the series expansion\nfor the energy is now convergent and approaches the energy of the anharmonic\noscillator as the walls are moved further apart. We use the convergent series\nto calculate the ground state energy at weak, intermediate and strong coupling.\nAt strong coupling, the result from the series agrees with the exact (correct)\nenergy to within 0.1 %, a remarkable result in light of the fact that at strong\ncoupling the usual perturbative series diverges badly right from the start.",

In particular, quantum circuits\nwith quantum control of causal order (QC-QCs) form a broad class of physical\nsupermaps obtained from a bottom-up construction and are believed to represent\nall quantum processes physically realisable in a fixed spacetime.\nComplementarily, the formalism of routed quantum circuits introduces quantum\noperations constrained by \"routes\" to represent processes in terms of a more\nfine-grained routed circuit decomposition. This decomposition, formalised using\na so-called routed graph, represents the information flow within the respective\nprocess. However, the existence of routed circuit decompositions has only been\nestablished for a small set of processes so far, including both certain\nspecific QC-QCs and more exotic processes as examples.\n  In this work, we remedy this fact by connecting these two frameworks. We\nprove that for any given $N$, one can use a single routed graph to\nsystematically obtain a routed circuit decomposition for any QC-QC with $N$\nparties. We detail this construction explicitly and contrast it with other\nrouted circuit decompositions of QC-QCs, which we obtain from alternative\nrouted graphs. We conclude by pointing out how this connection can be useful to\ntackle various open problems in the field of indefinite causal order,\nparticularly establishing circuit representations of subclasses of QC-QCs.",

Since these measures are functions of the\ncovariance matrix \"S\" and its inverse \"S^-1\", the associated Wishart and\ninverse-Wishart distributions are of note. DTC is shown to be the\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for the inverse-Wishart pair \"(S^-1)\" and its\ndiagonal matrix \"D=diag(S^-1)\", shedding light on its interpretation as a\nmeasure of \"total partial correlation\", -lndetP, with test hypothesis H0: P=I,\nwhere \"P\" is the standardized inverse covariance (i.e.\nP=(D^-1/2)(S^-1)(D^-1/2). The second aim of this paper introduces a\ngeneralization of all these measures for structured groups of variables. For\ninstance, consider three or more groups, each consisting of three or more\nvariables, with predominant redundancy within each group, but with synergistic\ninteractions between groups. O-information will miss the between group synergy\n(since redundancy occurs more often in the system). In contrast, the structured\nO-information measure presented here will correctly report predominant synergy\nbetween groups. This is a relevant generalization towards structured\nmultivariate information measures. A third aim is the presentation of a\nframework for quantifying the contribution of \"connections\" between variables,\nto the system's TC, DTC, O-information, and TSE complexity. A fourth aim is to\npresent a generalization of the redundancy-synergy index for quantifying the\ncontribution of a group of variables to the system's redundancy-synergy\nbalance. Finally, it is shown that the expressions derived here directly apply\nto data from several other elliptical distributions.

    "abstract": "To alleviate the computational burden of large language models (LLMs),\narchitectures with activation sparsity, represented by mixture-of-experts\n(MoE), have attracted increasing attention. However, the non-differentiable and\ninflexible routing of vanilla MoE hurts model performance. Moreover, while each\ntoken activates only a few parameters, these sparsely-activated architectures\nexhibit low chunk-level sparsity, indicating that the union of multiple\nconsecutive tokens activates a large ratio of parameters. Such a sparsity\npattern is unfriendly for acceleration under low-resource conditions (e.g.,\nend-side devices) and incompatible with mainstream acceleration techniques\n(e.g., speculative decoding). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nMoE architecture, BlockFFN, as well as its efficient training and deployment\ntechniques. Specifically, we use a router integrating ReLU activation and\nRMSNorm for differentiable and flexible routing. Next, to promote both\ntoken-level sparsity (TLS) and chunk-level sparsity (CLS), CLS-aware training\nobjectives are designed, making BlockFFN more acceleration-friendly. Finally,\nwe implement efficient acceleration kernels, combining activation sparsity and\nspeculative decoding for the first time. The experimental results demonstrate\nthe superior performance of BlockFFN over other MoE baselines, achieving over\n80% TLS and 70% 8-token CLS. Our kernels achieve up to 3.67$\\times$ speedup on\nreal end-side devices than dense models. All codes and checkpoints are\navailable publicly (https://github.com/thunlp/BlockFFN).",

In contrast, vortex\nstates represent cylindrical waves carrying a well-defined orbital angular\nmomentum projection along the propagation direction. This projection can be\narbitrarily large, endowing such particles with magnetic moments orders of\nmagnitude greater than those of plane-wave states. Consequently, vortex\nparticles could complement - or even replace - spin-polarized beams in\nhigh-energy collisions, enabling access to observables beyond the reach of the\nconventional states. Although relativistic vortex beams have yet to be\nrealized, we investigate the radiative and non-radiative dynamics of angular\nmomentum for vortex particles in accelerators. We compute the timescale for\nangular momentum loss via photon emission, finding it significantly longer than\ntypical acceleration times. The non-radiative dynamics is governed by\nprecession, with the orbital angular momentum precessing at a frequency\nmarkedly different from that of spin. Similar to spin tunes in circular\naccelerators, this can induce resonances that disrupt the beam's orbital\nmomentum - occurring far more frequently for vortex beams than for\nspin-polarized ones. Thus, vortex particle acceleration can be more feasible in\nlinacs, while Siberian snakes could serve as a tool for angular momentum\nmanipulations.",

Given its sequential nature\nand its resemblance to the way humans think, continual learning offers an\nopportunity to address several challenges which currently stand in the way of\nwidening the range of applicability of deep models to further real-world\nproblems. The continual need to update the learner with data arriving\nsequentially strikes inherent congruence between continual learning and\nBayesian inference which provides a principal platform to keep updating the\nprior beliefs of a model given new data, without completely forgetting the\nknowledge acquired from the old data. This survey inspects different settings\nof Bayesian continual learning, namely task-incremental learning and\nclass-incremental learning.

Despite its importance, the nature of the astrophysical\nsites where the r-process occurs, and the detailed mechanisms of its formation,\nremain elusive. The key to resolving these mysteries lies in the study of\nchemical signatures preserved in ancient, metal-poor stars. In this review, we\nexplore r-process nucleosynthesis, focusing on the sites, progenitors, and\nformation mechanisms. We discuss the role of potential astrophysical sites such\nas neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, magneto-rotational\nsupernovae, and collapsars, that can play a key role in producing the heavy\nelements. We also highlight the importance of studying these signatures through\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic surveys, stellar archaeology, and multi-messenger\nastronomy. Recent advancements, such as the gravitational wave event GW170817\nand detection of the r-process in the ejecta of its associated kilonovae, have\nestablished neutron star mergers as one of the confirmed sites. However,\nquestions remain regarding whether they are the only sites that could have\ncontributed in early epochs or if additional sources are needed to explain the\nsignatures of r-process found in the oldest stars.

    "abstract": "We present a novel dependent linear type theory in which the multiplicity of\nsome variable - i.e., the number of times the variable can be used in a program\n- can depend on other variables. This allows us to give precise resource\nannotations to many higher-order functions that cannot be adequately typed in\nany other system. Inspired by the Dialectica translation, our typing discipline\nis obtained by embedding linear logic into dependent type theory and specifying\nhow the embedded logic interacts with the host theory. We can then use a\nstandard natural numbers type to obtain a quantitative typing system with\ndependent multiplicities. We characterise the semantics for our theory as a\ncombination of standard models of dependent type theory and linear logic. Our\nsystem can be added to any dependently typed language, which we demonstrate\nwith an implementation in Agda.",

    "abstract": "Fairness has emerged as a formidable challenge in data-driven decisions. Many\nof the data problems, such as creating compact data summaries for approximate\nquery processing, can be effectively tackled using concepts from computational\ngeometry, such as $\\varepsilon$-nets. However, these powerful tools have yet to\nbe examined from the perspective of fairness. To fill this research gap, we add\nfairness to classical geometric approximation problems of $\\varepsilon$-net,\n$\\varepsilon$-sample, and geometric hitting set. We introduce and address two\nnotions of group fairness: demographic parity, which requires preserving group\nproportions from the input distribution, and custom-ratios fairness, which\ndemands satisfying arbitrary target ratios. We develop two algorithms to\nenforce fairness: one based on sampling and another on discrepancy theory. The\nsampling-based algorithm is faster and computes a fair $\\varepsilon$-net of\nsize which is only larger by a $\\log(k)$ factor compared to the standard\n(unfair) $\\varepsilon$-net, where $k$ is the number of demographic groups. The\ndiscrepancy-based algorithm is slightly slower (for bounded VC dimension), but\nit computes a smaller fair $\\varepsilon$-net. Notably, we reduce the fair\ngeometric hitting set problem to finding fair $\\varepsilon$-nets. This results\nin a $O(\\log \\mathsf{OPT} \\times \\log k)$ approximation of a fair geometric\nhitting set. Additionally, we show that under certain input distributions,\nconstructing fair $\\varepsilon$-samples can be infeasible, highlighting\nlimitations in fair sampling. Beyond the theoretical guarantees, our\nexperimental results validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithms. In particular, we achieve zero unfairness with only a modest\nincrease in output size compared to the unfair setting.",

Additionally, LHAASO, HAWC, and HESS\nhave reported over forty galactic gamma-ray sources with energies above 100\nTeV. Detecting neutrinos correlated with high-energy gamma-ray sources would\nprovide compelling evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration in these galactic\nsources.

ICEMAN is the\ncombination of three largely independent neutrino samples of different event\nmorphologies and builds upon the previous work of the DNN-based cascade sample,\nEnhanced Starting Track Event Selection, and the Northern Track sample. Recent\nimprovements in ice modeling and detector calibration are also incorporated\ninto the cascade reconstruction.

In recent history, typical polling\nestimates have largely lacked precision in predicting election outcomes, which\nhas not only caused uncertainty for American voters, but has also impacted\ncampaign strategies, spending, and fundraising efforts. One intriguing aspect\nof traditional polling is the types of questions that are asked -- the\nquestions largely focus on asking individuals who they intend to vote for.\nHowever, they don't always probe who voters think will win -- regardless of who\nthey want to win. In contrast, online betting markets allow individuals to\nwager money on who they expect to win, which may capture who individuals think\nwill win in an especially salient manner. The current study used both\ndescriptive and predictive analytics to determine whether data from Polymarket,\nthe world's largest online betting market, provided insights that differed from\ntraditional presidential polling. Overall, findings suggest that Polymarket was\nsuperior to polling in predicting the outcome of the 2024 presidential\nelection, particularly in swing states. Results are in alignment with research\non ''Wisdom of Crowds'' theory, which suggests a large group of people are\noften accurate in predicting outcomes, even if they are not necessarily experts\nor closely aligned with the issue at hand.

    "abstract": "The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the\nassumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human\ndecision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are\nthese AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant\nto perform?\n  This study investigates the question of competence through a two-part audit\nof eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex, contextual racial\nand gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates merely for the\npresence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated core competence,\nprovided a critical insight: some models that appeared unbiased were, in fact,\nincapable of performing a substantive evaluation, relying instead on\nsuperficial keyword matching.\n  This paper introduces the \"Illusion of Neutrality\" to describe this\nphenomenon, where an apparent lack of bias is merely a symptom of a model's\ninability to make meaningful judgments. This study recommends that\norganizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation framework, auditing AI\nhiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable competence to ensure\nthey are both equitable and effective.",

However, existing approaches often rely on static maps or costly\nsensors, limiting scalability and adaptability. Additionally, large-scale DTs\nthat collect and analyze data from multiple sources face challenges in privacy,\ncommunication, and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Geo-ORBIT (Geometrical Operational Roadway Blueprint with Integrated\nTwin), a unified framework that combines real-time lane detection, DT\nsynchronization, and federated meta-learning. At the core of Geo-ORBIT is\nGeoLane, a lightweight lane detection model that learns lane geometries from\nvehicle trajectory data using roadside cameras. We extend this model through\nMeta-GeoLane, which learns to personalize detection parameters for local\nentities, and FedMeta-GeoLane, a federated learning strategy that ensures\nscalable and privacy-preserving adaptation across roadside deployments. Our\nsystem is integrated with CARLA and SUMO to create a high-fidelity DT that\nrenders highway scenarios and captures traffic flows in real-time. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse urban scenes show that FedMeta-GeoLane consistently\noutperforms baseline and meta-learning approaches, achieving lower geometric\nerror and stronger generalization to unseen locations while drastically\nreducing communication overhead.

In this paper we study the production\nand evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of\nthermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle\nscattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that\nthe bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to\nradiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal\ngravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to\nthat in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We\nalso calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find\nthat it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies ~100\nGHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises\nfrom emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The\nflat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during\nWI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection\nprospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved\nslightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging.\nThe thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the\namplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI\nmodels can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum\ncontribution without exceeding current observational limits on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton\ncontribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally\nexpected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the\ncosmic microwave background.",

    "abstract": "When a new infectious disease (or a new strain of an existing one) emerges,\nas in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, different types of mobility restrictions\nare considered to slow down or mitigate the spread of the disease. The measures\nto be adopted require carefully weighing the social cost against their impact\non disease control. In this work, we analyze, in a context of mobility\nrestrictions, the role of frequent versus occasional contacts in epidemic\nspread. We develop an individual-based mathematical model where frequent\ncontacts among individuals (at home, work, schools) and occasional contacts (at\nstores, transport, etc.) are considered. We define several contact structures\nby changing the relative weight between frequent and occasional contacts while\nkeeping the same initial effective rate of spread. We find the remarkable\nresult that the more frequent contacts prevail over occasional ones, the higher\nthe epidemic peak, the sooner it occurs, and the greater the final number of\nindividuals affected by the epidemic. We conduct our study using an SIR model,\nconsidering both exponential and deterministic recovery from infection, and\nobtain that this effect is more pronounced under deterministic recovery. We\nfind that the impact of relaxation measures depends on the relative importance\nof frequent and occasional contacts within the considered social structures.\nFinally, we assess in which of the considered scenarios the homogeneous mixing\napproximation provides a reasonable description of the epidemic dynamics.",

In the first part of the paper, the competition of two strains\nwhich have the same basic fitness (same reproduction number) but different\ntiming in quiescence is analyzed. Thereto, the complexity of the model is\nreduced: By a time scale argument, we approximate the SQIS model by an SIS\nmodel under the assumption of rapid switching between I and Q. Furthermore,\nusing dimension reduction methods for the van Kampen expansion of the models,\nwe replace the multi-dimensional SDE by an effective one dimensional SDE on the\ncenter manifold of the models. Finally, the fixation probabilities of the\nstrains are derived.\n  In the second part of the paper, we use concepts from adaptive dynamics to\nanalyze the stochastic random walk on the trait space. We find that quiescence\nis favored by intrinsic stochastic effects. In the end, a more intuitive\nexplanation is added to the mathematical arguments.\n  The analysis suggests a new paradigm for the evolution of quiescence in\nparasites: In the present context, quiescence is not a bed-hedging strategy to\nescape detrimental conditions in a fluctuating environment, but a simple and\nefficient method to continuously control and slow down the time scale of\nlife-history traits. It turns out that evolution favors slowness, with the\nanalysis suggesting that this effect may be widespread in systems where species\ninteract only indirectly through competition for resources.",

Using 866 publicly available spectra from 393 SNe, 407 from\ntype IIb SNe (SNe IIb) and 459 from type II SNe (SNe II), we analysed H$\\alpha$\nand He~I 5876 A at early phases ($<40$ days from the explosion) to identify\npossible differences between these two SN types. By comparing the\npseudo-equivalent width (pEW) and full width at half maximum (FWHM), we find\nthat the strength of the absorption component of these lines serves as a\nquantitative discriminator, with SNe IIb exhibiting stronger lines at all\ntimes. The most significant differences emerge within the first 10-20 days. To\nassess the statistical significance of these differences, we apply statistical\nmethods and machine-learning techniques. Population density evolution reveals a\nclear distinction in both pEW and FWHM. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis\nconfirms distinct evolutionary patterns, particularly in pEW, while FWHM\nvariations are less pronounced. A combination of t-distributed Stochastic\nNeighbour Embedding and Linear Discriminant Analysis effectively separates the\ntwo SN types. Additionally, a Random Forest Classifier demonstrates the\nrobustness of pEW and FWHM as classification criteria, allowing for accurate\nclassification of newly observed SNe II and IIb based on computed\nclassification probabilities. Applying our method to low-resolution spectra\nobtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient, a\nmagnitude-limited survey, we identified 34 misclassified SNe. This revision\nincreases the estimated fraction of SNe IIb from 4.0% to 7.26%. This finding\nsuggests that misclassification significantly impacts the estimated\ncore-collapse SN rate. Our approach enhances classification accuracy and\nprovides a valuable tool for future supernova studies.",

    "abstract": "Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate\nconfiguration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\nadapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA\ncombines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize\nredundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight\nsoftware systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA\nachieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with\nup to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to\nimprove different local models in handling concept drift.",

Our extensions unlock the application of rigorous statistical risk\nmonitoring to TTA, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TTA\nmonitoring framework across a representative set of datasets, distribution\nshift types, and TTA methods.",

    "abstract": "Previous generations of cellular communication, such as 5G, have been\ndesigned with the objective of improving key performance indicators (KPIs) such\nas throughput, latency, etc. However, to meet the evolving KPI demands as well\nas the ambitious sustainability targets for the ICT industry, 6G will need to\nbe designed differently. Concretely, 6G will need to consider both the\nperformance and sustainability targets for the various use cases it will serve.\nMoreover, like previous generations, 6G will have various candidate\ntechnological enablers, making the design space of the system even more\ncomplex. Furthermore, given the subjective nature of the sustainability\nindicators, in particular social sustainability, there is a significant gap in\nliterature on how technical enablers and 6G System design can be linked to\nthem. Hence, in this article a novel method for 6G end-to-end (E2E) system\ndesign based on Knowledge graphs (KG) has been introduced. It considers as its\ninput: the use case KPIs, use case sustainability requirements expressed as Key\nValues (KV) and KV Indicators (KVIs), the ability of the technological enablers\nto satisfy these KPIs and KVIs, the 6G system design principles defined in\nHexa-X-II project, the maturity of a technological enabler and the dependencies\nbetween the various enablers. As part of the KG method, a novel approach for\ndetermining the key values a technological enabler addresses, has also been\nintroduced. The effectiveness of the KG method was demonstrated by its\napplication in designing the 6G E2E system for the cooperating mobile robot use\ncase defined in the Hexa-X-II project, where 82 enablers were selected. Lastly,\nresults from proof-of-concept demonstrations for a subset of the selected\nenablers have also been provided, which reinforce the efficacy of the KG method\nfor designing a sustainable 6G system.",

To\ncompress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and\nmatrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding\nmatrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity\nRegulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge.\nSpecifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the\ngiven image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is\nnon-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP\nachieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it\nrequires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive\nexperiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when\nusing it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when\nusing L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be\nmixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore\nonly will cause fail training.",

Using the 16.8 yr\nFermi-LAT data, an extended emission, with a significance of 13.5 $\\sigma$ and\na radius 0.24{\\deg} in 0.2--500 GeV in the uniform-disk model, was found to the\nadjacent east of the SNR. With archival Mopra CO-line data, a large molecular\nclump at local-standard-of-rest velocity $\\sim-48$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$ was\nrevealed appearing coincident with the gamma-ray source. The SNR was found\nlocated in a cavity encircled by a 'C'-shaped ring-like molecular shell at\n$-45$ to $-43$ km s$^{-1}$. This morphological agreement, together with the\nposition-velociy diagrams made along lines cutting across the cavity, suggests\nthat the SNR was evolving in the expanding molecular bubble created by the\nstellar wind of the progenitor with a mass $\\gtrsim 15 M_{\\mathrm{sun}}$. The\ngiant molecular cloud, visible at around $-46$ km s$^{-1}$, and the associated\nSNR are thus estimated to lie at a kinematic distance of 3.1 kpc, with the HI\nabsorption taken into account. We suggest that the SNR has entered the\nradiative phase after the blastwave recently struck the cavity wall. With the\nevolutionary scenario of the SNR, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission\nreported here can be naturally interpreted by the hadronic interaction between\nthe accelerated protons that escaped from the SNR shock and the eastern large\nmolecular clump.",

    "abstract": "Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for\nlearning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most\napproaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which\nis often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations\nare not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable\nrobot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting\na critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic\nagents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement\nlearning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical\ndemonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from\nsuboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We\nempirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,\nand demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation\nexperiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed\nmethods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward\nlearning from suboptimal demonstrations.",

It could not only identify a new component of the\nastrophysical neutrino flux, but also characterize how its spectrum\nextrapolates from GeV to PeV energies. This would in turn give valuable\ninsights into the internal processes of neutrino sources. Astrophysical\ntransients, such as collapsars, have been proposed as sources of\ntime-correlated GeV- and high-energy neutrinos. Conducting this search in such\nshort time scales allows for a substantial reduction in the dominant background\nrate for GeV neutrino candidate events.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a critical role in enhancing large language\nmodels (LLMs) by introducing structured and grounded knowledge into the\nlearning process. However, most existing KG-enhanced approaches rely on\nparameter-intensive fine-tuning, which risks catastrophic forgetting and\ndegrades the pretrained model's generalization. Moreover, they exhibit limited\nadaptability to real-time knowledge updates due to their static integration\nframeworks. To address these issues, we introduce the first test-time\nKG-augmented framework for LLMs, built around a dedicated knowledge\ngraph-guided attention (KGA) module that enables dynamic knowledge fusion\nwithout any parameter updates. The proposed KGA module augments the standard\nself-attention mechanism with two synergistic pathways: outward and inward\naggregation. Specifically, the outward pathway dynamically integrates external\nknowledge into input representations via input-driven KG fusion. This inward\naggregation complements the outward pathway by refining input representations\nthrough KG-guided filtering, suppressing task-irrelevant signals and amplifying\nknowledge-relevant patterns. Importantly, while the outward pathway handles\nknowledge fusion, the inward path selects the most relevant triples and feeds\nthem back into the fusion process, forming a closed-loop enhancement mechanism.\nBy synergistically combining these two pathways, the proposed method supports\nreal-time knowledge fusion exclusively at test-time, without any parameter\nmodification. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks verify the comparable\nknowledge fusion performance of KGA.",

We demonstrate that local overfitting can arise even without\nconventional overfitting, and is closely linked to the double descent\nphenomenon.\n  Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage approach that leverages\nthe training history of a single model to recover and retain forgotten\nknowledge: first, by aggregating checkpoints into an ensemble, and then by\ndistilling it into a single model of the original size, thus enhancing\nperformance without added inference cost.\n  Extensive experiments across multiple datasets, modern architectures, and\ntraining regimes validate the effectiveness of our approach.

The beer\npath problem, which captures the option of visiting points of interest, such as\ngas stations or convenience stops, prior to reaching the final destination, has\nbeen recently introduced and extensively studied in static graphs. However,\nexisting approaches do not account for temporal information, which is often\ncrucial in real-world scenarios. For instance, transit services may follow\nfixed schedules, and shops may only be accessible during certain hours.\n  In this work, we introduce the notion of beer paths in temporal graphs, where\nedges are time-dependent and certain vertices (beer vertices) are active only\nat specific time instances. We formally define the problems of computing\nearliest-arrival, latest-departure, fastest, and shortest temporal beer paths\nand propose efficient algorithms for these problems under both edge stream and\nadjacency list representations. The time complexity of each of our algorithms\nis aligned with that of corresponding temporal pathfinding algorithms, thus\npreserving efficiency.\n  Additionally, we present preprocessing techniques that enable efficient query\nanswering under dynamic conditions, for example new openings or closings of\nshops. We achieve this through appropriate precomputation of selected paths or\nby transforming a temporal graph into an equivalent static graph.",

We present a series of compression and shear\nexperiments conducted in microgravity using the Center of Applied Space\nTechnology and Microgravity (ZARM) drop tower and GraviTower Bremen (GTB). Our\nin-house developed experimental setup enables precise measurement of packing\ndensity and in-situ shear stress via a Taylor-Couette rheometer. We find that\nthe jamming transition occurs at lower packing density in microgravity than on\nEarth, confirming that gravity promotes densification. Rheological measurements\nfurther reveal that in microgravity, the lack of a secondary force field and\npredominance of cohesive interparticle forces increase the stress needed for\ngranular media to flow. These findings highlight gravity's dual role in\nenhancing both compaction and flow, and demonstrate the need for tailored\ngranular models, valid in low- and microgravity environments.",

    "abstract": "While comments are essential for enhancing code readability and\nmaintainability in modern software projects, developers are often motivated to\nupdate code but not comments, leading to outdated or inconsistent documentation\nthat hinders future understanding and maintenance. Recent approaches such as\nCUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural\nsequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these\nmethods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating,\nresulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update\nscenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging\nlarge language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in\nsoftware engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and\nprogram repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic\nbehind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment\nupdating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on\neach update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel\ncomment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies\nto provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a\nranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements\nover state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy,\n10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in\nSentenceBert similarity.

This extension generalizes ChannelComp by enabling flexible modulation\ndesign across multiple transmissions, thereby enhancing reliability against\nchannel noise. We formulate the modulation design as a non-convex optimization\nproblem, apply matrix lifting to relax it into a semidefinite programming\n(SDP), and recover a feasible modulation solution by solving a low rank\napproximation. For scenarios where the modulation formats cannot be changed, we\nfurther develop a power adaptation scheme that adjusts amplitude and phase of\nthe modulated symbols while preserving the modulation structure. Numerical\nresults show that SeMAC can achieve a reliable computation by reducing the\ncomputation error up to 18 dB compared to other existing methods, particularly\nfor the product function.",

    "abstract": "IceCube-Gen2 is a planned next-generation neutrino observatory at the South\nPole that builds upon the successful design of IceCube. Integrating two\ncomplementary detection technologies for neutrinos, optical and radio Cherenkov\nemission, in combination with a surface array for cosmic-ray air shower\ndetection, IceCube-Gen2 will cover a broad neutrino energy range from MeV to\nEeV. This index of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray\nConference in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025) describes research and\ndevelopment efforts for IceCube-Gen2. Included are summaries of the design,\nstatus, and sensitivity of the IceCube-Gen2 optical, surface, and radio\ncomponents; performance studies of next-generation surface detectors and in-ice\noptical sensors; advanced reconstruction techniques of cosmic-ray air showers\nand neutrino events; sustainability and environmental impact; and sensitivity\nstudies of astrophysical neutrino fluxes and cosmic-ray physics. Contributions\nrelated to IceCube and the scheduled IceCube Upgrade are available in a\nseparate collection.",

This process yielded a\nparallel corpus of over 60,000 problems. Our framework achieves 88.9% syntactic\naccuracy (pass@1) on MiniF2F, outperforming SOTA models such as Deepseek-V3\n(81%) and Herald (81.3%) across multiple datasets.

    "abstract": "Jerky active particles are Brownian self-propelled particles which are\ndominated by ``jerk'', the change in acceleration. They represent a\ngeneralization of inertial active particles. In order to describe jerky active\nparticles, a linear jerk equation of motion which involves a third-order\nderivative in time, Stokes friction and a spring force is combined with\nactivity modeled by an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This equation of\nmotion is solved analytically and the associated mean-square displacement (MSD)\nis extracted as a function of time. For small damping and small spring\nconstants, the MSD shows an enormous superballistic spreading with different\nscaling regimes characterized by anomalous high dynamical exponents 6, 5, 4 or\n3 arising from a competition between jerk, inertia and activity. When exposed\nto a harmonic potential, the gigantic spreading tendency induced by jerk gives\nrise to an enormous increase of the kinetic temperature and even to a sharp\nlocalization-delocalization transition, i.e. a jerky particle can escape from\nharmonic confinement. The transition can be either first or second order as a\nfunction of jerkiness. Finally it is shown that self-propelled jerky particles\ngoverned by the basic equation of motion can be realized experimentally both in\nfeedback-controlled macroscopic particles and in active colloids governed by\nfriction with memory.",

Usually, AI Agents utilize\nsophisticated prompt engineering and external reasoning framework to obtain a\npromising interaction with LLMs, e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Iteration of Thought\nand Image-of-Thought. However, they are still constrained by the inherent\nlimitations of LLM in understanding natural language, and the iterative\nreasoning process will generate a large amount of inference cost. To this end,\nwe propose a novel AI Agent Reasoning Framework with Introspection of Thought\n(INoT) by designing a new LLM-Read code in prompt. It enables LLM to execute\nprogrammatic dialogue reasoning processes following the code in prompt.\nTherefore, self-denial and reflection occur within LLM instead of outside LLM,\nwhich can reduce token cost effectively. Through our experiments on six\nbenchmarks for three different tasks, the effectiveness of INoT is verified,\nwith an average improvement of 7.95\\% in performance, exceeding the baselines.\nFurthermore, the token cost of INoT is lower on average than the best\nperforming method at baseline by 58.3\\%.

This task is especially useful when the audio is unavailable (e.g.\ndeleted) or unreliable (e.g. anonymized speech). Prior work in this area has\nprimarily focused on the feasibility of attributing speakers using transcripts\nproduced by human annotators. However, in real-world settings, one often only\nhas more errorful transcripts produced by automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystems. In this paper, we conduct what is, to our knowledge, the first\ncomprehensive study of the impact of automatic transcription on speaker\nattribution performance. In particular, we study the extent to which speaker\nattribution performance degrades in the face of transcription errors, as well\nas how properties of the ASR system impact attribution. We find that\nattribution is surprisingly resilient to word-level transcription errors and\nthat the objective of recovering the true transcript is minimally correlated\nwith attribution performance. Overall, our findings suggest that speaker\nattribution on more errorful transcripts produced by ASR is as good, if not\nbetter, than attribution based on human-transcribed data, possibly because ASR\ntranscription errors can capture speaker-specific features revealing of speaker\nidentity.",

    "abstract": "A new set of hardware merge sort devices are introduced here, which merge\nmultiple sorted input lists into a single sorted output list in a fast and\nefficient manner. In each merge sorter, the values from the sorted input lists\nare arranged in an input 2-D setup array, but with the order of each sorted\ninput list offset from the order of each of the other sorted input lists. In\nthese new devices, called List Offset Merge Sorters (LOMS), a minimal set of\ncolumn sort stages alternating with row sort stages process the input setup\narray into a final output array, now in the defined sorted order. LOMS 2-way\nsorters, which merge 2 sorted input lists, require only 2 merge stages and are\nsignificantly faster than Kenneth Batcher's previous state-of-the-art 2-way\nmerge devices, Bitonic Merge Sorters and Odd-Even Merge Sorters. LOMS 2-way\nsorters utilize the recently-introduced Single-Stage 2-way Merge Sorters (S2MS)\nin their first stage. Both LOMS and S2MS devices can merge any mixture of input\nlist sizes, while Batcher's merge sorters are difficult to design unless the 2\ninput lists are equal, and a power-of-2. By themselves, S2MS devices are the\nfastest 2-way merge sorters when implemented in this study's target FPGA\ndevices, but they tend to use a large number of LUT resources. LOMS 2-way\ndevices use fewer resources than comparable S2MS devices, enabling some large\nLOMS devices to be implemented in a given FPGA when comparable S2MS devices\ncannot fit in that FPGA. A List Offset 2-way sorter merges 2 lists, each with\n32 values, into a sorted output list of those 64 values in 2.24 nS, a speedup\nof 2.63 versus a comparable Batcher device. A LOMS 3-way merge sorter, merging\n3 sorted input lists with 7 values, fully merges the 21 values in 3.4 nS, a\nspeedup of 1.36 versus the comparable state-of-the-art 3-way merge device.",

    "abstract": "Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy\nhas challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance,\nefficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while\nend-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability.\nAdditionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based\ntask specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector\nvelocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address\nthese limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic,\nvelocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a\nmulti-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for\nlocomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy\nto resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a\ntwist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses\nand motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation\nand hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm.\nThe resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and\nshows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in\nextending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.

    "abstract": "Purpose: Ultra-high-field 7T MRI offers improved resolution and contrast over\nstandard clinical field strengths (1.5T, 3T). However, 7T scanners are costly,\nscarce, and introduce additional challenges such as susceptibility artifacts.\nWe propose an efficient transformer-based model (7T-Restormer) to synthesize\n7T-quality T1-maps from routine 1.5T or 3T T1-weighted (T1W) images. Methods:\nOur model was validated on 35 1.5T and 108 3T T1w MRI paired with corresponding\n7T T1 maps of patients with confirmed MS. A total of 141 patient cases (32,128\nslices) were randomly divided into 105 (25; 80) training cases (19,204 slices),\n19 (5; 14) validation cases (3,476 slices), and 17 (5; 14) test cases (3,145\nslices) where (X; Y) denotes the patients with 1.5T and 3T T1W scans,\nrespectively. The synthetic 7T T1 maps were compared against the ResViT and\nResShift models. Results: The 7T-Restormer model achieved a PSNR of 26.0 +/-\n4.6 dB, SSIM of 0.861 +/- 0.072, and NMSE of 0.019 +/- 0.011 for 1.5T inputs,\nand 25.9 +/- 4.9 dB, and 0.866 +/- 0.077 for 3T inputs, respectively. Using\n10.5 M parameters, our model reduced NMSE by 64 % relative to 56.7M parameter\nResShift (0.019 vs 0.052, p = <.001 and by 41 % relative to 70.4M parameter\nResViT (0.019 vs 0.032, p = <.001) at 1.5T, with similar advantages at 3T\n(0.021 vs 0.060 and 0.033; p < .001). Training with a mixed 1.5 T + 3 T corpus\nwas superior to single-field strategies. Restricting the model to 1.5T\nincreased the 1.5T NMSE from 0.019 to 0.021 (p = 1.1E-3) while training solely\non 3T resulted in lower performance on input 1.5T T1W MRI. Conclusion: We\npropose a novel method for predicting quantitative 7T MP2RAGE maps from 1.5T\nand 3T T1W scans with higher quality than existing state-of-the-art methods.\nOur approach makes the benefits of 7T MRI more accessible to standard clinical\nworkflows.",

However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of\nan autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited\nwhen combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to\ndynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV,\nwhich combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This\nstructure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal\nmemory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time\nto maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion\nNetwork (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion\nfeatures from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV\nfeatures with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal\nfeature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which\ncaptures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments\nconducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves\nsignificant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion.\nOnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording\nstate-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.",

In this study,\nwe addressed the persistent medium-field Q-slope issue in Nb film cavities,\nwhich, despite their high-quality factor at low RF fields, exhibit a\nsignificant Q-slope at medium RF fields compared to bulk Nb cavities.\nTraditional heat treatments, effective in reducing surface resistance and\nmitigating the Q-slope in bulk Nb cavities, are challenging for niobium-coated\ncopper cavities. To overcome this challenge, we employed DC biased high-power\nimpulse magnetron sputtering to deposit niobium film onto a 1.3 GHz single-cell\nelliptical bulk niobium cavity, followed by annealing treatments aimed at\nmodifying the properties of the niobium film. In-situ annealing at 340 {\\deg}C\nincreased the quench field from 10.0 to 12.5 MV/m. Vacuum furnace annealing at\n600 {\\deg}C and 800 {\\deg}C for 3 hours resulted in a quench field increase of\n13.5 and 15.3 MV/m, respectively. Further annealing at 800 {\\deg}C for 6 hours\nboosted the quench field to 17.5 MV/m. Additionally, the annealing treatments\nsignificantly reduced the field dependence of the surface resistance. However,\nincreasing the annealing temperature to 900 {\\deg}C induced a Q-switch\nphenomenon in the cavity. The analysis of RF performance and material\ncharacterization before and after annealing has provided critical insights into\nhow the microstructure and impurity levels in Nb films influence the evolution\nof the Q-slope in Nb film cavities.

Gas metallicity gradients\nare studied as a function of the galaxy's stellar mass, H I gas fraction,\ndiffuse ionised gas content, and using different parametric length scales for\nnormalisation. The metallicity gradients are analysed using Bayesian statistics\nbased on data from the Metal-THINGS survey. Bayesian MCMC models are developed\nto explore how metallicity gradients vary with a galaxy's mass and how they\ncorrelate with properties such as the stellar mass or the atomic gas fraction.\nFor our sample, we find that the metallicity typically decreases with galactic\nradius, consistent with inside-out galaxy growth. We find a trend dependent on\nthe stellar mass, with a break at log(M_star/M_sun)=9.5, and another between\nthe metallicity gradients and the atomic gas fraction (f_g,HI) of a galaxy at\nfg,HI=0.75, indicating relatively shallower gradients for lower gas fractions.\nWe find that normalisation using NUV-band effective radii are preferable for\ngalaxies with a higher atomic gas content and lower stellar masses, while\nr-band radii are better suited for those with lower atomic gas fractions and\nmore massive ones.

This\nmodel minimizes some user-defined norm while enforcing all interpolation\nconditions. To enable nontrivial feasible solutions, we propose to enhance the\ntrial space with 1D kernel basis functions inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold\nNetworks (KANs). Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed mixed\ndimensional trial space significantly improves surface reconstruction from raw\npoint clouds. This is particularly evident in the precise estimation of surface\nnormals, outperforming traditional RBF trial spaces including the one for\nHermite interpolation. This framework not only enhances processing of raw point\ncloud data but also shows potential for further contributions to computational\ngeometry.

In this paper we\npresent an interpretable data-driven approach for the state-dependent control\nof UPOs in the 3BP, through leveraging the inherent sensitivity of chaos and\nthe local manifold structure. We overcome the sampling challenge by utilising\nprior knowledge of UPOs and a novel augmentation strategy. This enables\nsample-efficient discovery of a verifiable and accurate local Poincar\\'{e} map\nin as few as 55 data points. We suggest that the Poincar\\'{e} map is best\ndiscovered at a surface of section where the norm of the monodromy matrix, i.e.\nthe local sensitivity to small perturbations, is the smallest. To stabilise the\nUPOs, we apply small velocity impulses once each period, determined by solving\na convex system of linear matrix inequalities based on the linearised map. We\nconstrain the norm of the decision variables used to solve this system,\nresulting in locally optimal velocity impulses directed along the local stable\nmanifold. Critically, this behaviour is achieved in a computationally efficient\nmanner. We demonstrate this sample-efficient and low-energy method across\nseveral orbit families in the 3BP, with potential applications ranging from\nrobotics and spacecraft control to fluid dynamics.",

    "abstract": "This article is motivated by challenges in conducting Bayesian inferences on\nunknown discrete distributions, with a particular focus on count data. To avoid\nthe computational disadvantages of traditional mixture models, we develop a\nnovel Bayesian predictive approach. In particular, our Metropolis-adjusted\nDirichlet (MAD) sequence model characterizes the predictive measure as a\nmixture of a base measure and Metropolis-Hastings kernels centered on previous\ndata points. The resulting MAD sequence is asymptotically exchangeable and the\nposterior on the data generator takes the form of a martingale posterior. This\nstructure leads to straightforward algorithms for inference on count\ndistributions, with easy extensions to multivariate, regression, and binary\ndata cases. We obtain a useful asymptotic Gaussian approximation and illustrate\nthe methodology on a variety of applications.",

Despite a growing body of research\non individual attack vectors - ranging from adversarial poisoning and evasion\nto circuit-level backdoors, side-channel leakage, and model extraction - these\nthreats are often analyzed in isolation, with unrealistic assumptions about\nattacker capabilities and system environments. This fragmentation hampers the\ndevelopment of effective, holistic defense strategies. In this work, we argue\nthat QML security requires more structured modeling of the attack surface,\ncapturing not only individual techniques but also their relationships,\nprerequisites, and potential impact across the QML pipeline. We propose\nadapting kill chain models, widely used in classical IT and cybersecurity, to\nthe quantum machine learning context.

Based on extensive literature analysis, we\npresent a detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors mapped to corresponding\nstages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework that is inspired by the MITRE\nATLAS for classical machine learning. We highlight interdependencies between\nphysical-level threats (like side-channel leakage and crosstalk faults), data\nand algorithm manipulation (such as poisoning or circuit backdoors), and\nprivacy attacks (including model extraction and training data inference).

We provide a theoretical analysis of\nthis setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous\nKnowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate\nprediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server\nupdates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge\ndistillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that\nwhile correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across\nclients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This\nsuggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified\nsamples.

Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update\nthe global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The\nserver update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a\ntheoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence.

However, the\nadvent of such systems also raises several questions on the ability of a\ncomplex network of agents to effectively self-organize and collaborate. While\nmeasuring performance on standard reasoning benchmarks indicates how well\nmulti-agent systems can solve reasoning tasks, it is unclear whether these\nsystems are able to leverage their topology effectively. Here, we propose\nAgentsNet, a new benchmark for multi-agent reasoning. By drawing inspiration\nfrom classical problems in distributed systems and graph theory, AgentsNet\nmeasures the ability of multi-agent systems to collaboratively form strategies\nfor problem-solving, self-organization, and effective communication given a\nnetwork topology. We evaluate a variety of baseline methods on AgentsNet\nincluding homogeneous networks of agents which first have to agree on basic\nprotocols for organization and communication. We find that some frontier LLMs\nare already demonstrating strong performance for small networks but begin to\nfall off once the size of the network scales. While existing multi-agent\nbenchmarks cover at most 2-5 agents, AgentsNet is practically unlimited in size\nand can scale with new generations of LLMs. As such, we also probe frontier\nmodels in a setup with up to 100 agents.",

    "abstract": "Although the analysis of rooted tree shape has wide-ranging applications,\nnotions of tree balance have developed independently in different domains. In\ncomputer science, a balanced tree is one that enables efficient updating and\nretrieval of data, whereas in biology tree balance quantifies bias in\nevolutionary processes. The lack of a precise connection between these concepts\nhas stymied the development of universal indices and general results. We\nrecently introduced a new tree balance index, $J^1$, that, unlike prior indices\npopular among biologists, permits meaningful comparison of trees with arbitrary\ndegree distributions and node sizes. Here we explain how our new index\ngeneralizes a concept that underlies the definition of the weight-balanced\ntree, an important type of self-balancing binary search tree. Our index thus\nunifies the tree balance concepts of biology and computer science. We provide\nnew analytical results to support applications of this universal index. First,\nwe quantify the accuracy of approximations to the expected values of $J^1$\nunder two important null models: the Yule process and the uniform model.\nSecond, we investigate minimal values of our index. These results help\nestablish $J^1$ as a universal, cross-disciplinary index of tree balance that\ngeneralizes and supersedes prior approaches.",

A novel type of\nrubrene microcrystal is prepared in the orthorhombic phase, exhibiting\nzone-sectored tabular domains with distinct photoluminescence (PL)\ncharacteristics. These sectors exhibit distinct PL spectra and time-evolution,\narising from differences in the in-plane orientation of the orthorhombic unit\ncell relative to the crystal surface. A combination of polarised optical\nmicroscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and atomic force\nmicroscopy (AFM) is used to characterise the samples in terms of crystal\norientation, fluorescence lifetime, and photoluminescence spectra. Spatially\nresolved PL spectroscopy reveals that the redshifted 650 nm emission band has\npolarisation along the transition dipole moment and is associated with high\nphoton absorption due to the alignment of excitation polarisation and\ntransition dipole moment and selectively localized within specific sectors of\nthe crystal. The detected photon originates from direct emission of a geminate\ncoherent triplet pair, or from its fusion. This band exhibits pure\nmono-exponential dynamics with 3.7 ns lifetime. The triplet fusion behaviour in\nthe succeeding time regimes can be treated in the framework of power law\nscaling and random walk. The emission kinetics are modelled using rate\nequations describing geminate and non-geminate exciton fusion processes,\nenabling a quantitative interpretation of the spatially resolved PL kinetics.\nThese findings introduce a material-based strategy, opening novel routes for\nphotonic applications and light harvesting.",

Because these\nmaterials are often limited in size, experimental setups typically rely on\ntightly focused beams and metallic holders with small apertures. In this work,\nwe perform a systematic study of how aperture geometry influences THz signal\ntransmission in a standard free-space configuration. By analyzing time- and\nfrequency-domain data for circular apertures of varying diameters and\nthicknesses, we quantify the spatial and spectral filtering effects imposed by\naperture size. We show that small apertures progressively attenuate\nlow-frequency components of the transmitted signal, while higher-frequency\ncontent remains comparatively unaffected. These effects become especially\nsignificant for apertures smaller than typical THz beam waists, resulting in\namplitude suppression and phase distortions that compromise the accuracy of\nfrequency-domain analysis and optical parameter retrieval. The transmitted\nintensity as a function of aperture diameter also provides a straightforward\nmethod for estimating the beam waist at the focus. In contrast, standard\naperture thicknesses do not introduce measurable distortions, confirming the\nadequacy of treating thick, non-resonant apertures as dielectric slabs.

    "abstract": "Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical\nwater management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable\nirrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and\ndrying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping\nsecure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a\nkey component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited\ndata on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking\nand targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework\nto monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a\nregion facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect\nessential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's\nPromoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained\napproximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their\nfield-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with\nSentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and\nirrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing\nDSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior\nknowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR\nadoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with\ndistrict-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77)\nwith government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool\nto track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and\nmeasure program impacts at scale.",

However, the ability to\nfollow speech instructions has not been fully realized due to the lack of\ndatasets and heavily biased training tasks. Leveraging the rich ASR datasets,\nprevious approaches have used Large Language Models~(\\textbf{LLMs}) to continue\nthe linguistic information of speech to construct speech instruction datasets.\nYet, due to the gap between LLM-generated results and real human responses, the\ncontinuation methods further amplify these shortcomings.

Although modern\nText-To-Speech~(\\textbf{TTS}) models have achieved near-human-level synthesis\nquality, it is challenging to appropriately convert out-of-distribution text\ninstruction to speech due to the limitations of the training data distribution\nin TTS models. To address this issue, we propose a query rewriting framework\nwith multi-LLM knowledge fusion, employing multiple agents to annotate and\nvalidate the synthesized speech, making it possible to construct high-quality\nspeech instruction datasets without relying on human annotation. Experiments\nshow that this method can transform text instructions into distributions more\nsuitable for TTS models for speech synthesis through zero-shot rewriting,\nincreasing data usability from 72\\% to 93\\%.

    "abstract": "Husimi function (Q-function) of a quantum state is the distribution function\nof the density operator in the coherent state representation. It is widely used\nin theoretical research, such as in quantum optics. The Wehrl entropy is the\nShannon entropy of the Husimi function, and is non-zero even for pure states.\nThis entropy has been extensively studied in mathematical physics. Recent\nresearch also suggests a significant connection between the Wehrl entropy and\nmany-body quantum entanglement in spin systems. We investigate the statistical\ninterpretation of the Husimi function and the Wehrl entropy, taking the system\nof $N$ spin-1/2 particles as an example. Due to the completeness of coherent\nstates, the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy can be explained via the positive\noperator-valued measurement (POVM) theory, although the coherent states are not\na set of orthonormal basis. Here, with the help of the Bayes' theorem, we\nprovide an alternative probabilistic interpretation for the Husimi function and\nthe Wehrl entropy. This interpretation is based on direct measurements of the\nsystem, and thus does not require the introduction of an ancillary system as in\nPOVM theory. Moreover, under this interpretation the classical correspondences\nof the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy are just phase-space probability\ndistribution function of $N$ classical tops, and its associated entropy,\nrespectively. Therefore, this explanation contributes to a better understanding\nof the relationship between the Husimi function, Wehrl entropy, and\nclassical-quantum correspondence. The generalization of this statistical\ninterpretation to continuous-variable systems is also discussed.",

We focus on an outer approximation (OA) approach, for\nwhich we develop the theoretical foundation and present two warm-starting\ntechniques for solving sequences of convex MINLPs. These types of problem\nsequences arise in several important applications, such as, multiobjective\nMINLPs using scalarization techniques, sparse linear regression, hybrid model\npredictive control, or simply in analyzing the impact of certain problem\nparameters.\n  The main contribution of this paper is the mathematical analysis of the\nproposed warm-starting framework for OA-based algorithms, which shows that a\nsimple adaptation of the polyhedral outer approximation from one problem to the\nnext can greatly improve the computational performance. We prove that, under\nsome conditions, one of the proposed warm-starting techniques result in only\none OA iteration to find an optimal solution and verify optimality. Numerical\nresults also demonstrate noticeable performance improvements compared to two\ncommon initialization approaches, and show that the warm-starting can also in\npractice result in a single iteration to converge for several problems in the\nsequences. Our methods are especially effective for problems where consecutive\nproblems in the sequence are similar, and where the integer part of the optimal\nsolutions are constant for several problems in the sequence.

    "abstract": "Proto-personas are commonly used during early-stage Product Discovery, such\nas Lean Inception, to guide product definition and stakeholder alignment.\nHowever, the manual creation of proto-personas is often time-consuming,\ncognitively demanding, and prone to bias. In this paper, we propose and\nempirically investigate a prompt engineering-based approach to generate\nproto-personas with the support of Generative AI (GenAI). Our goal is to\nevaluate the approach in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, user acceptance,\nand the empathy elicited by the generated personas. We conducted a case study\nwith 19 participants embedded in a real Lean Inception, employing a qualitative\nand quantitative methods design. The results reveal the approach's efficiency\nby reducing time and effort and improving the quality and reusability of\npersonas in later discovery phases, such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP)\nscoping and feature refinement. While acceptance was generally high, especially\nregarding perceived usefulness and ease of use, participants noted limitations\nrelated to generalization and domain specificity. Furthermore, although\ncognitive empathy was strongly supported, affective and behavioral empathy\nvaried significantly across participants. These results contribute novel\nempirical evidence on how GenAI can be effectively integrated into software\nProduct Discovery practices, while also identifying key challenges to be\naddressed in future iterations of such hybrid design processes.",

Based on the obtained results, in\nparticular, the observed X-ray spectra and lack of pulsations, as well as\nproperties of the identified optical counterparts, we conclude that both\ncandidates are unlikely to be XRBs. Based on LAMOST optical spectroscopy and\nSED fit results for 1eRASS J061330.8+160440 we classify it as an M0\nchromospherically active subgiant star. ZTF and TESS photometry reveal highly\nsignificant period for this object of 7.189 days, which likely attributed to\nstarspot(s). On the other hand, SALT follow-up spectroscopy of 1eRASS\nJ161201.9-464622 solidly classifies this source as a bright novalike\ncataclysmic variable (CV), the second discovered with eROSITA. A persistent\n4.802 h signal is found across all three available TESS observations, and is\ntentatively identified as the orbital period of the binary. Follow-up\nhigh-speed photometry and time-resolved spectroscopy are required to confirm\nthe derived orbital modulation.",

Among these techniques, optoplasmonic\nwhispering gallery mode sensing has demonstrated great potential in label-free\nsingle-molecule characterization. It combines the principles of localized\nsurface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and whispering gallery mode (WGM) sensing,\noffering exceptional sensing capabilities, even at the level of single ions.\nHowever, current optoplasmonic WGM sensing operates in a multiplexed channel,\nmaking it challenging to focus on individual binding sites of analyte\nmolecules. In this article, we characterize different binding sites of DNA\nanalyte molecules hybridizing to docking strands on the optoplasmonic WGM\nsensor, using the ratio of the resonance shift between sequential polar WGM\nmodes. We identify specific docking sites that undergo transient interactions\nand eventually hybridize with the complementary analyte strands permanently.",

    "abstract": "Image-text matching (ITM) aims to address the fundamental challenge of\naligning visual and textual modalities, which inherently differ in their\nrepresentations, continuous, high-dimensional image features vs. discrete,\nstructured text. We propose a novel framework that bridges the modality gap by\nleveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as visual semantic parsers.\nBy generating rich Visual Semantic Descriptions (VSD), MLLMs provide semantic\nanchor that facilitate cross-modal alignment. Our approach combines: (1)\nInstance-level alignment by fusing visual features with VSD to enhance the\nlinguistic expressiveness of image representations, and (2) Prototype-level\nalignment through VSD clustering to ensure category-level consistency. These\nmodules can be seamlessly integrated into existing ITM models. Extensive\nexperiments on Flickr30K and MSCOCO demonstrate substantial performance\nimprovements. The approach also exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to\ncross-domain tasks, including news and remote sensing ITM.

We find that NGC~1346 has reverted to\nits former (2001) type-1 spectral state after having been a type-2 active\ngalactic nucleus from 2004 to 2022. More and more intense broad H$\\beta$ (3720\n$\\pm$ 310 km.s$^{-1}$ full width at half maximum) and H$\\alpha$ (2985 $\\pm$ 230\nkm.s$^{-1}$) emission lines appeared between August and September 2024,\nsuggesting that the broad-line region (BLR) is increasingly irradiated. The\nstrong blueshift of the Balmer lines ($\\sim$ 1600 km.s$^{-1}$) indicates that\nthe gas is moving toward the observer, possibly due to a radiation-driven\noutflow. The strong difference between 2022's ($\\sim$ 3\\%) and 2024-2025's\nde-biased polarization ($\\le$ 0.5\\%), the blueing of the spectra between August\nand September 2024, and the slow rise in the integrated flux between 2022 and\n2025 argue against asymmetric or temporary obscuration by a cloud passing in\nfront of the line of sight. Two options, either a re-illumination of the BLR or\na tidal disruption event, can explain the observed properties of NGC~1346.\nTimely follow-up observations taken while the phenomenon is still ongoing are\nneeded to determine which of the two solutions is the correct one.",

    "abstract": "Liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs) rely on highly pure argon to\nensure that ionization electrons produced by charged particles reach readout\narrays. ProtoDUNE Single-Phase (ProtoDUNE-SP) was an approximately 700-ton\nliquid argon detector intended to prototype the Deep Underground Neutrino\nExperiment (DUNE) Far Detector Horizontal Drift module. It contains two drift\nvolumes bisected by the cathode plane assembly, which is biased to create an\nalmost uniform electric field in both volumes. The DUNE Far Detector modules\nmust have robust cryogenic systems capable of filtering argon and supplying the\nTPC with clean liquid. This paper will explore comparisons of the argon purity\nmeasured by the purity monitors with those measured using muons in the TPC from\nOctober 2018 to November 2018. A new method is introduced to measure the liquid\nargon purity in the TPC using muons crossing both drift volumes of\nProtoDUNE-SP. For extended periods on the timescale of weeks, the drift\nelectron lifetime was measured to be above 30 ms using both systems. A\nparticular focus will be placed on the measured purity of argon as a function\nof position in the detector.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensuring the reliability\nof deep learning applications and has attracted significant attention in recent\nyears. A rich body of literature has emerged to develop efficient score\nfunctions that assign high scores to in-distribution (ID) samples and low\nscores to OOD samples, thereby helping distinguish OOD samples. Among these\nmethods, distance-based score functions are widely used because of their\nefficiency and ease of use. However, deep learning often leads to a biased\ndistribution of data features, and extreme features are inevitable. These\nextreme features make the distance-based methods tend to assign too low scores\nto ID samples. This limits the OOD detection capabilities of such methods. To\naddress this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Feature Bank\nEnhancement (FBE), that uses statistical characteristics from dataset to\nidentify and constrain extreme features to the separation boundaries, therapy\nmaking the distance between samples inside and outside the distribution\nfarther. We conducted experiments on large-scale ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10\nrespectively, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on both benchmark. Additionally, theoretical analysis and\nsupplementary experiments are conducted to provide more insights into our\nmethod.",

    "abstract": "Encoding a qubit in the continuous degrees of freedom of a quantum system,\nsuch as bosonic modes, is a powerful alternative to modern quantum error\ncorrection (QEC). Among the most prominent bosonic QEC codes, binomial codes\nprovide protection against loss and dephasing errors by encoding logical states\nin superpositions of Fock states with binomially weighted coefficients. While\nmuch attention has been given to their error-correcting capabilities and\nintegration into fault-tolerant architectures, efficient methods for generating\narbitrary binomial codewords remain scarce. In this work, we propose a novel\nscheme for generating these codewords by exploiting nonlinear multiphoton\ninteractions between a continuous-variable bosonic mode (oscillator) and a\ntwo-level system (spin/qubit). Our proposed scheme assumes the ability to\nprepare the oscillator in an arbitrary Fock state and the qubit in an arbitrary\nsuperposition of its basis states and access to arbitrarily high multiphoton\ninteractions. To enhance the experimental feasibility of our scheme, we further\ndemonstrate how to reduce the required order parameter of multiphoton\ninteractions by a factor of two for a special class of code states.",

We address this gap by developing an\nagentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential\nequations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which\ninform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional\nbacktests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally\nplausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading\nstrategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across\nmultiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model\ndiscovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading\ndecisions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread interest in machine learning (ML), the engineering\nindustry has not yet fully adopted ML-based methods, which has left engineers\nand stakeholders uncertain about the legal and regulatory frameworks that\ngovern their decisions. This gap remains unaddressed as an engineer's\ndecision-making process, typically governed by professional ethics and\npractical guidelines, now intersects with complex algorithmic outputs. To\nbridge this gap, this paper explores how engineers can navigate legal\nprinciples and legislative justifications that support and/or contest the\ndeployment of ML technologies. Drawing on recent precedents and experiences\ngained from other fields, this paper argues that analogical reasoning can\nprovide a basis for embedding ML within existing engineering codes while\nmaintaining professional accountability and meeting safety requirements. In\nexploring these issues, the discussion focuses on established liability\ndoctrines, such as negligence and product liability, and highlights how courts\nhave evaluated the use of predictive models. We further analyze how legislative\nbodies and standard-setting organizations can furnish explicit guidance\nequivalent to prior endorsements of emergent technologies. This exploration\nstresses the vitality of understanding the interplay between technical\njustifications and legal precedents for shaping an informed stance on ML's\nlegitimacy in engineering practice. Finally, our analysis catalyzes a legal\nframework for integrating ML through which stakeholders can critically assess\nthe responsibilities, liabilities, and benefits inherent in ML-driven\nengineering solutions.",

    "abstract": "Formally specifying, let alone verifying, properties of systems involving\nmultiple programming languages is inherently challenging. We introduce\nHeterogeneous Dynamic Logic (HDL), a framework for combining reasoning\nprinciples from distinct (dynamic) program logics in a modular and\ncompositional way. HDL mirrors the architecture of satisfiability modulo\ntheories (SMT): Individual dynamic logics, along with their calculi, are\ntreated as dynamic theories that can be flexibly combined to reason about\nheterogeneous systems whose components are verified using different program\nlogics. HDL provides two key operations: Lifting extends an individual dynamic\ntheory with new program constructs (e.g., the havoc operation or regular\nprograms) and automatically augments its calculus with sound reasoning\nprinciples for the new constructs; and Combination enables cross-language\nreasoning in a single modality via Heterogeneous Dynamic Theories, facilitating\nthe reuse of existing proof infrastructure. We formalize dynamic theories,\ntheir lifting and combination in Isabelle, and prove the soundness of all proof\nrules. We also prove relative completeness theorems for lifting and\ncombination: Under common assumptions, reasoning about lifted or combined\ntheories is no harder than reasoning about the constituent dynamic theories and\ntheir common first-order structure (i.e., the \"data theory\"). We demonstrate\nHDL's utility by verifying an automotive case study in which a Java controller\n(formalized in Java dynamic logic) steers a plant model (formalized in\ndifferential dynamic logic).",

For thin BST (30 nm), charged impurities, potentially from silicon\ndioxide substrate traps, contribute to band tail-type localization, with the\nimpurity density ($ n_{\\text{imp}} = 10^{11} \\text{ cm}^{-2} $) suggesting an\nexternal influence, though quantitative confirmation is needed. In contrast,\nthick BST (60 nm) exhibits potential fluctuations driven by inherent impurities\n($ n_{\\text{imp}} = 2.23 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ cm}^{-2} $), forming\nelectron-rich (n-type) and hole-rich (p-type) regions that cause band\nmeandering near the chemical potential. Indium doping in thin IBST\nsignificantly increases the impurity density to $ 1.53 \\times 10^{15} \\text{\ncm}^{-2} $, exacerbating these fluctuations and reducing mobility due to\nenhanced scattering. Gate-dependence analysis further revealed a\ntemperature-driven transition from n-type to p-type characteristics at elevated\ntemperatures (~170 K), attributed to thermal activation of holes in p-type\nregions. These findings highlight the critical role of impurity management in\noptimizing topological insulators for applications in spintronics and quantum\ncomputing.",

Second, we inspect how the OIMF constrains\nthe ocean flow and Ganymede's internal structure and suggest a suitable metric\nfor this purpose. We calculate the OIMF by solving the electromagnetic\ninduction (EMI) equation in the simplified form, where we neglect the\nocean-induced field in the advection term and the motionless induction. We show\nthat this approach is sufficiently accurate by comparison with the solution of\nthe full EMI equation. We also demonstrate that the OIMF is predominantly a\nstationary signal generated by the interaction of the toroidal component of the\nflow with Ganymede's internal field. The contributions to the OIMF due to the\npoloidal component of the flow and Jupiter's magnetic field can be neglected as\nsecond-order effects. The stationary OIMF is a measurable quantity with a few\nnT amplitude on Ganymede's surface if the ocean is sufficiently thick\n(approximately 400 km) and conductive (approximately 5 S/m). In this case, the\nspecific footprint of the measured OIMF could be used to identify the flow\nregime (mode) of the convecting ocean. Additionally, the OIMF can be used to\ndetermine the ocean thickness since the OIMF pattern is shifted towards low\nlatitudes if the ocean thickness is reduced.",

From the\nprocess fidelity results it shows that the (classical) thermal noise in the\nphase-shifters dominates over other optical imperfections, such as mode\nmismatch and dark counts from single-photon sources.\n  The benchmarking framework and experimental results demonstrate that photonic\nprocessors are strong contenders for near-term quantum algorithm deployment,\nparticularly in hybrid variational contexts. This analysis is valuable not only\nfor state and process tomography but also for a wide range of applications\ninvolving variational quantum circuit based algorithms.",

To clarify its\nnature, we performed multiband time-series optical photometry with 1.5-m class\ntelescopes and spectroscopy with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We also\nanalysed archival data of different optical surveys and detected the source in\nX-rays with the Spectrum-RG/eROSITA telescope. We confirm the orbital period of\n$\\approx$1.5 h with the high amplitude of the brightness modulation. Compiling\nsurvey data, covering $\\sim$19 yr, we find high and low brightness states of\nthe object at time scales of years, likely explained by different accretion\nrates. Our data were obtained in the high brightness state. Optical spectra\nwith hydrogen and helium emission lines, consisting of broad and narrow\ncomponents, indicate the presence of an accretion stream without disk. The\nDoppler tomography shows that the narrow component is mainly emitted from the\nLagrangian L$_1$ point, while the broad component is from the region where the\naccretion stream interacts with the white dwarf magnetosphere. The ratio of\nequivalent widths of HeII 4686 and H$\\beta$ emission lines is $<$0.4, which is\ncuriously low for polars. The X-ray spectrum of the source can be described by\nthe thermal plasma emission model with parameters consistent with values\nobserved for polars.",

This\nanisotropy is understood to be of extragalactic origin, as the maximum of the\ndipolar component is located ${\\sim}115^\\circ$ away from the Galactic Center.\nCosmic rays interact with background radiation and magnetized regions on their\npath from their sources to Earth. These interactions, which depend on the\ncosmic-ray energy, charge and mass composition, give rise to different horizons\nand deflections that are expected to lead to different anisotropies in the\narrival directions of cosmic rays at Earth. The Auger Collaboration has\ndetermined that the mass composition of cosmic rays at ultra-high energies is\nmixed, becoming increasingly heavier as a function of energy. Thus, different\ndipole amplitudes are expected to be measured at a given energy when separating\nthe data into composition-distinct subsets of lighter and heavier elements.\n  In this contribution, we investigate the composition signature on the\nlarge-scale anisotropy taking advantage of composition estimators obtained from\nthe data gathered with the surface detector. A way of probing for composition\nsignatures in anisotropy patterns is then to divide the data into subsets of\n``lighter'' and ``heavier'' elements per energy bin. In a simulation library,\nwe evaluate the possibility of measuring a separation in total dipole amplitude\nbetween two such populations of the measured dataset under a source-agnostic\nmodel.

The framework leverages a spatial-temporal\nencoder and a risk-attentive feature fusion decoder to embed the risk potential\nfield into the extracted spatial-temporal feature representations for\ntrajectory prediction. A risk-scaled loss function is further designed to\nimprove the prediction accuracy of high-risk scenarios, such as short relative\nspacing. Experiments on the widely used NGSIM and HighD datasets demonstrate\nthat our method reduces average prediction errors by 4.8% and 31.2%\nrespectively compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially in high-risk\nscenarios.

Recent works have explored data augmentation\ntechniques or introduced timing conditions as model inputs to enable\ntiming-conditioned 10-second T2A generation, while their synthesis quality is\nstill limited. In this work, we propose a novel training-free timing-controlled\nT2A framework, FreeAudio, making the first attempt to enable timing-controlled\nlong-form T2A generation, e.g., \"owl hooted at 2.4s-5.2s and crickets chirping\nat 0s-24s\". Specifically, we first employ an LLM to plan non-overlapping time\nwindows and recaption each with a refined natural language description, based\non the input text and timing prompts. Then we introduce: 1) Decoupling and\nAggregating Attention Control for precise timing control; 2) Contextual Latent\nComposition for local smoothness and Reference Guidance for global consistency.\nExtensive experiments show that: 1) FreeAudio achieves state-of-the-art\ntiming-conditioned T2A synthesis quality among training-free methods and is\ncomparable to leading training-based methods; 2) FreeAudio demonstrates\ncomparable long-form generation quality with training-based Stable Audio and\npaves the way for timing-controlled long-form T2A synthesis.

    "abstract": "3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has gained increasing attention due to its\npivotal role in 3D perception. Recent advancements have primarily focused on\nrefining voxel-level features to construct 3D scenes. However, treating voxels\nas the basic interaction units inherently limits the utilization of class-level\ninformation, which is proven critical for enhancing the granularity of\ncompletion results. To address this, we propose \\textbf{D}isentangling Instance\nand Scene Contexts (DISC), a novel dual-stream paradigm that enhances learning\nfor both instance and scene categories through separated optimization.\nSpecifically, we replace voxel queries with discriminative class queries, which\nincorporate class-specific geometric and semantic priors. Additionally, we\nexploit the intrinsic properties of classes to design specialized decoding\nmodules, facilitating targeted interactions and efficient class-level\ninformation flow. Experimental results demonstrate that DISC achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both SemanticKITTI and\nSSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks, with mIoU scores of 17.35 and 20.55,\nrespectively. Remarkably, DISC even outperforms multi-frame SOTA methods using\nonly single-frame input and significantly improves instance category\nperformance, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame SOTA instance mIoU by\n17.9\\% and 11.9\\%, respectively, on the SemanticKITTI hidden test.

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation relies on many dense pixel-wise annotations to achieve\nthe best performance, but owing to the difficulty of obtaining accurate\nannotations for real world data, practitioners train on large-scale synthetic\ndatasets. Unpaired image translation is one method used to address the ensuing\ndomain gap by generating more realistic training data in low-data regimes.\nCurrent methods for unpaired image translation train generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) to perform the translation and enforce pixel-level semantic\nmatching through cycle consistency. These methods do not guarantee that the\nsemantic matching holds, posing a problem for semantic segmentation where\nperformance is sensitive to noisy pixel labels. We propose a novel image\ntranslation method, Domain Adversarial Kernel Prediction Network (DA-KPN), that\nguarantees semantic matching between the synthetic label and translation.\nDA-KPN estimates pixel-wise input transformation parameters of a lightweight\nand simple translation function. To ensure the pixel-wise transformation is\nrealistic, DA-KPN uses multi-scale discriminators to distinguish between\ntranslated and target samples. We show DA-KPN outperforms previous GAN-based\nmethods on syn2real benchmarks for semantic segmentation with limited access to\nreal image labels and achieves comparable performance on face parsing.",

Parallel co-winding is a\npromising method to reduce the charging delay of NI coils while maintaining\nthermal stability, demonstrating significant potential for applications in\nfusion and other large-scale or high-field magnets. The non-uniform current\ndistribution among parallel superconducting tapes in parallel co-wound NI coils\nmay lead to thermal and mechanical stability issues. In this work, we conducted\ncurrent measurement experiments on small parallel co-wound NI REBCO coils to\ninvestigate the non-uniform current distribution and its influencing factors.\nThe parallel tapes in the input and output sections of the test coils were\nseparated and a series of Rogowski coils was used to measure the current in\neach tape during ramping charging process. We combined a field-circuit coupled\nmodel based on the T-A formulation with an equivalent circuit model to\ncalculate the current distribution in co-wound coils. Both the measured and\ncalculated results indicated that the current distribution during ramping was\nhighly non-uniform, with some tapes carrying reverse currents. We calculated\nthe current distribution in co-wound coils with different insulation methods\nand analyzed the influencing factors of the reverse current. The influence of\nthe terminal resistance on current distribution was also discussed. This work\ncould contribute to a deeper understanding of current distribution behavior in\nco-wound coils and provide insights for their application in large-scale or\nhigh-field magnet systems.",

Physically, these contributions\nare expected to arise from a spectral asymmetry in the continuum of scattering\nstates of $n$ BPS dyons with mutually non-local charges. For $n=2$, the\n(standard, depth one) error function completion was derived long ago by\nexplicitly computing the bosonic and fermionic density of states in the\ntwo-body supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Here we derive the general\nnon-holomorphic completion for an arbitrary number of centers by evaluating the\nrefined Witten index of the supersymmetric quantum mechanics using\nlocalisation. In a nutshell, the index reduces to an integral over\n$\\mathbb{R}^{3n-3}$ (the relative location of the centers), and splits into an\nintegral over the $2n-2$ dimensional phase space of BPS ground states times an\nintegral over $n-1$ transverse directions, which ultimately produces the\nexpected generalized error functions.",

Existing\nstrategies, such as the Minimum Hop Path set, prioritize minimizing hop counts\nto reduce latency, but ignore ISL switching costs, which leads to high\ninstability. To overcome this, the Adaptive Path Routing Scheme introduces path\nsimilarity thresholds to reduce the ISL switching frequency between shells.\nHowever, the greedy approach of Adaptive Path Routing Scheme is often trapped\nin local optima, sacrificing inter-shell path distance efficiency. To address\nthese limitations, we propose the Dynamic Programming-based Integrated Routing\nCost (DP-IRC) algorithm, which is designed explicitly for inter-shell routing\noptimization. By formulating multi-shell paths as a multistage decision\nproblem, DP-IRC balances hop counts and ISL stability through an Integrated\nRouting Cost (IRC) metric, combining inter-/intra-shell hops and switching\ncosts. Experiments over 60 time slots with real-world Starlink and OneWeb\nconfigurations show that DP-IRC reduces inter-shell ISL switching rates by\n39.1% and 22.0% compared to the Minimum Hop Path set strategy and Adaptive Path\nRouting Scheme, respectively, while still maintaining near-optimal end-to-end\ndistances.",

To address this, we\npropose RadiomicsRetrieval, a 3D content-based retrieval framework bridging\nhandcrafted radiomics descriptors with deep learning-based embeddings at the\ntumor level. Unlike existing 2D approaches, RadiomicsRetrieval fully exploits\nvolumetric data to leverage richer spatial context in medical images. We employ\na promptable segmentation model (e.g., SAM) to derive tumor-specific image\nembeddings, which are aligned with radiomics features extracted from the same\ntumor via contrastive learning. These representations are further enriched by\nanatomical positional embedding (APE). As a result, RadiomicsRetrieval enables\nflexible querying based on shape, location, or partial feature sets. Extensive\nexperiments on both lung CT and brain MRI public datasets demonstrate that\nradiomics features significantly enhance retrieval specificity, while APE\nprovides global anatomical context essential for location-based searches.\nNotably, our framework requires only minimal user prompts (e.g., a single\npoint), minimizing segmentation overhead and supporting diverse clinical\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "Euclid is presently mapping the distribution of matter in the Universe in\ndetail via the weak lensing (WL) signature of billions of distant galaxies. The\nWL signal is most prominent around galaxy clusters, and can extend up to\ndistances well beyond their virial radius, thus constraining their total mass.\nNear the centre of clusters, where contamination by member galaxies is an\nissue, the WL data can be complemented with strong lensing (SL) data which can\ndiminish the uncertainty due to the mass-sheet degeneracy and provide\nhigh-resolution information about the distribution of matter in the centre of\nclusters. Here we present a joint SL and WL analysis of the Euclid Early\nRelease Observations of the cluster Abell 2390 at z=0.228. Thanks to Euclid's\nwide field of view of 0.5 deg$^$2, combined with its angular resolution in the\nvisible band of 0.\"13 and sampling of 0.\"1 per pixel, we constrain the density\nprofile in a wide range of radii, 30 kpc < r < 2000 kpc, from the inner region\nnear the brightest cluster galaxy to beyond the virial radius of the cluster.\nWe find consistency with earlier X-ray results based on assumptions of\nhydrostatic equilibrium, thus indirectly confirming the nearly relaxed state of\nthis cluster. We also find consistency with previous results based on weak\nlensing data and ground-based observations of this cluster. From the combined\nSL+WL profile, we derive the values of the viral mass $M_{200} = (1.48 \\pm\n0.29)\\times10^{15}\\, \\Msun$, and virial radius $r_{200} =(2.05\\pm0.13 \\, {\\rm\nMpc}$), with error bars representing one standard deviation. The profile is\nwell described by an NFW model with concentration c=6.5 and a small-scale\nradius of 230 kpc in the 30\\,kpc $< r <$ 2000\\,kpc range that is best\nconstrained by SL and WL data. Abell 2390 is the first of many examples where\nEuclid data will play a crucial role in providing masses for clusters.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA\nregulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on\nhigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based\nalgorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face\nseveral limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA\nsequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high\ncomputational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are\ninefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is\neven greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the\ncanonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep\nlearning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.\nFurthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far\nlower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning\nframework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for\npredicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of\ntwo subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing\n(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant\nspecies. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering\npreviously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability\nanalyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing\nto its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational\nmethod and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a\nfoundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA\nannotation.",

In the core\nof our approach is a polynomial time algorithm for computing planar\nH-modulators. Given a graph class H, a planar H-modulator of a graph G is a set\nX \\subseteq V(G) such that the ``torso'' of X is planar and all connected\ncomponents of G - X belong to H. Here, the torso of X is obtained from G[X] if,\nfor every connected component of G-X, we form a clique out of its neighborhood\non G[X]. We introduce H-Planarity as the problem of deciding whether a graph G\nhas a planar H-modulator. We prove that, if H is hereditary, CMSO-definable,\nand decidable in polynomial time, then H-Planarity is solvable in polynomial\ntime. Further, we introduce two parametric extensions of H-Planarity by\ndefining the notions of H-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth, which\ngeneralize the concepts of elimination distance and tree decompositions to the\nclass H. Combining this result with existing FPT algorithms for various\nH-modulator problems, we thereby obtain FPT algorithms parameterized by\nH-planar treedepth and H-planar treewidth for numerous graph classes H. By\ncombining the well-known algorithmic properties of planar graphs and graphs of\nbounded treewidth, our methods for computing H-planar treedepth and H-planar\ntreewidth lead to a variety of algorithmic applications. For instance, once we\nknow that a given graph has bounded H-planar treedepth or bounded H-planar\ntreewidth, we can derive additive approximation algorithms for graph coloring\nand polynomial-time algorithms for counting (weighted) perfect matchings.\nFurthermore, we design Efficient Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes\n(EPTAS-es) for several problems, including Maximum Independent Set.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the progenitors of thermonuclear supernovae (Type Ia supernovae;\nSNe Ia) remains a key objective in contemporary astronomy. The rare subclass of\nSNe Ia that interacts with circumstellar material (Type Ia-CSM) allows for\nstudies of the progenitor's environment before explosion, and generally favours\nsingle-degenerate progenitor channels. The case of SN Ia-CSM PTF11kx clearly\nconnected thermonuclear explosions with hydrogen-rich CSM-interacting events,\nand the more recent SN 2020eyj connected SNe Ia with helum-rich companion\nprogenitors. Here we present a study of SN 2020aeuh, a Type Ia-CSM with delayed\ninteraction. We analyse photometric and spectroscopic data that monitor the\nevolution of SN 2020aeuh and compare its properties with those of peculiar SNe\nIa and core-collapse SNe. At early times, the evolution of SN 2020aeuh\nresembles a slightly overluminous SN Ia. Later, the interaction-dominated\nspectra develop the same pseudocontinuum seen in Type Ia-CSM PTF11kx and SN\n2020eyj. However, the later-time spectra of SN 2020aeuh lack hydrogen and\nhelium narrow lines. Instead, a few narrow lines could be attributed to carbon\nand oxygen. We fit the pseudobolometric light curve with a CSM-interaction\nmode, yielding a CSM mass of 1-2 M$_{\\odot}$. We propose that SN 2020aeuh was a\nType Ia supernova that eventually interacted with a dense medium which was\ndeficient in both hydrogen and helium. Whereas previous SNe Ia-CSM constitute\nour best evidence for nondegenerate companion progenitors, the CSM around SN\n2020aeuh is more difficult to understand. We include a hydrodynamical\nsimulation for a double-degenerate system to showcase how the dynamical\nevolution of such a progenitor scenario could produce the CSM observed around\nSN 2020aeuh. It is clear that SN 2020aeuh challenges current models for stellar\nevolution leading up to a SN Ia explosion.",

These spirals can originate from\neither frustrated Heisenberg exchange interactions or the interplay between\nexchange interactions and the relativistic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction,\nleading to atomic- and mesoscale textures, respectively. However, the\nconversion of exchange-stabilized spin spirals into skyrmions typically\nrequires magnetic fields that exceed practical laboratory limits. Here, we\ndemonstrate a strategy leveraging hydrogen adsorption to expand the range of\nmagnetic films capable of hosting stable or metastable skyrmions. In a\nstructurally open and anisotropic system of two pseudomorphic Fe layers on\nIr(110), spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy combined with ab initio\ncalculations reveals that a right-handed, exchange-stabilized N\\'eel-type spin\nspiral propagating along the [$\\overline{1}10$] direction with a $1.3$~nm\nperiod transitions upon hydrogen adsorption to a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type\nspiral with a sevenfold longer period of $8.5$~nm. This transition enables\nelliptical skyrmions to form at moderate magnetic fields. Hydrogenation thus\nprovides a non-volatile mechanism to toggle between distinct magnetic states,\noffering a versatile platform for controlling spin textures.",

Traditional music\nperformance synthesis pipelines follow a two-stage approach, first generating\nexpressive performance MIDI from a score, then synthesising the MIDI into\naudio. However, the synthesis models often struggle to generalise across\ndiverse MIDI sources, musical styles, and recording environments. To address\nthese challenges, we propose MIDI-VALLE, a neural codec language model adapted\nfrom the VALLE framework, which was originally designed for zero-shot\npersonalised text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. For performance MIDI-to-audio\nsynthesis, we improve the architecture to condition on a reference audio\nperformance and its corresponding MIDI. Unlike previous TTS-based systems that\nrely on piano rolls, MIDI-VALLE encodes both MIDI and audio as discrete tokens,\nfacilitating a more consistent and robust modelling of piano performances.\nFurthermore, the model's generalisation ability is enhanced by training on an\nextensive and diverse piano performance dataset. Evaluation results show that\nMIDI-VALLE significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline, achieving\nover 75% lower Frechet Audio Distance on the ATEPP and Maestro datasets.

This model assumes sub-Alfv\\'enic interstellar\nturbulence in the surrounding medium of the pulsar and a rough alignment of the\nline-of-sight of observers towards the pulsars with the local mean magnetic\nfield direction in the halo. In this model, the expected morphology of a pulsar\nhalo is highly dependent on the properties of the interstellar magnetic field.\nWe investigate the anisotropic diffusion of electron-positron pairs across\nmultiple coherence of magnetic fields in pulsar halos in this work. We focus\nparticularly on their influences on the predicted gamma-ray surface brightness\nprofile and the asymmetry of the halo's morphology, as well as the\nobservational expectations by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory\n(LHAASO). Our results indicate that the requirement of a specific magnetic\nfield geometry can be alleviated when accounting for a limited (and realistic)\ncoherence length of the magnetic field in the model. Also, the halo's\nmorphology may appear less asymmetric, especially after being smoothed by the\npoint spread function of instruments. It largely relaxes the tension between\nthe asymmetric morphology of halos predicted by the model and lack of apparent\nasymmetric halos detected so far.

Our key insight is that the inference efficiency\nemerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than\nparsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A\nPrefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of\nin-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency.

Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts,\napplying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using\nholistic images.

To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided\nFeature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR),\nwhich simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student\ndistillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion\npatterns into feature representation while transferring the purified\ndiscriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch\nthrough reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware\nVision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern\nembeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding\nocclusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature\nErasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent\nis employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that\ncontain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and\nsubstitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature\ncontamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues.\nAfterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch\neffectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust\nrepresentation regardless of the interference of occlusions.",

    "abstract": "Data depths are score functions that quantify in an unsupervised fashion how\ncentral is a point inside a distribution, with numerous applications such as\nanomaly detection, multivariate or functional data analysis, arising across\nvarious fields. The halfspace depth was the first depth to aim at generalising\nthe notion of quantile beyond the univariate case. Among the existing variety\nof depth definitions, it remains one of the most used notions of data depth.\nTaking a different angle from the quantile point of view, we show that the\nhalfspace depth can also be regarded as the minimum loss of a set of\nclassifiers for a specific labelling of the points. By changing the loss or the\nset of classifiers considered, this new angle naturally leads to a family of\n\"loss depths\", extending to well-studied classifiers such as, e.g., SVM or\nlogistic regression, among others. This framework directly inherits\ncomputational efficiency of existing machine learning algorithms as well as\ntheir fast statistical convergence rates, and opens the data depth realm to the\nhigh-dimensional setting. Furthermore, the new loss depths highlight a\nconnection between the dataset and the right amount of complexity or simplicity\nof the classifiers. The simplicity of classifiers as well as the interpretation\nas a risk makes our new kind of data depth easy to explain, yet efficient for\nanomaly detection, as is shown by experiments.",

    "abstract": "In molten-salt-fuelled reactor systems, the fluid may experience substantial\nvolumetric heat generation in addition to heat removal from surrounding\nstructures. To quantify these effects, we investigate developed channel flow\nwith internal heating using a systematic multi-scale approach comprising Direct\nNumerical Simulation (DNS), Large Eddy Simulation (LES), and a semi-analytical\nsolver (SAS). First, DNS and LES are compared in a turbulent parallel-plate\nconfiguration at different Prandtl and Reynolds numbers, demonstrating\nexcellent agreement in flow and thermal fields, with the SAS method showing\nacceptable accuracy. Building on this benchmarking, the SAS tool is then\nemployed to explore a broad parameter space, offering insights into how\ninternal heat deposition modifies the temperature distribution across Reynolds\nand Prandtl numbers. Comparisons are also drawn against the canonical\nwall-heating scenario, revealing that volumetric heating often remains a\nsecondary effect in turbulent regimes but can become more pronounced at lower\nReynolds numbers, higher Prandtl numbers, or when nearly all heat is deposited\nin the fluid. These findings establish guidelines for reduced-order modeling in\nliquid-fuel reactor analyses and highlight conditions under which internal\nheating warrants particular attention. The paper concludes by outlining ongoing\nand future research directions, including refinements for variable fluid\nproperties and complex geometry extensions.",

It operates in coincidence with the other detectors\nof the Pierre Auger Observatory particularly the Surface Detector (SD) and the\nFluorescence Detector (FD). As the largest cosmic-ray radio detector worldwide\nbefore the recent Observatory upgrade AugerPrime, AERA has played a pioneering\nrole in the development of radio technique for cosmic rays, providing\ncomplementary measurements and serving as a testbed for ideas that motivated\nthe build-up of a new Radio Detector (RD) as part of AugerPrime. We report on\nmeasurements of the depth of the shower maximum using the radio footprint,\ndemonstrating compatibility and competitive resolution with established FD\nresults. An absolute calibration of AERA is achieved by monitoring the sidereal\nmodulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission for nearly a decade,\nconfirming the long-term stability of a radio detector with no significant\naging effects observed. This stability suggests that radio detectors could also\nbe used to monitor potential aging effects in other detector systems.\nAdditionally, we investigate the muon content of inclined air showers using\nhybrid SD-AERA events. Our results indicate that the muon content in measured\ndata is consistent with expectations for iron nuclei as predicted by\ncurrent-generation hadronic interaction models, confirming the well-known muon\ndeficit for the first time with radio data.

Sequential Federated Learning (SFL) is a newly-emerging FL\ntraining framework where the global model is trained in a sequential manner\nacross clients. Since SFL can provide strong convergence guarantees under data\nheterogeneity, it has attracted significant research attention in recent years.\nHowever, experiments show that SFL suffers from severe catastrophic forgetting\nin heterogeneous environments, meaning that the model tends to forget knowledge\nlearned from previous clients. To address this issue, we propose an SFL\nframework with discrepancy-aware multi-teacher knowledge distillation, called\nSFedKD, which selects multiple models from the previous round to guide the\ncurrent round of training. In SFedKD, we extend the single-teacher Decoupled\nKnowledge Distillation approach to our multi-teacher setting and assign\ndistinct weights to teachers' target-class and non-target-class knowledge based\non the class distributional discrepancy between teacher and student data.\nThrough this fine-grained weighting strategy, SFedKD can enhance model training\nefficacy while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, to prevent\nknowledge dilution, we eliminate redundant teachers for the knowledge\ndistillation and formalize it as a variant of the maximum coverage problem.\nBased on the greedy strategy, we design a complementary-based teacher selection\nmechanism to ensure that the selected teachers achieve comprehensive knowledge\nspace coverage while reducing communication and computational costs.

    "abstract": "The downward continuation of potential fields from the Earth's surface into\nthe subsurface is a critical task in gravity exploration, as it helps to\nidentify the sources of gravity anomalies. This problem is often addressed by\nsolving a first-kind integral equation using regularization techniques to\nstabilize an inherently unstable process. A similar approach is used in our\nwork, where the continued field is represented as the potential of a simple\nlayer or its vertical derivative. The constancy of the density sign of this\nequivalent simple layer preserves the sign of anomalies, provided that the\nlayer's surface encloses all anomalous sources. This constraint is a key\nfeature of our algorithm for the downward continuation of potential fields. To\nenforce, for instance, non-negativity in the simple layer density, we employ\nthe NNLS (Non-Negative Least Squares) method. The efficiency of the proposed\nmethod is demonstrated on model examples.",

In this paper, we\npropose a novel \\textbf{bi-level framework} that maps language to logic through\na two-stage process: high-level task abstraction and low-level logic\ngeneration. At the upper level, a large language model (LLM) parses natural\nlanguage queries into intermediate structured representations specifying the\nproblem type, objectives, decision variables, and symbolic constraints. At the\nlower level, the LLM uses these representations to generate symbolic workflows\nor executable reasoning programs for accurate and interpretable decision\nmaking. The framework supports modular reasoning, enforces explicit\nconstraints, and generalizes across domains such as mathematical problem\nsolving, question answering, and logical inference. We further optimize the\nframework with an end-to-end {bi-level} optimization approach that jointly\nrefines both the high-level abstraction and low-level logic generation stages.\nExperiments on multiple realistic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our\napproach significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy, with\naccuracy gains reaching as high as 40\\%.

We demonstrate that the eigenstate carries\nnet angular momentum with the vortex charge being the quantum number of the\ntotal angular momentum along the propagation direction and deduce the explicit\nexpression for the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, we show\nthat helicity, which exhibits anomaly in the vortex state, can serve as a\npractical characterizing quantity for the REVB. This work lays a theoretical\nfoundation for further exploration of REVBs in both theory and experiment.",

    "abstract": "There are currently two main paradigms for evaluating large language models\n(LLMs), reference-based evaluation and preference-based evaluation. The first,\ncarried over from the evaluation of machine learning models in general, relies\non pre-defined task instances, for which reference task executions are\navailable. The second, best exemplified by the LM-arena, relies on (often\nself-selected) users bringing their own intents to a site that routes these to\nseveral models in parallel, among whose responses the user then selects their\nmost preferred one. The former paradigm hence excels at control over what is\ntested, while the latter comes with higher ecological validity, testing actual\nuse cases interactively. Recently, a third complementary paradigm has emerged\nthat combines some of the strengths of these approaches, offering control over\nmulti-turn, reference-free, repeatable interactions, while stressing\ngoal-directedness: dialogue game based evaluation. While the utility of this\napproach has been shown by several projects, its adoption has been held back by\nthe lack of a mature, easily re-usable implementation. In this paper, we\npresent clembench, which has been in continuous development since 2023 and has\nin its latest release been optimized for ease of general use. We describe how\nit can be used to benchmark one's own models (using a provided set of benchmark\ngame instances in English), as well as how easily the benchmark itself can be\nextended with new, tailor-made targeted tests.",

The continuity equations describe the statistical\nevolution of the features in the asymptotic regime where the layers of the\nnetwork form a continuum. The velocity field is expressed through the network\nactivation function, which is itself viewed as a function of the statistical\ndistribution of the network parameters (weights and biases). From a\nmathematical standpoint, the control is interpreted in a relaxed sense, taking\nvalues in the space of probability measures over the set of parameters. We\ninvestigate the optimal behavior of the network when the cost functional arises\nfrom a regression problem and includes an additional entropic regularization\nterm on the distribution of the parameters. In this framework, we focus in\nparticular on the existence of stable optimizers --that is, optimizers at which\nthe Hessian of the cost is non-degenerate. We show that, for an open and dense\nset of initial data, understood here as probability distributions over features\nand associated labels, there exists a unique stable global minimizer of the\ncontrol problem. Moreover, we show that such minimizers satisfy a local\nPolyak--Lojasiewicz inequality, which can lead to exponential convergence of\nthe corresponding gradient descent when the initialization lies sufficiently\nclose to the optimal parameters. This result thus demonstrates the genericity\n(with respect to the distribution of features and labels) of the\nPolyak--Lojasiewicz condition in ResNets with a continuum of layers and under\nentropic penalization.",

To some extent, the structure resembles that of a\nfield-effect transistor with multiple controlling electrodes (gates).\nScalability is audible and it opens up a possibility of large-scale quantum\ncomputer fabricated by advanced silicon technology. Moreover, the structure\ncould be developed into an ensemble quantum register where instead of single\nnanowire an array of them with common controlling electrodes and contacts is\nfabricated. This ensemble register is much more resistant against environment\nnoise caused by phonons and stray charges due to averaging and compensation. It\nis crucial that an individual qubit consists of two DQDs. The basic states of\nthat qubit correspond to symmetric state of one DQD and antisymmetric state of\nanother, and vice versa. Then the quantum information can be encoded and\nprocessed without charge transfer between dots. The probability to find an\nelectron in a dot constantly equals 1/2 thus the Coulomb interaction between\nDQDs is also constant. Although the Coulomb interaction is incessant, the\nstrength of its action depends on mutual states of interacting DQDs\n(in-resonance or off-resonance). Therefore, a quantum algorithm could be\neffectuated via manipulation solely with steady and pulse gate potentials that\nreminds an operation of a digital integrated circuit. The final read-out of the\nregister is performed after decoding into charge states of DQDs and a\ntransmission of current through the wire.",

    "abstract": "Polycrystalline materials have a viscoelastic rheology where the strains\nproduced by stresses depend on the timescale of deformation. Energy can be\nstored elastically within grain interiors and dissipated by a variety of\ndifferent mechanisms. One such dissipation mechanism is\ndiffusionally-accommodated/-assisted grain boundary sliding, also known as\ntransient diffusion creep. Here we detail a simple reference model of transient\ndiffusion creep, based on finite element calculations with simple grain shapes:\na regular hexagon in 2D and a tetrakaidecadedron in 3D. The linear viscoelastic\nbehaviour of the finite element models can be well described by a parameterised\nextended Burgers model, which behaves as a Maxwell model at low frequencies and\nas an Andrade model at high frequencies. The parametrisation has a specific\nrelaxation strength, Andrade exponent and Andrade time. The Andrade exponent\ndepends only on the angles at which grains meet at triple junctions, and can be\nrelated to the exponents of stress singularities that occur at triple junctions\nin purely elastic models without diffusion. A comparison with laboratory\nexperiments shows that the simple models here provide a lower bound on the\nobserved attenuation. However, there are also clearly additional dissipative\nprocesses occurring in laboratory experiments that are not described by these\nsimple models.",

    "abstract": "Differences in the values of the Hubble constant obtained from the local\nuniverse and the early universe have resulted in a significant tension. This\ntension signifies that our understanding of cosmology (physical processes\nand/or cosmological data) is incomplete. Some of the suggested solutions\ninclude physics of the early Universe. In this paper we aim to investigate\ncommon features of various early universe solutions to the Hubble constant\ntension. The physics of the early universe affects the size of the sound\nhorizon which is probed with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Within\nthe standard model, the size of the horizon (within limits of current\nmeasurements) is affected by processes that could occur between (approximately)\n1 day after the Big Bang and the last scattering instant. We focus on simple\nextensions incorporating Early Dark Energy (EDE) and show how such a model\naffects the inferred values of the Hubble constant. We compare this model to\nLambdaCDM models using MCMC analysis, likelihoods over the parameter space and\nBayesian evidence. The MCMC analysis shows that EDE leads to a decrease in the\nsize of the sound horizon that is consistent with H0 = 73.56 km/s/Mpc but we\nalso show that MCMC analysis favours increasing redshift and proportion of EDE.\nThe Bayesian evidence favours our EDE model for very narrow, finely-tuned\nparameter space. The LambdaCDM model used for comparison has good evidence\nacross a wide parameter space. We interpret this as an indication that more\nsophisticated models are required. We conclude that if the Hubble tension were\nto be related to the physics of the early universe, EDE could be used as a\nwindow to explore conditions of the early universe and extend our understanding\nof that era.",

In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning\nattacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for\nDMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for\nvisualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify\nand experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across\ntimesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias\nand inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we\nobserve that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept\nregions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism\ncomprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency\npoison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid\nadversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain\nlearning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning\nmethods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all\npoisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published\ndefenses.

While HMC is\nwidely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the\ncomputational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large\nDNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can\nbe parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number\nof samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the\nrequired computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a\nDNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited\ncomputational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last\nlayer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world\nvideo datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution\nclassification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetection. Due to the stochastic nature of the probabilistic evaluations, we\nperformed five grid searches for different random seeds to avoid being reliant\non a single initialization for the hyperparameter configurations. The results\nshow that LL--HMC achieves competitive in-distribution classification and OOD\ndetection performance. Additional sampled last layer parameters do not improve\nthe classification performance, but can improve the OOD detection.

Floating-point errors can lead to severe consequences.\nAlthough floating-point errors widely exist, only a subset of inputs may\ntrigger significant errors in floating-point programs. Therefore, it is crucial\nto determine whether a given input could produce such errors. Researchers tend\nto take the results of high-precision floating-point programs as oracles for\ndetecting floating-point errors, which introduces two main limitations: (1)\ndifficulty of implementation and (2) prolonged execution time. The two recent\ntools, ATOMU and FPCC, can partially address these issues. However, ATOMU\nsuffers from false positives; while FPCC, though eliminating false positives,\noperates at a considerably slower speed.\n  To address these two challenges, we propose a novel approach named\nPI-detector to computing floating-point errors effectively and efficiently. Our\napproach is based on the observation that floating-point errors stem from large\ncondition numbers in atomic operations (such as addition and subtraction),\nwhich then propagate and accumulate. PI-detector injects small perturbations\ninto the operands of individual atomic operations within the program and\ncompares the outcomes of the original program with the perturbed version to\ncompute floating-point errors. We evaluate PI-detector with datasets from ATOMU\nand HSED, as well as a complex linear system-solving program.

TOI-2431 b has a period of 5\nhours and 22 minutes, making it one of the shortest-period exoplanets known to\ndate. TOI-2431 b has a radius of $1.536 \\pm 0.033\\, \\rm{R_\\oplus}$, and a mass\nof $6.2 \\pm 1.2\\, \\rm{M_\\oplus}$, suggesting it has a density compatible with\nan Earth-like composition and, due to its high irradiation, is likely a\n'lava-world' with a $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ = $2063 \\pm 30 \\, {\\rm K}$. We estimate\nthat the current orbital period is only 30% larger than the Roche-limit orbital\nperiod, and that it has an expected orbital decay timescale of only $\\sim$31\nMyr. Finally, due to the brightness of the host star ($V = 10.9$, $K = 7.6$),\nTOI-2431 b has a high Emission Spectroscopy Metric of 27, making it one of the\nbest USP systems for atmospheric phase-curve analysis.",

This paper introduces a novel\napproach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that\nnot only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages\nusers in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings\nhighlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the\npotential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering\na more informed online space.",

This discovery plays a key role in the developing framework of network\nnonlocality, offering a new method for confirming the quantum nature of\nmeasurements within a single network node. Bi-contextuality acts as a reversed\nBell scenario: while Bell scenarios involve splitting a system for independent\nmeasurements, our approach combines systems from separate independent sources\nfor joint measurements. The outcomes defy classical models that assume\nindependence and non-contextuality. The simplest Bell scenario can be seen as a\nsubset of the Peres-Mermin (PM) square, and our phenomenon represents another\nimportant subset of this framework. Moreover, bi-contextuality has notable\nconsequences related to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) theorem, suggesting\nthat classical psi-ontic models must account for contextuality or the\ndependence of preparations, challenging established assumptions.",

Its unified architecture supports\nmulti-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white\nmatter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and\ntransformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning.\nEvaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022,\nF3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical\nheterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice\nSimilarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET\n2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022.

In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose\nfailures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to\nsystematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation\nmodels lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a\ncomprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary\ncategories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present\nAttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing\nmisattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also\npropose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first\ngeneral-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,\nmisattribution, and feedback.

    "abstract": "Many document types use intrinsic, convention-driven structures that serve to\nencode precise and structured information, such as the conventions governing\nengineering drawings. However, state-of-the-art approaches treat document\nrecognition as a mere computer vision problem, neglecting these underlying\ndocument-type-specific structural properties, making them dependent on\nsub-optimal heuristic post-processing and rendering many less frequent or more\ncomplicated document types inaccessible to modern document recognition. We\nsuggest a novel perspective that frames document recognition as a transcription\ntask from a document to a record. This implies a natural grouping of documents\nbased on the intrinsic structure inherent in their transcription, where related\ndocument types can be treated (and learned) similarly. We propose a method to\ndesign structure-specific inductive biases for the underlying machine-learned\nend-to-end document recognition systems, and a respective base transformer\narchitecture that we successfully adapt to different structures. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the so-found inductive biases in extensive experiments\nwith progressively complex record structures from monophonic sheet music, shape\ndrawings, and simplified engineering drawings. By integrating an inductive bias\nfor unrestricted graph structures, we train the first-ever successful\nend-to-end model to transcribe engineering drawings to their inherently\ninterlinked information. Our approach is relevant to inform the design of\ndocument recognition systems for document types that are less well understood\nthan standard OCR, OMR, etc., and serves as a guide to unify the design of\nfuture document foundation models.",

    "abstract": "The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it\nalso presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus.\nExisting methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group\nconnections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke\npsychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus.\nAdditionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local\nconsensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these\nissues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework,\nH-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles,\nconsidering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts.\nAdditionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that\nadaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths\nthrough a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user\ninteractions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0%\nto 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This\napproach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user\ninteraction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.",

It applies to the\neffective photo-isomerization reactions just as it does to the elementary\nvibronic transitions.

Using an effective low-energy Hamiltonian, we derive electronic energy\nbands and calculate optical conductivity via the Kubo formula. Results show\nthat RSOC strength, altermagnet interactions strength, and Neel vector\ndirection notably affect the optical conductivity of altermagnet metals. Energy\nradiation is highly sensitive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling, with a saturation\neffect beyond a particular value, and its peak emission rate is lower than that\nof graphene due to reduced conductivity. Different from usual semi-conductor,\nsemi-metal or Dirac materials, eg. graphene or silicene, altermagnets generate\nangular momentum radiation with specific Rashba spin-orbit coupling and\naltermagnet interaction strength. Angular momentum radiation is minimally\nreactive to Rashba spin-orbit coupling at low altermagnet interactions strength\nvalues but exhibits drastic oscillations between extreme values as altermagnet\ninteractions strength reaches a critical point, showing high sensitivity. These\nfindings suggest that adjusting these parameters can tailor altermagnet\napplications in spintronics and quantum technologies, potentially leading to\ninnovative devices with customized radiation attributes.",

While\ntraditional pipelines like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo\n(MVS) achieve high precision through iterative optimization, they are limited\nby complex workflows, high computational cost, and poor robustness in\nchallenging scenarios like texture-less regions. Recently, deep learning has\ncatalyzed a paradigm shift in 3D reconstruction. A new family of models,\nexemplified by DUSt3R, has pioneered a feed-forward approach. These models\nemploy a unified deep network to jointly infer camera poses and dense geometry\ndirectly from an Unconstrained set of images in a single forward pass. This\nsurvey provides a systematic review of this emerging domain. We begin by\ndissecting the technical framework of these feed-forward models, including\ntheir Transformer-based correspondence modeling, joint pose and geometry\nregression mechanisms, and strategies for scaling from two-view to multi-view\nscenarios. To highlight the disruptive nature of this new paradigm, we contrast\nit with both traditional pipelines and earlier learning-based methods like\nMVSNet. Furthermore, we provide an overview of relevant datasets and evaluation\nmetrics. Finally, we discuss the technology's broad application prospects and\nidentify key future challenges and opportunities, such as model accuracy and\nscalability, and handling dynamic scenes.",

Our study examines two critical quenches, one from\nan ordered and a different one from a disordered initial state, for both of\nwhich we assess the dynamic scaling ansatz, the critical exponent values, and\nthe fluctuation field statistics that occur. Notably, the dynamic scaling\nansatz followed by the system strongly depends on the initial condition: a\ncritical quench from the ordered phase follows Family-Vicsek (FV) scaling,\nwhile a critical quench from the disordered phase shows an initial overgrowth\nregime with intrinsic anomalous roughening, followed by relaxation to\nequilibrium. This behavior is explained in terms of the dynamical instability\nof the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation at the critical temperature, whereby\nthe linearly unstable term is eventually stabilized by nonlinear interactions.\nFor both quenches we have determined the occurrence of probability distribution\nfunctions for the field fluctuations, which are time-independent along the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics when suitably normalized by the time-dependent\nfluctuation amplitude. Additionally, we have developed a related interface\nmodel for a field which scales as the space integral of the TDGL field\n(integral GL model). Numerical simulations of this model reveal either FV or\nfaceted anomalous roughening, depending on the critical quenched performed, as\nwell as an emergent symmetry in the fluctuation statistics for a critical\nquench from the ordered phase.",

This TV-regularized convex program\non the space of measures allows to recover a sparse measure using a noisy\nobservation from an appropriate measurement operator. While previous works have\nuncovered the central role played by this operator and its associated kernel in\norder to get estimation error bounds, the latter requires a technical local\npositive curvature (LPC) assumption to be verified on a case-by-case basis. In\npractice, this yields only few LPC-kernels for which this condition is proved.\nAt the heart of our contribution lies the kernel switch, which uncouples the\nmodel kernel from the LPC assumption: it enables to leverage any known\nLPC-kernel as a pivot kernel to prove error bounds, provided embedding\nconditions are verified between the model and pivot RKHS. We increment the list\nof LPC-kernels, proving that the \"sinc-4\" kernel, used for signal recovery and\nmixture problems, does satisfy the LPC assumption. Furthermore, we also show\nthat the BLASSO localisation error around the true support decreases with the\nnoise level, leading to effective near regions. This improves on known results\nwhere this error is fixed with some parameters depending on the model kernel.\nWe illustrate the interest of our results in the case of translation-invariant\nmixture model estimation, using bandlimiting smoothing and sketching techniques\nto reduce the computational burden of BLASSO.",

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nsignificant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through\ncollaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,\nwe present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision\nconferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant\nagents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance\ndetection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and\nstance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,\nnegative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making.

With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline\nto compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as\npossible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars.\n  Methods.

The original formulation of $(k,\\ell)$-anonymity\nrepresents the adversary's knowledge as a vector of distances to the set of\nattacker nodes. In this article, we argue that such adversary is too strong\nwhen it comes to counteracting active attacks. We, instead, propose a new\nformulation where the adversary's knowledge is the multiset of distances to the\nset of attacker nodes. The goal of this article is to study the\n$(k,\\ell)$-multiset anonymity from a graph theoretical point of view, while\nestablishing its relationship to $(k,\\ell)$-anonymity in one hand, and\nconsidering the $k$-multiset antiresolving sets as its theoretical frame, in a\nsecond one. That is, we prove properties of some graph families in relation to\nwhether they contain a set of attacker nodes that breaks the\n$(k,\\ell)$-multiset anonymity. From a practical point of view, we develop a\nlinear programming formulation of the $k$-multiset antiresolving sets that\nallows us to calculate the resistance of social graphs against active attacks.\nThis is useful for analysts who wish to know the level of privacy offered by a\ngraph.",

    "abstract": "Beam alignment (BA) is a crucial process in millimeter-wave (mmWave)\ncommunications, enabling precise directional transmission and efficient link\nestablishment. However, due to characteristics like omnidirectional exposure\nand the broadcast nature of the BA phase, it is particularly vulnerable to\neavesdropping and identity impersonation attacks. To this end, this paper\nproposes a novel secure framework named CovertAuth, designed to enhance the\nsecurity of the BA phase against such attacks. In particular, to combat\neavesdropping attacks, the closed-form expressions of successful BA probability\nand covert transmission rate are first derived. Then, a covert communication\nproblem aimed at jointly optimizing beam training budget and transmission power\nis formulated to maximize covert communication rate, subject to the covertness\nrequirement. An alternating optimization algorithm combined with successive\nconvex approximation is employed to iteratively achieve optimal results. To\ncombat impersonation attacks, the mutual coupling effect of antenna array\nimpairments is explored as a device feature to design a weighted-sum energy\ndetector based physical layer authentication scheme. Moreover, theoretical\nmodels for authentication metrics like detection and false alarm probabilities\nare also provided to conduct performance analysis. Based on these models, an\noptimization problem is constructed to determine the optimal weight value that\nmaximizes authentication accuracy. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that\nCovertAuth presents improved detection accuracy under the same covertness\nrequirement compared to existing works.",

We formulate a joint\noptimization problem that aims to minimize the peak AoI while determining\noptimal UAV trajectories and laser charging strategies.

This study established a computational\nframework by combining large eddy simulation (LES) with a generative machine\nlearning approach which integrates modal decomposition and neural network,\nenabling fast prediction of hydrogen-methane combustion. A canonical\njet-in-hot-coflow burner was selected as the benchmark configuration. LES was\nperformed using eddy dissipation concept model in conjunction with a 17-species\nand 58-step skeletal mechanism. Reasonable agreement between LES results and\nexperimental data was obtained for temperature and species mass fraction,\nconfirming the accuracy of the present LES results. Flow characteristics and\nflame structures were analyzed, providing a reference for choosing parameters\nin prediction. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was used to extract\ndominant flow features, and a hybrid autoregressive model, which combines modal\ndecomposition with a deep learning (POD-DL) was constructed to forecast the\ntemporal evolution of the combustion field. Comparison between the predicted\nresults and LES data, including instantaneous contours, radial distributions,\nhistogram and relative root mean square error, demonstrated a reasonable\nagreement. The main complexity lies in capturing the chaotic and fine-scale\nstructures inherent to turbulent combustion.

This\nprocess is enhanced through a voice activity detection and speech separation\npipeline, which allows for more precise targeting of speech.\n  In order to demonstrate the effectivness of the proposed approach, we\nconsider a three-part evaluation protocol that assesses: 1) speech\nintelligibility using Word Error Rate (WER), 2) sound sources detectability\nusing Sound source Classification Accuracy-Drop (SCAD) from a widely used\npre-trained model, and 3) audio quality using the Fr\\'echet Audio Distance\n(FAD), computed with our reference dataset that contains unaltered speech.\nExperiments on this simulated evaluation dataset, which consists of linear\nmixtures of speech and environmental sound scenes, show that our method\nachieves satisfactory speech intelligibility reduction (97.9% WER), minimal\ndegradation of the sound sources detectability (2.7% SCAD), and high perceptual\nquality (FAD of 1.40).

This study presents a modular, low-cost\nInternet of Things (IoT) system designed for real-time environmental and\nbehavioural monitoring in heritage sites. Built with off-the-shelf components\nsuch as ESP32 microcontrollers and Raspberry Pi, the system integrates a\nwireless sensor network, edge computing, and cloud services (Microsoft Azure)\nto measure variables including temperature, humidity, sound, and visitor\nproximity. It also incorporates computer vision models to classify visitor\nbehaviour, achieving up to 95% accuracy using fine-tuned Vision Transformers.\nThe system's modularity, enabled via JSON configurations, allows for rapid\nreconfiguration without firmware changes. A simulated deployment demonstrated\nrobust performance, low power consumption, and cost-efficiency (less than 200\nGBP per node), validating the system's potential for scalable, sustainable\nheritage monitoring. This open-source framework offers a practical path forward\nfor institutions seeking to balance accessibility with conservation needs.",

The observation that many black holes have reached\nsupermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion\nmodels are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the\nphysics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically\nthick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides\nthe radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of\nthe inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section\ndrops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite\nbeing Eddington-limited. Indeed, after implementing a modified cross-section\ncalculated via the Klein-Nishina Formula, we find that SMBH formation time\ndrops by up to $47\\%$. In this context, we show how a $10^{9} M_{\\odot}$ black\nhole can form from a seed $10 M_{\\odot}$ black hole within $500$ Myr by way of\naccretion and mergers. While our picture is over-simplified and contrived in a\nnumber of ways that we discuss, we suggest that our scenario is interesting in\nthat it offers a solution to two issues at the intersection of astrophysics and\ncosmology, namely the reason the Eddington limit is obeyed and how some black\nholes have grown rapidly despite that limit.",

Recent point-wise techniques (e.g., CSQ,\nMDS) have improved retrieval performance by pre-assigning a hash center to each\nclass, enhancing the discriminability of hash codes across various datasets.\nHowever, these methods rely on data-independent algorithms to generate hash\ncenters, which neglect the semantic relationships between classes and may\ndegrade retrieval performance.\n  This paper introduces the concept of semantic hash centers, building on the\nidea of traditional hash centers. We hypothesize that hash centers of\nsemantically related classes should have closer Hamming distances, while those\nof unrelated classes should be more distant. To this end, we propose a\nthree-stage framework, SHC, to generate hash codes that preserve semantic\nstructure.\n  First, we develop a classification network to identify semantic similarities\nbetween classes using a data-dependent similarity calculation that adapts to\nvarying data distributions. Second, we introduce an optimization algorithm to\ngenerate semantic hash centers, preserving semantic relatedness while enforcing\na minimum distance between centers to avoid excessively similar hash codes.\nFinally, a deep hashing network is trained using these semantic centers to\nconvert images into binary hash codes.\n  Experimental results on large-scale retrieval tasks across several public\ndatasets show that SHC significantly improves retrieval performance.\nSpecifically, SHC achieves average improvements of +7.26%, +7.62%, and +11.71%\nin MAP@100, MAP@1000, and MAP@ALL metrics, respectively, over state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

A key challenge in\nlong-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the\ncomposition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across\nrecording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit\nalignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require\ntest-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across\nsessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In\nthis work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural\nTransformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on\nunordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel\ncontext-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers\nunit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording\nsessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows\nfew-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from\nthe test session. To further promote model robustness to population\nvariability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for\niBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training. We\nevaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark,\ncovering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates. SPINT\ndemonstrates robust cross-session generalization, outperforming existing\nzero-shot and few-shot unsupervised baselines while eliminating the need for\ntest-time alignment and fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Models for spin systems, known from statistical physics, are applied\nanalogously in econometrics in the form of agent-based models. The models\ndiscussed in the econophysics literature all use the state variable $T$, which,\nin physics, represents the temperature of a system. However, there is little\nevidence on how temperature can be measured in econophysics, so that the models\ncan be applied. Only in idealized capital market applications has the\nrelationship between temperature and volatility been demonstrated, allowing\ntemperature to be determined through volatility measurements. The question\nremains how this can be achieved in agent systems beyond capital market\napplications. This paper focuses precisely on this question. It examines an\nagent system with two decision options in a news environment, establishes the\nmeasurement equation, and outlines the basic concept of temperature\nmeasurement. The procedure is illustrated using an example. In an application\nwith competing subsystems, an interesting strategy for influencing the average\nopinion in the competing subsystem is presented.",

    "abstract": "The centerline of a bobsleigh track defines its geometry and is essential for\nsimulation modeling. To reduce bBobsleigh training costs, leveraging the\ncenterline of the bobsleigh track to construct a virtual environment that\nclosely replicates real competitive settings presents a promising solution.\nHowever, publicly available centerline data are typically limited and it is\nimprecise to construct a training system solely based on 2-dimensional (2D)\ncenterline. To address this practical issue, this paper proposes a method for\ngenerating a 3-dimensional (3D) track centerline based on 2D centerline data.\nIncorporating international track design regulations, the method formulates an\noptimization problem that considers total track length, height difference,\nslope constraints, and geometric continuity. A Projected Gradient Descent (PGD)\nalgorithm is used to solve the optimization problem. The generated 3D\ncenterlines are compared with real track data, and the results show that the\nmethod can reproduce realistic centerline trends from original or scaled 2D\ndata. For the selected track segment, the relative errors in total length,\nheight difference, and average slope are within 1.7%, 3.2% and 4.1%,\nrespectively, for real 2D data and within 1.1%, 3.5% and 4.3% respectively for\nscaled data. All slope values remain within the allowable limits. Moreover, by\nadjusting the segmentation or modifying the weight of height difference in the\ncost function, various centerline styles applicable to different competitions\ncan be generated. Under different segmentation and weight factors, the maximum\nerrors reach up to 4.4%, 4.8%, and 9.8%, and 4.4%, 4.8%, and 10.0%,\nrespectively. The proposed method provides a flexible and efficient tool for\nsupporting bobsleigh track centerline design.",

Simple, unknotted active rings display\na transition from an extended phase to a collapsed one upon increasing the\ndegree of polymerization. We find that topology has a significant effect on the\npolymer size at which the collapse takes place, with twist knots collapsing\nearlier than torus knots. Increasing knot complexity further accentuates this\ndifference, as the collapse point of torus knots grows linearly with the\nminimum crossing number of the knot while that of twist knots shrinks,\neventually canceling the actively stretched regime altogether. This behavior is\na consequence of the ordered configuration of torus knots in their stretched\nactive state, featuring an effective alignment for non-neighboring bonds which\nincreases with the minimal crossing number. Twist knots do not feature ordered\nconfigurations or bond alignment, increasing the likelihood of collisions,\nleading to collapse. These results show that topology yields a degree of\ncontrol on the properties of active ring polymers, and can be used to tune\nthem. At the same time, they suggest that activity might introduce a bias for\ntorus knots, as complex twist knots cannot be formed in extended active\npolymers.",

In this work, we study sampling-based approaches for achieving\nhigh-quality text generation from discrete diffusion models in reward-guided\nsettings. We introduce a novel inference-time scaling approach based on\nparticle Gibbs sampling for discrete diffusion models. The particle Gibbs\nsampling algorithm iteratively refines full diffusion trajectories using\nconditional Sequential Monte Carlo as its transition mechanism. This process\nensures that the updated samples progressively improve and move closer to the\nreward-weighted target distribution. Unlike existing inference-time scaling\nmethods, which are often limited to single diffusion trajectories, our approach\nleverages iterative refinement across multiple trajectories. Within this\nframework, we further analyze the trade-offs between four key axes for\ninference-time scaling under fixed compute budgets: particle Gibbs iterations,\nparticle count, denoising steps, and reward estimation cost. Empirically, our\nmethod consistently outperforms prior inference-time strategies on\nreward-guided text generation tasks, achieving significant improvement in\naccuracy under varying compute budgets.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents a promising frontier at the\nintersection of quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to\nleverage quantum computational advantages to enhance data-driven tasks. This\nreview explores the potential of QML to address the computational bottlenecks\nof classical machine learning, particularly in processing complex datasets. We\nintroduce the theoretical foundations of QML, including quantum data encoding,\nquantum learning theory and optimization techniques, while categorizing QML\napproaches based on data type and computational architecture. It is\nwell-established that quantum computational advantages are problem-dependent,\nand so potentially useful directions for QML need to be systematically\nidentified. Key developments, such as Quantum Principal Component Analysis,\nquantum-enhanced sensing and applications in material science, are critically\nevaluated for their theoretical speed-ups and practical limitations. The\nchallenges posed by Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, including\nhardware noise, scalability constraints and data encoding overheads, are\ndiscussed in detail. We also outline future directions, emphasizing the need\nfor quantum-native algorithms, improved error correction, and realistic\nbenchmarks to bridge the gap between theoretical promise and practical\ndeployment. This comprehensive analysis underscores that while QML has\nsignificant potential for specific applications such as quantum chemistry and\nsensing, its broader utility in real-world scenarios remains contingent on\novercoming technological and methodological hurdles.",

What data should\npractitioners finetune on to mitigate hallucinations in language models? In\nthis work, we study the relationship between the factuality of finetuning data\nand the prevalence of hallucinations in long-form generation tasks.\nCounterintuitively, we find that finetuning on factual gold data is not as\nhelpful as finetuning on model-generated data that models believe to be\nfactual. Next, we evaluate filtering strategies applied on both factual gold\ndata and model-generated data, and find that finetuning on model-generated data\nthat is filtered by models' own internal judgments often leads to better\noverall factuality compared to other configurations: training on gold data\nfiltered by models' judgments, training on gold data alone, or training on\nmodel-generated data that is supported by gold data.

Namely, we allow the algorithm to use information about the\ncurrent \\OneMax value, and we find that it allows much better parameter\nchoices, especially in marginal states. Although those states are rarely\nvisited by the algorithm, such policies yield a notable speed-up in terms of\nexpected runtime.

Although multi-sensor fusion approaches\nintegrating diverse sensors have shown promising performance improvements, the\nresearch community faces two key barriers: On one hand, the lack of\nstandardized and configurable benchmarks that systematically evaluate SLAM\nalgorithms under diverse degradation scenarios hinders comprehensive\nperformance assessment. While on the other hand, existing SLAM frameworks\nprimarily focus on fusing a limited set of sensor types, without effectively\naddressing adaptive sensor selection strategies for varying environmental\nconditions.\n  To bridge these gaps, we make three key contributions: First, we introduce\nM3DGR dataset: a sensor-rich benchmark with systematically induced degradation\npatterns including visual challenge, LiDAR degeneracy, wheel slippage and GNSS\ndenial. Second, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of forty SLAM systems on\nM3DGR, providing critical insights into their robustness and limitations under\nchallenging real-world conditions. Third, we develop a resilient modular\nmulti-sensor fusion framework named Ground-Fusion++, which demonstrates robust\nperformance by coupling GNSS, RGB-D, LiDAR, IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and\nwheel odometry.

    "abstract": "The stability of communities - whether biological, social, economic,\ntechnological or ecological depends on the balance between cooperation and\ncheating. While cooperation strengthens communities, selfish individuals, or\n\"cheaters,\" exploit collective benefits without contributing. If cheaters\nbecome too prevalent, they can trigger the collapse of cooperation and of the\ncommunity, often in an abrupt manner. A key challenge is determining whether\nthe risk of such a collapse can be detected in advance. To address this, we use\na combination of evolutionary graph theory and machine learning to examine how\none can predict the unravel of cooperation on complex networks. By introducing\nfew cheaters into a structured population, we employ machine learning to detect\nand anticipate the spreading of cheaters and cooperation collapse. Using\ntemporal and structural data, the presented results show that prediction\naccuracy improves with stronger selection strength and larger observation\nwindows, with CNN-Seq-LSTM and Seq-LSTM best performing models. Moreover, the\naccuracy for the predictions depends crucially on the type of game played\nbetween cooperators and cheaters (i.e., accuracy improves when it is more\nadvantageous to defect) and on the community structure. Overall, this work\nintroduces a machine learning approach into detecting abrupt shifts in\nevolutionary graph theory and offer potential strategies for anticipating and\npreventing cooperation collapse in complex social networks.",

    "abstract": "Accessibility, defined as travel impedance between spatially dispersed\nopportunities for activity, is one of the main determinants of public transport\n(PT) use. In-depth understanding of its properties is crucial for optimal\npublic transport systems planning and design. Although the concept has been\naround for decades and there is a large body of literature on accessibility\noperationalisation and measurement, a unified approach is lacking. To this end,\nwe introduce a novel graph representation of public transport networks, termed\nthe access graph, based on the shortest paths between nodes. Shortest paths are\ncalculated using the in-vehicle time-weighted L- and frequency-weighted P-space\nrepresentations to determine generalised travel times. Then there is an edge\nbetween two nodes in the access graph if the travel time between them is below\na certain threshold time budget. In this representation, node degree directly\nmeasures the number of nodes reachable within a predetermined time. We study\nthe threshold-dependent evolution of the access graph, focusing on average\ndegree and degree distributions. Based on the topological properties of the\naccess graph, we define a set of accessibility indicators. In addition, we\npropose indicators of access equity. We apply the methodology to a dataset of\n51 metro networks worldwide. In all cases, a logistic-like growth of average\ndegree with time budget is observed, indicating universal behaviour of\naccessibility and exhibiting the value of the proposed representation for\nunified accessibility studies and its potential for comparative analyses. We\nsee a great potential for the access graph to drive in-depth studies of\naccessibility.",

Nevertheless,\nits performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image\nand in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of\nannotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context\npairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible\ndue to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address\nthis challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework\nthat enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling\nself-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual\nalignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model\ninitially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the\nroles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to\nvalidate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context\nimage. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure\nof the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to\nalter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the\nalignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven\nmedical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models,\ndemonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight\nCCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution\nfor universal medical image segmentation.

This opens the doorway of systematically designing lattice\nHamiltonians with unique properties by choosing correspondingly varying phases\nacross the lattice.

A tunable fraction\nof localized vs. delocalized eigenstates belonging to the three subdomains of\nthe corresponding energy bands is demonstrated and analyzed with different\nmeasures of localization. In the asymmetric case the center of localization can\nbe shifted arbitrarily by shifting the underlying phase grid. Introducing a\ncomplete phase revolution leads for low and high energies to two well-separated\nbranches of localized states which finally merge with increasing energy into\nthe branch of delocalized states.

Our results show that enlarging the agent cohort, deepening the\ninteraction depth, and broadening agent persona heterogeneity each enrich the\ndiversity of generated ideas. Moreover, specifically increasing critic-side\ndiversity within the ideation-critique-revision loop further boosts the\nfeasibility of the final proposals.

    "abstract": "Accurate extrinsic calibration between multiple LiDAR sensors and a\nGNSS-aided inertial navigation system (GINS) is essential for achieving\nreliable sensor fusion in intelligent mining environments. Such calibration\nenables vehicle-road collaboration by aligning perception data from\nvehicle-mounted sensors to a unified global reference frame. However, existing\nmethods often depend on artificial targets, overlapping fields of view, or\nprecise trajectory estimation, which are assumptions that may not hold in\npractice. Moreover, the planar motion of mining vehicles leads to observability\nissues that degrade calibration performance. This paper presents a targetless\nextrinsic calibration method that aligns multiple onboard LiDAR sensors to the\nGINS coordinate system without requiring overlapping sensor views or external\ntargets. The proposed approach introduces an observation model based on the\nknown installation height of the GINS unit to constrain unobservable\ncalibration parameters under planar motion. A joint optimization framework is\ndeveloped to refine both the extrinsic parameters and GINS trajectory by\nintegrating multiple constraints derived from geometric correspondences and\nmotion consistency. The proposed method is applicable to heterogeneous LiDAR\nconfigurations, including both mechanical and solid-state sensors. Extensive\nexperiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the accuracy,\nrobustness, and practical applicability of the approach under diverse sensor\nsetups.",

The model is equivalent to content-oblivious computation,\nwhere nodes communicate solely via pulses. They showed that if the network is\n2-edge-connected, then any algorithm for a noiseless setting can be simulated\nin the fully-defective setting; otherwise, no non-trivial computation is\npossible in the fully-defective setting. However, their simulation requires a\npredesignated leader, which they conjectured to be necessary for any\nnon-trivial content-oblivious task.\n  In this work, we present two results:\n  General 2-edge-connected topologies: First, we show an asynchronous\ncontent-oblivious leader election algorithm that quiescently terminates in any\n2-edge-connected network with message complexity $O(m \\cdot N \\cdot\n\\mathsf{ID}_{\\min})$, where $m$ is the number of edges, $N$ is a known upper\nbound on the number of nodes, and $\\mathsf{ID}_{\\min}$ is the smallest\n$\\mathsf{ID}$. Combined with the above simulation, this result shows that\nwhenever a size bound $N$ is known, any noiseless algorithm can be simulated in\nthe fully-defective model without a preselected leader, fully refuting the\nconjecture.\n  Unoriented rings: We then show that the knowledge of $N$ can be dropped in\nunoriented ring topologies by presenting a quiescently terminating election\nalgorithm with message complexity $O(n \\cdot \\mathsf{ID}_{\\max})$ that matches\nthe previous bound. Consequently, this result constitutes a strict improvement\nover the previous leader election in oriented rings by Frei, Gelles, Ghazy, and\nNolin (DISC 2024) and shows that, on rings, fully-defective and noiseless\ncommunication are computationally equivalent, with no additional assumptions.",

Existing hiding schemes\nare easily detected by the naked eyes or steganalyzers due to the cover type\nconfined to the spatial domain, single-range feature extraction and attacks,\nand insufficient loss constraints. To address these issues, we propose a\nmulti-range representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework\ncalled MRAG for JPEG image hiding. This design stems from the fact that\nsteganalyzers typically combine local-range and global-range information to\nbetter capture hidden traces. Specifically, MRAG integrates the local-range\ncharacteristic of the convolution and the global-range modeling of the\ntransformer. Meanwhile, a features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed\nto launch multi-range representations-driven feature-level adversarial attacks.\nIt computes the adversarial loss between covers and stegos based on the\nsurrogate steganalyzer's classified features, i.e., the features before the\nlast fully connected layer. Under the dual constraints of features angle and\nnorm, MRAG can delicately encode the concatenation of cover and secret into\nsubtle adversarial perturbations from local and global ranges relevant to\nsteganalysis. Therefore, the resulting stego can achieve visual and\nsteganalysis imperceptibility. Moreover, coarse-grained and fine-grained\nfrequency decomposition operations are devised to transform the input,\nintroducing multi-grained information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMRAG can achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

Our findings highlight the sensitivity of\nevaluation metrics to the language type. For example, in fusional languages,\nn-gram-based metrics show lower correlation with human assessments compared to\nisolating and agglutinative languages. We also demonstrate that proper\ntokenization can significantly mitigate this issue for morphologically rich\nfusional languages, sometimes even reversing negative trends.

To address\nthis, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for\nMultimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer\ntype can generalize to unseen cancers.

Two\nstrategies are widely used: contrastive learning (optimizing directly on\nground-truth labels) and knowledge distillation (transferring knowledge from a\nlarger reranker). While both have been studied extensively, a clear comparison\nof their effectiveness for training cross-encoder rerankers under practical\nconditions is needed.\n  This paper empirically compares these strategies by training rerankers of\ndifferent sizes and architectures using both methods on the same data, with a\nstrong contrastive learning model acting as the distillation teacher. Our\nresults show that knowledge distillation generally yields better in-domain and\nout-of-domain ranking performance than contrastive learning when distilling\nfrom a larger teacher model. This finding is consistent across student model\nsizes and architectures. However, distilling from a teacher of the same\ncapacity does not provide the same advantage, particularly for out-of-domain\ntasks. These findings offer practical guidance for choosing a training strategy\nbased on available teacher models. We recommend using knowledge distillation to\ntrain smaller rerankers if a larger, more powerful teacher is accessible; in\nits absence, contrastive learning remains a robust baseline.",

However, they are prone to catastrophic failure because of\ninsufficient load transfer across the interfaces between the brittle eutectic\nphase and the ductile matrix. Here we present a general solution to this\nproblem by engineering these interfaces at the atomic scale, equipping them\nwith excellent load transfer capabilities, thus qualifying such composites for\nlightweight structural applications. We demonstrate the approach by adding Zr\nto an Al-Gd-based hypoeutectic alloy, promoting the formation of a coherent\nInterfacial-Ordered-Phase (IOP) around the brittle Al3Gd eutectic phase and\nnanosized core-shell ordered precipitates in the primary Al matrix. This\nenables a 400% increase in tensile plasticity while retaining a high tensile\nstrength of 295 MPa at room temperature and 130 MPa at 250C. This exceptional\nincrease in formability is attributed to the ability of the IOP layer to\nprevent dislocations from accumulating at the weak fibre/matrix interfaces,\navoiding stress concentrations that would otherwise initiate fibre breakage and\ndebonding. The core-shell precipitates in Al cause a large number of\ndislocation cross/multiple-slips on different {111} planes, forming ultra-fine\n(10 nm) dislocation networks that leverage substantial plastic strain\naccumulation.

We present the NeurOptimiser, a fully spike-based\noptimisation framework that materialises the neuromorphic-based metaheuristic\nparadigm through a decentralised NC system. The proposed approach comprises a\npopulation of Neuromorphic Heuristic Units (NHUs), each combining spiking\nneuron dynamics with spike-triggered perturbation heuristics to evolve\ncandidate solutions asynchronously. The NeurOptimiser's coordination arises\nthrough native spiking mechanisms that support activity propagation, local\ninformation sharing, and global state updates without external orchestration.\nWe implement this framework on Intel's Lava platform, targeting the Loihi 2\nchip, and evaluate it on the noiseless BBOB suite up to 40 dimensions. We\ndeploy several NeurOptimisers using different configurations, mainly\nconsidering dynamic systems such as linear and Izhikevich models for spiking\nneural dynamics, and fixed and Differential Evolution mutation rules for\nspike-triggered heuristics. Although these configurations are implemented as a\nproof of concept, we document and outline further extensions and improvements\nto the framework implementation. Results show that the proposed approach\nexhibits structured population dynamics, consistent convergence, and\nmilliwatt-level power feasibility. They also position spike-native MHs as a\nviable path toward real-time, low-energy, and decentralised optimisation.",

While recent\nLLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection\naccuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''),\nthey struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM\nsystems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource\nlanguages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a\nmultilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse\nlanguages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing\nguardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in\nLLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model\ninto a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct\nSEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over\n260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases.\nWe evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on\nthis benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak\nprompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art\nLlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and\n18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In\ncontrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual\nunsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and\nachieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further\nreveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the\noverall performance of SEALGuard.

Traditional neural\nnetworks and deep learning models frequently encounter challenges with diverse,\nhigh-dimensional workloads, especially during sudden resource demand changes,\nleading to inefficiencies. This issue arises from their limited optimization\nduring training, relying only on parametric (inter-connection weights)\nadjustments using conventional algorithms. To address this issue, this work\nproposes a novel Comprehensively Adaptive Architectural Optimization-based\nVariable Quantum Neural Network (CA-QNN), which combines the efficiency of\nquantum computing with complete structural and qubit vector parametric\nlearning. The model converts workload data into qubits, processed through qubit\nneurons with Controlled NOT-gated activation functions for intuitive pattern\nrecognition. In addition, a comprehensive architecture optimization algorithm\nfor networks is introduced to facilitate the learning and propagation of the\nstructure and parametric values in variable-sized QNNs. This algorithm\nincorporates quantum adaptive modulation and size-adaptive recombination during\ntraining process. The performance of CA-QNN model is thoroughly investigated\nagainst seven state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets of\nheterogeneous cloud workloads.

Based on\nsummarizing the existing construction results of all $2$-to-$1$ mappings over\nfinite fields with even characteristic, this article first applies the\ngeneralized switching method to the study of $2$-to-$1$ mappings, that is, to\nconstruct $2$-to-$1$ mappings over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^l}$ with\n$F(x)=G(x)+{\\rm Tr}_{q^l/q}(R(x))$, where $G$ is a monomial and $R$ is a\nmonomial or binomial. Using the properties of Dickson polynomial theory and the\ncomplete characterization of low-degree equations, we construct a total of $16$\nnew classes of $2$-to-$1$ mappings, which are not QM-equivalent to any existing\n$2$-to-$1$ polynomials. Among these, $9$ classes are of the form $cx + {\\rm\nTr}_{q^l/q}(x^d)$, and $7$ classes have the form $cx + {\\rm Tr}_{q^l/q}(x^{d_1}\n+ x^{d_2})$. These new infinite classes explain most of numerical results by\nMAGMA under the conditions that $q=2^k$, $k>1$, $kl<14$ and $c \\in\n\\gf_{q^l}^*$. Finally, we construct some binary linear codes using the newly\nproposed $2$-to-$1$ mappings of the form $cx + {\\rm Tr}_{q^l/q}(x^d)$. The\nweight distributions of these codes are also determined.

    "abstract": "Audio-driven talking head generation holds significant potential for film\nproduction. While existing 3D methods have advanced motion modeling and content\nsynthesis, they often produce rendering artifacts, such as motion blur,\ntemporal jitter, and local penetration, due to limitations in representing\nstable, fine-grained motion fields. Through systematic analysis, we reformulate\ntalking head generation into a unified framework comprising three steps: video\npreprocessing, motion representation, and rendering reconstruction. This\nframework underpins our proposed M2DAO-Talker, which addresses current\nlimitations via multi-granular motion decoupling and alternating optimization.\nSpecifically, we devise a novel 2D portrait preprocessing pipeline to extract\nframe-wise deformation control conditions (motion region segmentation masks,\nand camera parameters) to facilitate motion representation. To ameliorate\nmotion modeling, we elaborate a multi-granular motion decoupling strategy,\nwhich independently models non-rigid (oral and facial) and rigid (head) motions\nfor improved reconstruction accuracy. Meanwhile, a motion consistency\nconstraint is developed to ensure head-torso kinematic consistency, thereby\nmitigating penetration artifacts caused by motion aliasing. In addition, an\nalternating optimization strategy is designed to iteratively refine facial and\noral motion parameters, enabling more realistic video generation. Experiments\nacross multiple datasets show that M2DAO-Talker achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, with the 2.43 dB PSNR improvement in generation quality and 0.64\ngain in user-evaluated video realness versus TalkingGaussian while with 150 FPS\ninference speed.

    "abstract": "The X-ray transient source EP240309a/EP\\,J115415.8$-$501810 was first\ndetected by the Wide-Field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board Einstein Probe (EP)\nduring the commissioning phase. Subsequent optical observations confirmed it as\na Cataclysmic Variable of the intermediate polar type with a 238.2\\,s spinning\nwhite dwarf in a $\\sim$3.76\\,hr orbit. We report on the source discovery and\nfollow-up studies made with the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) of EP. A\nperiodic variation of 231\\,s is detected in the 0.3$-$2\\,keV band, while no\nobvious pulsation appears in the 2$-$10\\,keV band. The spectral analysis shows\nthat the X-ray emission could be described by an absorbed bremsstrahlung model\nwith $kT$\\textgreater\\,11\\,keV. The partial covering absorption, with an\nhydrogen column density $N_H$ = 2.0$\\times 10^{22}\\,\\rm cm^{-2}$ and covering\nfraction around 0.9, is much larger than the interstellar absorption along the\nline of sight. According to the distance $d = 309.5$\\,pc obtained from Gaia\nparallax, we estimate that the luminosity of this source in the 0.3$-$10\\,keV\nrange is $\\sim 2\\times10^{32}$\\,erg\\,s$^{-1}$. In addition, phase-resolved\nspectral analysis reveals that the detected periodic variation is mainly caused\nby the change in the absorption column density. In this scenario the spin\nmodulation arises due to absorption from the pre-shock accretion flow of the\nX-ray emitting pole, while the optical radiation is modulated at the orbital\nside band ($\\omega_{\\rm spin} - \\Omega_{\\rm orbit}$) due to reprocessing in\nregions within the binary system. Due to its unusual transient behaviour for an\nintermediate polar, we have also searched for radio signals similar to those\nobserved in the new class of long period transients. We derived upper limits\nwith ASKAP (200--300\\,$\\mu$Jy\\,beam$^{-1}$ between 800--1500 MHz) and MWA\n(40--90\\,mJy\\,beam$^{-1}$ between 80--300 MHz).",

To achieve this, a disruptive network architecture is essential, and\nhigh altitude platform stations (HAPS) offer a promising solution. By\nintegrating HAPS with terrestrial networks, we can create HAPS-empowered\nvertical heterogeneous networks (vHetNets), which significantly improve\ncoverage and capacity, as well as support emerging use cases. In HAPS-empowered\nvHetNets, different tiers can share the same spectrum, forming harmonized\nspectrum vHetNets that enhance spectral efficiency (SE). However, we face two\nmajor challenges: i) co-channel interference in harmonized spectrum vHetNets,\nand ii) the large-scale nature of the network. To address the first challenge,\nwe adopt a cell-free approach as the underlying network architecture for the\nHAPS-empowered vHetNet. In this approach, base stations use beamforming to\ndirect high-gain, narrow beams toward users, which helps mitigate interference.\nHowever, this creates a nonconvex and high-dimensional optimization problem,\nwhich highlights the second challenge of dealing with a large-scale network.\nConsequently, centralized solutions become impractical due to the computational\nand communication overhead involved. The standard two-block alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) is one option, but nonconvex constraints\ncan hinder its convergence. As an alternative, we have developed a two-level\ndistributed proportional fairness beamforming weight design (PFBWD) algorithm.\nThis algorithm uses a combination of the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) and\na three-block ADMM framework.

Specifically, we first derive the\nauto-ambiguity function (AAF) of an AFDM chirp subcarrier, revealing its\n\"spike-like\" local property and \"periodic-like\" global property along the\nrotated delay and Doppler dimensions. This structure naturally forms a\nparallelogram for each localized pulse of the AAF of the AFDM chirp subcarrier,\nenabling unambiguous target sensing. Then, we study the cross-ambiguity\nfunction (CAF) between two different AFDM chirp subcarriers, which exhibits the\nsame local and global properties as the AAF but with an additional shift along\nthe Doppler dimension. We then extend our analysis to the AF of various typical\nAFDM frames, considering both deterministic pilot and random data symbols. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that inserting guard symbols in AFDM facilitates\ninterference-free sensing.

By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin\nequations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0<\\alpha<\\beta\\leq 1$, we uncover rich\ntransient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory\nkernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a\nsubdiffusive particle ($\\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains\nits intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory\nexponents differ ($\\alpha<\\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\\alpha=\\beta$)\nsuppress recovery.

    "abstract": "In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly\nbenefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However,\nthe improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering\ncharacteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target\ndetection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution,\nthe inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to\nblind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately\ndegrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this\npaper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that\nincorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection\nmodel, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To\nbe specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature\nAdaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA\nmodule is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and\nachieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the\ninterpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module\nis proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure\nadjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source\ndomain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the\ndetection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from\ndifferent-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances\ncross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving\ndiscriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in\ncross-resolution SAR target detection.",

The framework\nasymmetrically treats temporal and spatial information regarding them as\nendogenous variables in the outcome regression, and exogenous variables in the\npropensity score model, thereby expanding the standard doubly robust treatment\neffect estimation to jointly enhance bias correction and predictive accuracy.\nTo demonstrate its utility, we focus on clinical domains such as cancer,\ndementia, and Parkinson disease, where treatment effects are challenging to\nobserve directly. Simulation studies are conducted to emulate latent disease\ndynamics and evaluate the model performance under varying conditions. Overall,\nthe proposed framework advances predictive causal inference by structurally\nadapting to spatiotemporal complexities common in biomedical data.",

    "abstract": "The presence of missing values often reflects variations in data collection\npolicies, which may shift across time or locations, even when the underlying\nfeature distribution remains stable. Such shifts in the missingness\ndistribution between training and test inputs pose a significant challenge to\nachieving robust predictive performance. In this study, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework designed to address this challenge, particularly in the\ncommon yet challenging scenario where the test-time dataset is unseen. We begin\nby introducing a set of mutual information-based conditions, called MI\nrobustness conditions, which guide the prediction model to extract\nlabel-relevant information. This promotes robustness against distributional\nshifts in missingness at test-time. To enforce these conditions, we design\nsimple yet effective loss terms that collectively define our final objective,\ncalled MIRRAMS. Importantly, our method does not rely on any specific\nmissingness assumption such as MCAR, MAR, or MNAR, making it applicable to a\nbroad range of scenarios. Furthermore, it can naturally extend to cases where\nlabels are also missing in training data, by generalizing the framework to a\nsemi-supervised learning setting. Extensive experiments across multiple\nbenchmark tabular datasets demonstrate that MIRRAMS consistently outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art baselines and maintains stable performance under\ndiverse missingness conditions. Moreover, it achieves superior performance even\nin fully observed settings, highlighting MIRRAMS as a powerful, off-the-shelf\nframework for general-purpose tabular learning.",

However, a fundamental and\nexperimentally consequential aspect remains unaddressed: fermions propagating\nin curved space inherently couple to the underlying geometry via the spin\nconnection, as required by general covariance - a feature not yet incorporated\nin studies of hyperbolic crystals. Here, we introduce a symmetry-based\nframework for Dirac fermions on two-dimensional hyperbolic lattices, explicitly\nincorporating spin-curvature coupling via a discrete spin connection. Starting\nfrom the continuous symmetries of the Poincar\\'e disk, we classify the\nirreducible representations and construct a symmetry-adapted basis,\nestablishing a direct correspondence to the continuum Dirac theory.

Consequently, our knowledge about dark matter is\nlimited, for example, we do not know if dark matter is a stable particle or if\nit decays. Without a theoretical particle model, the parameter space of\npossible decay models is highly variable, and astrophysical or cosmological\nmeans of indirectly constraining the phenomenological models are required. This\npaper investigates a scenario in which a dark matter decays and the dark\ndaughter particle moves with respect to the comoving mother particle. The model\nis parameterised by the decay rate and the injection velocity of the dark\nmatter particles, which can be converted to the mass ratio. In previous work, a\nsimpler model was used to investigate the evolution of cosmic voids typified as\nregions with low content of galaxies and non-baryonic matter. It was found that\nthe growth of S-type voids is modified by the dark matter decay, leading to\nimprints at the present day. Here we extend our study and improve the method\nused to model the decay. We also study the gravitational weak-lensing signal\nthat will be able to detect or constrain the parameter space of decaying dark\nmatter.

This paper introduces a practical and\neffective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL\nfrom online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary,\nnot competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy\nto its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency\nwhile preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending\nSFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that\nthe primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length.

    "abstract": "Contamination from nearby sources often compromises stellar rotation periods\nderived from photometric light curves, particularly in data with large pixel\nscales such as TESS. This problem is compounded when both the target and\ncontaminant are intrinsically variable, a scenario that challenges deblending\nalgorithms, which often assume constant contaminants. We assess the reliability\nof rotation period detections using wide binary systems, whose components share\na common age and rotational history. By applying gyrochronology constraints, we\nidentify period combinations that yield consistent ages between components,\nhelping to isolate true rotation signals. Simulating blends with degraded\nKepler data, our method recovers correct rotation periods with an 88\\% success\nrate for periods $<12$ days, where TESS detections are most reliable. Applying\nthis framework to nearly 300 wide binaries observed by TESS, we find that\ndespite significant contamination, a subset of pairs shows consistent\ngyrochronological ages. We establish a practical detection threshold for TESS\nblended observations, finding that periods shorter than $\\sim8$ days are\nreliably recovered, while those longer than $\\sim10$ days become significantly\nmore challenging and often remain unresolved. As expected, rotation periods are\nmore often recovered when the highest-amplitude periodogram peak is linked to\nthe brighter star and the second to the dimmer star, although many cases\ndeviate from this pattern, indicating it cannot always be assumed. Our results\nhighlight the limitations of standard deblending methods and demonstrate that\nastrophysical constraints, such as gyrochronology, provide a valuable tool for\nextracting reliable rotation periods from complex photometric blends.",

In this study, we present a nonlinear spatial network model that\nsimulates RyR spatial organization to investigate calcium release dynamics by\nintegrating RyR behavior, calcium buffering, and calsequestrin (CSQ)\nregulation. The model successfully reproduces calcium sparks, shedding light on\ntheir initiation, duration, and termination mechanisms under clamped calcium\nconditions. Our simulations demonstrate that RyR clusters act as on-off\nswitches for calcium release, producing short-lived calcium quarks and\nlonger-lasting calcium sparks based on distinct activation patterns. Spark\ntermination is governed by calcium gradients and stochastic RyR dynamics, with\nCSQ facilitating RyR closure and spark termination. We also uncover the dual\nrole of CSQ as both a calcium buffer and a regulator of RyRs. Elevated CSQ\nlevels prolong calcium release due to buffering effects, while CSQ-RyR\ninteractions induce excessive refractoriness, a phenomenon linked to\npathological conditions such as ventricular arrhythmias. Dysregulated CSQ\nfunction disrupts the on-off switching behavior of RyRs, impairing calcium\nrelease dynamics.

The observed thinness of the tachocline\nhas long been a mystery, given the expected tendency of such shear to undergo\nradiative spreading. Radiative spreading is the process by which the meridional\ncirculation and angular velocity burrow into a stably-stratified fluid owing to\nthe mitigating effect of radiative thermal diffusion. A confinement mechanism\nis thus required to keep the tachocline so thin. In previous work using global\ndynamo simulations, we achieved a statistically-stationary confined tachocline\nwhere the confinement mechanism was derived from the Maxwell stress arising\nfrom a dynamo-generated nonaxisymmetric poloidal magnetic field. However, the\nparameters chosen meant that the tachocline was confined against viscous spread\ninstead of radiative spread. Here, we show that the previously identified\ndynamo confinement mechanism still succeeds in a simulation that lies in the\nmore solar-like radiative spreading regime. In particular, a nonaxisymmetric,\nquasicyclic dynamo develops in the convective zone and overshoot layer,\npenetrates into the radiative zone via a novel type of skin effect, and creates\na Maxwell stress that confines the tachocline over many magnetic cycles. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first fully self-consistent rendering of a\nconfined tachocline in a global numerical simulation in the parameter regime\nappropriate to the Sun.",

Here, we demonstrate that large-scale nonlinear computation can be\nperformed using linear optics through optimized diffractive processors composed\nof passive phase-only surfaces. In this framework, the input variables of\nnonlinear functions are encoded into the phase of an optical wavefront, e.g.,\nvia a spatial light modulator (SLM), and transformed by an optimized\ndiffractive structure with spatially varying point-spread functions to yield\noutput intensities that approximate a large set of unique nonlinear functions,\nall in parallel. We provide proof establishing that this architecture serves as\na universal function approximator for an arbitrary set of bandlimited nonlinear\nfunctions, also covering multi-variate and complex-valued functions. We also\nnumerically demonstrate the parallel computation of one million distinct\nnonlinear functions, accurately executed at wavelength-scale spatial density at\nthe output of a diffractive optical processor. Furthermore, we experimentally\nvalidated this framework using in situ optical learning and approximated 35\nunique nonlinear functions in a single shot using a compact setup consisting of\nan SLM and an image sensor.

However, fine-tuning more generalizable classifiers based\non existing labeled datasets remains an important challenge, as creating large\nand accurately labeled datasets often requires considerable time and resources.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the capabilities of four advanced LLMs, including\nGPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70b, to enhance user feedback\nclassification and address the challenge of the limited labeled dataset. To\nachieve this, we conduct several experiments on eight datasets that have been\nmeticulously labeled in prior research. These datasets include user reviews\nfrom app stores, posts from the X platform, and discussions from the public\nforums, widely recognized as representative sources of app user feedback. We\nanalyze the performance of various LLMs in identifying both fine-grained and\ncoarse-grained user feedback categories. Given the substantial volume of daily\nuser feedback and the computational limitations of LLMs, we leverage these\nmodels as an annotation tool to augment labeled datasets with general and\napp-specific data. This augmentation aims to enhance the performance of\nstate-of-the-art BERT-based classification models.

The simulations utilise\nself-consistent chemical profiles for the primary WD which were generated by a\nstellar evolution code incorporating the effects of semi-degenerate carbon\nburning.

We compare the results using our\nself-consistent chemical profiles to a constant-composition WD structure and\nfind the same explosion pattern when the inspiral time is short.

To address this constraint, the DS@GT BirdCLEF\nteam explored two strategies. First, we establish competitive baselines by\noptimizing pre-trained models from the Bioacoustics Model Zoo for CPU\ninference. Using TFLite, we achieved a nearly 10x inference speedup for the\nPerch model, enabling it to run in approximately 16 minutes and achieve a final\nROC-AUC score of 0.729 on the public leaderboard post-competition and 0.711 on\nthe private leaderboard. The best model from the zoo was BirdSetEfficientNetB1,\nwith a public score of 0.810 and a private score of 0.778. Second, we introduce\na novel, lightweight pipeline named Spectrogram Token Skip-Gram (STSG) that\ntreats bioacoustics as a sequence modeling task. This method converts audio\ninto discrete \"spectrogram tokens\" by clustering Mel-spectrograms using Faiss\nK-means and then learns high-quality contextual embeddings for these tokens in\nan unsupervised manner with a Word2Vec skip-gram model. For classification,\nembeddings within a 5-second window are averaged and passed to a linear model.\nWith a projected inference time of 6 minutes for a 700-minute test set, the\nSTSG approach achieved a final ROC-AUC public score of 0.559 and a private\nscore of 0.520, demonstrating the viability of fast tokenization approaches\nwith static embeddings for bioacoustic classification.

This paper presents a novel\nmaneuver detection approach based on comparing the confidence levels associated\nwith the orbital state estimation and the observation likelihood. First, a\nconfidence-dominance maneuver indicator (CDMI) is proposed by setting a\nconfidence level for the state estimation and computing the maximum likelihood\nof the observation and its confidence level. The CDMI then flag a maneuver when\nthe observation's confidence level exceeds that of the state estimation,\nindicating that the observation is unlikely under the no-maneuver hypothesis\nwhile maintaining consistency with the prior state estimation confidence. To\nefficiently compute the maximum likelihood of the observation and obtain the\nCDMI, a recursive polynomial optimization method is developed, taking advantage\nof convex optimization and polynomial approximation. In addition, an integrated\nCDMI approach is developed to eliminate the need to manually select the state\nconfidence level. The integrated CDMI approach maintains high detection\naccuracy while simultaneously providing an indication of maneuver likelihood,\nthereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability. The performance of\nthe proposed CDMI-based maneuver detection approaches is evaluated against an\noptimal control distance metric and two mixture-based approaches. The\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed integrated CDMI approach can\nachieve up to 99.33\\% detection accuracy, at least 10% higher than the\ncompeting methods, while substantially reducing computational costs.",

    "abstract": "Validity of second-order perturbation theory (PT) is examined for\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA) energy in Co films with enhanced spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC) and Co/Pt bilayers. Comparison with accurate results obtained\nwith the force theorem (FT) reveals significant discrepancies in the dependence\nof the MCA energy on the Co thickness. For systems with strong SOC, the PT\nfails to correctly describe the oscillations of the MCA energy, largely\noverestimating their amplitude and even failing (for Co/Pt bilayers) to\nreproduce their specific periodicity. These failures specifically concern the\ndominating oscillations with the 2-monolayer period which arise from pairs of\nquantum well (QW) minority-spin d states in the Co layer, degenerate at the\ncentre of the Brillouin zone (BZ). A simplified model of such states\ndemonstrates that the large discrepancies between PT and FT predictions arise\nfrom the breakdown of the PT in a region around the BZ centre where the energy\nspacing between states within each pair is small compared to the SOC strength.\nThe oscillation amplitude of the MCA energy calculated with the FT is limited\nby the finite energy spacing between consecutive QW pairs, whereas this\namplitude grows quadratically with the SOC strength in the PT calculations.\nFurthermore, for weak and moderate SOC strengths, the accuracy of the PT\ndiminishes with increasing the ratio of the SOC constant to temperature. This\nexplains why the PT overestimates the amplitude of MCA energy oscillations at\nlow temperatures, even for the Co film with a relatively weak nominal SOC. For\nthe Co/Pt bilayer, the strong temperature dependence of the oscillation\namplitude in the PT approach leads to the MCA energies markedly different at\nlow and zero temperatures, of opposite sign and several times larger in\nmagnitude, compared to the FT results.",

We introduce SelfReVision, a lightweight and scalable\nself-improvement framework for vision-language procedural planning.\nSelfReVision enables small VLMs to iteratively critique, revise, and verify\ntheir own plans-without external supervision or teacher models-drawing\ninspiration from chain-of-thought prompting and self-instruct paradigms.\nThrough this self-distillation loop, models generate higher-quality,\nexecution-ready plans that can be used both at inference and for continued\nfine-tuning. Using models varying from 3B to 72B, our results show that\nSelfReVision not only boosts performance over weak base VLMs but also\noutperforms models 100X the size, yielding improved control in downstream\nembodied tasks.",

    "abstract": "We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for\nthree-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction\nof instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric\nsurface patches, specifically bicubic B\\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a\nmodification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks\nStarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance\nvoxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to\narbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.\n  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging,\nSurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance\nparameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one\nsynthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D.\nThese results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be\nlearned effectively alongside instance membership.",

    "abstract": "Are temporary workers subject to different wage markdowns than permanent\nworkers? This paper examines productivity, output markups, and wage markdowns\nin India's automotive sector during 2000--2020. I develop a model integrating\nCES production, nested logit labor supply, and differentiated labor market\nconduct: Nash-Bertrand wage setting for temporary workers versus Nash\nbargaining for unionized permanent workers. Results reveal declining output\nmarkups as marginal costs outpace prices through productivity deceleration.\nRising labor-augmenting productivity cannot offset declining Hicks-neutral\nproductivity, reducing overall TFP. Labor market power substantially compresses\nworker compensation: wage markdowns persist at 40% for temporary workers and\n10% for permanent workers.",
