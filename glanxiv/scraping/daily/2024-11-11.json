    "abstract": "Traditional compilers, designed for optimizing low-level code, fall short\nwhen dealing with modern, computation-heavy applications like image processing,\nmachine learning, or numerical simulations. Optimizations should understand the\nprimitive operations of the specific application domain and thus happen on that\nlevel.\n  Domain-specific languages (DSLs) fulfill these requirements. However, DSL\ncompilers reinvent the wheel over and over again as standard optimizations,\ncode generators, and general infrastructure & boilerplate code must be\nreimplemented for each DSL compiler.\n  This paper presents MimIR, an extensible, higher-order intermediate\nrepresentation. At its core, MimIR is a pure type system and, hence, a form of\na typed lambda calculus. Developers can declare the signatures of new\n(domain-specific) operations, called \"axioms\". An axiom can be the declaration\nof a function, a type constructor, or any other entity with a possibly\npolymorphic, polytypic, and/or dependent type. This way, developers can extend\nMimIR at any low or high level and bundle them in a \"plugin\". Plugins extend\nthe compiler and take care of optimizing and lowering the plugins' axioms.\n  We show the expressiveness and effectiveness of MimIR in three case studies:\nLow-level plugins that operate at the same level of abstraction as LLVM, a\nregular-expression matching plugin, and plugins for linear algebra and\nautomatic differentiation. We show that in all three studies, MimIR produces\ncode that has state-of-the-art performance.",

    "abstract": "Safely handling objects and avoiding slippage are fundamental challenges in\nrobotic manipulation, yet traditional techniques often oversimplify the issue\nby treating slippage as a binary occurrence. Our research presents a framework\nthat both identifies slip incidents and measures their severity. We introduce a\nset of features based on detailed vector field analysis of tactile deformation\ndata captured by the GelSight Mini sensor. Two distinct machine learning models\nuse these features: one focuses on slip detection, and the other evaluates the\nslip's severity, which is the slipping velocity of the object against the\nsensor surface. Our slip detection model achieves an average accuracy of 92%,\nand the slip severity estimation model exhibits a mean absolute error (MAE) of\n0.6 cm/s for unseen objects. To demonstrate the synergistic approach of this\nframework, we employ both the models in a tactile feedback-guided vertical\nsliding task. Leveraging the high accuracy of slip detection, we utilize it as\nthe foundational and corrective model and integrate the slip severity\nestimation into the feedback control loop to address slips without\novercompensating.",

These patterns have become ubiquitous on various digital\nplatforms. While efforts to mitigate deceptive patterns have emerged from legal\nand technical perspectives, a significant gap remains in creating usable and\nscalable solutions. We introduce our AutoBot framework to address this gap and\nhelp web stakeholders navigate and mitigate online deceptive patterns. AutoBot\naccurately identifies and localizes deceptive patterns from a screenshot of a\nwebsite without relying on the underlying HTML code. AutoBot employs a\ntwo-stage pipeline that leverages the capabilities of specialized vision models\nto analyze website screenshots, identify interactive elements, and extract\ntextual features. Next, using a large language model, AutoBot understands the\ncontext surrounding these elements to determine the presence of deceptive\npatterns. We also use AutoBot, to create a synthetic dataset to distill\nknowledge from 'teacher' LLMs to smaller language models. Through extensive\nevaluation, we demonstrate AutoBot's effectiveness in detecting deceptive\npatterns on the web, achieving an F1-score of 0.93 when detecting deceptive\npatterns, underscoring its potential as an essential tool for mitigating online\ndeceptive patterns. We implement AutoBot, across three downstream applications\ntargeting different web stakeholders: (1) a local browser extension providing\nusers with real-time feedback, (2) a Lighthouse audit to inform developers of\npotential deceptive patterns on their sites, and (3) as a measurement tool\ndesigned for researchers and regulators.",

To achieve this, a conversational\nmusic retrieval system should seamlessly engage in multi-turn conversation by\n1) understanding user queries and 2) responding with natural language and\nretrieved music.

Similar to 238P, we find a remarkable\nabsence of hypervolatile species, finding Q(CO2)<7.6x10^22 molecules/s,\ncorresponding to Q(CO2)/Q(H2O)<0.2%.

Dynamical dust modeling\nshows that the coma's morphology as imaged by JWST's NIRCAM instrument on 2023\nNovember 22 can be reproduced by asymmetric dust emission from a nucleus with a\nmid-range obliquity (~80 deg) with a steady-state mass loss rate of ~0.8 kg/s.\nFinally, we find similar Afrho-to-gas ratios of log10(Afrho/Q(H2O))=-24.8+/-0.2\nfor 358P and log10(Afrho/QH2O)=-24.4+/-0.2 for 238P, suggesting that Afrho\ncould serve as an effective proxy for estimating water production rates in\nother active main-belt comets.

Commonly, ground\nmetrics are decided with heuristics or learned via supervised algorithms.\nHowever, since many interesting datasets are unlabelled, unsupervised ground\nmetric learning approaches have been introduced. One promising option employs\nWasserstein singular vectors (WSVs), which emerge when computing optimal\ntransport distances between features and samples simultaneously. WSVs are\neffective, but can be prohibitively computationally expensive in some\napplications: $\\mathcal{O}(n^2m^2(n \\log(n) + m \\log(m))$ for $n$ samples and\n$m$ features. In this work, we propose to augment the WSV method by embedding\nsamples and features on trees, on which we compute the tree-Wasserstein\ndistance (TWD). We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the algorithm\nconverges to a better approximation of the standard WSV approach than the best\nknown alternatives, and does so with $\\mathcal{O}(n^3+m^3+mn)$ complexity. In\naddition, we prove that the initial tree structure can be chosen flexibly,\nsince tree geometry does not constrain the richness of the approximation up to\nthe number of edge weights. This proof suggests a fast and recursive algorithm\nfor computing the tree parameter basis set, which we find crucial to realising\nthe efficiency gains at scale. Finally, we employ the tree-WSV algorithm to\nseveral single-cell RNA sequencing genomics datasets, demonstrating its\nscalability and utility for unsupervised cell-type clustering problems. These\nresults poise unsupervised ground metric learning with TWD as a low-rank\napproximation of WSV with the potential for widespread application.",

XPoint employs\nmodularity and self-supervision to allow for the adjustment of elements such as\nthe base detector, which generates pseudoground truth keypoints invariant to\nviewpoint and spectrum variations. The framework integrates a VMamba encoder,\npretrained on segmentation tasks, for robust feature extraction, and includes\nthree joint decoder heads: two are dedicated to interest point and descriptor\nextraction; and a task-specific homography regression head imposes geometric\nconstraints for superior performance in tasks like image registration. This\nflexible architecture enables quick adaptation to a wide range of modalities,\ndemonstrated by training on Optical-Thermal data and fine-tuning on settings\nsuch as visual-near infrared, visual-infrared, visual-longwave infrared, and\nvisual-synthetic aperture radar. Experimental results show that XPoint\nconsistently outperforms or matches state-ofthe-art methods in feature matching\nand image registration tasks across five distinct multispectral datasets.

    "abstract": "The lack of both nesting and a van Hove singularity at half filling, together\nwith the presence of Dirac cones makes the honeycomb lattice a special\nlaboratory to explore strongly correlated phenomena. For instance, at zero\ntemperature the repulsive [attractive] Hubbard model only undergoes a\ntransition to an antiferromagnetic [$s$-wave superconducting degenerate with\ncharge density wave (SC-CDW)] for sufficiently strong on-site coupling,\n$U/t\\gtrsim 3.85$ [$U/t\\lesssim -3.85$]; in between these, the system is a\nsemi-metal, by virtue of the Dirac cones. The addition of an additional\ninteraction, $V>0$ or $V<0$, between fermions in nearest neighbor orbitals\nshould break the SC-CDW degeneracy giving rise to a phase diagram quite\ndistinct from the one for the square lattice. Here we perform determinant\nquantum Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the whole phase diagram,\ncovering the four combinations of signs of $U$ and $V$; the use of complex\nHubbard-Stratonovich fields renders the region $|V|\\leq |U|/3$ free from the\n`minus sign problem'. We calculate structure factors associated with different\norderings, which, together with the double occupancy and the average sign\nallows us to map out the whole phase diagram. We have found that the SM phase\nforms a zone from which ordered phases are excluded, preventing the\nstabilization of a $d$-wave SC phase, i.e., only $s$-wave pairing is allowed.",

    "abstract": "The numerical flux determines the performance of numerical methods for\nsolving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we\ncompare a selection of 8 numerical fluxes in the framework of nonlinear\nsemidiscrete finite volume (FV) schemes, based on Weighted Essentially\nNon-Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC)\ntime discretization. The methodology is implemented and systematically assessed\nfor order of accuracy in space and time up to seven. The numerical fluxes\nselected in the present study represent the two existing classes of fluxes,\nnamely centred and upwind. Centred fluxes do not explicitly use wave\npropagation information, while, upwind fluxes do so from the solution of the\nRiemann problem via a wave model containing $A$ waves. Upwind fluxes include\ntwo subclasses: complete and incomplete fluxes. For complete upwind fluxes,\n$A=E$, where $E$ is the number of characteristic fields in the exact problem.\nFor incomplete upwind ones, $A<E$. Our study is conducted for the one- and\ntwo-dimensional Euler equations, for which we consider the following numerical\nfluxes: Lax-Friedrichs (LxF), First-Order Centred (FORCE), Rusanov (Rus),\nHarten-Lax-van Leer (HLL), Central-Upwind (CU), Low-Dissipation Central-Upwind\n(LDCU), HLLC, and the flux computed through the exact Riemann solver (Ex.RS).\nWe find that the numerical flux has an effect on the performance of the\nmethods. The magnitude of the effect depends on the type of numerical flux and\non the order of accuracy of the scheme.

We apply the computational procedure to markets consisting of\ngroups of stocks, varying asset type and number.

    "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly used to select which individuals receive\nlimited-resource interventions in domains such as human services, education,\ndevelopment, and more. However, it is often not apparent what the right\nquantity is for models to predict. Policymakers rarely have access to data from\na randomized controlled trial (RCT) that would enable accurate estimates of\nwhich individuals would benefit more from the intervention, while observational\ndata creates a substantial risk of bias in treatment effect estimates.\nPractitioners instead commonly use a technique termed ``risk-based targeting\"\nwhere the model is just used to predict each individual's status quo outcome\n(an easier, non-causal task). Those with higher predicted risk are offered\ntreatment. There is currently almost no empirical evidence to inform which\nchoices lead to the most effective machine learning-informed targeting\nstrategies in social domains. In this work, we use data from 5 real-world RCTs\nin a variety of domains to empirically assess such choices. We find that when\ntreatment effects can be estimated with high accuracy (which we simulate by\nallowing the model to partially observe outcomes in advance), treatment effect\nbased targeting substantially outperforms risk-based targeting, even when\ntreatment effect estimates are biased. Moreover, these results hold even when\nthe policymaker has strong normative preferences for assisting higher-risk\nindividuals. However, the features and data actually available in most RCTs we\nexamine do not suffice for accurate estimates of heterogeneous treatment\neffects. Our results suggest treatment effect targeting has significant\npotential benefits, but realizing these benefits requires improvements to data\ncollection and model training beyond what is currently common in practice.",

Due to the fibre\nloss, some photons are lost in transmission. Noise in the transmission link and\nthe quantum memory also reduces fidelity.

Choosing how sensitive the model is to\nits context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at\ntasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this\npaper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining\nwhether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To\nguide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In\nthis task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a\nquestion (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior\nor contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer\nfor both intents (either France or England). When fine-tuned on this task,\ninstruction-tuned versions of Llama-3.1, Mistral-v0.3, and Gemma-2 can solve it\nwith high accuracy (85-95%). Analyzing these high-performing models, we narrow\ndown which layers may be important to context sensitivity using a novel linear\ntime algorithm. Then, in each model, we identify a 1-D subspace in a single\nlayer that encodes whether the model follows context or prior knowledge.\nInterestingly, while we identify this subspace in a fine-tuned model, we find\nthat the exact same subspace serves as an effective knob in not only that model\nbut also non-fine-tuned instruct and base models of that model family. Finally,\nwe show a strong correlation between a model's performance and how distinctly\nit separates context-agreeing from context-ignoring answers in this subspace.\nThese results suggest a single subspace facilitates how the model chooses\nbetween context and prior knowledge, hinting at a simple fundamental mechanism\nthat controls this behavior.",

This paper aims to review and validate hierarchical stochastic\nGMMs, with a focus on identifying their ''optimal'' configuration. We introduce\nthe word ''hierarchical'' as its formulation contains two steps:(1) selecting a\nmodulated filtered white noise model (MFWNM) to replicate a target record and\n(2) constructing a joint probability density function (PDF) for the parameters\nof the selected MFWNM, accounting for the record-to-record variability. In the\nfirst step, we review the development of MFWNMs and explore the ''optimal''\nmodeling of time-varying spectral content. Specifically, we investigate\ndifferent frequency filters (single- and multi-mode) and various trends\n(constant, linear, and non-parametric) to describe the filters' time-varying\nproperties. In the second step, the joint PDF is decomposed into a product of\nmarginal distributions and a correlation structure, represented by copula\nmodels. We explore two copula models: the Gaus-sian copula and the R-vine\ncopula. The hierarchical GMMs are evaluated by comparing specific statistical\nmetrics, calculated from 1,001 real strong motions, with those derived from\ntheir corresponding synthetic dataset.

    "abstract": "Prior works have demonstrated many advantages of cumulative statistics over\nthe classical methods of reliability diagrams, ECEs (empirical, estimated, or\nexpected calibration errors), and ICIs (integrated calibration indices). The\nadvantages pertain to assessing calibration of predicted probabilities,\ncomparison of responses from a subpopulation to the responses from the full\npopulation, and comparison of responses from one subpopulation to those from a\nseparate subpopulation. The cumulative statistics include graphs of cumulative\ndifferences as a function of the scalar covariate, as well as metrics due to\nKuiper and to Kolmogorov and Smirnov that summarize the graphs into single\nscalar statistics and associated P-values (also known as \"attained significance\nlevels\" for significance tests). However, the prior works have not yet treated\ndata from biostatistics.\n  Fortunately, the advantages of the cumulative statistics extend to the\nBehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) of the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention. This is unsurprising, since the mathematics is the same\nas in earlier works. Nevertheless, detailed analysis of the BRFSS data is\nrevealing and corroborates the findings of earlier works.\n  Two methodological extensions beyond prior work that facilitate analysis of\nthe BRFSS are (1) empirical estimators of uncertainty for graphs of the\ncumulative differences between two subpopulations, such that the estimators are\nvalid for any real-valued responses, and (2) estimators of the weighted average\ntreatment effect for the differences in the responses between the\nsubpopulations. Both of these methods concern the case in which none of the\ncovariate's observed values for one subpopulation is equal to any of the\ncovariate's values for the other subpopulation. The data analysis presented\nreports results for this case as well as several others.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing proliferation of mobile applications in our everyday\nexperiences, the concerns surrounding ethics have surged significantly. Users\ngenerally communicate their feedback, report issues, and suggest new\nfunctionalities in application (app) reviews, frequently emphasizing safety,\nprivacy, and accountability concerns. Incorporating these reviews is essential\nto developing successful products. However, app reviews related to ethical\nconcerns generally use domain-specific language and are expressed using a more\nvaried vocabulary. Thus making automated ethical concern-related app review\nextraction a challenging and time-consuming effort.\n  This study proposes a novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) based approach\nthat combines Natural Language Inference (NLI), which provides a deep\ncomprehension of language nuances, and a decoder-only (LLaMA-like) Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to extract ethical concern-related app reviews at scale.\nUtilizing 43,647 app reviews from the mental health domain, the proposed\nmethodology 1) Evaluates four NLI models to extract potential privacy reviews\nand compares the results of domain-specific privacy hypotheses with generic\nprivacy hypotheses; 2) Evaluates four LLMs for classifying app reviews to\nprivacy concerns; and 3) Uses the best NLI and LLM models further to extract\nnew privacy reviews from the dataset. Results show that the\nDeBERTa-v3-base-mnli-fever-anli NLI model with domain-specific hypotheses\nyields the best performance, and Llama3.1-8B-Instruct LLM performs best in the\nclassification of app reviews.

A key\naspect of the methodology is the accurate detection of the aiming beam, which\nis essential for localizing points used to map FLIm measurements onto the\ntissue region within the surgical field. The primary challenge arises from the\ncomplex and variable conditions encountered in the surgical environment,\nparticularly in Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS). Uneven illumination in the\nsurgical field can cause reflections, reduce contrast, and results in\ninconsistent color representation, further complicating aiming beam detection.\nTo overcome these challenges, an instance segmentation model was developed\nusing a data-centric training strategy that improves accuracy by minimizing\nlabel noise and enhancing detection robustness. The model was evaluated on a\ndataset comprising 40 in vivo surgical videos, demonstrating a median detection\nrate of 85%. This performance was maintained when the model was integrated in a\nclinical system, achieving a similar detection rate of 85% during TORS\nprocedures conducted in patients. The system's computational efficiency,\nmeasured at approximately 24 frames per second (FPS), was sufficient for\nreal-time surgical guidance.

Its gas\nmetallicity is among the lowest known in the local Universe, with parameter\n12+log(O/H) in the range of 6.96-7.3 dex. Six of its SF regions are located in\nor near the so-called 'Northern Ring', in which the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) images reveal many luminous young stars. We present for these SF regions\n(Knots) the results of optical monitoring in 35 epochs during the years\n2016--2023. The data was acquired with the 6m (BTA) and the 1m telescopes of\nthe Special Astrophysical Observatory and the 2.5m telescope of the MSU\nCaucasian Mountain Observatory. We complement the above results with the\narchive data from 10 other telescopes for 11 epochs during the years 1988-2013\nand with 3 our BTA observations between 2005 and 2015. Our goal is to search\nfor variability of these Knots and to relate it to the probable light\nvariations of their brightest stars. One of them, DDO68-V1 (in Knot 3), was\nidentified in 2008 with a luminous blue variable (LBV) star, born in the lowest\nmetallicity environments. For Knot 3, variations of its integrated light in the\nprevious epochs reached ~0.8 mag. In the period since 2016, the amplitude of\nvariations of Knot 3 reached ~0.3 mag. For the rest Knots, due to the lower\namplitudes, the manifestation of variability is less pronounced. We examine the\npresence of variability via the criterion chi^{2} and the Robust Median\nStatistics and discuss the robustness of the detected variations. The\nvariability is detected according to the both criteria in the lightcurves of\nall Knots with the chi^{2} confidence level of alpha = 0.0005. The peak-to-peak\namplitudes of variations are ~0.09, ~0.13, ~0.11, ~0.08 and ~0.16 mag for Knots\n1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, respectively.

Our method controls translation length by\npredicting the duration of speech and pauses in conjunction with the\ntranslation process. This is achieved by providing timing information to the\ndecoder, ensuring it tracks the remaining duration for speech and pauses while\ngenerating the translation. The evaluation on the Zh-En test set of CoVoST 2,\ndemonstrates that the proposed Isochrony-Controlled ST achieves 0.92 speech\noverlap and 8.9 BLEU, which has only a 1.4 BLEU drop compared to the ST\nbaseline.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a scheduling algorithm that divides a\nmanufacturing/warehouse floor into zones that an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR)\nwill occupy and complete part pick-up and drop-off tasks. Each zone is balanced\nso that each AMR will share each task equally. These zones change over time to\naccommodate fluctuations in production and to avoid overloading an AMR with\ntasks. A decentralized dynamic zoning (DDZ) algorithm is introduced to find the\noptimal zone design, eliminating the possibility of single-point failure from a\ncentralized unit. Then a simulation is built comparing the adaptability of DDZ\nand other dynamic zoning algorithms from previous works. Initial results show\nthat DDZ has a much lower throughput than other dynamic zoning algorithms but\nDDZ can achieve a better distribution of tasks. Initial results show that DDZ\nhad a lower standard deviation of AMR total travel distance which was 2874.7\nfeet less than previous works. This 68.7\\% decrease in standard deviation\nsuggests that AMRs under DDZ travel a similar distance during production. This\ncould be useful for real-world applications by making it easier to design\ncharging and maintenance schedules without much downtime.

Periodic boundary conditions are of course familiar, but field\nspace endpoints--which appear in real-world systems--are far less explored. In\nthis paper we argue that boundaries in field space are generic, radiatively\nstable structures that allow for new physics at very low scales not ruled out\nby experiment. Such boundaries are delocalized in field space from the vacuum,\nso they can only be accessed by coherent fields or high multiplicity processes,\nboth of which are weakly constrained observationally. Low multiplicity\ninteractions do not detect the boundary and instead perceive a \"mirage cutoff\"\nthat is parametrically higher than the true cutoff of the theory. Hence, field\nspace boundaries are deformations of the standard model that are Lorentz\ninvariant, local, unitary at low energies, and experimentally unconstrained. We\ncomment on the possibility of field space boundaries on the long-range force\ncarriers and the Higgs, as well as possible implications for the hierarchy\nproblem.",

Our data comes from\nthe sepsis cohort of MIMIC-IV and the clinical data warehouses of the Mass\nGeneral Brigham healthcare system. The ultimate objective of this work is to\nuse the optimal learned policy function to estimate the counterfactual\ntreatment policy and identify deviations across sub-populations of interest.

We compare to a sample of LG-like systems in\nthe Illustris simulation and find that $\\sim 13\\%$ of these pairs have\nundergone a pericentric passage. Using the simulated sample, we examine how\naccurately an isolated, two-body model describes the MW-M31 orbit, and show\nthat $\\sim 10\\%$ of the analogues in the simulation are well-modeled by such an\norbit. Systems that evolve in isolation by this definition are found to have a\nlower rate of major mergers and, in particular, have no major mergers since $z\n\\approx 0.3$. For all systems, we find an increase in the orbital angular\nmomentum, which is fairly independent of the merger rate and is possibly\nexplained by the influence of tidal torques on the LG. Given the likely quiet\nrecent major merger history of the MW, it is plausible that the isolated\ntwo-body model appropriately describes the orbit, though recent evidence for a\nmajor merger in M31 may complicate this interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how individual agents make strategic decisions within\ncollectives is important for advancing fields as diverse as economics,\nneuroscience, and multi-agent systems. Two complementary approaches can be\nintegrated to this end. The Active Inference framework (AIF) describes how\nagents employ a generative model to adapt their beliefs about and behaviour\nwithin their environment. Game theory formalises strategic interactions between\nagents with potentially competing objectives. To bridge the gap between the\ntwo, we propose a factorisation of the generative model whereby each agent\nmaintains explicit, individual-level beliefs about the internal states of other\nagents, and uses them for strategic planning in a joint context. We apply our\nmodel to iterated general-sum games with two and three players, and study the\nensemble effects of game transitions, where the agents' preferences (game\npayoffs) change over time. This non-stationarity, beyond that caused by\nreciprocal adaptation, reflects a more naturalistic environment in which agents\nneed to adapt to changing social contexts. Finally, we present a dynamical\nanalysis of key AIF quantities: the variational free energy (VFE) and the\nexpected free energy (EFE) from numerical simulation data. The ensemble-level\nEFE allows us to characterise the basins of attraction of games with multiple\nNash Equilibria under different conditions, and we find that it is not\nnecessarily minimised at the aggregate level. By integrating AIF and game\ntheory, we can gain deeper insights into how intelligent collectives emerge,\nlearn, and optimise their actions in dynamic environments, both cooperative and\nnon-cooperative.",

    "abstract": "An important challenge in robust machine learning is when training data is\nprovided by strategic sources who may intentionally report erroneous data for\ntheir own benefit. A line of work at the intersection of machine learning and\nmechanism design aims to deter strategic agents from reporting erroneous\ntraining data by designing learning algorithms that are strategyproof.\nStrategyproofness is a strong and desirable property, but it comes at a cost in\nthe approximation ratio of even simple risk minimization problems.\n  In this paper, we study strategyproof regression and classification problems\nin a model with advice. This model is part of a recent line on mechanism design\nwith advice where the goal is to achieve both an improved approximation ratio\nwhen the advice is correct (consistency) and a bounded approximation ratio when\nthe advice is incorrect (robustness). We provide the first non-trivial\nconsistency-robustness tradeoffs for strategyproof regression and\nclassification, which hold for simple yet interesting classes of functions. For\nclasses of constant functions, we give a deterministic and strategyproof\nmechanism that is, for any $\\gamma \\in (0, 2]$, $1+\\gamma$ consistent and $1 +\n4/\\gamma$ robust and provide a lower bound that shows that this tradeoff is\noptimal. We extend this mechanism and its guarantees to homogeneous linear\nregression over $\\mathbb{R}$. In the binary classification problem of selecting\nfrom three or more labelings, we present strong impossibility results for both\ndeterministic and randomized mechanism. Finally, we provide deterministic and\nrandomized mechanisms for selecting from two labelings.",

    "abstract": "A fraction of the dense cores within a turbulent molecular cloud will\neventually collapse to form stars. Identifying the physical criteria for\ninstability and analyzing critical core properties is therefore necessary to\nstar formation theory. Here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of\n\"critical cores\" on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified\nin a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar\ncores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find\nthat radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion in individual\ncritical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium\nspheres (TESs). While a global linewidth-size relation exists for a cloud with\ngiven size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations around each core\nexhibit significant variations. As a result, there is no single density\nthreshold for collapse; instead, cores collapse at a range of densities\ndetermined by the local sonic scale and gravitational potential environment.\nThe critical cores in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find\neither purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. In our low Mach number model\nwhich better resolves the characteristic mass and sonic scales, we find\nmarginal evidence that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks\naround a characteristic mass scale associated with the large-scale cloud\nproperties. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical\ntime for the purpose of testing gravoturbulent fragmentation theories, and\nderive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the\nCMF.",

To address this question, we carefully\nconstruct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and\nanalyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show\nthat the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal\nstructure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating\nclouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically\nwith the cloud's Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of\nindividual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential\nminimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and\ndecreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for\ninitiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies\nwidely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the\nradial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state\nof gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium\nspheres to predict the onset of each core's collapse. Instability is expected\nwhen the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good\nagreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity\nand opposing forces is only $\\sim 20\\%$ during core collapse, meaning that this\nis a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their\nevolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence\ninherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by\ngravity only appear near the end of the collapse.",

    "abstract": "Set theory is foundational to mathematics and, when sets are finite, to\nreasoning about the world. An intelligent system should perform set operations\nconsistently, regardless of superficial variations in the operands. Initially\ndesigned for semantically-oriented NLP tasks, large language models (LLMs) are\nnow being evaluated on algorithmic tasks. Because sets are comprised of\narbitrary symbols (e.g. numbers, words), they provide an opportunity to test,\nsystematically, the invariance of LLMs' algorithmic abilities under simple\nlexical or semantic variations. To this end, we present the SetLexSem\nChallenge, a synthetic benchmark that evaluates the performance of LLMs on set\noperations. SetLexSem assesses the robustness of LLMs' instruction-following\nabilities under various conditions, focusing on the set operations and the\nnature and construction of the set members. Evaluating seven LLMs with\nSetLexSem, we find that they exhibit poor robustness to variation in both\noperation and operands. We show -- via the framework's systematic sampling of\nset members along lexical and semantic dimensions -- that LLMs are not only not\nrobust to variation along these dimensions but demonstrate unique failure modes\nin particular, easy-to-create semantic groupings of \"deceptive\" sets. We find\nthat rigorously measuring language model robustness to variation in frequency\nand length is challenging and present an analysis that measures them\nindependently.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning can complete the picture of information extraction by\nuncovering key dependencies between data sources. However, current systems fail\nto fully leverage multiple modalities for optimal performance. This has been\nattributed to modality competition, where modalities strive for training\nresources, leaving some underoptimized. We show that current balancing methods\nstruggle to train multimodal models that surpass even simple baselines, such as\nensembles. This raises the question: how can we ensure that all modalities in\nmultimodal training are sufficiently trained, and that learning from new\nmodalities consistently improves performance? This paper proposes the\nMultimodal Competition Regularizer (MCR), a new loss component inspired by\nmutual information (MI) decomposition designed to prevent the adverse effects\nof competition in multimodal training. Our key contributions are: 1)\nIntroducing game-theoretic principles in multimodal learning, where each\nmodality acts as a player competing to maximize its influence on the final\noutcome, enabling automatic balancing of the MI terms. 2) Refining lower and\nupper bounds for each MI term to enhance the extraction of task-relevant unique\nand shared information across modalities. 3) Suggesting latent space\npermutations for conditional MI estimation, significantly improving\ncomputational efficiency. MCR outperforms all previously suggested training\nstrategies and is the first to consistently improve multimodal learning beyond\nthe ensemble baseline, clearly demonstrating that combining modalities leads to\nsignificant performance gains on both synthetic and large real-world datasets.",

In what follows we introduce a model of a quantum\nmeasurement process that consistently includes the impact of having access only\nto finite resources when describing a macroscopic system, like a measurement\napparatus. Leveraging modern tools from equilibration of closed systems and\ntypicality, we show how the measurement collapse can be seen as an effective\ndescription of a closed dynamics, of which we do not know all its details.

    "abstract": "While a large body of work inspects language models for biases concerning\ngender, race, occupation and religion, biases of geographical nature are\nrelatively less explored. Some recent studies benchmark the degree to which\nlarge language models encode geospatial knowledge. However, the impact of the\nencoded geographical knowledge (or lack thereof) on real-world applications has\nnot been documented. In this work, we examine large language models for two\ncommon scenarios that require geographical knowledge: (a) travel\nrecommendations and (b) geo-anchored story generation. Specifically, we study\nfive popular language models, and across about $100$K travel requests, and\n$200$K story generations, we observe that travel recommendations corresponding\nto poorer countries are less unique with fewer location references, and stories\nfrom these regions more often convey emotions of hardship and sadness compared\nto those from wealthier nations.",

It\ncomprises four telescopes: three 0.42-meter small aperture telescopes (SATs),\nfocused on searching for primordial gravitational waves, and one 6-meter large\naperture telescope, focused on studying small-scale perturbations. Each of the\nSATs will field over 12,000 TES bolometers, with two SATs sensitive to both 90\nand 150GHz frequency bands (SAT-MF1, and SAT-MF2), while the third SAT is\nsensitive to 220 and 280GHz frequency bands. Prior to its deployment in 2023,\nthe optical properties of SAT-MF1 were characterized in the laboratory. We\nreport on measurements of near-field beam maps acquired using a thermal source\nalong with measurements using a holographic method that enables\ncharacterization of the amplitude and phase of the beam response, yielding an\nestimate of the far-field radiation pattern received by SAT-MF1. We find that\nthe near-field half-width-half-maximum (HWHM) requirements are met across the\nfocal plane array for the 90GHz frequency band, and through most of the focal\nplane array for the 150GHz frequency band. The mean of the bandpass averaged\nHWHM of the edge-detector focal plane modules match the simulated HWHM to\n10.4%, with the discrepancy caused by fringing in the simulation. The measured\nbeam profiles match simulations to within 2dB from the beam center to at least\nthe -10dB level. Holography estimates of the far-field 90GHz beams match the\nfull-width-half-maximum from simulation within 1%, and the beam profiles\ndeviate by less than 2dB inside the central lobe. The success of the holography\nand thermal beam map experiments confirmed the optical performance was\nsufficient to meet the science requirements. On-site observations are currently\nunderway.",

    "abstract": "In this study, an odour-mediated system is developed and studied. In an\nodor-mediated systems, the sense of smell or odour of species plays a critical\nrole in the interactions between predators and prey. It is widely recognised in\nscientific literature that these systems are very common and essential across\nnatural ecosystems. These systems are crucial for various behaviors, including\nforaging, mating, and avoiding predators. In this paper, it is assumed that the\npresence of prey odour aids the predator in its hunting efforts. It is assumed\nthat both prey and intermediate predators seek refuge against their respective\npredators upon detecting the odour of their predators. In other words, the\nodour of predators assists prey species in evaluating the danger and seeking\nrefuge for hiding. This model incorporates the prey species' harvesting as\nwell. We also explore the impact of fading memory on the system by\nincorporating fractional derivatives into the model. The conditions for both\nthe existence and local stability of the non-negative equilibria are derived.\nThe current model system undergoes both Hopf and transcritical bifurcation when\nthe parameter values are appropriately chosen. The dynamic behaviour of the\nsystem is showcased and thoroughly analysed using a range of diagrams,\nhighlighting the impact of prey refuge and predator odour parameters. This\npaper extensively examines the long-term impacts of harvesting within the\nsystem. The extent to which prey odour influences the system is investigated,\nand it emerges that prey odour can play a significant function within the\nsystem. It has been observed that when individuals within the system have a\nstrong memory, it positively affects the stability of the system. Numerical\nsimulations are conducted in order to demonstrate and validate the usefulness\nof the model being considered, therefore supporting the analytical conclusions.",

For example, perturbation-induced variations\nof interest may be subtle and masked by other dominant source of variation\nshared with controls, and variable guide efficiency results in some cells not\nundergoing genetic perturbation despite expressing a guide RNA. While a number\nof methods have been developed to address the former problem by explicitly\ndisentangling perturbation-induced variations from those shared with controls,\nless attention has been paid to the latter problem of noisy perturbation\nlabels.

    "abstract": "Accurate material characterization and model calibration are essential for\ncomputationally-supported engineering decisions. Current characterization and\ncalibration methods (1) use simplified test specimen geometries and global\ndata, (2) cannot guarantee that sufficient characterization data is collected\nfor a specific model of interest, (3) use deterministic methods that provide\nbest-fit parameter values with no uncertainty quantification, and (4) are\nsequential, inflexible, and time-consuming. This work brings together several\nrecent advancements into an improved workflow called Interlaced\nCharacterization and Calibration that advances the state-of-the-art in\nconstitutive model calibration. The ICC paradigm (1) efficiently uses\nfull-field data to calibrate a high-fidelity material model, (2) aligns the\ndata needed with the data collected with an optimal experimental design\nprotocol, (3) quantifies parameter uncertainty through Bayesian inference, and\n(4) incorporates these advances into a quasi real-time feedback loop. The ICC\nframework is demonstrated on the calibration of a material model using\nsimulated full-field data for an aluminum cruciform specimen being deformed\nbi-axially. The cruciform is actively driven through the myopically optimal\nload path using Bayesian optimal experimental design, which selects load steps\nthat yield the maximum expected information gain. To aid in numerical stability\nand preserve computational resources, the full-field data is dimensionally\nreduced via principal component analysis, and fast surrogate models which\napproximate the input-output relationships of the expensive finite element\nmodel are used. The tools demonstrated here show that high-fidelity\nconstitutive models can be efficiently and reliably calibrated with quantified\nuncertainty, thus supporting credible decision-making and potentially\nincreasing the agility of solid mechanics modeling.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, we have witnessed a rapid emergence of soft and\nreconfigurable robots thanks to their capability to interact safely with humans\nand adapt to complex environments. However, their softness makes accurate\ncontrol very challenging. High-fidelity sensing is critical in improving\ncontrol performance, especially posture and contact estimation. To this end,\ntraditional camera-based sensors and load cells have limited portability and\naccuracy, and they will inevitably increase the robot's cost and weight. In\nthis study, instead of using specialized sensors, we only collect distributed\npressure data inside a pneumatics-driven soft arm and apply the physical\nreservoir computing principle to simultaneously predict its kinematic posture\n(i.e., bending angle) and payload status (i.e., payload mass). Our results show\nthat, with careful readout training, one can obtain accurate bending angle and\npayload mass predictions via simple, weighted linear summations of pressure\nreadings. In addition, our comparative analysis shows that, to guarantee low\nprediction errors within 10\\%, bending angle prediction requires less training\ndata than payload prediction. This result reveals that balanced linear and\nnonlinear body dynamics are critical for the physical reservoir to accomplish\ncomplex proprioceptive and exteroceptive information perception tasks. Finally,\nthe method of exploring the most efficient readout training methods presented\nin this paper could be extended to other soft robotic systems to maximize their\nperception capabilities.",

SED fitting\nmethods, effective in pencil-beam surveys, face limitations in all-sky surveys\nwith fewer bands available, lacking the ability to capture the AGN contribution\nto the SED accurately. This limitation affects the many 10s of millions of AGN\nclearly singled out and identified by SRG/eROSITA. Our goal is to significantly\nenhance photometric redshift performance for AGN in all-sky surveys while\navoiding the need to merge multiple data sets. Instead, we employ readily\navailable data products from the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey\nfor DESI, covering > 20,000 deg$^{2}$ with deep images and catalog-based\nphotometry in the grizW1-W4 bands. We introduce PICZL, a machine-learning\nalgorithm leveraging an ensemble of CNNs. Utilizing a cross-channel approach,\nthe algorithm integrates distinct SED features from images with those obtained\nfrom catalog-level data. Full probability distributions are achieved via the\nintegration of Gaussian mixture models. On a validation sample of 8098 AGN,\nPICZL achieves a variance $\\sigma_{\\textrm{NMAD}}$ of 4.5% with an outlier\nfraction $\\eta$ of 5.6%, outperforming previous attempts to compute accurate\nphoto-z for AGN using ML.

Our streamlined methodology\nmaintains consistent performance across the entire survey area when accounting\nfor differing data quality. The same approach can be adopted for future deep\nphotometric surveys such as LSST and Euclid, showcasing its potential for\nwide-scale realisation.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that mildly varying tellurics\nand moderate wavelength solution errors induce only mild decreases in HRCCS\ndetection significance. However, limiting-case, strongly varying tellurics can\nbias the retrieved velocities and gas abundances.

In this work, we investigate the\ntwo-stage relaxation of the OTOC towards its equilibrium value in various local\nquantum circuits. We apply a systematic framework based on an emergent\nstatistical model, where the dynamics of two single-particle modes -- a domain\nwall and a magnon -- govern the decay rates. Specifically, a configuration with\ncoexisting domain wall and magnon modes generates the phantom rate in the first\nstage, and competition between these modes determines the second stage. We also\nexamine this relaxation within the operator cluster picture. The magnon modes\ntranslates into a bound state of clusters and domain wall into a random\noperator, giving consistent rates.

These chaotic features\ndiffer from those of closed quantum systems, as the dynamics is not\ncharacterized by a unitary evolution. At the same time, the presence of\nnon-decaying oscillations makes this phenomenon distinct from other form of\nchaos in open quantum system, where the system decays instead. We investigate\nthe connection between chaos and this quasi-crystalline phase using mean-field\ntechniques, and we confirm these results including quantum fluctuations at the\nlowest order.",

If the\nright-handed neutrino Majorana mass is at or below the weak scale, direct\nexperimental discovery of these states is possible in laboratory experiments.\nHowever, there is no a priori basis to expect right-handed neutrinos to be so\nlight since the Majorana mass is a technically natural parameter and could\ncomfortably reside at any scale, including at scales far above the weak scale.\nHere we explore the possibility that the right-handed neutrino Majorana mass\noriginates from electroweak symmetry breaking. Working within an effective\ntheory with two Higgs doublets, nonzero lepton number is assigned to the\nbilinear operator built from the two Higgs fields, which is then coupled to the\nright-handed neutrino mass operator. In tandem with the neutrino Yukawa\ncoupling, following electroweak symmetry breaking a seesaw mechanism operates,\ngenerating the light SM neutrino masses along with right-handed neutrinos with\nmasses below the electroweak scale. This scenario leads to novel phenomenology\nin the Higgs sector, which may be probed at the LHC and at future colliders.\nThere are also interesting prospects for neutrinoless double beta decay and\nlepton flavor violation. We also explore some theoretical aspects of the\nscenario, including the technical naturalness of the effective field theory and\nultraviolet completions of the right-handed neutrino Majorana mass.",

We demonstrate a high-temperature kinetic\nsuperconductor in a simple lattice model with nearest-neighbor hopping ($t$)\nprojected onto a constrained Hilbert space, analogous to the $t$-$J$ model with\n$J=0$, where kinetic magnetism has been previously studied. Using density\nmatrix renormalization group (DMRG) on cylinders up to width $L_y=8$, we find a\nsuperconducting ground state exhibiting a key difference from high-$T_c$\ncuprates: both the pairing gap and phase stiffness \\textit{increase} with\ndoping ($x$). We find pairing gaps, determined from spin and single-electron\ncharge gaps, exceeding $1.5t$. This model can be realized within the double\nKondo lattice model, relevant to bilayer nickelates, in the limit of strong\ninter-layer spin coupling ($J_\\perp/t \\rightarrow +\\infty$) and a balancing\ninter-layer repulsion ($V$). Importantly, the double Kondo model does not\nfundamentally restrict $J_\\perp/t$, suggesting the potential for high critical\ntemperatures ($T_c$) approaching $0.5t$. While this idealized limit predicts\nlarge pairing gaps, we show a smooth connection to the more realistic regime\nwith $J_\\perp \\sim t$, albeit with a reduced pairing gap of approximately\n$0.1t$.

In quantum gravity, it has\nbeen suggested that conditional expectations may be used to implement the\nholographic map algebraically, with quantum error correction underlying the\nemergence of spacetime through the generalized entropy formula. However, the\nrequirements for exact error correction are almost certainly too strong for\nrealistic theories of quantum gravity. In this note, we present a relaxed\nnotion of quantum conditional expectation which implements approximate error\ncorrection. We introduce a generalization of Connes' spatial theory adapted to\ncompletely positive maps, and derive a chain rule allowing for the\nnon-commutative factorization of relative modular operators into a marginal and\nconditional part, constituting a quantum Bayes' law. This allows for an exact\nquantification of the information gap occurring in the data processing\ninequality for arbitrary quantum channels. When applied to algebraic\ninclusions, this also provides an approach to factorizing the entropy of states\ninto a sum of terms which, in the gravitational context, may be interpreted as\na generalized entropy. We illustrate that the emergent area operator is fully\nnon-commutative rather than central, except under the conditions of exact error\ncorrection. We provide some comments on how this result may be used to\nconstruct a fully algebraic quantum extremal surface prescription and to probe\nthe quantum nature of black holes.",

The blow-up time scale is independent of the spatial\nresolution and spectral basis but sensitive to the timestepping scheme and the\ntimestep size. The instability appears in multi-step and multi-stage\nimplicit-explicit (IMEX) timestepping schemes of different orders of accuracy\nand has been found to manifest in simulations of soliton solutions of the\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and traveling wave solutions of a nonlinear\ngeneralized Klein-Gordon equation. Focusing on the case of KdV solitons, we\nshow that modal predictions from linear stability theory are unable to explain\nthe instability because the spurious growth from linear dispersion is small and\nnonlinear sources of error growth converge too slowly in the limit of small\ntimestep size. We then develop a novel multi-scale asymptotic framework that\ncaptures the slow, nonlinear accumulation of timestepping errors. The framework\nallows the solution to vary with respect to multiple time scales related to the\ntimestep size and thus recovers the instability as a function of a slow time\nscale dictated by the order of accuracy of the timestepping scheme.

    "abstract": "We present the largest uniform study to date of Type IIn supernovae (SNe\nIIn), focusing in this first paper on the multi-band optical light curves of\n$487$ SNe IIn. The sample, constructed from multiple surveys, extends to $z\n\\approx 0.8$, with the majority of events at $z \\lesssim 0.3$. We construct\nuniform multi-band and bolometric light curves using Gaussian process\nregression, and determine key observed properties in the rest-frame (e.g., peak\nluminosity, timescales, radiated energy). We find that SNe IIn span broad\nranges in peak luminosity ($\\sim 10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and timescales\n($\\sim 20-300$ days above 50% of peak luminosity), but the sample divides into\ntwo clear groups in the luminosity-timescale phase-space around the median peak\nluminosity ($\\approx 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$): faint-fast and luminous-slow\ngroups. This leads to a strong bimodality in the radiated energy distribution,\nwith peaks at $\\sim 10^{49}$ and $\\sim 2\\times10^{50}$ erg, with the latter\nevents having a characteristic timescale of $\\sim 100$ days, and the former\nappearing to bifurcate into two branches with timescales of $\\sim 40$ and $\\sim\n70$ days. Therefore, SNe IIn exhibit at least two dominant groupings, and\nperhaps three, which are likely reflective of different progenitor and/or\ncircumstellar medium formation pathways. We do not find any obvious transition\nin SN IIn properties at the arbitrary cut-off of $\\approx -20$ mag used for the\ndesignation \"Type II Superluminous Supernovae\", and we argue that this\nclassification should be abandoned. The absence of SNe IIn with timescales of\n$\\lesssim 14$ days defines the region occupied by fast transients with evidence\nfor interaction with hydrogen-poor circumstellar medium.",

Cosmological simulations predict a linear relation between the infall\nlookback time and the logarithm of the binding energy, with a small scatter.\nGaia measurements of the bulk proper motions of globular clusters and dwarf\nsatellites of the Milky Way are sufficiently accurate to establish the kinetic\nenergies of these systems. Assuming the gravitational potential of the Milky\nWay, we can deduce the binding energies of the dwarf satellites and those of\nthe galaxies that were previously accreted by the Milky Way. This can be\ncompared to cosmological simulations for the first time. The relation of the\ninfall lookback time versus binding energy we found in a cosmological\nsimulation matches that for the early accretion events when the simulated total\nMilky Way mass within 21 kpc was rescaled to 2 $10^{11}$ solar masses. This\nagrees well with previous estimates from globular cluster kinematics and from\nthe rotation curve. However, the vast majority of the dwarf galaxies are clear\noutliers to this rescaled relation, unless they are very recent infallers. In\nother words, the very low binding energies of most dwarf galaxies compared to\nSgr and previous accreted galaxies suggests that most of them were accreted\nmuch later than 8 or even 5 Gyr ago. We also found that the subhalo systems in\nsome cosmological simulations are too dynamically hot when they are compared to\nidentified Milky Way substructures.

This relation has been studied\nfor decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant\ngalaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central\nblack holes in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only\nprovides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a\nBayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\\bullet-\\sigma$ relation across 244\ngalaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting\na central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting\nprobability with a linear regression of mass on $\\sigma$. From the logistic\nregression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of $11$, $34$ and\n$126$ km/s have a $50$%, $90$% and $99$% probability of hosting a central black\nhole, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the\nmodel, we find that $M_\\bullet \\propto \\sigma^{5.8}$, which is significantly\nsteeper than the slope reported in earlier studies. Our model also predicts a\npopulation of under-massive black holes ($M_\\bullet=10-10^5 M_\\odot$) in\ngalaxies with $\\sigma \\lesssim 127$ km/s and over-massive black holes\n($M_\\bullet \\geq 1.8 \\times 10^7$) above this threshold.

    "abstract": "The datasets used for Deep Neural Network training (e.g., ImageNet, MSCOCO,\netc.) are often manually balanced across categories (classes) to facilitate\nlearning of all the categories. This curation process is often expensive and\nrequires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across\nclasses. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet,\netc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often\nover-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for\nwell-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect\ndatasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models\nto be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing\nrobust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is\nnecessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural\nNetworks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real\nworld. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of\nlearning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on\nLearning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the\nmode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image\ngenerations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective\ngeneralization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which\nallow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit\ngeneration of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing\nRelevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed\ndata with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part,\nwhich focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various\ndomains with zero to very few labeled samples.",

In the last years, Magnetohydrondynamic (MHD)\nwind-driven accretion has been proposed as a valid alternative to the more\nconventional viscous accretion. In particular, winds have been shown to\nreproduce the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass\naccretion rate onto the central star Macc, but this has been done only for\nspecific conditions. It is not clear whether this implies fine tuning or if it\nis a general result. We investigate under which conditions the observed\ncorrelation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto\nthe central star Macc can be obtained. We find that, in the absence of a\ncorrelation between the initial mass M0 and the initial accretion timescale\ntacc,0, the slope of the Md-Macc correlation depends on the value of the spread\nof the initial conditions of masses and lifetimes of disks. Then, we clarify\nthe conditions under which a disk population can be fitted with a single\npower-law. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the spread of\nlog(Md/Macc) valid when the spread of tacc is taken to be constant. In the\npresence of a correlation between M0 and tacc,0, we derive an analytical\nexpression for the slope of the Md-Macc correlation in the initial conditions\nof disks and at late times. We conclude that MHD winds can predict the observed\nvalues of the slope and the spread of the Md-Macc correlation under a broad\nrange of initial conditions. This is a fundamental expansion of previous works\non the MHD paradigm, exploring the establishment of this fundamental\ncorrelation beyond specific initial conditions.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an algorithm to generate a 3D extruder path, combining\nclassic planar and non-planar layers to enhance the surface quality and\naccuracy of complex 3D printed parts. Material extrusion 3D printing, due to\nits layer-by-layer construction method, produces parts with a discretization\neffect commonly referred to as the \"staircase\" effect, particularly on\nnear-flat surfaces. The algorithm addresses this issue using a mixed-layer\napproach that uses 3D non-planar layers for the surfaces that would benefit\nfrom non-planar printing, and planar layers for the remaining regions. Existing\nstudies have demonstrated similar combined layer methods but are often limited\nin the variety and complexity of shapes they can process due to their inherent\nslicing techniques. This algorithm presents a universal approach to non-planar\nextruder path generation by identifying the non-planar surfaces and generating\nnon-planar extruder paths that conform to the object's surface. Subsequently,\nit identifies the space occupied by the non-planar layers and removes it from\nthe original mesh to produce a collision-free planar-only mesh, sliced using\nclassic planar methods. The algorithm was evaluated on objects of various\ncomplex shapes, comparing the results with outputs from standard planar\nslicers. The improvement in surface accuracy was also quantified by measuring\nthe Chamfer Distance. Specifically, it is shown that the algorithm can generate\nnon-planar extruder paths of complex geometries, improving surface quality.",

A particular\ninterest lies on keystroke dynamics (KD), which refers to the task of\nrecognizing individuals' identity based on their unique typing style. In this\nwork, we propose the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to recognize\nsuch patterns. Although PLMs have shown high performance on multiple NLP\nbenchmarks, the use of these models on specific tasks requires customization.\nBERT and RoBERTa, for instance, rely on subword tokenization, and they cannot\nbe directly applied to KD, which requires temporal-character information to\nrecognize users. Recent character-aware PLMs are able to process both subwords\nand character-level information and can be an alternative solution.\nNotwithstanding, they are still not suitable to be directly fine-tuned for KD\nas they are not optimized to account for user's temporal typing information\n(e.g., hold time and flight time). To overcome this limitation, we propose\nTempCharBERT, an architecture that incorporates temporal-character information\nin the embedding layer of CharBERT. This allows modeling keystroke dynamics for\nthe purpose of user identification and authentication. Our results show a\nsignificant improvement with this customization.

The selectors,\nmoved outside the transformer blocks, allow for the use of a variety of\narchitecture without further modifications. Furthermore, our proposed\narchitecture supports sparse node activation due to the logarithmic complexity\nof a tree search. We validate our idea by testing a series of decoder-only tree\ntransformers, achieving competitive results across a diverse range of language\ndatasets. Our study demonstrates that the proposed tree transformer model\noutperforms a size-equivalent linear transformer model 76\\% of the time over a\nwide range of tree architectures.

These devices operate similarly to\nmetal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms\nbetween the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike\ntraditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique\nspin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60\nmV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs\nfor low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative\ndifferential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current\nratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local\ngiant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications\nlike logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support\ncomputing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data\nprocessing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for\nthese multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to\nidentify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for\nsimulations.

Such correctness conditions are\nparticularly prominent in Internet of Things (IoT) and real-time systems\napplications, which interface with hardware devices that come with inherent\ntiming constraints. Verifying compliance of such systems with the intended\n\\emph{timed protocol} is challenged by their \\emph{heterogeneity} -- ruling out\nany verification method that relies on the system to be implemented in one\ncommon language, let alone in a high-level and typed programming language. To\naddress this challenge, this paper contributes a \\emph{logical relation} to\nverify that its inhabitants (the applications and hardware devices to be proved\ncorrect) comply with the given timed protocol. To cater to the systems'\nheterogeneity, the logical relation is entirely \\emph{semantic}, lifting the\nrequirement that its inhabitants are syntactically well-typed. A semantic\napproach enables two modes of use of the logical relation for program\nverification: (i) \\emph{once-and-for-all} verification of an \\emph{arbitrary}\nwell-typed application, given a type system, and (ii) \\emph{per-instance}\nverification of a specific application / hardware device (a.k.a. foreign code).\nTo facilitate mode (i), the paper develops a refinement type system for\nexpressing timed message-passing protocols and proves that any well-typed\nprogram inhabits the logical relation (fundamental theorem). A type checker for\nthe refinement type system has been implemented in Rust, using an SMT solver to\ncheck satisfiability of timing constraints. Then, the paper demonstrates both\nmodes of use based on a small case study of a smart home system for monitoring\nair quality, consisting of a controller application and various environment\nsensors.",

While this generative data expansion may suffice\nfor easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficult\ndiscriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID).\nCC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even when\nthey change their clothes across cameras. Not only are current CC-ReID models\nconstrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets,\nbut generating additional data that retains important personal features for\naccurate identification is a current challenge. To address this issue we\npropose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained\ndiffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse\nimages of individuals in varied attire. We generate additional data for five\nbenchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and\nincrease their clothing diversity by 10X, totaling over 2.1M images generated.\nDLCR employs diffusion-based text-guided inpainting, conditioned on clothing\nprompts constructed using LLMs, to generate synthetic data that only modifies a\nsubject's clothes while preserving their personally identifiable features. With\nthis massive increase in data, we introduce two novel strategies - progressive\nlearning and test-time prediction refinement - that respectively reduce\ntraining time and further boosts CC-ReID performance.

This interplay yields an intrinsic spin texture\nin the ground state, forming a linear chain of alternating skyrmions at the\nsaddle points. Our study analyzes the spin-mixing dynamics for both a freely\nevolving and a controlled longitudinal magnetization. The spin-1 system\nexhibits the Einstein-de Hass effect for the first case, for which an exchange\nbetween the total orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum is\nobserved, resulting in minimal oscillations about the initial position of the\nskyrmion chain. However, for the fixed magnetization dynamics, the skyrmion\nchain exhibits ample angular oscillations about the equilibrium position, with\nthe temporary formation of new skyrmions and anti-skyrmions to facilitate the\noscillatory motion. Keeping the magnetization constant, this contrast now stems\nfrom the exchange between the canonical and spin-dependent contribution to the\norbital angular momentum. The variation in canonical angular momentum is linked\nto the angular oscillations, while the spin-dependent angular momentum accounts\nfor the creation or annihilation of skyrmions. We confirm the presence of\nscissor mode excitations in the spin texture due to the angular skyrmion\noscillations.",

The modified risk\nmeasure is called the adjusted standard-deviatile. First, we derive the\nasymptotic expansions of the adjusted standard-deviatile. Next, based on the\nfirst-order asymptotic expansion, we propose two efficient estimation methods\nfor the adjusted standard-deviatile at intermediate and extreme levels.

By making use of power broadening in resonant laser excitation,\nwe explore the crossover between the inhomogeneous and the homogeneous\nbroadening regimes. With the support of numerical simulations, we show that the\nlineshape, count rate, second-order correlations and long-time photon\nstatistics evolve from a regime where they are dictated by spectral diffusion\nto a regime where they are simply given by the homogeneous response of the\nemitter, yielding restored Lorentzian shape and Poissonian photon statistics.\nSaturation of the count rate and line broadening occur not at the onset of the\nRabi oscillations, but when the power-broadened homogeneous response becomes\ncomparable with the inhomogeneous linewidth. Moreover, we identify specific\nsignatures in both the second-order correlations and long-time photon\nstatistics that are well explained by a microscopic spectral diffusion model\nbased on discrete jumps at timescales of micro- to milliseconds.

However, these methods remain far from\npractical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challenges\ncontributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills\ndue to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with\ndatasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the\napplication of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these\ndatasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio,\nlimiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, we\npresent \\omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different\nimage editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in\nfour folds: (1) \\omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven\ndifferent specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance\nsampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o)\ninstead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing\narchitecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we\nprovide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle\nany image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images of\ndifferent aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover different\ntasks. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluations demonstrate that\n\\omniedit can significantly outperform all the existing models.

The discussion is\nestablished in the framework of the $\\mu\\nu$SSM, where the presence of\n$R$-parity violating couplings involving right-handed neutrinos solves\nsimultaneously the $\\mu$-problem and the accommodation of neutrino masses and\nmixing angles. The squarks are pair produced and decay dominantly to a neutrino\nand a quark. They also have two sub-dominant three body decays to quark, Higgs\nand neutrino/charged lepton. The decays can be prompt or displaced, depending\non the regions of the parameter space of the model. We focus the analyses on\nright up-down-type squarks and left up-type squarks, since left down-type\nsquarks cannot be the LSP because of D-term contributions. We compare the\npredictions of these scenarios with ATLAS and CMS searches for prompt and\nlong-lived particles. To analyse the parameter space we sample the $\\mu\\nu$SSM\nfor a squark LSP, paying special attention to reproduce the current\nexperimental data on neutrino and Higgs physics, as well as flavour\nobservables. Because of the contribution of squark-squark final states to the\nproduction cross section, the results depend on the squark family. In\nparticular, for a right strange squark LSP, the lower limit on the mass is\n$1646$ GeV, corresponding to an upper limit on the decay length of $54.7$ mm,\nand for a right (left) scharm LSP, the limits are $1625$ ($1357$) GeV and\n$13.4$ ($1.9$) mm.

It seems appealing to\ngovern robots solely based on data, bypassing the traditional, more elaborate\npipeline of system modeling through first-principles and subsequent controller\ndesign. One promising data-driven approach is the Extended Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition (EDMD) for control-affine systems, a system class which contains\nmany vehicles and machines of immense practical importance including, e.g.,\ntypical wheeled mobile robots. EDMD can be highly data-efficient,\ncomputationally inexpensive, can deal with nonlinear dynamics as prevalent in\nrobotics and mechanics, and has a sound theoretical foundation rooted in\nKoopman theory. On this background, this present paper examines how EDMD models\ncan be integrated into predictive controllers for nonholonomic mobile robots.\nIn addition to the conventional kinematic mobile robot, we also cover the\ncomplete data-driven control pipeline - from data acquisition to control design\n- when the robot is not treated in terms of first-order kinematics but in a\nsecond-order manner, allowing to account for actuator dynamics. Using only\nreal-world measurement data, it is shown in both simulations and hardware\nexperiments that the surrogate models enable high-precision predictive\ncontrollers in the studied cases. However, the findings raise significant\nconcerns about purely data-centric approaches that overlook the underlying\ngeometry of nonholonomic systems, showing that, for nonholonomic systems, some\ngeometric insight seems necessary and cannot be easily compensated for with\nlarge amounts of data.",

LLMs contain billions of parameters, so these small\nfractions, such as 0.01%, translate to hundreds of thousands of parameters. In\nthis work, we present an even more surprising finding: Pruning as few as a\nsingle parameter can destroy an LLM's ability to generate text -- increasing\nperplexity by 3 orders of magnitude and reducing zero-shot accuracy to\nguessing. We propose a data-free method for identifying such parameters, termed\nsuper weights, using a single forward pass through the model. We additionally\nfind that these super weights induce correspondingly rare and large activation\noutliers, termed super activations. When preserved with high precision, super\nactivations can improve simple round-to-nearest quantization to become\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art methods. For weight quantization, we\nsimilarly find that by preserving the super weight and clipping other weight\noutliers, round-to-nearest quantization can scale to much larger block sizes\nthan previously considered.

    "abstract": "Scale invariance is a key feature that characterizes criticality in complex\ndynamical systems, which often organize into structures exhibiting no typical\nsize and/or lifespan. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic\ninteractions are typically required for showcasing such criticality, the\nquestion of whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely\ndeterministic interactions remains unclear. In this work, we discover highly\naffirmative signatures of critical dynamics in equal-state clusters that emerge\nin the \\textit{logistic} Game of life (GOL): an extension of Conway's GOL into\na Cantor set state space that is nevertheless deterministic. We uncover at\nleast three types of asymptotic behavior, i.e. phases, that are separated by\ntwo fundamentally distinct critical points. The first critical point --\nassociated with a peculiar form of self-organized criticality -- defines the\nnon-analytic boundary between a sparse-static and a sparse-dynamic asymptotic\nphase. Meanwhile, the second point marks an enigmatic deterministic percolation\ntransition between the sparse-dynamic and a third, dense-dynamic phase.\nMoreover, we identify distinct power-law distributions of cluster sizes with\nunconventional critical exponents that challenge the current paradigms for\ncritical behavior. Overall, our work concretely paves the way for studying\nemergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.",

Recent methods harness the powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) for\n2D-to-3D knowledge distillation, achieving zero-shot 3D part segmentation.\nHowever, these methods are limited by their reliance on text prompts, which\nrestricts the scalability to large-scale unlabeled datasets and the flexibility\nin handling part ambiguities. In this work, we introduce SAMPart3D, a scalable\nzero-shot 3D part segmentation framework that segments any 3D object into\nsemantic parts at multiple granularities, without requiring predefined part\nlabel sets as text prompts. For scalability, we use text-agnostic vision\nfoundation models to distill a 3D feature extraction backbone, allowing scaling\nto large unlabeled 3D datasets to learn rich 3D priors. For flexibility, we\ndistill scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features for 3D part segmentation at\nmultiple granularities. Once the segmented parts are obtained from the\nscale-conditioned part-aware 3D features, we use VLMs to assign semantic labels\nto each part based on the multi-view renderings.

Additionally, we contribute a new 3D\npart segmentation benchmark to address the lack of diversity and complexity of\nobjects and parts in existing benchmarks.

Recent advances in\nbipedal and quadrupedal robots demonstrate good mobility on rugged terrains but\nrely heavily on sensors for stability due to low static stability from a high\ncenter of mass and a narrow base of support. We hypothesize that a multi-legged\nrobotic system can leverage morphological redundancy from additional legs to\nminimize sensing requirements when traversing challenging terrains. Studies\nsuggest that a multi-legged system with sufficient legs can reliably navigate\nnoisy landscapes without sensing and control, albeit at a low speed of up to\n0.1 body lengths per cycle (BLC). However, the control framework to enhance\nspeed on challenging terrains remains underexplored due to the complex\nenvironmental interactions, making it difficult to identify the key parameters\nto control in these high-degree-of-freedom systems. Here, we present a\nbio-inspired vertical body undulation wave as a novel approach to mitigate\nenvironmental disturbances affecting robot speed, supported by experiments and\nprobabilistic models. Finally, we introduce a control framework which monitors\nfoot-ground contact patterns on rugose landscapes using binary foot-ground\ncontact sensors to estimate terrain rugosity. The controller adjusts the\nvertical body wave based on the deviation of the limb's averaged\nactual-to-ideal foot-ground contact ratio, achieving a significant enhancement\nof up to 0.235 BLC on rugose laboratory terrain. We observed a $\\sim$ 50\\%\nincrease in speed and a $\\sim$ 40\\% reduction in speed variance compared to the\nopen-loop controller.

In the particular case of heterogeneously distributed CIFAR-10 dataset,\nFENS achieves up to a 26.9% higher accuracy over state-of-the-art (SOTA) OFL,\nbeing only 3.1% lower than FL.

To understand the impact of interventions\nprecisely, it is useful to examine \\emph{counterfactuals} -- e.g., how a given\nsentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a\nspecific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is\nconceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal\nhierarchy.

This reformulation allows us to model the joint\ndistribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the\nsame instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on\nhindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables\nand generate counterfactuals of observed strings.

We develop\nTransformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, including\ndecoder-only models at various scales for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion\nmodels for image generation. Experiments show that models using Cog Attention\nexhibit superior performance compared to those employing traditional softmax\nattention modules. Our approach suggests a promising research direction for\nrethinking and breaking the entrenched constraints of traditional softmax\nattention, such as the requirement for non-negative weights.",

    "abstract": "As new knowledge rapidly accumulates, language models (LMs) with pretrained\nknowledge quickly become obsolete. A common approach to updating LMs is\nfine-tuning them directly on new knowledge. However, recent studies have shown\nthat fine-tuning for memorization may be ineffective in storing knowledge or\nmay exacerbate hallucinations. In this work, we introduce a setting we call\ncontinual memorization, where a model must memorize and retain a set of\nfactoids through multiple stages of fine-tuning on subsequent datasets. We\ncharacterized the forgetting patterns through extensive experiments and show\nthat LMs widely suffer from forgetting, especially when needing to memorize\nfactoids in the second stage. We posit that forgetting can be alleviated by\nmodifying training dynamics: (1) protecting the memorization process when\nlearning factoids or (2) reducing interference from subsequent training stages.\nIntriguingly, we find that mixing randomly generated word sequences or generic\ndata sampled from pretraining corpora at different training stages effectively\nmitigates forgetting REMIX: Random and Generic Data Mixing). REMIX can recover\nperformance from severe forgetting, outperforming replay methods and other\ncontinual learning baselines. We analyze how REMIX influences the learning\nprocess and find that robust memorization follows a distinct pattern: the model\nstores factoids in earlier layers than usual and diversifies the layers that\nretain them, which results in easier recall and manipulate of the learned\nfactoids.",

    "abstract": "Axions are a well-motivated candidate for dark matter. The preeminent method\nto search for axion dark matter is known as the axion haloscope, which makes\nuse of the conversion of axions to photons in a large magnetic field. Due to\nthe weak coupling of axions to photons however, the expected signal strength is\nexceptionally small. To increase signal strength, many haloscopes make use of\nresonant enhancement and high gain amplifiers, while also taking measures to\nkeep receiver noise as low as possible such as the use of dilution\nrefrigerators and ultra low-noise electronics. In this paper we derive the\ntheoretical noise model based on the sources of noise found within a typical\naxion haloscope receiver chain, using the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX)\nas a case study. We present examples of different noise calibration\nmeasurements at 1280~MHz taken during ADMX's most recent data-taking run. These\nnew results shed light on a previously unidentified interaction between the\ncavity and JPA, as well as provide a better understanding of the systematic\nuncertainty on the system noise temperature used in the axion search analysis\nfor this data-taking run. Finally, the consistency between the measurements and\nthe detailed model provide suggestions for future improvements within ADMX and\nother axion haloscopes to reach a lower noise temperature.",

The effective nucleon interactions in the\nisoscalar-scalar, isoscalar-vector, and isovector-vector channels are\nconsidered, where the corresponding coupling constants ($\\alpha_S, \\alpha_V,\n\\alpha_{TV}$) are fixed by dividing entire density range into three regions\nwith six independent parameters. In this work we focus on constraining the\ndensity-dependent point-coupling constants at supranuclear densities, while the\ncoupling constants at subsaturation densities are derived from the covariant\ndensity functional DD-ME2. For those consistent with astrophysical\nobservations, the coupling constants generally decrease with density and\napproach to small positive values at large enough densities, which\nqualitatively agrees with various RMF models. The posterior probability density\nfunctions and their correlations of the coupling constants and various nuclear\nmatter properties are examined as well. At $1\\sigma$ level, the constrained\ncoupling constants at density $1.5n_0$ ($2.5n_0$) are $\\alpha_S =\n3.1^{+0.1}_{-0.05} (1.55^{+0.85}_{-0.2}) \\times 10^{-4} \\mathrm{MeV}^{-2}$,\n$\\alpha_V = 2.3^{+0.1}_{-0.0} (1.3^{+0.55}_{-0.1}) \\times 10^{-4}\n\\mathrm{MeV}^{-2}$, and $\\alpha_{TV} = 2.05^{+0}_{-0.4}\n(2.05^{+0}_{-0.5})\\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{MeV}^{-2}$.

    "abstract": "The recent detection of extended $\\gamma$-ray emission around middle-aged\npulsars is interpreted as inverse-Compton scattering of ambient photons by\nelectron-positron pairs escaping the pulsar wind nebula, which are confined\nnear the system by unclear mechanisms. This emerging population of $\\gamma$-ray\nsources was first discovered at TeV energies and remains underexplored in the\nGeV range. To address this, we conducted a systematic search for extended\nsources along the Galactic plane using 14 years of Fermi-LAT data above 10 GeV,\naiming to identify a number of pulsar halo candidates and extend our view to\nlower energies. The search covered the inner Galactic plane ($\\lvert\nl\\rvert\\leq$ 100$^{\\circ}$, $\\lvert b\\rvert\\leq$ 1$^{\\circ}$) and the positions\nof known TeV sources and bright pulsars, yielding broader astrophysical\ninterest. We found 40 such sources, forming the Second Fermi Galactic Extended\nSources Catalog (2FGES), most with 68% containment radii smaller than\n1.0$^{\\circ}$ and relatively hard spectra with photon indices below 2.5. We\nassessed detection robustness using field-specific alternative interstellar\nemission models and by inspecting significance maps. Noting 13 sources\npreviously known as extended in the 4FGL-DR3 catalog and five dubious sources\nfrom complex regions, we report 22 newly detected extended sources above 10\nGeV. Of these, 13 coincide with H.E.S.S., HAWC, or LHAASO sources; six coincide\nwith bright pulsars (including four also coincident with TeV sources); six are\nassociated with 4FGL point sources only; and one has no association in the\nscanned catalogs. Notably, six to eight sources may be related to pulsars as\nclassical pulsar wind nebulae or pulsar halos.",

Our approach utilizes a\nunique coupling architecture in which, the qubit first interacts with a filter\nresonator before coupling to the readout resonator. This configuration enables\nprecise control over the Purcell decay rate and ac Stark factor without\nimpacting on measuring time. The mentioned factor is highly sensitive to the\ncoupling strength between the readout resonator and the filter, meaning that\nthe factor adjustment directly impacts the qubit state detection. A major\nadvantage of this design is that tuning the resonator-filter coupling strength\nis relatively straightforward, offering flexibility in fine-tuning ac Stark\nfactor. This work extensively analyzes the system using full quantum mechanical\ntheory, deriving the total Hamiltonian and investigates mode dynamics via\nquantum Langevin equations. Key parameters influencing the nonclassicality of\noutput signals are also explored through quantum correlation metrics, including\nsymplectic eigenvalues, quantum discord, and classical discord. The main goal\nis to find any compromises exsting between the ac Stark factor increasing and\nthe quantum correlation created in the readout circuit. By optimizing the\ncritical factors, by which the ac Stark factor mainly affected, the proposed\ndesign not only improves the distinguishability of the qubit states but also\nensures robust nonclassicality in the output signals.

To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a sparse sampling of the parameter domain, followed by a\nlow-rank tensor completion. The resulting specialized tensor completion problem\nis formulated for a tensor of order $C + D$, where $C$ fully sampled modes\ncorrespond to the snapshot degrees of freedom, and $D$ partially sampled modes\ncorrespond to the system's parameters. To address this non-standard tensor\ncompletion problem, we introduce a low-rank tensor format called the hybrid\ntensor train.

This approach derives the gravitational partition\nfunction by incorporating non-saddle geometries besides the classical\nsolutions. Unlike the sharp transition points seen in free energy calculated\nvia saddle-point approximation, the ensemble-averaged free energy plotted\nagainst temperature shows a smoother behavior, suggesting that black hole phase\ntransitions may be viewed as a small $G_N$ (Newton's gravitational constant)\nlimit of the ensemble theory. This is similar to the behavior of black hole\nsolutions in Einstein's gravity theory in AdS spacetime. We have obtained an\nexpression for the quantum-corrected free energy for EGB-AdS black holes, and\nin the six-dimensional case, we observe a well-defined local minimum after the\ntransition temperature which was absent in the earlier analysis of the\nclassical free energy landscape. Furthermore, we expand the ensemble-averaged\nfree energy in powers of $G_N$ to identify non-classical contributions. Our\nfindings indicate that the similarities in the thermodynamic behavior between\nfive-dimensional EGB-AdS and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-AdS (RN-AdS) black holes, as\nwell as between six-dimensional EGB-AdS and Schwarzschild-AdS black holes,\nextend beyond the classical regime.",

Another essential element of epithelia is curvature, which\nis required to achieve complex shapes, like in the lung or intestine. Here we\nintroduce a three-dimensional bubbly vertex model to study the interplay\nbetween extrusion and curvature. We find a generic cellular bulging instability\nat topological defects which is much stronger than for standard vertex models.\nTo clarify the underlying mechanism, we analytically calculate the energy\nlandscape for a single bulging cell in a mean field tissue. We find that\nextrusion is energetically preferred at topological defects due to a\nredistribution of Gaussian curvature into the defect. We show that it can be\ndriven both by a decrease in apico-basal tension or by contractile line\ntensions. We also show that extrusion can be suppressed by luminal pressure and\ninterfacial bending rigidity, allowing for additional control of this important\nprocess. Our theory suggests that epithelial curvature naturally leads to cell\nbulging and extrusion because the interfacial curvature of individual cells at\nthe defects strongly amplifies buckling effected by tissue-scale topological\ndefects in elastic sheets.",

Depending on the materials, traps can be defect-like single\nmolecules or clusters of several neighboring ones, and can have a significant\nimpact on the dynamics of charge carriers. Our proposed method builds on the\nrandom walk model of charge dynamics on a directed, weighted graph, the\nmolecular transport network. It comprises an effective heuristic to determine\nthe number of traps or trap clusters based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors\nof the random walk Laplacian matrix and uses subsequent spectral clustering\ntechniques to identify these traps. In contrast to currently available methods,\nours enables identification of trap molecules in organic semiconductors without\nhaving to explicitly simulate the charge dynamics and is applicable to a\nvariety of energy- or topology-based traps in homomolecular or mixed systems\nwith or without detailed-balance. As a prototypical system we simulate an\namorphous morphology of bathocuproine, a material with known high energetic\ndisorder and charge trapping. Based on a first-principle multiscale model, we\nfirst obtain a reference charge transport network and then purposefully modify\nits properties to represent different trap characteristics.

The constraint can be modelled in two\ndifferent ways: either both players share the same Poisson process (the common\nconstraint) or each player has her own Poisson process (the independent\nconstraint). In the Markovian case where the payoff is given by a pair of\nfunctions of an underlying diffusion, we give sufficient conditions under which\nthe solution of the game (the value function, and the optimal stopping sets for\neach player) under the common (respectively, independent) constraint is also\nthe solution of the game under the independent (respectively, common)\nconstraint. Roughly speaking, if the stopping sets of the maximiser and\nminimiser in the game under the common constraint are disjoint, then the\nsolution to the game is the same under both the common and the independent\nconstraint. However, the fact that the stopping sets are disjoint in the game\nunder the independent constraint, is not sufficient to guarantee that the\nsolution of the game under the independent constraint is also the solution\nunder the common constraint.",

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning has been widely adopted to ensure large language models\n(LLMs) follow user instructions effectively. The resulting\ninstruction-following capabilities of LLMs heavily rely on the instruction\ndatasets used for tuning. Recently, synthetic instruction datasets have emerged\nas an economically viable solution to provide LLMs diverse and high-quality\ninstructions. However, existing approaches typically assume that larger or\nstronger models are stronger teachers for instruction tuning, and hence simply\nadopt these models as response generators to the synthetic instructions. In\nthis paper, we challenge this commonly-adopted assumption. Our extensive\nexperiments across five base models and twenty response generators reveal that\nlarger and stronger models are not necessarily stronger teachers of smaller\nmodels. We refer to this phenomenon as the Larger Models' Paradox. We observe\nthat existing metrics cannot precisely predict the effectiveness of response\ngenerators since they ignore the compatibility between teachers and base models\nbeing fine-tuned. We thus develop a novel metric, named as\nCompatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) to measure the effectiveness of response\ngenerators. Our experiments across five base models demonstrate that CAR\noutperforms almost all baselines.",

    "abstract": "Although text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit remarkable generation\ncapabilities, they frequently fail to accurately bind semantically related\nobjects or attributes in the input prompts; a challenge termed semantic\nbinding. Previous approaches either involve intensive fine-tuning of the entire\nT2I model or require users or large language models to specify generation\nlayouts, adding complexity. In this paper, we define semantic binding as the\ntask of associating a given object with its attribute, termed attribute\nbinding, or linking it to other related sub-objects, referred to as object\nbinding. We introduce a novel method called Token Merging (ToMe), which\nenhances semantic binding by aggregating relevant tokens into a single\ncomposite token. This ensures that the object, its attributes and sub-objects\nall share the same cross-attention map. Additionally, to address potential\nconfusion among main objects with complex textual prompts, we propose end token\nsubstitution as a complementary strategy. To further refine our approach in the\ninitial stages of T2I generation, where layouts are determined, we incorporate\ntwo auxiliary losses, an entropy loss and a semantic binding loss, to\niteratively update the composite token to improve the generation integrity. We\nconducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of ToMe,\ncomparing it against various existing methods on the T2I-CompBench and our\nproposed GPT-4o object binding benchmark. Our method is particularly effective\nin complex scenarios that involve multiple objects and attributes, which\nprevious methods often fail to address.

    "abstract": "Azurin and its derived peptides, notably p28, exhibit significant anticancer\nproperties, primarily by stabilizing the tumor suppressor protein p53 and\npreventing its degradation. Previous studies have shown that p28 binds to p53's\nDNA-binding domain, protecting it from degradation mechanisms. Expanding on\nthese findings, our research explored whether p28 acts on additional cancer\npathways beyond p53 stabilization. Specifically, we examined the interactions\nbetween p28 and Human Double Minute 2 (HDM2), a protein that downregulates\np53's tumor-suppressive activity by binding to its transactivation domain\n(TAD). HDM2 is crucial in diminishing p53's function, and our study aimed to\ndetermine if p28 disrupts this HDM2-p53 interaction. Using HADDOCK docking and\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we identified three stable conformations of the\nHDM2-p28 complex. These conformations effectively block HDM2's hydrophobic\npocket, allowing for sustained inter-chain interactions and showing favorable\nbinding energies. Further analysis pinpointed essential residues in these\ninteractions, and we calculated interaction energies using the Molecular\nMechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) method. Our findings reveal\nthat by blocking HDM2's binding sites, p28 helps maintain p53's transcriptional\nactivity, thus enhancing its tumor-suppressive functions, including apoptosis\nand cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. This study enhances understanding of\nazurin-derived peptides' anticancer mechanisms and highlights p28's potential\nas a peptide-based anticancer agent. These findings also suggest the\npossibility of designing additional peptide therapies targeting HDM2 and other\ncancer-related pathways, opening new directions in anticancer therapeutics.",

Over\nthe past three decades, advancements in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nand machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to\nbrain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has\nexpanded into decoding more complex processes like language and memory across\nthe whole brain, utilizing techniques to handle greater variability and improve\nsignal accuracy. We argue that \"seeing\" involves more than just mapping visual\nstimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various\nemotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In\nthis paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual\nprocesses by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are\nexposed to visual stimuli. We utilize large-scale fMRI encoders and Image\ngenerative models pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then\nfine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models hence can decode\nvisual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional\nconfines of the visual cortex. We first compare our method with\nstate-of-the-art approaches to decoding visual processing and show improved\npredictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests that\nbeyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes most to decoding\nstimuli, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making and\nsemantic processing.

Using unbiased\nfinite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond mean-field\napproaches to determine the ground state order parameter as a function of RSOC\nand phonon frequency. Our results reveal that the Rashba metal is unstable due\nto particle-hole instabilities, favoring the emergence of a CDW phase for any\nRSOC value. In the limit of a pure Rashba hopping, the model exhibits a\ndistinct behavior with the appearance of four Weyl cones at half-filling, where\nquantum phase transitions are expected to occur at strong interactions. Indeed,\na quantum phase transition, belonging to the Gross-Neveu Ising universality\nclass between a semi-metal and CDW emerges at finite phonon frequency dependent\ncoupling $\\lambda_c$. In the antiadiabatic limit we observe an enhance symmetry\nin the IR that unifies SC and CDW orders.

    "abstract": "Transformer models have demonstrated remarkable success in many domains such\nas natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. With the growing\ninterest in transformer-based architectures, they are now utilized for gesture\nrecognition. So, we also explore and devise a novel ConvMixFormer architecture\nfor dynamic hand gestures. The transformers use quadratic scaling of the\nattention features with the sequential data, due to which these models are\ncomputationally complex and heavy. We have considered this drawback of the\ntransformer and designed a resource-efficient model that replaces the\nself-attention in the transformer with the simple convolutional layer-based\ntoken mixer. The computational cost and the parameters used for the\nconvolution-based mixer are comparatively less than the quadratic\nself-attention. Convolution-mixer helps the model capture the local spatial\nfeatures that self-attention struggles to capture due to their sequential\nprocessing nature. Further, an efficient gate mechanism is employed instead of\na conventional feed-forward network in the transformer to help the model\ncontrol the flow of features within different stages of the proposed model.\nThis design uses fewer learnable parameters which is nearly half the vanilla\ntransformer that helps in fast and efficient training. The proposed method is\nevaluated on NVidia Dynamic Hand Gesture and Briareo datasets and our model has\nachieved state-of-the-art results on single and multimodal inputs. We have also\nshown the parameter efficiency of the proposed ConvMixFormer model compared to\nother methods. The source code is available at\nhttps://github.com/mallikagarg/ConvMixFormer.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in code\ngeneration recently, offering programmers revolutionary assistance in software\ndevelopment. However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, they are\nsusceptible to error accumulation during code generation. Once an error is\nproduced, LLMs can merely continue to generate the subsequent code conditioned\non it, given their inability to adjust previous outputs. Existing LLM-based\napproaches typically consider post-revising after code generation, leading to\nthe challenging resolution of accumulated errors and the significant wastage of\nresources. Ideally, LLMs should rollback and resolve the occurred error in time\nduring code generation, rather than proceed on the basis of the error and wait\nfor post-revising after generation. In this paper, we propose ROCODE, which\nintegrates the backtracking mechanism and program analysis into LLMs for code\ngeneration. Specifically, we employ program analysis to perform incremental\nerror detection during the generation process. When an error is detected, the\nbacktracking mechanism is triggered to priming rollback strategies and\nconstraint regeneration, thereby eliminating the error early and ensuring\ncontinued generation on the correct basis. Experiments on multiple code\ngeneration benchmarks show that ROCODE can significantly reduce the errors\ngenerated by LLMs, with a compilation pass rate of 99.1%. The test pass rate is\nimproved by up to 23.8% compared to the best baseline approach. Compared to the\npost-revising baseline, the token cost is reduced by 19.3%. Moreover, our\napproach is model-agnostic and achieves consistent improvements across nine\nrepresentative LLMs.",

The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to\nrecognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it\nbelongs to a language. On the other hand, it is common instead to evaluate\nlanguage models on proxy tasks, e.g., language modeling or sequence-to-sequence\ntransduction, that are similar in only an informal sense to the underlying\ntheory. We correct this mismatch by training and evaluating neural networks\ndirectly as binary classifiers of strings, using a general method that can be\napplied to a wide variety of languages. As part of this, we extend an algorithm\nrecently proposed by Sn{\\ae}bjarnarson et al. (2025) for efficient\nlength-controlled sampling of strings from regular languages. We provide\nresults on a variety of languages across the Chomsky hierarchy for three neural\narchitectures: a simple RNN, an LSTM, and a causally-masked transformer. We\nfind that the RNN and LSTM often outperform the transformer, and that auxiliary\ntraining objectives such as language modeling can help, although no single\nobjective uniformly improves performance across languages and architectures.\nOur contributions will facilitate theoretically sound empirical testing of\nlanguage recognition claims in future work.

    "abstract": "Model reduction is a key technology for large-scale physical systems in\nscience and engineering, as it brings behavior expressed in many degrees of\nfreedom to a more manageable size that subsequently allows control,\noptimization, and analysis with multi-query algorithms. We introduce an\nenhanced regression technique tailored to uncover quadratic parametric\nreduced-order dynamical systems from data. Our method, termed Improved Greedy\nIdentification of Latent Dynamics (I-GILD), refines the learning phase of the\noriginal GILD approach. This refinement is achieved by reorganizing the\nquadratic model coefficients, allowing the minimum-residual problem to be\nreformulated using the Frobenius norm. Consequently, the optimality conditions\nlead to a generalized Sylvester equation, which is efficiently solved using the\nconjugate gradient method. Analysis of the convergence shows that I-GILD\nachieves superior convergence for quadratic model coefficients compared to\nGILD's steepest gradient descent, reducing both computational complexity and\niteration count. Additionally, we derive an error bound for the model\npredictions, offering insights into error growth in time and ensuring\ncontrolled accuracy as long as the magnitudes of initial error is small and\nlearning residuals are well minimized. The efficacy of I-GILD is demonstrated\nthrough its application to numerical and experimental tests, specifically the\nflow past Ahmed body with a variable rear slant angle, and the lid-driven\ncylindrical cavity problem with variable Reynolds numbers, utilizing\nparticle-image velocimetry (PIV) data. These tests confirm I-GILD's ability to\ntreat real-world dynamical system challenges and produce effective\nreduced-order models.",

However, these tools often focus on\nindividual test elements in isolation (e.g., APIs, parameters, values),\nresulting in lower coverage and less effectiveness in fault detection. To\naddress these limitations, we present AutoRestTest, the first black-box tool to\nadopt a dependency-embedded multi-agent approach for REST API testing that\nintegrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with a semantic property\ndependency graph (SPDG) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach treats\nREST API testing as a separable problem, where four agents -- API, dependency,\nparameter, and value agents -- collaborate to optimize API exploration. LLMs\nhandle domain-specific value generation, the SPDG model simplifies the search\nspace for dependencies using a similarity score between API operations, and\nMARL dynamically optimizes the agents' behavior. Our evaluation of AutoRestTest\non 12 real-world REST services shows that it outperforms the four leading\nblack-box REST API testing tools, including those assisted by RESTGPT (which\ngenerates realistic test inputs using LLMs), in terms of code coverage,\noperation coverage, and fault detection.

    "abstract": "The block classical Gram--Schmidt (BCGS) algorithm and its reorthogonalized\nvariant are widely-used methods for computing the economic QR factorization of\nblock columns $X$ due to their lower communication cost compared to other\napproaches such as modified Gram--Schmidt and Householder QR. To further reduce\ncommunication, i.e., synchronization, there has been a long ongoing search for\na variant of reorthogonalized BCGS variant that achieves $O(u)$ loss of\northogonality while requiring only \\emph{one} synchronization point per block\ncolumn, where $u$ represents the unit roundoff. Utilizing Pythagorean inner\nproducts and delayed normalization techniques, we propose the first provably\nstable one-synchronization reorthogonalized BCGS variant, demonstrating that it\nhas $O(u)$ loss of orthogonality under the condition $O(u) \\kappa^2(X) \\leq\n1/2$, where $\\kappa(\\cdot)$ represents the condition number.\n  By incorporating one additional synchronization point, we develop a\ntwo-synchronization reorthogonalized BCGS variant which maintains $O(u)$ loss\nof orthogonality under the improved condition $O(u) \\kappa(X) \\leq 1/2$. An\nadaptive strategy is then proposed to combine these two variants, ensuring\n$O(u)$ loss of orthogonality while using as few synchronization points as\npossible under the less restrictive condition $O(u) \\kappa(X) \\leq 1/2$. As an\nexample of where this adaptive approach is beneficial, we show that using the\nadaptive orthogonalization variant, $s$-step GMRES achieves a backward error\ncomparable to $s$-step GMRES with BCGSI+, also known as BCGS2, both\ntheoretically and numerically, but requires fewer synchronization points.",

To address these, we figure out audio-visual character\nidentification, matching character names to each dialogue, as a key factor. We\npropose StoryTeller, a system for generating dense descriptions of long videos,\nincorporating both low-level visual concepts and high-level plot information.\nStoryTeller uses a multimodal large language model that integrates visual,\naudio, and text modalities to perform audio-visual character identification on\nminute-long video clips. The results are then fed into a LVLM to enhance\nconsistency of video description. We validate our approach on movie description\ntasks and introduce MovieStory101, a dataset with dense descriptions for\nthree-minute movie clips. To evaluate long video descriptions, we create\nStoryQA, a large set of multiple-choice questions for MovieStory101 test set.\nWe assess descriptions by inputting them into GPT-4 to answer these questions,\nusing accuracy as an automatic evaluation metric.

We use the ATON\nstellar evolution code to calculate theoretical values of convective turnover\ntimes ($\\tau_{\\rm c}$) and Rossby numbers ($Ro$, the ratio between rotation\nperiods and $\\tau_{\\rm c}$) for pre-main sequence (pre-MS) and main sequence\n(MS) stars. We investigate how $\\tau_{\\rm c}$ varies with the initial rotation\nperiod and with the disk lifetime, using angular momentum conserving models and\nmodels simulating the disk-locking mechanism. In the latter case, the angular\nvelocity is kept constant, during a given locking time, to mimic the magnetic\nlocking effects of a circumstellar disk. The local convective turnover times\ngenerated with disk-locking models are shorter than those obtained with angular\nmomentum conserving models. The differences are smaller in the early pre-MS,\nincrease with stellar age and become more accentuated for stars with\n$M$$\\geq$$1 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ and ages greater than 100 Myr. Our new values of\n$\\tau_{\\rm c}$ were used to estimate $Ro$ for a sample of stars selected from\nthe literature in order to investigate the rotation-activity relationship.

    "abstract": "In a multi-field/fluid cosmological system consisting of a number of\nminimally coupled canonical scalar fields, non-canonical scalar fields and\nbarotropic perfect fluids, we introduce a new definition of effective speed of\nsound of the entire system for describing the evolution of cosmological\nperturbations. This effective speed of sound is not just gauge invariant but\nalso a background dependent quantity and therefore can be treated as a\nparameter to quantify perturbations in such multi-field/fluid systems. It is\nwith this effective speed that the gauge invariant Bardeen potential and the\ncurvature perturbation propagate at scales much smaller than the sound horizon.\nFurther, the effective speed of sound defined in this paper generalizes the one\ndefined by Garriga and Mukhanov for a single non-canonical scalar field to a\nsystem consisting of many minimally coupled barotropic perfect fluids,\ncanonical and non-canonical scalar fields. Moreover, just like in the case of a\nsingle pure-kinetic non-canonical scalar field, this effective speed of the\nsound of the total system turns out to be identically equal to the total\nadiabatic speed of sound when the dynamic of the universe is driven by a number\nof pure kinetic non-canonical scalar fields making such a system tantamount to\na system of equivalent multi barotropic perfect fluids. We also derive a set of\nequations which governs the evolution of perturbations in a general\nmulti-field/fluid universe containing barotropic perfect fluids, canonical and\nnon-canonical scalar fields. Using these equations we show that, in the large\nscale limit ($k = 0$ scales), if the perturbations are initially adiabatic,\nthen it continues to remain so at that scales throughout the evolution of the\nuniverse. Consequently, at that scales, such multi-field/fluid universe\ndynamically behaves as if it contains only a single barotropic perfect fluid.",

The\nprocesses are generally reciprocal, as demonstrated by comparable efficiencies\nwhen reversing injector and detector roles. However, introducing Ru, which\nenables the orbital Hall effect (OHE), disrupts this reciprocity.

    "abstract": "In our work, we consider the problem of computing a vector $x \\in Z^n$ of\nminimum $\\|\\cdot\\|_p$-norm such that $a^\\top x \\not= a_0$, for any vector\n$(a,a_0)$ from a given subset of $Z^n$ of size $m$. In other words, we search\nfor a vector of minimum norm that avoids a given finite set of hyperplanes,\nwhich is natural to call as the $\\textit{Hyperplanes Avoiding Problem}$. This\nproblem naturally appears as a subproblem in Barvinok-type algorithms for\ncounting integer points in polyhedra. We show that:\n  1) With respect to $\\|\\cdot\\|_1$, the problem admits a feasible solution $x$\nwith $\\|x\\|_1 \\leq (m+n)/2$, and show that such solution can be constructed by\na deterministic polynomial-time algorithm with $O(n \\cdot m)$ operations.\nMoreover, this inequality is the best possible. This is a significant\nimprovement over the previous randomized algorithm, which computes $x$ with a\nguaranty $\\|x\\|_{1} \\leq n \\cdot m$. The original approach of A.~Barvinok can\nguarantee only $\\|x\\|_1 = O\\bigl((n \\cdot m)^n\\bigr)$. To prove this result, we\nuse a newly established algorithmic variant of the Combinatorial\nNullstellensatz;\n  2) The problem is NP-hard with respect to any norm $\\|\\cdot\\|_p$, for $p \\in\n\\bigl(R_{\\geq 1} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}\\bigr)$.\n  3) As an application, we show that the problem to count integer points in a\npolytope $P = \\{x \\in R^n \\colon A x \\leq b\\}$, for given $A \\in Z^{m \\times\nn}$ and $b \\in Q^m$, can be solved by an algorithm with $O\\bigl(\\nu^2 \\cdot n^3\n\\cdot \\Delta^3 \\bigr)$ operations, where $\\nu$ is the maximum size of a normal\nfan triangulation of $P$, and $\\Delta$ is the maximum value of rank-order\nsubdeterminants of $A$. As a further application, it provides a refined\ncomplexity bound for the counting problem in polyhedra of bounded codimension.\nFor example, in the polyhedra of the Unbounded Subset-Sum problem.",

A\nchallenge with this approach is that the ability changes as the student learns,\nwhich makes traditional item response theory (IRT) models inappropriate. Most\nIRT models estimate an ability based on a test result, and assume that the\nability is constant throughout a test.\n  We review some existing methods for measuring abilities that change\nthroughout the measurement period, and propose a new method which we call the\nElo-informed growth model.

Furthermore, this trend appears to persist beyond the\nleading large-$N_c$ approximation, provided that the infrared dynamics of QCD\nremains dominated by the scalar condensate of the quark bilinear, as expected.\nNotably, our findings highlight that $CP$-violating four-fermion interactions,\nwhich are perturbatively irrelevant, can become relevant in the chirally broken\nphase through nonperturbative effects, with potential implications for\nspontaneous $CP$-violation scenarios.",

Occultations return kilometric accuracies on the\nthree-dimensional shape of bodies irrespective of their geocentric distances,\nwith the potential of detecting topographic features along the limb. From the\nshape, accurate values of albedo can be derived, and if the mass is known, the\nbulk density is pinned down, thus constraining the internal structure and\nequilibrium state of the object. Occultations are also extremely sensitive to\ntenuous atmospheres, down to the nanobar level. They allowed the monitoring of\nPluto's and Triton's atmospheres in the last three decades, constraining their\nseasonal evolution. They may unveil in the near future atmospheres around other\nremote bodies of the solar system. Since 2013, occultations have led to the\nsurprising discovery of ring systems around the Centaur object Chariklo, the\ndwarf planet Haumea and the large trans-Neptunian object Quaoar, while\nrevealing dense material around the Centaur Chiron.

A\ntypical RAG implementation uses powerful retrieval models to extract external\ninformation and large language models (LLMs) to generate answers. In contrast,\nrecent LLM-based retrieval has gained attention for its substantial\nimprovements in information retrieval (IR) due to the LLMs' semantic\nunderstanding capability. However, directly applying LLM to RAG systems\npresents challenges. This may cause feature locality problems as massive\nparametric knowledge can hinder effective usage of global information across\nthe corpus; for example, an LLM-based retriever often inputs document summaries\ninstead of full documents. Moreover, various pre-trained tasks in LLMs\nintroduce variance, further weakening performance as a retriever.\n  To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning\narchitecture called Invar-RAG. In the retrieval stage, an LLM-based retriever\nis constructed by integrating LoRA-based representation learning to tackle\nfeature locality issues. To enhance retrieval performance, we develop two\npatterns (invariant and variant patterns) and an invariance loss to reduce LLM\nvariance.

The\nmechanism correlates to the interplay between out-of-plane ferroelectricity and\nvalley physics in antiferromagnetic multiferroic quadrilayer, which enables the\nlayer-locked Berry curvature and Hall effect, i.e., deflecting the carriers\nwith four different layer physics to move in specific directions. More\nimportantly, the quadri-layertronics can be generated and manipulated by\ncontrolling the interlayer dipole arrangements via a gate voltage, allowing for\nthe selective induction and detection of layer Hall effect in specific layers.\nUsing first principles calculations, we further demonstrate the gate control of\nquadri-layertronics in multiferroic antiferromagnet of quadrilayer OsCl2.

With this assumption,\nnodes have initial knowledge only of themselves, not their neighbors. In this\ncase the time and message lower bounds are $\\Omega(D)$ and $\\Omega(m)$,\nrespectively, where $D$ is the diameter of the network and $m$ is the number of\nedges, and there exist (even) deterministic algorithms that simultaneously\nmatch these bounds.\n  On the other hand, under the $\\text{KT}_1$ assumption, whereby each node has\ninitial knowledge of itself and the identifiers of its neighbors, the situation\nis not clear. For the $\\text{KT}_1$ CONGEST model (where messages are of small\nsize), King, Kutten, and Thorup (KKT) showed that one can solve several\nfundamental global problems (with the notable exception of BFS tree\nconstruction) such as broadcast, leader election, and spanning tree\nconstruction with $\\tilde{O}(n)$ message complexity ($n$ is the network size),\nwhich can be significantly smaller than $m$. Randomization is crucial in\nobtaining this result. While the message complexity of the KKT result is\nnear-optimal, its time complexity is $\\tilde{O}(n)$ rounds, which is far from\nthe standard lower bound of $\\Omega(D)$.\n  In this paper, we show that in the $\\text{KT}_1$ LOCAL model (where message\nsizes are not restricted), singular optimality is achievable. Our main result\nis that all global problems, including BFS tree construction, can be solved in\n$\\tilde{O}(D)$ rounds and $\\tilde{O}(n)$ messages, where both bounds are\noptimal up to polylogarithmic factors.

This work mainly focuses on the correlations between\nnet-kaon and net-proton, and net-kaon and net-charge in Pb$-$Pb collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}} = 5.02$ TeV using data recorded during LHC Run 2. The\nnet-proton and net-kaon serve as proxies for net-baryon and net-strangeness,\nrespectively, with measurements analyzed as a function of collision centrality.\nTheoretical predictions from the Thermal-FIST model are compared with\nexperimental results, providing insights into the effects of resonance decays\nand charge conservation laws on the correlations.",

In this paper, we will focus on the\nanalysis of degree of freedom (DoF) in IRS-aided multi-user MIMO network.\nFirstly, the DoF upper bound of IRS-aided single-user MIMO network, i.e., the\nachievable maximum DoF of such a system, is derived, and the corresponding\nresults are extended to the case of IRS-aided multiuser MIMO by using the\nmatrix rank inequalities. In particular, in serious rank-deficient, also called\nlow-rank, channels like line-of-sight (LoS), the network DoF may doubles over\nno-IRS with the help of IRS. To verify the rate performance gain from augmented\nDoF, three closed-form beamforming methods, null-space projection plus maximize\ntransmit power and maximize receive power (NSP-MTP-MRP), Schmidt\northogonalization plus minimum mean square error (SO-MMSE) and two-layer\nleakage plus MMSE (TLL-MMSE) are proposed to achieve the maximum DoF.\nSimulation results shows that IRS does make a dramatic rate enhancement. For\nexample, in a serious deficient channel, the sum-rate of the proposed TLL-MMSE\naided by IRS is about twice that of no IRS. This means that IRS may achieve a\nsignificant DoF improvement in such a channel.",

One major obstacle is the lack of\nidentification of multi-wavelength counterparts for FRBs at cosmological\ndistances. So far, all the searches other than in the radio wavelength,\nincluding those in the gamma-ray energies, have only left upper limits. Here we\nreport a gigaelectronvolt (GeV) gamma-ray flare lasting 15.6 seconds as well as\nadditional evidence of variable gamma-ray emission in temporal and spatial\nassociation with the hyper-active, newly discovered repeating FRB 20240114A,\nwhich has been localized to a dwarf galaxy at a redshift of 0.13. The\nenergetic, short GeV gamma-ray flare reached a prompt isotropic luminosity of\nthe order of ${10}^{48}~{\\rm ergs~{s}^{-1}}$. The additional less-significant\ngamma-ray flares, if true, also have similar luminosities; such flares could\ncontribute to a 5-day average luminosity of the order of ${10}^{45}~{\\rm\nergs~{s}^{-1}}$. These high-luminosity flares challenge the traditional FRB\nengine scenario involving a seconds-period magnetar.

We also found that\nregular sunspots, which have umbra and penumbra, rotate $\\approx 1.5\\%$ faster\nthan solar pores, in which penumbra is absent.

While some of these KPIs are achievable in urban scenarios, rural\nareas often face challenging connectivity conditions due to the lack of\nterrestrial network (TN) infrastructure. To solve this problem, non-terrestrial\nnetworks (NTNs) such as satellite-based solutions, have been introduced to\nprovide coverage in remote regions. Therefore, a multi-connectivity approach\ncan be integrated to simultaneously serve an end-user by merging satellite and\ncellular links in a joint approach. This study explores, using experimental\ndata, the benefits of both TN-TN and TN-NTN multi-connectivity in rural\nenvironments. The results obtained demonstrate that a traditional\nsingle-connectivity approach may not be sufficient to provide service to rural\nenvironments due to the KPIs requirements given several use cases within these\nrural areas. The multi-connectivity strategy, which jointly integrates 5G and\nsatellite networks, meets the network availability requirements for latency,\ndownlink throughput, and uplink throughput KPIs at least 98%, 99%, and 95% of\nthe time, respectively, for several use cases, such as precision agriculture,\nlivestock monitoring, and forest management.

However, substantial data size poses\nchallenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential\ntechnology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing\nmore compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into\nimplicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been\nexplored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC)\ntechnique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores\nderived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing\nredundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to\ncompress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical\nattribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS\ninto multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor\nprimitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying\nLevels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for\npredicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial\nredundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical\ntransform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For\nnon-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor\nprimitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and\nanchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the\nnext LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a\nsignificant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the\nstate-of-the-art compression method on small scenes datasets.",

    "abstract": "Automated feature detection in historical maps can significantly accelerate\nthe reconstruction of the geospatial past. However, this process is often\nconstrained by the time-consuming task of manually digitizing sufficient\nhigh-quality training data. The emergence of visual foundation models, such as\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM), offers a promising solution due to their\nremarkable generalization capabilities and rapid adaptation to new data\ndistributions. Despite this, directly applying SAM in a zero-shot manner to\nhistorical map segmentation poses significant challenges, including poor\nrecognition of certain geospatial features and a reliance on input prompts,\nwhich limits its ability to be fully automated. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce MapSAM, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts SAM\ninto a prompt-free and versatile solution for various downstream historical map\nsegmentation tasks. Specifically, we employ Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank\nAdaptation (DoRA) to integrate domain-specific knowledge into the image\nencoder. Additionally, we develop an automatic prompt generation process,\neliminating the need for manual input. We further enhance the positional prompt\nin SAM, transforming it into a higher-level positional-semantic prompt, and\nmodify the cross-attention mechanism in the mask decoder with masked attention\nfor more effective feature aggregation. The proposed MapSAM framework\ndemonstrates promising performance across two distinct historical map\nsegmentation tasks: one focused on linear features and the other on areal\nfeatures. Experimental results show that it adapts well to various features,\neven when fine-tuned with extremely limited data (e.g. 10 shots).",

We\nfurther assume that the system has a locally unique gapped ground state.\nPhysically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at\nzero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a\nsystem to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium\nalmost-stationary states approach, we prove that the longitudinal current\ndensity induced by a constant electric field of strength $\\varepsilon$ is of\norder $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^\\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the\nusual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in\n$\\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^\\infty)$. The\nproportionality factor $\\sigma_\\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall\nconductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well\nknown double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our\nresults, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases,\nand that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that \"measures\" the Hall\nconductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H}}$ in expectation up to $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^\\infty)$,\nbut also has vanishing variance.

Recently, ensemble-based models (ESM) have been shown to offer\nsignificant robustness improvement, while preserving high ID accuracy. However,\nour study finds that ESMs do not solve the ID-OOD trade-offs: they achieve peak\nperformance for ID and OOD accuracy at different mixing coefficients. When\noptimized for OOD accuracy, the ensemble model exhibits a noticeable decline in\nID accuracy, and vice versa. In contrast, we propose a sample-wise ensembling\ntechnique that can simultaneously attain the best ID and OOD accuracy without\nthe trade-offs. Specifically, we construct a Zero-Shot Failure (ZSF) set\ncontaining training samples incorrectly predicted by the zero-shot model. For\neach test sample, we calculate its distance to the ZSF set and assign a higher\nweight to the fine-tuned model in the ensemble if the distance is small.

On\nImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, our VRF further improves the OOD\naccuracy by 1.5 - 2.0 pp over the ensemble baselines while maintaining or\nincreasing ID accuracy.

In specific, mask tokens mainly gather\ninformation for decoding, while visible tokens tend to primarily provide\ninformation, and their deep representations can be built only upon themselves.\nTemporally (across steps), the interactions between adjacent generation steps\nmostly concentrate on updating the representations of a few critical tokens,\nwhile the computation for the majority of tokens is generally repetitive.\nDriven by these findings, we propose EfficientNAT (ENAT), a NAT model that\nexplicitly encourages these critical interactions inherent in NATs. At the\nspatial level, we disentangle the computations of visible and mask tokens by\nencoding visible tokens independently, while decoding mask tokens conditioned\non the fully encoded visible tokens. At the temporal level, we prioritize the\ncomputation of the critical tokens at each step, while maximally reusing\npreviously computed token representations to supplement necessary information.\nENAT improves the performance of NATs notably with significantly reduced\ncomputational cost. Experiments on ImageNet-256, ImageNet-512 and MS-COCO\nvalidate the effectiveness of ENAT. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/LeapLabTHU/ENAT.",

    "abstract": "Finding interpretable biomechanical models can provide insight into the\nfunctionality of organs with regard to physiology and disease. However,\nidentifying broadly applicable dynamical models for in vivo tissue remains\nchallenging. In this proof of concept study we propose a reconstruction\nframework for data-driven discovery of dynamical models from experimentally\nobtained undersampled MRI spectral data. The method makes use of the previously\ndeveloped spectro-dynamic framework which allows for reconstruction of\ndisplacement fields at high spatial and temporal resolution required for model\nidentification. The proposed framework combines this method with data-driven\ndiscovery of interpretable models using Sparse Identification of Non-linear\nDynamics (SINDy). The design of the reconstruction algorithm is such that a\nsymbiotic relation between the reconstruction of the displacement fields and\nthe model identification is created. Our method does not rely on periodicity of\nthe motion. It is successfully validated using spectral data of a dynamic\nphantom gathered on a clinical MRI scanner. The dynamic phantom is programmed\nto perform motion adhering to 5 different (non-linear) ordinary differential\nequations. The proposed framework performed better than a 2-step approach where\nthe displacement fields were first reconstructed from the undersampled data\nwithout any information on the model, followed by data-driven discovery of the\nmodel using the reconstructed displacement fields. This study serves as a first\nstep in the direction of data-driven discovery of in vivo models.",

Its role in HMYSOs has not yet been elucidated. Here,\nwe investigate the properties of TI outbursts in young, massive ($M_*\\gtrsim\n5M_{\\odot}$) stars, and compare them to those observed so far.\n  Our simulations show that modelled TI bursts can replicate the durations and\npeak accretion rates of long (a few years to decades) outbursts observed in\nHMYSOs with similar mass characteristics. However, they struggle with\nshort-duration (less than a year) bursts with short (a few weeks or months)\nrise times, suggesting the need for alternative mechanisms. Moreover, while our\nmodels match the durations of longer bursts, they fail to reproduce the\nmultiple outbursts seen in some HMYSOs, regardless of model parameters. We also\nemphasise the significance of not just evaluating model accretion rates and\ndurations, but also performing photometric analysis to thoroughly evaluate the\nconsistency between model predictions and observational data.\n  Our findings suggest that some other plausible mechanisms, such as\ngravitational instabilities and disc fragmentation can be responsible for\ngenerating the observed outburst phenomena in HMYSOs and underscore the need\nfor further investigation into alternative mechanisms driving short outbursts.\n  However, the physics of TI is crucial in sculpting the inner disc physics in\nthe early bright epoch of massive star formation, and comprehensive parameter\nspace exploration and the use of 2D modeling are essential for obtaining a more\ndetailed understanding of the underlying physical processes.",

We study the fragments obtained from counting logics by\nrestricting requantification for some but not necessarily all the variables.\nSimilar to the logics without limitation on requantification, we develop tools\nto investigate the restricted variants. Specifically, we introduce a bijective\npebble game in which certain pebbles can only be placed once and for all, and a\ncorresponding two-parametric family of Weisfeiler-Leman algorithms.

This indicates that energy stability may not be decisive for\nthe long-term qualitative correctness of numerical solutions. We found that\nusing another fundamental property of the solution, namely monotonicity instead\nof energy stability, is sufficient to ensure that many common numerical schemes\nconverge to the correct equilibrium state. This leads us to introduce the\ncritical step size constant $h^*=h^*(u_0,\\epsilon)$ that ensures the\nmonotonicity and unique solvability of the numerical solutions, where the\nscaling parameter $\\epsilon \\in(0,1)$. We prove that the implicit Euler scheme\n$h^*=h^*(\\epsilon)$, which is independent of $u_0$ and only depends on\n$\\epsilon$. Hence regardless of the initial value taken, the simulation can be\nguaranteed to be correct when $h<h^*$. But for various other numerical methods,\nno mater how small the step size $h$ is in advance, there will always be\ninitial values that cause simulation errors. In fact, for these numerical\nmethods, we prove that $\\inf_{u_0\\in \\mathbb{R}}h^*(u_0,\\epsilon)=0$. Various\nnumerical experiments are used to confirm the theoretical analysis.",

To achieve this goal, we develop a novel\ndetector concept featuring 5-dimensional calorimetry that provides spatial,\nenergy, and time measurements for each hit, and a reconstruction framework that\ncombines state-of-the-art particle flow and artificial intelligence algorithms.\nIn the benchmark process of Higgs to di-jets, over 90% of visible energy can be\nsuccessfully mapped into well-reconstructed particles that not only maintain a\none-to-one correspondence relationship but also associate with the correct\ncombination of cluster and track, improving the invariant mass resolution of\nhadronically decayed Higgs bosons by 25%.

Previous works have concentrated on binary directional focus\ndecoding, i.e., determining whether the attended speaker is on the left or\nright side of the listener. However, a more precise decoding of the exact\ndirection of the attended speaker is necessary for effective speech processing.\nAdditionally, audio spatial information has not been effectively leveraged,\nresulting in suboptimal decoding results. In this paper, it is found that on\nthe recently presented dataset with 14-class directional focus, models relying\nexclusively on EEG inputs exhibit significantly lower accuracy when decoding\nthe directional focus in both leave-one-subject-out and leave-one-trial-out\nscenarios. By integrating audio spatial spectra with EEG features, the decoding\naccuracy can be effectively improved. The CNN, LSM-CNN, and Deformer models are\nemployed to decode the directional focus from listeners' EEG signals and audio\nspatial spectra.

    "abstract": "Most existing DOA estimation methods assume ideal source incident angles with\nminimal noise. Moreover, directly using pre-estimated angles to calculate\nweighted coefficients can lead to performance loss. Thus, a green multi-modal\n(MM) fusion DOA framework is proposed to realize a more practical, low-cost and\nhigh time-efficiency DOA estimation for a H$^2$AD array. Firstly, two more\nefficient clustering methods, global maximum cos\\_similarity clustering\n(GMaxCS) and global minimum distance clustering (GMinD), are presented to infer\nmore precise true solutions from the candidate solution sets. Based on this, an\niteration weighted fusion (IWF)-based method is introduced to iteratively\nupdate weighted fusion coefficients and the clustering center of the true\nsolution classes by using the estimated values. Particularly, the coarse DOA\ncalculated by fully digital (FD) subarray, serves as the initial cluster\ncenter. The above process yields two methods called MM-IWF-GMaxCS and\nMM-IWF-GMinD. To further provide a higher-accuracy DOA estimation, a fusion\nnetwork (fusionNet) is proposed to aggregate the inferred two-part true angles\nand thus generates two effective approaches called MM-fusionNet-GMaxCS and\nMM-fusionNet-GMinD. The simulation outcomes show the proposed four approaches\ncan achieve the ideal DOA performance and the CRLB. Meanwhile, proposed\nMM-fusionNet-GMaxCS and MM-fusionNet-GMinD exhibit superior DOA performance\ncompared to MM-IWF-GMaxCS and MM-IWF-GMinD, especially in extremely-low SNR\nrange.",

While the signal\nspace-based method is effective in strong line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, we\nshow that it struggles with the complexities of non-line-of-sight (NLoS)\nscenarios, compromising the robustness of CSI-based RFF.

Under this\nunsupervised multi-domain setting, we have identified inherent model bias\nwithin CLIP, notably in its visual and text encoders.

These biases are subsequently subtracted from original image and\ntext features separately, to render them domain-invariant.

Our algorithm\nreturns a feasible set of causal effects that can be identified exactly given\nrelevant covariance parameters. The feasible set may be disconnected but is a\nfinite union of convex subsets. We discuss conditions under which this set is\nsharp, i.e., contains all and only effects consistent with the background\nassumptions and the joint distribution of observable variables. Our method\napplies to a wide class of semiparametric models, and we demonstrate how its\nability to select specific subsets of instruments confers an advantage over\nconvex relaxations in both linear and nonlinear settings. We also adapt our\nalgorithm to form confidence sets that are asymptotically valid under a common\nstatistical assumption from the Mendelian randomization literature.",

Strong\nhybridization strength also spatially delocalizes the TSSs, diminishing the\neffective orbital coupling between TSS-based p and magnetic d orbitals, which\nfurther weakens kinetic and Coulomb exchange interaction strength. Moreover,\nmodifying the stacking order offers an experimentally viable approach to\noptimizing magnetic gaps, enabling the tunability of Chern numbers, chirality\nand maximizing global gaps. These findings unveil a universal guiding principle\nfor optimizing magnetic gaps in FMI-TI proximity-based QAH systems, offering\nvaluable insights for advancing experimental implementations in this field.",

Second, we address the problem that a white noise test, for\nexample checking the residuals of a model fit, is usually not performed because\none believes in this hypothesis, but thinks that the white noise hypothesis may\nbe approximately true, because a postulated models describes the unknown\nrelation well. This reflects a meanwhile classical paradigm of Box(1976) that\n\"all models are wrong but some are useful\". We address this point of view by\ninvestigating if the maximum deviation of the local autocovariance functions\nfrom 0 exceeds a given threshold $\\Delta$ that can either be specified by the\nuser or chosen in a data dependent way.\n  The formulation of the problem in this form raises several mathematical\nchallenges, which do not appear when one is testing the classical white noise\nhypothesis.

    "abstract": "This article revisits the validity of tree-level statements regarding the\nYukawa sector of various minimal-renormalisable $SU(5)$ frameworks at the loop\nlevel. It is well-known that an $SU(5)$ model with only the $45_{\\rm{H}}$\ndimensional irreducible representation~(irrep) contributing to the Yukawa\nsector is highly incompatible in yielding the low-energy observables. However,\nthis study shows that when one-loop corrections from heavy degrees of freedom\nare included in the various Yukawa vertices, the model can accurately reproduce\nthe charged fermion mass spectrum and mixing angles. Furthermore, the fitted\ncouplings remain within the perturbative range. The fitted parameters also\nnecessitate mass splitting among various scalars of $45_{\\rm{H}}$ dimensional\nirrep, with at least one scalar's mass differing by as much as 13 orders of\nmagnitude from the matching scale $(M_{\\rm{GUT}})$, collectively providing\nsubstantial threshold corrections. As an extension, the minimal $SU(5)$ model\nwith only the $45_{\\rm{H}}$ irrep is augmented with the\n$15_{\\rm{H}}$-dimensional irrep, which also successfully reproduces the\nobserved charged and neutral fermion mass spectra. Finally, the study considers\nan alternative $SU(5)$ model incorporating both $5_{\\rm{H}}$ and $15_{\\rm{H}}$\nirreps, which also yields the desired fermion mass spectra and mixing angles.\nThis work demonstrates the viability of a minimal $SU(5)$ Yukawa sector in\ndifferent setups when quantum corrections are considered.",

In discrete manufacturing, production\nlines and equipment are complex and numerous, which introduces significant\nuncertainty during the production process. Among these uncertainties,\ndecision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) pose additional challenges in finding\noptimal production strategies, as the signature or the shape of the uncertainty\nset cannot be determined before solving the model. However, existing research\ndoes not account for decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) present in\ndiscrete manufacturing; moreover, current algorithms for solving models with\nDDUs suffer from high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for the\nreal-time control requirements of modern industry. To this end, we proposed an\nenergy-production co-scheduling model for discrete manufacturing, taking into\naccount decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs).

Pattern languages\nwith length constraints contain only words in which all variables are\nsubstituted to words with lengths that fulfill such a given set of length\nconstraints. We consider membership, inclusion, and equivalence problems for\nerasing and non-erasing pattern languages with length constraints.\n  Our main result shows that the erasing equivalence problem - one of the most\nprominent open problems in the realm of patterns - becomes undecidable if\nlength constraints are allowed in addition to variable equality.\n  Additionally, it is shown that the terminal-free inclusion problem, a\nprominent problem which has been shown to be undecidable in the binary case for\npatterns without any constraints, is also generally undecidable for all larger\nalphabets in this setting.\n  Finally, we also show that considering regular constraints, i.e., associating\nvariables also with regular languages as additional restrictions together with\nlength constraints for valid substitutions, results in undecidability of the\nnon-erasing equivalence problem. This sets a first upper bound on constraints\nto obtain undecidability in this case, as this problem is trivially decidable\nin the case of no constraints and as it has unknown decidability if only\nregular- or only length-constraints are considered.",

Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), which\nprovides unique decade-long mid-IR light curves with a six-month cadence, we\nhave conducted the first systematic search for SMBHB candidates based on IR\nperiodicity. Analyzing a parent sample of 48,932 objects selected from about\nhalf a million AGNs, we have identified 28 candidate periodic AGNs with periods\nranging from 1,268 to 2,437 days (in the observer frame) by fitting their WISE\nlight curves with sinusoidal functions. However, our mock simulation of the\nparent sample indicates that stochastic variability can actually produce a\nsimilar number of periodic sources, underscoring the difficulty in robustly\nidentifying real periodic signals with WISE light curves, given their current\nsampling. Notably, we found no overlap between our sample and optical periodic\nsources, which can be explained by a distinct preference for certain periods\ndue to selection bias. By combining archived data from different surveys, we\nhave identified SDSS J140336.43+174136.1 as a candidate exhibiting periodic\nbehavior in both optical and IR bands, a phenomenon that warrants further\nvalidation through observational tests.

    "abstract": "Asteroid Didymos, recently targeted by the NASA DART mission, is also planned\nto be visited by the ESA Hera mission. The main goal of the DART mission was to\nimpact Dimorphos, the small satellite of Didymos, which was accomplished in\nSeptember 2022. This collision altered the Didymos-Dimorphos system, generating\na notable quantity of ejecta that turned Dimorphos into an active asteroid,\nwith some ejecta potentially settling on the surfaces of both components. This\nprompts the investigation into the extent of post-impact surface alterations on\nthese bodies compared to their original states.\n  The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pre-impact thermal inertia of\nDidymos independently. We employed ASTERIA, an alternative to conventional\nthermophysical modeling, to estimate the surface thermal inertia of Didymos.\nThe approach is based on a model-to-measurement comparison of the Yarkovsky\neffect-induced drift on the orbital semi-major axis. These results, alongside\nexisting literature, enable an evaluation of the impact-induced alterations in\nDidymos's thermal inertia.\n  Our nominal estimate with a constant thermal inertia model stands at $\\Gamma\n= 211_{-55}^{+81}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$, while assuming it varies\nwith the heliocentric distance with an exponent of $-0.75$ thermal inertia of\nDidymos is found to be $258_{-63}^{+94}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$.\nSubsequent verification confirmed that this result is robust against variations\nin unknown physical parameters. The thermal inertia estimates for Didymos align\nstatistically with values reported in the literature, derived from both pre-\nand post-impact data. The forthcoming Hera mission will provide an opportunity\nto corroborate these findings further. Additionally, our results support the\nhypothesis that the thermal inertia of near-Earth asteroids is generally lower\nthan previously expected.",

The\nRe-ID dataset includes 730 individuals captured with two UAVs simultaneously.\nThe dataset is designed to drive scalable, long-term animal behaviour tracking\nusing multiple camera sensors. By providing baseline performance with two\ndetectors, and benchmarking several state-of-the-art tracking methods, our\ndataset reflects the real-world challenges of tracking wild animals in socially\nand ecologically relevant contexts.

Despite its potential, existing\nsharding solutions face significant limitations in handling dynamic workloads,\nensuring secure cross-shard transactions, and maintaining system integrity. To\naddress these gaps, we propose DynaShard, a dynamic and secure cross-shard\ntransaction processing mechanism designed to enhance blockchain sharding\nefficiency and security. DynaShard combines adaptive shard management, a hybrid\nconsensus approach, plus an efficient state synchronization and dispute\nresolution protocol. Our performance evaluation, conducted using a robust\nexperimental setup with real-world network conditions and transaction\nworkloads, demonstrates DynaShard's superior throughput, reduced latency, and\nimproved shard utilization compared to the FTBS method. Specifically, DynaShard\nachieves up to a 42.6% reduction in latency and a 78.77% improvement in shard\nutilization under high transaction volumes and varying cross-shard transaction\nratios. These results highlight DynaShard's ability to outperform\nstate-of-the-art sharding methods, ensuring scalable and resilient blockchain\nsystems.

While recent works motivate the benefits of\ndiscovering local causal graphs for dynamics modelling, in this work we\ndemonstrate that accurately capturing these relationships in complex settings\nremains challenging for the current state-of-the-art. To remedy this\nshortcoming, we postulate that sparsity is a critical ingredient for the\ndiscovery of such local causal structures. To this end we present the SPARse\nTrANsformer World model (SPARTAN), a Transformer-based world model that learns\nlocal causal structures between entities in a scene. By applying sparsity\nregularisation on the attention pattern between object-factored tokens, SPARTAN\nidentifies sparse local causal models that accurately predict future object\nstates. Furthermore, we extend our model to capture sparse interventions with\nunknown targets on the dynamics of the environment. This results in a highly\ninterpretable world model that can efficiently adapt to changes. Empirically,\nwe evaluate SPARTAN against the current state-of-the-art in object-centric\nworld models on observation-based environments and demonstrate that our model\ncan learn accurate local causal graphs and achieve significantly improved\nfew-shot adaptation to changes in the dynamics of the environment as well as\nrobustness against removing irrelevant distractors.",

We aim to improve empirical\nestimates of mass loss and wind clumping for hot main-sequence massive stars,\nstudy the dependence of both properties on the metallicity, and compare the\ntheoretical predictions to our findings. We analyzed the optical and UV spectra\nof 13 O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy, which has a\nmetallicity of $\\sim 0.2\\,Z_\\odot$. We quantified the stellar atmosphere,\noutflow, and wind-clumping properties.

We find significant variations in the\nwind-clumping properties of the target stars, with clumping starting at flow\nvelocities $0.01 - 0.23$ of the terminal wind velocity and reaching clumping\nfactors $f_{\\rm cl} = 2 - 30$.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel discrete-time distributed algorithm for\nfinding least squares solutions of linear algebraic equations with a scheduling\nprotocol to further enhance its scalability. Each agent in the network is\nassumed to know some rows of the coefficient matrix and the corresponding\nentries in the observation vector. Unlike typical distributed algorithms, our\napproach considers communication bandwidth limits, allowing agents to transmit\nonly a portion of their ``guessed\" solution, independent of its dimension. A\nperiodic scheduling protocol determines which portion is transmitted at each\niteration. Assuming a small fixed step size and a diagonalizable algorithm\nmatrix, we prove that agents' ``guessed\" solutions converge exponentially to a\nleast squares solution. For cases where the observation vectors are\ntime-varying, a modified algorithm guarantees practical convergence, with\ntracking error bounded by the single-step variation in the observation vector.\nSimulations on both small-scale and medium-scale examples validate the\nfeasibility of our algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Classical Be stars, the \"e\" standing for the presence of spectroscopic line\nemission, are main sequence stars of spectral type B that are able to form a\ngaseous disk in Keplerian motion from star-ejected matter. The main driver of\nthis capability is the rapid surface rotation, which might be acquired via\nbinary interaction or through internal stellar evolution, but additional\nmechanisms, such as nonradial pulsation, usually enable a star to become a Be\nstar well below the actual critical rotation threshold. The angular momentum\nloss through the disk then keeps the star below the critical rotation value for\nthe rest of its main sequence life span. It is one of the oldest standing\nresearch fields of astronomy, since the first discovery of a Be star in 1866.\nThe article, therefore, not only presents the properties of Be stars, but as\nwell the history of the field. The current main research topics, discussed in\ngreater detail, are: 1) the variability of the central object and the nature of\nBe stars as nonradially pulsating stars, 2) the physics of the viscosity\ngoverned circumstellar disk and its variability, which can serve as proxy for\nthe more common, but typically harder to observe viscuous accretion disks, and\n3) the role of binarity both in the formation of Be stars as rapid rotators,\nand as well their impact on the observed properties of these stars.",

(CH2) Directly aggregating local\nfair models does not always yield a globally fair model due to non Identical\nand Independent data Distributions (non-IID) among clients. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a Wasserstein Fair Federated Learning framework, namely\nWassFFed. To tackle CH1, we ensure that the outputs of local models, rather\nthan the loss calculated with surrogate functions or classification results\nwith a threshold, remain independent of various user groups. To resolve CH2, we\nemploy a Wasserstein barycenter calculation of all local models' outputs for\neach user group, bringing local model outputs closer to the global output\ndistribution to ensure consistency between the global model and local models.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating\nthat WassFFed outperforms existing approaches in striking a balance between\naccuracy and fairness.",

For instance, within the scenario of\ntransaction risk management, a graph pattern that is characteristic of a\nparticular risk category can be readily employed to discern transactions\nfraught with risk, delineate networks of criminal activity, or investigate the\nmethodologies employed by fraudsters. Nonetheless, graph data in industrial\nsettings is often characterized by its massive scale, encompassing data sets\nwith millions or even billions of nodes, making the manual extraction of graph\npatterns not only labor-intensive but also necessitating specialized knowledge\nin particular domains of risk.

While test collections have\nbecome an integral part of IR research, the process of data creation involves\nsignificant manual-annotation effort, which often makes it very expensive and\ntime-consuming. Consequently, test collections can become too small when the\nbudget is limited, which may lead to unstable evaluations. As a cheaper\nalternative, recent studies have proposed using large language models (LLMs) to\ncompletely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs correlate to some\nextent with human judgments, their predictions are not perfect and often show\nbias. Thus, a complete replacement with LLMs is considered too risky and not\nfully reliable.\n  In this paper, we propose LLM-Assisted Relevance Assessments (LARA), an\neffective method to balance manual annotations with LLM annotations, helping\nbuild a rich and reliable test collection even under a low budget. We use the\nLLM's predicted relevance probabilities to select the most profitable documents\nfor manual annotation under a budget constraint. Guided by theoretical\nreasoning, LARA actively learns to calibrate the LLM's predicted relevance\nprobabilities, directing the human-annotation process. Then, using the\ncalibration model learned from the limited manual annotations, LARA debiases\nthe LLM predictions to annotate the remaining non-assessed data. Experiments on\nTREC-7 Ad Hoc, TREC-8 Ad Hoc, TREC Robust 2004, and TREC-COVID datasets show\nthat LARA outperforms alternative solutions under almost any budget constraint.\nWhile the community debates humans versus LLMs in relevance assessments, we\ncontend that, given the same amount of human effort, it is reasonable to\nleverage LLMs.",

This produces unique responses of the Martian CO2-driven climate\nsystem to variations of astronomical forcings. Specifically, it has been shown\nthat the phenomenon called an atmospheric collapse occurs when the axial\nobliquity is low, affecting the Martian climatic evolution. However, the\nbehavior of the Martian climate system and the accompanying changes in climate\nand habitability of such planets remain ambiguous. Here we employed a\nlatitudinally-resolved Martian energy balance model and assessed the possible\nclimate on Mars for wider ranges of orbital parameters, solar irradiance, and\ntotal exchangeable CO2 mass. We show that the atmospheric collapse occurs when\nthe obliquity is below ~10 degrees when other parameters are kept at the\npresent Mars condition. We also show that the climate solutions on Mars depend\non orbital parameters, solar luminosity, and the total exchangeable CO2 mass.\nWe found that the atmospheric collapse would have occurred repeatedly in the\nhistory of Mars following the variation of the axial obliquity, while the\nlong-term evolution of atmospheric pCO2 is also affected by the changes in the\ntotal exchangeable CO2 mass in Martian history.

Previous studies predominantly\nemploy an extracting-and-modeling paradigm to harness the information in KG,\nwhich first extracts relevant subgraphs based on pre-defined rules and then\nproceeds to design various strategies aiming to improve the representations and\nfusion of the extracted structural knowledge. Despite their effectiveness,\nthere are still two challenges. On one hand, subgraphs extracted by rule-based\nmethods may have the potential to overlook critical nodes and result in\nuncontrollable subgraph size. On the other hand, the misalignment between graph\nand text modalities undermines the effectiveness of knowledge fusion,\nultimately impacting the task performance. To deal with the problems above, we\npropose a novel framework: \\textbf{S}ubgraph R\\textbf{E}trieval Enhanced by\nGra\\textbf{P}h-\\textbf{T}ext \\textbf{A}lignment, named \\textbf{SEPTA}. Firstly,\nwe transform the knowledge graph into a database of subgraph vectors and\npropose a BFS-style subgraph sampling strategy to avoid information loss,\nleveraging the analogy between BFS and the message-passing mechanism. In\naddition, we propose a bidirectional contrastive learning approach for\ngraph-text alignment, which effectively enhances both subgraph retrieval and\nknowledge fusion. Finally, all the retrieved information is combined for\nreasoning in the prediction module. Extensive experiments on five datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.",

In this regard, this paper examines\nmodel-independent bounds on adversarial performance for QML.

Experimental results are compared to the\ncomputed bound, demonstrating the potential of QML models to achieve high\nrobustness. In the best case, the experimental error is only 10% above the\nestimated bound, offering evidence of the inherent robustness of quantum\nmodels.

The Lotka-Volterra model is critical for understanding ecological\ndynamics, population control, and species interactions, as it is represented by\na system of differential equations.

The\nclassical Lee-Yang program initiated the study of phase transitions via\nlocating complex zeros of partition functions. Markov chains, besides serving\nas algorithms, have also been used to model physical processes tending to\nequilibrium. In many scenarios, rapid mixing of Markov chains coincides with\nthe absence of phase transitions (complex zeros). Prior works have shown that\nthe absence of phase transitions implies rapid mixing of Markov chains. We\nreveal a converse connection by lifting probabilistic tools for the analysis of\nMarkov chains to study complex zeros of partition functions.\n  Our motivating example is the independence polynomial on $k$-uniform\nhypergraphs, where the best-known zero-free regime has been significantly\nlagging behind the regime where we have rapidly mixing Markov chains for the\nunderlying hypergraph independent sets. Specifically, the Glauber dynamics is\nknown to mix rapidly on independent sets in a $k$-uniform hypergraph of maximum\ndegree $\\Delta$ provided that $\\Delta \\lesssim 2^{k/2}$. On the other hand, the\nbest-known zero-freeness around the point $1$ of the independence polynomial on\n$k$-uniform hypergraphs requires $\\Delta \\le 5$, the same bound as on a graph.\n  By introducing a complex extension of Markov chains, we lift an existing\npercolation argument to the complex plane, and show that if $\\Delta \\lesssim\n2^{k/2}$, the Markov chain converges in a complex neighborhood, and the\nindependence polynomial itself does not vanish in the same neighborhood. In the\nsame regime, our result also implies central limit theorems for the size of a\nuniformly random independent set, and deterministic approximation algorithms\nfor the number of hypergraph independent sets of size $k \\le \\alpha n$ for some\nconstant $\\alpha$.",

To\naddress this need, we conduct a comprehensive and comparative study on three\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, GLM-4, Mistral-NeMo, and LLaMA3.1, focusing on their\neffectiveness in generating automated financial reports. Our primary motivation\nis to explore how these models can be harnessed within finance, a field\ndemanding precision, contextual relevance, and robustness against erroneous or\nmisleading information. By examining each model's capabilities, we aim to\nprovide an insightful assessment of their strengths and limitations. Our paper\noffers benchmarks for financial report analysis, encompassing proposed metrics\nsuch as ROUGE-1, BERT Score, and LLM Score. We introduce an innovative\nevaluation framework that integrates both quantitative metrics (e.g.,\nprecision, recall) and qualitative analyses (e.g., contextual fit, consistency)\nto provide a holistic view of each model's output quality. Additionally, we\nmake our financial dataset publicly available, inviting researchers and\npractitioners to leverage, scrutinize, and enhance our findings through broader\ncommunity engagement and collaborative improvement.

Predicting object trajectories\nand occupancy enables autonomous vehicles to anticipate movements and make\ndecisions with future information, increasing their adaptability and reducing\nthe risk of accidents. Current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches often isolate\nthe detection, tracking, and prediction stages, which can lead to significant\nprediction errors due to accumulated inaccuracies between stages. Recent\nadvances have improved the feature representation of multi-camera perception\nsystems through Bird's-Eye View (BEV) transformations, boosting the development\nof end-to-end systems capable of predicting environmental elements directly\nfrom vehicle sensor data. These systems, however, often suffer from high\nprocessing times and number of parameters, creating challenges for real-world\ndeployment. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel BEV instance\nprediction architecture based on a simplified paradigm that relies only on\ninstance segmentation and flow prediction. The proposed system prioritizes\nspeed, aiming at reduced parameter counts and inference times compared to\nexisting SOTA architectures, thanks to the incorporation of an efficient\ntransformer-based architecture.

Then, an intriguing question is that can\nwe realize much more physical models with exact solvable MEs? Here we uncover\nthe hidden self-duality in a class of quasiperiodic network models constituted\nby periodic sites and quasiperiodic sites.

The mosaic models studied in the literature are the simplest quasiperiodic\nnetowork models.

A survey of 108 Khmer native speakers, including\nstudents, employees, and professionals, revealed that many frequently encounter\nchallenges with homophones in their writing, often struggling to choose the\ncorrect word based on context. The survey also highlighted the absence of\neffective tools to address homophone errors in Khmer, which complicates the\nwriting process. Additionally, a review of existing studies on spelling\ncorrection in other languages, such as English, Azerbaijani, and Bangla,\nidentified a lack of research focused specifically on homophones, particularly\nin the Khmer language. In summary, this research highlights the necessity for a\nspecialized tool to address Khmer homophone errors. By bridging current gaps in\nresearch and available resources, such a tool would enhance the confidence and\naccuracy of Khmer authors in their writing, thereby contributing to the\nenrichment and preservation of the language. Continued efforts in this domain\nare essential for ensuring that Khmer can leverage advancements in technology\nand linguistics effectively.",

    "abstract": "Accurate spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for the sustainable\ndevelopment of smart cities. However, current approaches often struggle to\ncapture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking\nglobal relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques\npredominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global\nrelations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient\nfor capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose\nST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with\nself-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations\neffectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic\ncomplexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we\nintroduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential\nregions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce\na spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial\nneighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic\ninterpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental\nevaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of\nST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in\ncomputational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance,\napproximately 1%.",

We used the public code SteParKin to derive their\ngalactic space velocities and identify members in the different galactic\npopulations. We also identified candidate members in young stellar kinematic\ngroups, with ages ranging from 1 Ma to 800 Ma with SteParKin, LACEwING, and\nBANYAN {\\Sigma}. We removed known close binaries and perform an analysis of\nkinematic, rotation, and activity indicators (rotational periods and projected\nvelocities, Halpha, X-rays, and UV emission) for 1546 M dwarfs. We defined five\nrotation-activity-colour relations satisfied by young ({\\tau} <= 800 Ma) stars.\nResults. We identified 191 young M dwarf candidates (~12%), 113 of which are\nnewly recognised in this work. In this young sample, there are 118 very active\nstars based on H{\\alpha} emission, fast rotation, and X-ray and UV emission\nexcess. Of them, 27 have also strong magnetic fields, 9 of which are likely\nyounger than 50 Ma. Additionally, there are 87 potentially young stars and 99\nstars with a dubious youth classification, which may increase the fraction of\nyoung stars to an astounding 24%.

We study the impact of model\nmerging through model similarity metrics and contributions of individual models\nbeing merged.

Among\navailable methods, the classical simulation of quantum circuits inspired by\ndensity functional theory -- the so-called QC-DFT method, shows promise for\nlarge circuit simulations as it approximates the quantum circuits using\nsingle-qubit reduced density matrices to model multi-qubit systems. However,\nthe QC-DFT method performs very poorly when dealing with multi-qubit gates. In\nthis work, we introduce a novel CNOT \"functional\" that leverages neural\nnetworks to generate unitary transformations, effectively mitigating the\nsimulation errors observed in the original QC-DFT method. For random circuit\nsimulations, our modified QC-DFT enables efficient computation of single-qubit\nmarginal measurement probabilities, or single-qubit probability (SQPs), and\nachieves lower SQP errors and higher fidelities than the original QC-DFT\nmethod. Despite some limitations in capturing full entanglement and joint\nprobability distributions, we find potential applications of SQPs in simulating\nShor's and Grover's algorithms for specific solution classes.

The\nmost feasible approach is to adopt offline reinforcement learning from limited\ntrajectory samples.

This results in critical policy failures and generalization errors in\nsensitive domains like Real-Time Communication (RTC). We solve this crucial\nproblem of identifying robust actions in presence of domain shifts due to\nunseen exogenous stochastic factors in the wild.

The term\n\"generative\" reflects AI's ability to iteratively produce structured outputs,\nwhile \"midtended\" captures the potential hybrid (human-AI) nature of the\nprocess. It stands between traditional conceptions of intended creation,\nunderstood directed from within, and extended processes that bring\nexo-biological processes into the creative process. We examine current\ngenerative technologies (based on multimodal transformer architectures typical\nof large language models like ChatGPT), to explain how they can transform human\ncognitive agency beyond what standard theories of extended cognition can\ncapture. We suggest that the type of cognitive activity typical of the coupling\nbetween a human and generative technologies is closer (but not equivalent) to\nsocial cognition than to classical extended cognitive paradigms. Yet, it\ndeserves a specific treatment. We provide an explicit definition of generative\nmidtended cognition in which we treat interventions by AI systems as\nconstitutive of the agent's intentional creative processes. Furthermore, we\ndistinguish two dimensions of generative hybrid creativity: 1. Width: captures\nthe sensitivity of the context of the generative process (from the single\nletter to the whole historical and surrounding data), 2. Depth: captures the\ngranularity of iteration loops involved in the process. Generative midtended\ncognition stands in the middle depth between conversational forms of cognition\nin which complete utterances or creative units are exchanged, and\nmicro-cognitive (e.g. neural) subpersonal processes.

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by abrupt seizures.\nAlthough seizures may appear random, they are often preceded by early warning\nsigns in neural signals, notably, critical slowing down, a phenomenon in which\nthe system's recovery rate from perturbations declines when it approaches a\ncritical point. Detecting these markers could enable preventive therapies. This\npaper introduces a multi-stable slow-fast system to capture critical slowing\ndown in epileptic dynamics. We construct regions of attraction for stable\nstates, shedding light on how dynamic bifurcations drive pathological\noscillations. We derive the recovery rate after perturbations to formalize\ncritical slowing down. A novel algorithm for detecting precursors to ictal\ntransitions is presented, along with a proof-of-concept event-based feedback\ncontrol strategy to prevent impending pathological oscillations.

    "abstract": "Neural vocoders often struggle with aliasing in latent feature spaces, caused\nby time-domain nonlinear operations and resampling layers. Aliasing folds\nhigh-frequency components into the low-frequency range, making aliased and\noriginal frequency components indistinguishable and introducing two practical\nissues. First, aliasing complicates the waveform generation process, as the\nsubsequent layers must address these aliasing effects, increasing the\ncomputational complexity. Second, it limits extrapolation performance,\nparticularly in handling high fundamental frequencies, which degrades the\nperceptual quality of generated speech waveforms. This paper demonstrates that\n1) time-domain nonlinear operations inevitably introduce aliasing but provide a\nstrong inductive bias for harmonic generation, and 2) time-frequency-domain\nprocessing can achieve aliasing-free waveform synthesis but lacks the inductive\nbias for effective harmonic generation. Building on this insight, we propose\nWavehax, an aliasing-free neural WAVEform generator that integrates 2D\nconvolution and a HArmonic prior for reliable Complex Spectrogram estimation.\nExperimental results show that Wavehax achieves speech quality comparable to\nexisting high-fidelity neural vocoders and exhibits exceptional robustness in\nscenarios requiring high fundamental frequency extrapolation, where aliasing\neffects become typically severe.

Conventional\ncomputational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and\nnot easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been\ndeveloped using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on\nextensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can\nachieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the\nfoundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as\nmolecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques.

Here we examine the effects\nof pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an\nanalytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank\nstructures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation\nof the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact\non responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions\nwith cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of\nconnectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes\nthan other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a\nstrong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a\npotential instability that requires revisiting the classical\nexcitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs,\nwe show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where\nan increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity\ndue to the recurrent feedback.

To this end, automated code\nchecker generation is anticipated to ease the burden of checker development. In\nthis paper, we propose AutoChecker, an innovative LLM-powered approach that can\nwrite code checkers automatically based on only a rule description and a test\nsuite. To achieve comprehensive checking logic, AutoChecker incrementally\nupdates the checker's logic by focusing on solving one selected case each time.\nTo obtain precise API knowledge, during each iteration, it leverages\nfine-grained logic-guided API-context retrieval, where it first decomposes the\nchecking logic into a series of sub-operations and then retrieves\nchecker-related API-contexts for each sub-operation. For evaluation, we apply\nAutoChecker, five baselines, and three ablation methods using multiple LLMs to\ngenerate checkers for 20 randomly selected PMD rules. Experimental results show\nthat AutoChecker significantly outperforms others across all effectiveness\nmetrics, with an average test pass rate of 82.28%.

    "abstract": "Non-equilibrium quantum transport is crucial to technological advances\nranging from nanoelectronics to thermal management. In essence, it deals with\nthe coherent transfer of energy and (quasi-)particles through quantum channels\nbetween thermodynamic baths. A complete understanding of quantum transport thus\nrequires the ability to simulate and probe macroscopic and microscopic physics\non equal footing. Using a superconducting quantum processor, we demonstrate the\nemergence of non-equilibrium steady quantum transport by emulating the baths\nwith qubit ladders and realising steady particle currents between the baths. We\nexperimentally show that the currents are independent of the microscopic\ndetails of bath initialisation, and their temporal fluctuations decrease\nrapidly with the size of the baths, emulating those predicted by thermodynamic\nbaths. The above characteristics are experimental evidence of pure-state\nstatistical mechanics and prethermalisation in non-equilibrium many-body\nquantum systems. Furthermore, by utilising precise controls and measurements\nwith single-site resolution, we demonstrate the capability to tune steady\ncurrents by manipulating the macroscopic properties of the baths, including\nfilling and spectral properties. Our investigation paves the way for a new\ngeneration of experimental exploration of non-equilibrium quantum transport in\nstrongly correlated quantum matter.",

The increasingly available data\nand independent contractors have enabled these platforms to design customized\nservices and a cost-efficient workforce to effectively match demand and supply.\nIn practice, a diverse landscape of the workforce has been observed: some rely\nsolely on either employees or contractors, others use a blended workforce with\nboth types of workers. In this paper, we consider a profit-maximizing service\nprovider (SP) that decides to offer a single service or two differentiated\nservices, along with the pricing and staffing of the workforce with employees\nand/or contractors, to price- and waiting-sensitive customers. Contractors\nindependently determine whether or not to participate in the marketplace based\non private reservation rates and per-service wage offered by the SP, while it\ncontrols the number of employees who receive per-hour wage. Under a single\nservice, we show that the SP relies on either employees or contractors and\nidentify sufficient and necessary conditions in which one workforce is better\nthan the other. Under the optimal service deployment, we show that the SP\noffers either a single service relying solely on employees or contractors, or\ntwo differentiated services with a hybrid workforce depending on the service\nvalue and cost efficiencies of employees and contractors. Our analysis suggests\nthat proliferating services with a blended workforce could improve the SP's\nprofit significantly, and identifies conditions in which this value is\nsignificant.

However, existing SNN models, still face\nhigh computational costs due to the numerous time steps as well as network\ndepth and scale. The tens of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses in\nthe human brain are developed from only 20,000 genes, which inspires us to\ndesign an efficient genetic encoding strategy that dynamic evolves to regulate\nlarge-scale deep SNNs at low cost. Therefore, we first propose a genetically\nscaled SNN encoding scheme that incorporates globally shared genetic\ninteractions to indirectly optimize neuronal encoding instead of weight, which\nobviously brings about reductions in parameters and energy consumption. Then, a\nspatio-temporal evolutionary framework is designed to optimize the inherently\ninitial wiring rules. Two dynamic regularization operators in the fitness\nfunction evolve the neuronal encoding to a suitable distribution and enhance\ninformation quality of the genetic interaction respectively, substantially\naccelerating evolutionary speed and improving efficiency.

Here, we\nevaluate moral judgments across 52 different LLMs, including multiple versions\nof proprietary models (GPT, Claude, Gemini) and open-source alternatives\n(Llama, Gemma), to assess their alignment with human moral preferences in\nautonomous driving scenarios. Using a conjoint analysis framework, we evaluated\nhow closely LLM responses aligned with human preferences in ethical dilemmas\nand examined the effects of model size, updates, and architecture.

    "abstract": "While existing query-based 3D end-to-end visual trackers integrate detection\nand tracking via the tracking-by-attention paradigm, these two chicken-and-egg\ntasks encounter optimization difficulties when sharing the same parameters. Our\nfindings reveal that these difficulties arise due to two inherent constraints\non the self-attention mechanism, i.e., over-deduplication for object queries\nand self-centric attention for track queries. In contrast, removing the\nself-attention mechanism not only minimally impacts regression predictions of\nthe tracker, but also tends to generate more latent candidate boxes. Based on\nthese analyses, we present SynCL, a novel plug-and-play synergistic training\nstrategy designed to co-facilitate multi-task learning for detection and\ntracking. Specifically, we propose a Task-specific Hybrid Matching module for a\nweight-shared cross-attention-based decoder that matches the targets of track\nqueries with multiple object queries to exploit promising candidates overlooked\nby the self-attention mechanism. To flexibly select optimal candidates for the\none-to-many matching, we also design a Dynamic Query Filtering module\ncontrolled by model training status. Moreover, we introduce Instance-aware\nContrastive Learning to break through the barrier of self-centric attention for\ntrack queries, effectively bridging the gap between detection and tracking.\nWithout additional inference costs, SynCL consistently delivers improvements in\nvarious benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance with $58.9\\%$\nAMOTA on the nuScenes dataset.

However, the emergent ordered states arising from interactions\nin intrinsic multi-orbital flat bands in kagome lattice materials remain\nlargely unexplored. In contrast to the vanadium-based AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs),\nthe newly discovered kagome metal CsCr3Sb5, featuring pressurized\nsuperconductivity, antiferromagnetism, structural phase transition, and density\nwave orders, provides a rich platform for investigating strong electron\ncorrelations in multi-orbital flat bands at the Fermi surface. Here, using\nultrafast optical techniques, we reveal the gap opening and the emergence of a\ndistinct 1x4 charge density wave (CDW) at low temperatures in CsCr3Sb5. We also\nfind that this CDW reduces the rotational symmetry to three inequivalent\nnematic domains, and the exotic nematicity is further amplified by the\ndegeneracy lifting of the multi-orbital flat bands, similar to some iron-based\nsuperconductors. Surprisingly, both CDW and orbital nematicity appear\nconcurrently with spin and structural orders at the same temperature,\nindicating that a single characteristic energy scale governs the low-energy\nflat band physics. Our study thus pioneers the investigation of ultrafast\ndynamics in flat band systems at the Fermi surface, offering new insights into\nthe interactions between multiple elementary excitations in strongly correlated\nsystems.",

Here, we propose an\nefficient scheme to achieve nonreciprocal interaction and entanglement between\ntwo qubits by combining coherent and dissipative couplings in a superconducting\nplatform, where two coherently coupled transmon qubits simultaneously interact\nwith a transmission line waveguide. The coherent interaction between the\ntransmon qubits can be achieved via capacitive coupling or via an intermediary\ncavity mode, while the dissipative interaction is induced by the transmission\nline via reservoir engineering. With high tunability of superconducting qubits,\ntheir positions along the transmission line can be adjusted to tune the\ndissipative coupling, enabling to tailor reciprocal and nonreciprocal\ninteractions between the qubits. A fully nonreciprocal interaction can be\nachieved when the separation between the two qubits is $(4n+3)\\lambda_{0} /4$,\nwhere $n$ is an integer and $\\lambda_{0}$ is the photon wavelength. This\nnonreciprocal interaction enables the generation of nonreciprocal entanglement\nbetween the two transmon qubits. Furthermore, applying a drive field to one of\nthe qubit can stabilize the system into a nonreciprocal steady-state entangled\nstate.

Alternatively, input-output (I/O) examples\nprovide an accessible, unambiguous, and flexible way to describe\nfunctionalities. However, their inherent diversity, opaqueness, and\nincompleteness impose greater challenges for understanding and implementing the\ntarget requirements. Therefore, generating code from I/O examples (i.e.,\nexample-based code generation) provides a new perspective, allowing us to\nadditionally evaluate LLMs' capability to infer target functionalities from\nlimited information and to process new-form requirements. However, related\nresearch about LLMs in example-based code generation remains largely\nunexplored. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive study\non example-based code generation using LLMs. We adopt an iterative evaluation\nframework and formalize the objective of example-based code generation as two\nsequential sub-objectives: generating code conforming to the given examples and\ngenerating code that successfully implements the target functionalities from\n(iteratively) given examples. We assess six state-of-the-art LLMs using a new\nbenchmark of 172 diverse target functionalities. The results demonstrate that\nwhen requirements are described using iterative I/O examples rather than\nnatural language, the LLMs' score decreases by over 60%, and the vast majority\n(even over 95%) of successfully implemented functionalities are achieved in the\nfirst round of the iterations. Furthermore, we also find that combining I/O\nexamples with even imprecise and fragmental natural language descriptions\ngreatly improves LLM performance, and the selection of initial I/O examples can\nalso influence the score, suggesting opportunities for prompt optimization.",

In spite of the preliminary empirical success of\nsketched adaptive methods, existing convergence analyses show the communication\ncost to have a linear dependence on the ambient dimension, i.e., number of\nparameters, which is prohibitively high for modern deep learning models. In\nthis work, we introduce specific sketched adaptive federated learning (SAFL)\nalgorithms and, as our main contribution, provide theoretical convergence\nanalyses in different FL settings with guarantees on communication cost\ndepending only logarithmically (instead of linearly) on the ambient dimension.\nUnlike existing analyses, we show that the entry-wise sketching noise existent\nin the preconditioners and the first moments of SAFL can be implicitly\naddressed by leveraging the recently-popularized anisotropic curvatures in deep\nlearning losses, e.g., fast decaying loss Hessian eigen-values. In the i.i.d.\nclient setting of FL, we show that SAFL achieves asymptotic $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$\nconvergence, and converges faster in the initial epochs. In the non-i.i.d.\nclient setting, where non-adaptive methods lack convergence guarantees, we show\nthat SACFL (SAFL with clipping) algorithms can provably converge in spite of\nthe additional heavy-tailed noise. Our theoretical claims are supported by\nempirical studies on vision and language tasks, and in both fine-tuning and\ntraining-from-scratch regimes.

Continual learning (CL) can help VLMs effectively adapt\nto new data distributions without joint training, but faces challenges of\ncatastrophic forgetting and generalization forgetting. Although significant\nprogress has been achieved by distillation-based methods, they exhibit two\nsevere limitations. One is the popularly adopted single-teacher paradigm fails\nto impart comprehensive knowledge, The other is the existing methods\ninadequately leverage the multimodal information in the original training\ndataset, instead they rely on additional data for distillation, which increases\ncomputational and storage overhead. To mitigate both limitations, by drawing on\nKnowledge Integration Theory (KIT), we propose a Multi-Stage Knowledge\nIntegration network (MulKI) to emulate the human learning process in\ndistillation methods. MulKI achieves this through four stages, including\nEliciting Ideas, Adding New Ideas, Distinguishing Ideas, and Making\nConnections. During the four stages, we first leverage prototypes to align\nacross modalities, eliciting cross-modal knowledge, then adding new knowledge\nby constructing fine-grained intra- and inter-modality relationships with\nprototypes. After that, knowledge from two teacher models is adaptively\ndistinguished and re-weighted. Finally, we connect between models from intra-\nand inter-task, integrating preceding and new knowledge.

However, solving these nonlinear PDEs is\nchallenging due to the vast computational resources they demand, highlighting\nthe pressing need for more efficient computational methods. Quantum computing\noffers a promising but technically challenging approach to solving nonlinear\nPDEs. Recently, Liao proposed a framework that leverages quantum computing to\naccelerate the solution of nonlinear PDEs based on the homotopy analysis method\n(HAM), a semi-analytical technique that transforms nonlinear PDEs into a series\nof linear PDEs. However, the no-cloning theorem in quantum computing poses a\nmajor limitation, where directly applying quantum simulation to each HAM step\nresults in exponential complexity growth with the HAM truncation order. This\nstudy introduces a \"secondary linearization\" approach that maps the whole HAM\nprocess into a system of linear PDEs, allowing for a one-time solution using\nestablished quantum PDE solvers. Our method preserves the exponential speedup\nof quantum linear PDE solvers while ensuring that computational complexity\nincreases only polynomially with the HAM truncation order. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our approach by applying it to the Burgers' equation and the\nKorteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation.

While\nexisting NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining\nthem or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work\nas these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in\nlow-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an\nimplicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process.\nTo this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can\nreconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images.\nThe key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images\nvia multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF,\nrespectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise\nDecomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene\nrepresentation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the\nestimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information.

A novel, large-sized, tiltrotor concept is\npresented, accompanied by a derived mathematical model describing the aircrafts\nbehaviours. A PID control method has been used to control the height, pitch,\nand velocity variations within the transition mode with secondary control loop\ndeveloped to control the tilt angle during transition. The derived model and\ncontrol are then implemented within a MATLAB simulation, where the control\nmethod was iterated to improve performance.

    "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) image stitching can expand the field-of-view (FOV) by\ncombining multiple US images from varied probe positions. However, registering\nUS images with only partially overlapping anatomical contents is a challenging\ntask. In this work, we introduce SynStitch, a self-supervised framework\ndesigned for 2DUS stitching. SynStitch consists of a synthetic stitching pair\ngeneration module (SSPGM) and an image stitching module (ISM). SSPGM utilizes a\npatch-conditioned ControlNet to generate realistic 2DUS stitching pairs with\nknown affine matrix from a single input image. ISM then utilizes this synthetic\npaired data to learn 2DUS stitching in a supervised manner. Our framework was\nevaluated against multiple leading methods on a kidney ultrasound dataset,\ndemonstrating superior 2DUS stitching performance through both qualitative and\nquantitative analyses. The code will be made public upon acceptance of the\npaper.",

    "abstract": "Humans excel at adapting perceptions and actions to diverse environments,\nenabling efficient interaction with the external world. This adaptive\ncapability relies on the biological nervous system (BNS), which activates\ndifferent brain regions for distinct tasks. Meta-learning similarly trains\nmachines to handle multiple tasks but relies on a fixed network structure, not\nas flexible as BNS. To investigate the role of flexible network structure (FNS)\nin meta-learning, we conduct extensive empirical and theoretical analyses,\nfinding that model performance is tied to structure, with no universally\noptimal pattern across tasks. This reveals the crucial role of FNS in\nmeta-learning, ensuring meta-learning to generate the optimal structure for\neach task, thereby maximizing the performance and learning efficiency of\nmeta-learning. Motivated by this insight, we propose to define, measure, and\nmodel FNS in meta-learning. First, we define that an effective FNS should\npossess frugality, plasticity, and sensitivity. Then, to quantify FNS in\npractice, we present three measurements for these properties, collectively\nforming the \\emph{structure constraint} with theoretical supports. Building on\nthis, we finally propose Neuromodulated Meta-Learning (NeuronML) to model FNS\nin meta-learning. It utilizes bi-level optimization to update both weights and\nstructure with the structure constraint.

Our data-driven scheme treats an unknown\nnetwork as an interconnection of individual agents (a.k.a. subsystems) and aims\nat constructing their symbolic models, referred to as discrete-domain\nrepresentations of unknown agents, by collecting data from their trajectories.\nThe primary objective is to synthesize a control strategy that guarantees\ndesired behaviors over an unknown network by employing local controllers,\nderived from symbolic models of individual agents. To achieve this, we leverage\nthe concept of alternating sub-bisimulation function (ASBF) to capture the\ncloseness between state trajectories of each unknown agent and its data-driven\nsymbolic model. Under a newly developed data-driven compositional condition, we\nthen establish an alternating bisimulation function (ABF) between an unknown\nnetwork and its symbolic model, based on ASBFs of individual agents, while\nproviding correctness guarantees. Despite the sample complexity in existing\nwork being exponential with respect to the network size, we demonstrate that\nour divide-and-conquer strategy significantly reduces it to a linear scale with\nrespect to the number of agents. We also showcase that our data-driven\ncompositional condition does not necessitate the traditional small-gain\ncondition, which demands precise knowledge of the interconnection topology for\nits fulfillment.

Online reinforcement learning is often adopted to\ntrain the RL models so the models can directly adapt to real network\nenvironments. However, its trail-and-error manner can also cause catastrophic\ndegradation of the quality of experience (QoE) of RTC application at run time.\nThus, safeguard strategies such as falling back to hand-crafted heuristics can\nbe used to run along with RL models to guarantee the actions explored in the\ntraining sensible, despite that these safeguard strategies interrupt the\nlearning process and make it more challenging to discover optimal RL policies.\n  The recent emergence of loss-tolerant neural video codecs (NVC) naturally\nprovides a layer of protection for the online learning of RL-based congestion\ncontrol because of its resilience to packet losses, but such packet loss\nresilience have not been fully exploited in prior works yet. In this paper, we\npresent a reinforcement learning (RL) based congestion control which can be\naware of and takes advantage of packet loss tolerance characteristic of NVCs\nvia reward in online RL learning. Through extensive evaluation on various\nvideos and network traces in a simulated environment, we demonstrate that our\nNVC-aware CC running with the loss-tolerant NVC reduces the training time by\n41\\% compared to other prior RL-based CCs. It also boosts the mean video\nquality by 0.3 to 1.6dB, lower the tail frame delay by 3 to 200ms, and reduces\nthe video stalls by 20\\% to 77\\% in comparison with other baseline RTC CCs.",

A major cause of concern is\nmethane, a greenhouse gas produced by the anaerobic biodegradation of\nhydrocarbons in oil sands residues, or tailings, stored in settle basins\ncommonly known as oil sands tailing ponds. In order to determine the methane\nemitting potential of these tailing ponds and have future methane projections,\nwe use real-time weather data, mechanistic models developed from laboratory\ncontrolled experiments, and industrial reports to train a physics constrained\nmachine learning model. Our trained model can successfully identify the\ndirections of active ponds and estimate their emission levels, which are\ngenerally hard to obtain due to data sampling restrictions. We found that each\nactive oil sands tailing pond could emit between 950 to 1500 tonnes of methane\nper year, whose environmental impact is equivalent to carbon dioxide emissions\nfrom at least 6000 gasoline powered vehicles. Although abandoned ponds are\noften presumed to have insignificant emissions, our findings indicate that\nthese ponds could become active over time and potentially emit up to 1000\ntonnes of methane each year. Taking an average over all datasets that was used\nin model training, we estimate that emissions around major oil sands regions\nwould need to be reduced by approximately 12% over a year, to reduce the\naverage methane concentrations to 2005 levels.",

In this work, we develop TimeText Corpus (TTC), a\ncarefully curated, time-aligned text and time dataset for multimodal\nforecasting. Our dataset is composed of sequences of numbers and text aligned\nto timestamps, and includes data from two different domains: climate science\nand healthcare. Our data is a significant contribution to the rare selection of\navailable multimodal datasets. We also propose the Hybrid Multi-Modal\nForecaster (Hybrid-MMF), a multimodal LLM that jointly forecasts both text and\ntime series data using shared embeddings. However, contrary to our\nexpectations, our Hybrid-MMF model does not outperform existing baselines in\nour experiments.

    "abstract": "Generalization in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) across unseen environment\nvariations often requires training over a diverse set of scenarios. Many\nexisting DRL algorithms struggle with efficiency when handling numerous\nvariations. The Generalist-Specialist Learning (GSL) framework addresses this\nby first training a generalist model on all variations, then creating\nspecialists from the generalist's weights, each focusing on a subset of\nvariations. The generalist then refines its learning with assistance from the\nspecialists. However, random task partitioning in GSL can impede performance by\nassigning vastly different variations to the same specialist, often resulting\nin each specialist focusing on only one variation, which raises computational\ncosts. To improve this, we propose Generalist-Specialist Learning with Point\nCloud Feature-based Task Partitioning (GSL-PCD). Our approach clusters\nenvironment variations based on features extracted from object point clouds and\nuses balanced clustering with a greedy algorithm to assign similar variations\nto the same specialist. Evaluations on robotic manipulation tasks from the\nManiSkill benchmark demonstrate that point cloud feature-based partitioning\noutperforms vanilla partitioning by 9.4%, with a fixed number of specialists,\nand reduces computational and sample requirements by 50% to achieve comparable\nperformance.",

This requires a stitching process to combine each\nshallow SDF in the collection together into one SDF representing the signed\nclosest distance to the boundary of the entire body. To achieve this we augment\neach shallow SDF with an additional output that resolves whether or not the\nindividual shallow SDF value is referring to a closest point on the boundary of\nthe body, or to a point on the interior of the body (but on the boundary of the\nindividual shallow SDF).

Despite the role\nthat compressed sensing (CS) and deep learning (DL)-based methods have played\nin improving image quality for high-field MRI, their adoption for low-field\nimaging is still in its infancy, and it remains unclear how robust these\nmethods are in low-SNR regimes.\n  Here, we propose, investigate, and compare four reconstruction approaches:\n(i) L1-wavelet CS; (ii) a data-driven network; (iii) an unrolled network; and\n(iv) a Swin Transformer Cascade. We evaluate their performance across a range\nof SNR values using publicly available datasets and ultra-low field (6.5 mT)\nMRI data. Our results show that the unrolled network and Swin Transformer\ncascade outperform CS and data-driven models. While transformer-based models\nachieve the highest performance at high SNR, unrolled convolution-based\nnetworks are more robust in ultra-low SNR settings and often outperform\ntransformers, indicating that simpler DL architectures may be better suited to\nlow-field MRI.\n  This work highlights both the potential and limitations of advanced\nreconstruction techniques in low-field MRI and pinpoints effective DL\nstrategies for addressing SNR challenges.",

    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning-based salient object detection (SOD) in optical\nremote sensing images (ORSIs) have achieved significant breakthroughs. We\nobserve that existing ORSIs-SOD methods consistently center around optimizing\npixel features in the spatial domain, progressively distinguishing between\nbackgrounds and objects. However, pixel information represents local\nattributes, which are often correlated with their surrounding context. Even\nwith strategies expanding the local region, spatial features remain biased\ntowards local characteristics, lacking the ability of global perception. To\naddress this problem, we introduce the Fourier transform that generate global\nfrequency features and achieve an image-size receptive field. To be specific,\nwe propose a novel United Domain Cognition Network (UDCNet) to jointly explore\nthe global-local information in the frequency and spatial domains. Technically,\nwe first design a frequency-spatial domain transformer block that mutually\namalgamates the complementary local spatial and global frequency features to\nstrength the capability of initial input features. Furthermore, a dense\nsemantic excavation module is constructed to capture higher-level semantic for\nguiding the positioning of remote sensing objects. Finally, we devise a\ndual-branch joint optimization decoder that applies the saliency and edge\nbranches to generate high-quality representations for predicting salient\nobjects. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nUDCNet method over 24 state-of-the-art models, through extensive quantitative\nand qualitative comparisons in three widely-used ORSIs-SOD datasets.

Recently, semi-dense\nmatching approaches have achieved substantial performance enhancements and\nestablished a widely-accepted coarse-to-fine paradigm. However, the majority of\nexisting methods focus on improving coarse feature representation rather than\nthe fine-matching module. Prior fine-matching techniques, which rely on\npoint-to-patch matching probability expectation or direct regression, often\nlack precision and do not guarantee the continuity of feature points across\nsequential images. To address this limitation, this paper concentrates on\nenhancing the fine-matching module in the semi-dense matching framework. We\nemploy a lightweight and efficient homography estimation network to generate\nthe perspective mapping between patches obtained from coarse matching. This\npatch-to-patch approach achieves the overall alignment of two patches,\nresulting in a higher sub-pixel accuracy by incorporating additional\nconstraints. By leveraging the homography estimation between patches, we can\nachieve a dense matching result with low computational cost. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy compared to\nprevious semi-dense matchers.

Here, we present the h-CMD method, short for hybrid\ncentroid molecular dynamics, that combines the recently introduced fast\nquasi-CMD (f-QCMD) method with fast CMD (f-CMD). In this scheme, molecules that\nare believed to suffer more seriously from the curvature problem of CMD, e.g.,\nwater, are treated with f-QCMD, while the rest, e.g., solid surfaces, are\ntreated with f-CMD. To test the accuracy of the newly introduced scheme, the\ninfrared spectra of the interfacial D2O confined in the archetypal ZIF-90\nframework are simulated using h-CMD compared to a variety of other PI methods,\nincluding thermostatted ring-polymer molecular dynamics (T-RPMD) and partially\nadiabatic CMD as well as f-CMD and experiment as reference. Comparisons are\nalso made to classical MD, where nuclear quantum effects are neglected\nentirely. Our detailed comparisons at different temperatures of 250-600 K show\nthat h-CMD produces O-D stretches that are in close agreement with the\nexperiment, correcting the known curvature problem and red-shifting of the\nstretch peaks of CMD. h-CMD also corrects the known issues associated with too\nartificially dampened and broadened spectra of T-RPMD, which leads to missing\nthe characteristic doublet feature of the interfacial confined water, rendering\nit unsuitable for these systems.

    "abstract": "Satellites are widely used to estimate and monitor ground cover, providing\ncritical information to address the challenges posed by climate change.\nHigh-resolution satellite images help to identify smaller features on the\nground and classification of ground cover types. Small satellites have become\nvery popular recently due to their cost-effectiveness. However, smaller\nsatellites have weaker spatial resolution, and preprocessing using recent\ngenerative models made it possible to enhance the resolution of these satellite\nimages. The objective of this paper is to propose computationally efficient\nguided or image-conditioned denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to perform\nsuper-resolution on low-quality images. Denoising based on stochastic ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs) typically takes hundreds of iterations and it can\nbe reduced using deterministic ODEs. I propose Consistency Models (CM) that\nutilize deterministic ODEs for efficient denoising and perform super resolution\non satellite images. The DOTA v2.0 image dataset that is used to develop object\ndetectors needed for urban planning and ground cover estimation, is used in\nthis project. The Stable Diffusion model is used as the base model, and the DDM\nin Stable Diffusion is converted into a Consistency Model (CM) using\nTeacher-Student Distillation to apply deterministic denoising. Stable diffusion\nwith modified CM has successfully improved the resolution of satellite images\nby a factor of 16, and the computational time was reduced by a factor of 20\ncompared to stochastic denoising methods. The FID score of low-resolution\nimages improved from 10.0 to 1.9 after increasing the image resolution using my\nalgorithm for consistency models.",

    "abstract": "Controllable image generation has always been one of the core demands in\nimage generation, aiming to create images that are both creative and logical\nwhile satisfying additional specified conditions. In the post-AIGC era,\ncontrollable generation relies on diffusion models and is accomplished by\nmaintaining certain components or introducing inference interferences. This\npaper addresses key challenges in controllable generation: 1. mismatched object\nattributes during generation and poor prompt-following effects; 2. inadequate\ncompletion of controllable layouts. We propose a train-free method based on\nattention loss backward, cleverly controlling the cross attention map.

Our approach\nrelies on restating the governing equations to enable discontinuous\napproximations of thermodynamic variables and a variational continuous time\nintegration. A key novelty is the inclusion of centred and upwinded fluxes. The\nproposed semi-discrete system conserves discrete entropy for centred fluxes,\nmonotonically damps entropy for upwinded fluxes, and conserves energy. The\nfully discrete scheme reflects entropy conservation at the continuous level.\nThe ability of a new linearised Jacobian, which accounts for both centred and\nupwinded fluxes, to capture large variations in buoyancy and simulate thermally\nunstable flows for long periods of time is demonstrated for two different\ntransient case studies. The first involves a thermogeostrophic instability\nwhere including upwinded fluxes is shown to suppress spurious oscillations\nwhile successfully conserving energy and monotonically damping entropy.

Here, we predict that the antiferromagnetic monolayer MnBr possesses\nspontaneous valley polarization. The valley splitting of valence band maximum\nis 21.55 meV at K and K' points, which is originated from Mn-dx2-y2 orbital by\nanalyzing the effective Hamiltonian. Importantly, monolayer MnBr has zero Berry\ncurvature in the entire momentum space but non-zero spin-layer locked Berry\ncurvature, which offers the condition for the anomalous valley Hall effect. In\naddition, the magnitude of valley splitting can be signally tuned by the onsite\ncorrelation, strain, magnetization rotation, electric field, and built-in\nelectric field. The electric field and built-in electric field induce spin\nsplitting due to breaking the P symmetry. Therefore, the spin-layer locked\nanomalous valley Hall effect can be observed in MnBr.

Current practices in NLP often use\nsparse attention which may, unfortunately, lead to substantial inaccuracies, or\nhallucinations, in code generation tasks.

However, coupling a single quantum emitter to\ncavity within photonic circuitry towards creation of the Purcell-enhanced\nsingle-photon emission is elusive due to the complexity of integrating active\ndevices in low-loss photonic circuits. Here we demonstrate a hybrid micro-ring\nresonator (HMRR) coupled with self-assembled quantum dots (QDs) for\ncavity-enhanced deterministic single-photon emission. The HMRR cavity supports\nwhispering-gallery modes with quality factors up to 7800. By further\nintroducing a micro-heater, we show that the photon emission of QDs can be\nlocally and dynamically tuned over one free spectral ranges of the HMRR (~4\nnm). This allows precise tuning of individual QDs in resonance with the cavity\nmodes, thereby enhancing single-photon emission with a Purcell factor of about\n4.9. Our results on the hybrid integrated cavities coupled with two-level\nquantum emitters emerge as promising devices for chip-based scalable photonic\nquantum applications.",

In particular, betatron\nheating produces agyrotropic anisotropy which balances with gyrophase mixing. A\nhybrid CGL model is proposed based on the local densities of cyclotron and\nbetatron orbits, then validated by numerical experiments. The relation between\nanisotropy and shear is explored by constructing the kinetic equilibrium of a\nflow expanded in the flux function. Flow as a linear flux function is simply\nbi-Maxwellian, while higher powers display higher-moment deviations. Next,\nweakly collisional gyroviscosity (magnetized pressure-strain) is considered in\na forward process (forced flow) and an inverse process (forced anisotropy). The\nforward process phase-mixes flow into a simple flux function, freezing flow\ninto flux and inducing anisotropy. In the inverse process, betatron\nheating-induced anisotropy self-generates a sheared flow to resist changes in\nflux.

However, existing methods only consider designing certain\nstrategies for target samples to adapt, ignoring the exploration of customized\nlearning for different target samples. When the model encounters complex target\ndistribution, existing methods will perform limited due to the inability to\nclearly and comprehensively learn the knowledge of multiple types of target\nsamples. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on designing a framework to use\ndifferent strategies for comprehensively mining different target samples. We\npropose a novel source-free framework (SOUF) to achieve semi-supervised\nfine-tuning of the source pre-trained model on the target domain. Different\nfrom existing SSDA methods, SOUF decouples SSDA from the perspectives of\ndifferent target samples, specifically designing robust learning techniques for\nunlabeled, reliably labeled, and noisy pseudo-labeled target samples. For\nunlabeled target samples, probability-based weighted contrastive learning (PWC)\nhelps the model learn more discriminative feature representations. To mine the\nlatent knowledge of labeled target samples, reliability-based mixup contrastive\nlearning (RMC) learns complex knowledge from the constructed reliable sample\nset. Finally, predictive regularization learning (PR) further mitigates the\nmisleading effect of noisy pseudo-labeled samples on the model.

    "abstract": "The charge density wave (CDW) state is a widespread phenomenon in\nlow-dimensional metals/semimetals. The spectral weight of the associated folded\nbands (shadow bands) can be an intriguing trigger leading to additional Fermi\nsurface instability and unexplored phase transitions. The rare earth\ntri-telluride CeTe3 exhibits a single CDW stabilized below ~400 K and\nantiferromagnetism below ~3 K. The distinct periodicities between the Te-square\nnet, the CeTe block layer, and the CDW give rise to rich shadow band\nformations. In this work, we reveal the predominant scattering between the\noriginal and shadow bands at 4 K, with the scattering within the original bands\nbeing relatively suppressed at Fermi energy. This unconventional quasi-particle\nscattering collectively underscores the vital role of the shadow bands'\nspectral weight and the hidden matrix element effect, which are crucial for\ncontrolling electronic properties in this system. Furthermore, our finding\npoints to the existence of rich and unexplored Fermi surface instabilities,\nwhich potentially play a role in controlling the nature of long-range\nantiferromagnetism at lower temperatures in the presence of finite charge-spin\ninteraction.",

Both structural and semantic information\nare vital for successful KGC. However, existing methods only use either the\nstructural knowledge from the KG embeddings or the semantic information from\npre-trained language models (PLMs), leading to suboptimal model performance.\nMoreover, since PLMs are not trained on KGs, directly using PLMs to encode\ntriples may be inappropriate. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nframework called Bridge, which jointly encodes structural and semantic\ninformation of KGs. Specifically, we strategically encode entities and\nrelations separately by PLMs to better utilize the semantic knowledge of PLMs\nand enable structured representation learning via a structural learning\nprinciple. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between KGs and PLMs, we employ a\nself-supervised representation learning method called BYOL to fine-tune PLMs\nwith two different views of a triple. Unlike BYOL, which uses augmentation\nmethods to create two semantically similar views of the same image, potentially\naltering the semantic information. We strategically separate the triple into\ntwo parts to create different views, thus avoiding semantic alteration.\nExperiments demonstrate that Bridge outperforms the SOTA models on three\nbenchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Incremental graph learning has gained significant attention for its ability\nto address the catastrophic forgetting problem in graph representation\nlearning. However, traditional methods often rely on a large number of labels\nfor node classification, which is impractical in real-world applications. This\nmakes few-shot incremental learning on graphs a pressing need. Current methods\ntypically require extensive training samples from meta-learning to build memory\nand perform intensive fine-tuning of GNN parameters, leading to high memory\nconsumption and potential loss of previously learned knowledge. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce Mecoin, an efficient method for building and\nmaintaining memory. Mecoin employs Structured Memory Units to cache prototypes\nof learned categories, as well as Memory Construction Modules to update these\nprototypes for new categories through interactions between the nodes and the\ncached prototypes. Additionally, we have designed a Memory Representation\nAdaptation Module to store probabilities associated with each class prototype,\nreducing the need for parameter fine-tuning and lowering the forgetting rate.\nWhen a sample matches its corresponding class prototype, the relevant\nprobabilities are retrieved from the MRaM. Knowledge is then distilled back\ninto the GNN through a Graph Knowledge Distillation Module, preserving the\nmodel's memory. We analyze the effectiveness of Mecoin in terms of\ngeneralization error and explore the impact of different distillation\nstrategies on model performance through experiments and VC-dimension analysis.\nCompared to other related works, Mecoin shows superior performance in accuracy\nand forgetting rate.

By linearly changing the measurement probability $p$\nto cross the critical point $p_c$ with driving velocity $R$, we identify the\ndynamic scaling relation of the entanglement entropy $S$ versus $R$ at $p_c$.\nFor decreasing $p$ from the area-law phase, $S$ satisfies $S\\propto \\ln R$;\nwhile for increasing $p$ from the volume-law phase, $S$ satisfies $S\\propto\nR^{1/r}$ in which $r=z+1/\\nu$ with $z$ and $\\nu$ being the dynamic and\ncorrelation length exponents, respectively.

We used CHARA/MIRC to\nmeasure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companion orbiting the\nCepheid SU Cygni. We also present new radial velocity measurements from the\nHST. The combination of interferometric astrometry with optical and ultraviolet\nspectroscopy provides the full orbital elements of the system, in addition to\ncomponent masses and the distance to the Cepheid system. We measured the mass\nof the Cepheid, $M_A = 4.859\\pm0.058M_\\odot$, and its two companions, $M_{Ba} =\n3.595 \\pm 0.033 M_\\odot$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.546 \\pm 0.009 M_\\odot$. This is the\nmost accurate existing measurement of the mass of a Galactic Cepheid (1.2%).\nComparing with stellar evolution models, we show that the mass predicted is\nhigher than the measured mass of the Cepheid, similar to conclusions of our\nprevious work. We also measured the distance to the system to be $926.3 \\pm\n5.0$pc, i.e. an unprecedented parallax precision of $6\\mu$as (0.5%), being the\nmost precise and accurate distance for a Cepheid. Such precision is similar to\nwhat is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in $\\sim$ 2030) for\nsingle stars fainter than G = 13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as\nSU Cyg. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in\naccurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for\nthe expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core\novershooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed\nus to compare prediction period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement\nof 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations\ncalibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement.",

    "abstract": "When training deep neural networks, a model's generalization error is often\nobserved to follow a power scaling law dependent both on the model size and the\ndata size. Perhaps the best known example of such scaling laws are for\ntransformer-based large language models, where networks with billions of\nparameters are trained on trillions of tokens of text. Yet, despite sustained\nwidespread interest, a rigorous understanding of why transformer scaling laws\nexist is still missing. To answer this question, we establish novel statistical\nestimation and mathematical approximation theories for transformers when the\ninput data are concentrated on a low-dimensional manifold. Our theory predicts\na power law between the generalization error and both the training data size\nand the network size for transformers, where the power depends on the intrinsic\ndimension $d$ of the training data. Notably, the constructed model architecture\nis shallow, requiring only logarithmic depth in $d$. By leveraging\nlow-dimensional data structures under a manifold hypothesis, we are able to\nexplain transformer scaling laws in a way which respects the data geometry.\nMoreover, we test our theory with empirical observation by training LLMs on\nnatural language datasets. We find the observed empirical data scaling laws\nclosely agree with our theoretical predictions. Taken together, these results\nrigorously show the intrinsic dimension of data to be a crucial quantity\naffecting transformer scaling laws in both theory and practice.",

In\nthis article, we consider the execution problem of targeting the volume\nweighted average price (VWAP) and propose a relaxed stochastic optimization\nproblem with an entropy regularizer to encourage more exploration. We derive\nthe explicit formula of the optimal policy, which is Gaussian distributed, with\nits mean value being the solution to the original problem. Extending the\nframework of continuous RL to processes with jumps, we provide some theoretical\nproofs for RL algorithms. First, minimizing the martingale loss function leads\nto the optimal parameter estimates in the mean-square sense, and the second\nalgorithm is to use the martingale orthogonality condition. In addition to the\nRL algorithm, we also propose another learning algorithm: adaptive dynamic\nprogramming (ADP) algorithm, and verify the performance of both in two\ndifferent environments across different random seeds. Convergence of all\nalgorithms has been verified in different environments, and shows a larger\nadvantage in the environment with stronger price impact. ADP is a good choice\nwhen the agent fully understands the environment and can estimate the\nparameters well.

This model uses an integrated end plug simulation model\nincluding, heating, equilibrium, and transport combined with a new formulation\nof the plasma operation contours (POPCONs) technique for the tandem mirror\ncentral cell. Using this model in concert with machine learning optimization\ntechniques, it is shown that an end plug utilizing high temperature\nsuperconducting magnets and modern neutral beams enables a classical tandem\nmirror pilot plant producing a fusion gain Q > 5.

The detailed end plug modelling performed in\nthis work has highlighted the importance of classical radial transport and\nneutral beam absorption efficiency on end plug viability. The central cell\nPOPCON technique allows consideration of a wide range of parameters in the\nrelatively simple near-Maxwellian central cell, facilitating the selection of\nmore optimal central cell plasmas. These advances make it possible to find more\nconservative classical tandem mirror fusion pilot plant operating points with\nlower temperatures, neutral beam energies, and end plug performance\nrequirements than designs in the literature.

Model editing is a new technical\nfield for effectively and efficiently correcting erroneous knowledge in LLMs,\nwhere various model editing techniques and benchmarks have been proposed\nrecently.

    "abstract": "Node classification with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) under a fixed set of\nlabels is well known in contrast to Graph Few-Shot Class Incremental Learning\n(GFSCIL), which involves learning a GNN classifier as graph nodes and classes\ngrowing over time sporadically. We introduce inductive GFSCIL that continually\nlearns novel classes with newly emerging nodes while maintaining performance on\nold classes without accessing previous data. This addresses the practical\nconcern of transductive GFSCIL, which requires storing the entire graph with\nhistorical data. Compared to the transductive GFSCIL, the inductive setting\nexacerbates catastrophic forgetting due to inaccessible previous data during\nincremental training, in addition to overfitting issue caused by label\nsparsity. Thus, we propose a novel method, called Topology-based class\nAugmentation and Prototype calibration (TAP). To be specific, it first creates\na triple-branch multi-topology class augmentation method to enhance model\ngeneralization ability. As each incremental session receives a disjoint\nsubgraph with nodes of novel classes, the multi-topology class augmentation\nmethod helps replicate such a setting in the base session to boost backbone\nversatility. In incremental learning, given the limited number of novel class\nsamples, we propose an iterative prototype calibration to improve the\nseparation of class prototypes. Furthermore, as backbone fine-tuning poses the\nfeature distribution drift, prototypes of old classes start failing over time,\nwe propose the prototype shift method for old classes to compensate for the\ndrift. We showcase the proposed method on four datasets.",

    "abstract": "DRC-semigroups model associative systems with domain and range operations,\nand contain many important classes, such as inverse, restriction, Ehresmann,\nregular $*$-, and $*$-regular semigroups. In this paper we show that the\ncategory of DRC-semigroups is isomorphic to a category of certain biordered\ncategories whose object sets are projection algebras in the sense of Jones.\nThis extends the recent groupoid approach to regular $*$-semigroups of the\nfirst and third authors. We also establish the existence of free DRC-semigroups\nby constructing a left adjoint to the forgetful functor into the category of\nprojection algebras.",
