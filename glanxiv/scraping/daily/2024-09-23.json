    "abstract": "We introduce a varying-order (VO) NURBS discretization method to enhance the\nperformance of the IGA technique for three-dimensional large deformation\nfrictional contact problems. Based on the promising results obtained with the\nprevious work on the 2D isogeometric contact analysis, the present work extends\nthe capability of the method for tri-variate NURBS discretization. The proposed\nmethod enables independent employment of the user-defined higher-order NURBS\nfor the discretization of the contact surface and the minimum order of NURBS\nfor the remaining solid volume. Such a method provides the possibility to\nrefine a NURBS solid with the controllable order elevation-based approach while\npreserving its volume parametrization at a fixed mesh. The advantages of the\nmethod are twofold. First, the higher-order NURBS for the evaluation of contact\nintegral enhances the accuracy of the contact responses at a fixed mesh, hence\nfully exploiting the advantage of higher-order NURBS specifically for contact\ncomputations. Second, the minimum order of NURBS for the computations in the\nremaining volume considerably reduces the computational cost associated with\nthe uniform order NURBS-based isogeometric contact analyses.\n  The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated using various\ncontact problems with or without considering friction between deformable\nsolids. The results with the standard uniform order of NURBS-based\ndiscretization are also included to provide a comparative assessment. We show\nthat to attain similar accuracy results, the VO NURBS discretization uses a\nmuch coarser mesh resolution than the standard NURBS-based discretization,\nleading to a major gain in computational efficiency for isogeometric contact\nanalysis. The convergence study demonstrates the consistent performance of the\nmethod for efficient IGA of three-dimensional (3D) frictional contact problems.",

Wang et al., Nat. Mat. 23, 492-498 (2024)]. This\nspontaneous intra-unit-cell orbital ordering, also known as electronic\nnematicity, breaks $C_4$ symmetry and is thought to arise from the Coulomb\ninteraction (denoted by $V_{pp}$) between oxygen $p_x$ and $p_y$ electrons.

This\nwork introduces DIAL-MPC (Diffusion-Inspired Annealing for Legged MPC), a\nsampling-based MPC framework with a novel diffusion-style annealing process.\nSuch an annealing process is supported by the theoretical landscape analysis of\nModel Predictive Path Integral Control (MPPI) and the connection between MPPI\nand single-step diffusion. Algorithmically, DIAL-MPC iteratively refines\nsolutions online and achieves both global coverage and local convergence. In\nquadrupedal torque-level control tasks, DIAL-MPC reduces the tracking error of\nstandard MPPI by $13.4$ times and outperforms reinforcement learning (RL)\npolicies by $50\\%$ in challenging climbing tasks without any training. In\nparticular, DIAL-MPC enables precise real-world quadrupedal jumping with\npayload. To the best of our knowledge, DIAL-MPC is the first training-free\nmethod that optimizes over full-order quadruped dynamics in real-time.",

    "abstract": "According to the Baldwin Effect learning can guide evolution. This does not\nsuppose that information about what has been learned is transferred back into\nthe genetic code: in the Baldwin Effect complex multi-gene characteristics are\ndiscovered through learning but acquired through standard selectionist\nevolutionary processes. Learning serves to improve the search by giving value\nto a partial, and otherwise useless, subset of the required genes. An elegant\nand concrete treatment of the Baldwin Effect is given in 'How learning can\nguide evolution', a 1987 paper by G. E. Hinton and S. J. Nowlan. This includes\na simple, but revealing, simulation illustrating the effect. As a commentary on\nthat paper, a similar simulation is used here to demonstrated that cooperation\ncan also guide evolution. Like learning, cooperation has a clear benefit to\nsurvival, but what is proposed here is small addition: that cooperation, like\nlearning in the Baldwin Effect, can also allow complex characteristic to be\ndiscovered and acquired much faster than they otherwise would. This suggests an\nadditional benefit of social behavior and suggests that social animals have a\nbroader evolutionary path towards some complex adaptations.",

    "abstract": "A knee point on a curve is the one where the curve levels off after an\nincrease. In a computer system, it marks the point at which the system's\nperformance is no longer improving significantly despite adding extra\nresources. Thus a knee point often represents an optimal point for decision.\nHowever, identifying knee points in noisy data is a challenging task. All\nprevious works defined knee points based on the data in the original scale.\nHowever, in this work, we define knee points based on normalized data and\nprovide a mathematical definition of curvature for normalized discrete data\npoints, based on the mathematical definition of curvature for continuous\nfunctions. The impact of normalization exerted on curvature and the location of\nknee points are also discussed. Nevertheless, assessing the effectiveness of\nmethods is difficult in the absence of ground truth data and benchmark\ndatasets, which makes comparing existing methods challenging. In view of this,\nwe create synthetic data that simulate real-world scenarios. We achieve this by\nselecting a set of functions that possess the required characteristics in this\nresearch and then introducing noise that satisfies the underlying distribution.\nIn addition, we present a deep-learning approach and employ a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) with a U-Net-like architecture, to accurately detect the\nknee point(s) of the underlying true distribution. The proposed model is\nevaluated against state-of-the-art methods. Experiments show that our network\noutperforms existing methods in all synthetic datasets, regardless of whether\nthe samples have single or multiple knee points. In fact, our model achieves\nthe best $F_{1}$ scores among all existing methods in all the test sets.",

Such hairy BHs are present for a\nvanishing vector-field mass ($m=0$) with a non-zero cubic Galileon coupling\n$\\beta_3$. We study the linear stability of those hairy BHs by considering\neven-parity perturbations in the eikonal limit.

We could detect two different unstable behaviors of perturbations in\nall the parameter spaces of hairy asymptotically flat BH solutions we searched\nfor. In the first case, an angular Laplacian instability on the horizon is\ninduced by negative $c_{\\Omega,1}^2$. For the second case, it is possible to\navoid this horizon instability, but in such cases, the positivity of\n$c_{\\Omega,1}^2$ is violated at large distances. Hence these hairy BHs are\ngenerally prone to Laplacian instabilities along the angular direction in some\nregions outside the horizon. Moreover, we also encounter a pathological\nbehavior of the radial propagation speeds $c_r$ possessing two different values\nof $c_r^2$ for one of the dynamical perturbations.

    "abstract": "Despite broad interest in modeling spoken dialogue agents, most approaches\nare inherently \"half-duplex\" -- restricted to turn-based interaction with\nresponses requiring explicit prompting by the user or implicit tracking of\ninterruption or silence events. Human dialogue, by contrast, is \"full-duplex\"\nallowing for rich synchronicity in the form of quick and dynamic turn-taking,\noverlapping speech, and backchanneling. Technically, the challenge of achieving\nfull-duplex dialogue with LLMs lies in modeling synchrony as pre-trained LLMs\ndo not have a sense of \"time\". To bridge this gap, we propose Synchronous LLMs\nfor full-duplex spoken dialogue modeling. We design a novel mechanism to\nintegrate time information into Llama3-8b so that they run synchronously with\nthe real-world clock. We also introduce a training recipe that uses 212k hours\nof synthetic spoken dialogue data generated from text dialogue data to create a\nmodel that generates meaningful and natural spoken dialogue, with just 2k hours\nof real-world spoken dialogue data. Synchronous LLMs outperform\nstate-of-the-art in dialogue meaningfulness while maintaining naturalness.\nFinally, we demonstrate the model's ability to participate in full-duplex\ndialogue by simulating interaction between two agents trained on different\ndatasets, while considering Internet-scale latencies of up to 240 ms.

In this work, we focus on robots exploring structured\nindoor environments which are often predictable and composed of repeating\npatterns. Most existing approaches, such as conventional frontier approaches,\nhave difficulty leveraging the predictability and explore with simple\nheuristics such as `closest first'. Recent works use deep learning techniques\nto predict unknown regions of the map, using these predictions for information\ngain calculation. However, these approaches are often sensitive to the\npredicted map quality or do not reason over sensor coverage. To overcome these\nissues, our key insight is to jointly reason over what the robot can observe\nand its uncertainty to calculate probabilistic information gain. We introduce\nMapEx, a new exploration framework that uses predicted maps to form\nprobabilistic sensor model for information gain estimation. MapEx generates\nmultiple predicted maps based on observed information, and takes into\nconsideration both the computed variances of predicted maps and estimated\nvisible area to estimate the information gain of a given viewpoint. Experiments\non the real-world KTH dataset showed on average 12.4% improvement than\nrepresentative map-prediction based exploration and 25.4% improvement than\nnearest frontier approach.

Motivated by the observation\nthat even in cases where the ratio between dimension and sample size is as\nsmall as $0.05$, tests based on a fixed-dimension asymptotics do not keep their\npreassigned level, we propose to derive critical values of test statistics\nusing an asymptotic regime where the dimension diverges at the same rate as the\nsample size.\n  This paper introduces a novel and well-founded statistical methodology for\ndetecting change points in a sequence of high-dimensional covariance matrices.\nOur approach utilizes a min-type statistic based on a sequential process of\nlikelihood ratio statistics. This is used to construct a test for the\nhypothesis of the existence of a change point with a corresponding estimator\nfor its location. We provide theoretical guarantees for these inference tools\nby thoroughly analyzing the asymptotic properties of the sequential process of\nlikelihood ratio statistics in the case where the dimension and sample size\nconverge with the same rate to infinity. In particular, we prove weak\nconvergence towards a Gaussian process under the null hypothesis of no change.\nTo identify the challenging dependency structure between consecutive test\nstatistics, we employ tools from random matrix theory and stochastic processes.\nMoreover, we show that the new test attains power under a class of alternatives\nreflecting changes in the bulk of the spectrum, and we prove consistency of the\nestimator for the change-point location.",

Neural\nMotion Planners (NMPs) are an appealing alternative to conventional planners as\nthey incorporate different environmental constraints to learn motion policies\ndirectly from raw sensor observations. Contemporary state-of-the-art NMPs can\nsuccessfully plan across different environments. However none of the existing\nNMPs generalize across robot embodiments.

For this\npurpose, we present a pipeline for automated satellite docking port detection\nand state estimation using monocular vision data from standard RGB sensing or\nan event camera. Rather than taking snapshots of the environment, an event\ncamera has independent pixels that asynchronously respond to light changes,\noffering advantages such as high dynamic range, low power consumption and\nlatency, etc. This work focuses on satellite-agnostic operations (only a\ngeometric knowledge of the actual port is required) using the recently released\nLockheed Martin Mission Augmentation Port (LM-MAP) as the target. By leveraging\nshallow data-driven techniques to preprocess the incoming data to highlight the\nLM-MAP's reflective navigational aids and then using basic geometric models for\nstate estimation, we present a lightweight and data-efficient pipeline that can\nbe used independently with either RGB or event cameras. We demonstrate the\nsoundness of the pipeline and perform a quantitative comparison of the two\nmodalities based on data collected with a photometrically accurate test bench\nthat includes a robotic arm to simulate the target satellite's uncontrolled\nmotion.",

    "abstract": "Based on experimental and simulation methods we helped develop, we are\nadvancing mechanistic understanding of how self-assembled NC metamaterials can\nproduce distinctive near- and far-field optical properties not readily\nachievable in lithographically patterned structures. First, the impacts of the\ninevitable defects and disorder associated with self-assembly can be\nrationalized and, in some cases, recognized as advantageous. Second,\nself-assembly enables intimate nanoscale intermixing of different NC and\nmolecular components. By incorporating probe molecules within the gaps between\nNCs where the electric field enhancement is strongest, we show enhanced\ndetection of molecular vibrations that can be optimized by tuning the size and\nresonance frequency of the NCs. We show how metasurfaces incorporating mixtures\nof NCs with different doping concentrations can achieve epsilon-near-zero\ndielectric response over a broad frequency range. Finally, considering the NC\nmetasurface itself as a building block, we show how photonic structures\nincorporating these assemblies can harness and amplify their distinctive\nproperties. Through modeling the NC monolayer as a slab with an effective\npermittivity response, we designed a frequency-tunable IR perfect absorber by\nlayering the NCs on a simple open cavity structure. Since the perfect\nabsorption architecture further enhances the IR electric field localization\nstrength, we expect that this integration strategy can enhance molecular\nvibration coupling or non-linear optical response. The versatility of the NC\nassembly and integration approach suggests opportunities for various metal\noxide NC superstructures, including mixing and stacking of NCs beyond a single\nmonolayer, representing a vast parameter space for design of linear and\nnonlinear IR optical components.",

    "abstract": "The ability to form, retrieve, and reason about memories in response to\nstimuli serves as the cornerstone for general intelligence - shaping entities\ncapable of learning, adaptation, and intuitive insight. Large Language Models\n(LLMs) have proven their ability, given the proper memories or context, to\nreason and respond meaningfully to stimuli. However, they are still unable to\noptimally encode, store, and retrieve memories - the ability to do this would\nunlock their full ability to operate as AI agents, and to specialize to niche\ndomains. To remedy this, one promising area of research is Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), which aims to augment LLMs by providing them with rich\nin-context examples and information. In question-answering (QA) applications,\nRAG methods embed the text of interest in chunks, and retrieve the most\nrelevant chunks for a prompt using text embeddings. Motivated by human memory\nencoding and retrieval, we aim to improve over standard RAG methods by\ngenerating and encoding higher-level information and tagging the chunks by\ntheir utility to answer questions. We introduce Graphical Eigen Memories For\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (GEM-RAG). GEM-RAG works by tagging each chunk\nof text in a given text corpus with LLM generated ``utility'' questions,\nconnecting chunks in a graph based on the similarity of both their text and\nutility questions, and then using the eigendecomposition of the memory graph to\nbuild higher level summary nodes that capture the main themes of the text. We\nevaluate GEM-RAG, using both UnifiedQA and GPT-3.5 Turbo as the LLMs, with\nSBERT, and OpenAI's text encoders on two standard QA tasks, showing that\nGEM-RAG outperforms other state-of-the-art RAG methods on these tasks. We also\ndiscuss the implications of having a robust RAG system and future directions.",

    "abstract": "Modern neural network classifiers achieve remarkable performance across a\nvariety of tasks; however, they frequently exhibit overconfidence in their\npredictions due to the cross-entropy loss. Inspired by this problem, we propose\nthe \\textbf{Cr}i\\textbf{t}ic Loss for Image \\textbf{Cl}assification (CrtCl,\npronounced Critical). CrtCl formulates image classification training in a\ngenerator-critic framework, with a base classifier acting as a generator, and a\ncorrectness critic imposing a loss on the classifier. The base classifier,\nacting as the generator, given images, generates the probability distribution\nover classes and intermediate embeddings. The critic model, given the image,\nintermediate embeddings, and output predictions of the base model, predicts the\nprobability that the base model has produced the correct classification, which\nthen can be back propagated as a self supervision signal. Notably, the critic\ndoes not use the label as input, meaning that the critic can train the base\nmodel on both labeled and unlabeled data in semi-supervised learning settings.\nCrtCl represents a learned loss method for accuracy, alleviating the negative\nside effects of using cross-entropy loss. Additionally, CrtCl provides a\npowerful way to select data to be labeled in an active learning setting, by\nestimating the classification ability of the base model on unlabeled data. We\nstudy the effectiveness of CrtCl in low-labeled data regimes, and in the\ncontext of active learning. In classification, we find that CrtCl, compared to\nrecent baselines, increases classifier generalization and calibration with\nvarious amounts of labeled data. In active learning, we show our method\noutperforms baselines in accuracy and calibration. We observe consistent\nresults across three image classification datasets.",

They collect and process vast amounts of data\nthrough various embedded subsystems. One significant player in this landscape\nis Android Automotive OS (AAOS), which has been integrated into over 100M\nvehicles and has become a dominant force in the in-vehicle infotainment market.\nWith this extensive data collection, privacy has become increasingly crucial.\nThe volume of data gathered by these systems raises questions about how this\ninformation is stored, used, and protected, making privacy a critical issue for\nmanufacturers and consumers. However, very little has been done on vehicle data\nprivacy. This paper focuses on the privacy implications of AAOS, examining the\nexact nature and scope of data collection and the corresponding privacy\npolicies from the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We develop a novel\nautomotive privacy analysis tool called PriDrive which employs three\nmethodological approaches: network traffic inspection, and both static and\ndynamic analyses of Android images using rooted emulators from various OEMs.\nThese methodologies are followed by an assessment of whether the collected data\ntypes were properly disclosed in OEMs and 3rd party apps' privacy policies (to\nidentify any discrepancies or violations). Our evaluation on three different\nOEM platforms reveals that vehicle speed is collected at a sampling rate of\nroughly 25 Hz. Other properties such as model info, climate & AC, and seat data\nare collected in a batch 30 seconds into vehicle startup. In addition, several\nvehicle property types were collected without disclosure in their respective\nprivacy policies. For example, OEM A's policies only covers 110 vehicle\nproperties or 13.02% of the properties found in our static analysis.",

    "abstract": "The wide fields of view, high sensitivity, and broad energy coverage of\ncurrent X-ray and gamma-ray satellites, coupled with the high cadence\nobservational strategy of some of them (recently Swift and Fermi) have been\nideal for carrying out unprecedented studies of the variability properties of\ndifferent classes of Galactic and extra-Galactic high-energy sources. These\nclasses of objects range from nearby flaring stars to the most distant Active\nGalactic Nuclei (AGNs). In this paper we focus on some of the most energetic\nevents, i.e. those powered by accretion (black hole binaries, ultra-luminous\nX-rays and Active Galactic Nuclei) until those leading to the first detections\nof GravitationalWaves (GWs), i.e. the Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), passing through\nthe controversial Inter-Mediate Mass Black-Holes (IMBHs). We show the\nimportance of X-ray and gamma-ray emission for the determination of the\nproperties (mass, spin, inclination, height of the corona) of the compact\nobjects residing in systems powered by accretion and the role of the LIGO and\nVIRGO interferometers in the case of the (compact objects) binary mergers.\nGravitational waves allow the determination of the properties of the\nnon-light-emitting compact objects (black-holes; BHs) in binary mergers (BH-BH)\nthat otherwise would be nearly impossible. We show that for the case of neutron\nstar (NS) mergers (NS-BH or NS-NS) electro-magnetic (EM) emission is still\npossible, and very powerful, being the responsible for the X-ray and gamma-ray\nemission of many GRBs (kilonovae). Very recently these transients have been\ndiscovered to show X-ray and gamma-ray variability patterns that could lead to\nvery important insights into the properties of the binary mergers that\noriginated them, opening a new view for their study.",

This region transitions from highly collisional to\nweakly collisional states, leading to complex plasma state transitions\ninfluenced by magnetic strengths and collisional properties. These processes\nintroduce numerical stiffness in multi-fluid models, imposing severe timestep\nrestrictions on standard time integration methods. New numerical methods are\nessential to address these computational challenges, effectively managing the\ndiverse timescales in multi-fluid and multi-physics models. The widely used\ntime operator splitting technique offers a straightforward approach but\nrequires careful timestep management to avoid stability issues and errors.\nDespite some studies on splitting errors, their impact on solar and stellar\nastrophysics is often overlooked. We focus on a Multi-Fluid Multi-Species\n(MFMS) model, which presents significant challenges for time integration. We\npropose a second-order Partitioned Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (PIROCK)\nmethod that combines efficient explicit and implicit integration techniques\nwith variable time-stepping and error control. Compared to a standard\nthird-order explicit method and a first-order Lie splitting approach, the\nPIROCK method shows robust advantages in accuracy, stability, and computational\nefficiency. Our results reveal PIROCK's capability to solve multi-fluid\nproblems with unprecedented efficiency.

    "abstract": "Quantum query complexity studies the number of queries needed to learn some\nproperty of a black box. A closely related question is how well an algorithm\ncan succeed with this learning task using only a fixed number of queries. In\nthis work, we propose measuring an algorithm's performance using the mutual\ninformation between the output and the actual value. The task of optimizing\nthis mutual information using a single query, is similar to a basic task of\nquantum communication, where one attempts to maximize the mutual information of\nthe sender and receiver. We make this analogy precise by splitting the\nalgorithm between two agents, obtaining a communication protocol. The oracle's\ntarget property plays the role of a message that Alice encodes into a quantum\nstate, which is subsequently sent over to Bob. The first part of the algorithm\nperforms this encoding, and the second part measures the state and aims to\ndeduce the message from the outcome. Moreover, we formally consider the oracle\nas a separate subsystem, whose state records the unknown oracle identity.\nWithin this construction, Bob's optimal measurement basis minimizes the quantum\ncorrelations between the two subsystems. We also find a lower bound on the\nmutual information, which is related to quantum coherence. These results extend\nto multiple-query algorithms. As a result, we describe the optimal non-adaptive\nalgorithm that uses at most a fixed number of queries, for any oracle\nclassification problem. We demonstrate our results by studying several\nwell-known algorithms through the proposed framework.",

In most modelling scenarios, random fluctuations driving\ndynamics or motion have some non-trivial temporal correlation structure, which\nrenders the SDE non-Markovian; a phenomenon commonly known as ``colored''\nnoise. Thus, an important objective is to develop effective tools for\nmathematically and numerically studying (possibly non-Markovian) SDEs. In this\nreport, we formalise a mathematical theory for analysing and numerically\nstudying SDEs based on so-called `generalised coordinates of motion'. Like the\ntheory of rough paths, we analyse SDEs pathwise for any given realisation of\nthe noise, not solely probabilistically. Like the established theory of\nMarkovian realisation, we realise non-Markovian SDEs as a Markov process in an\nextended space. Unlike the established theory of Markovian realisation however,\nthe Markovian realisations here are accurate on short timescales and may be\nexact globally in time, when flows and fluctuations are analytic. This theory\nis exact for SDEs with analytic flows and fluctuations, and is approximate when\nflows and fluctuations are differentiable. It provides useful analysis tools,\nwhich we employ to solve linear SDEs with analytic fluctuations. It may also be\nuseful for studying rougher SDEs, as these may be identified as the limit of\nsmoother ones. This theory supplies effective, computationally straightforward\nmethods for simulation, filtering and control of SDEs; amongst others, we\nre-derive generalised Bayesian filtering, a state-of-the-art method for\ntime-series analysis. Looking forward, this report suggests that generalised\ncoordinates have far-reaching applications throughout stochastic differential\nequations.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to many\nchallenging tasks. However, in order to perform well, it requires access to a\ngood reward function which is often sparse or manually engineered with scope\nfor error. Introducing human prior knowledge is often seen as a possible\nsolution to the above-mentioned problem, such as imitation learning, learning\nfrom preference, and inverse reinforcement learning. Learning from feedback is\nanother framework that enables an RL agent to learn from binary evaluative\nsignals describing the teacher's (positive or negative) evaluation of the\nagent's action. However, these methods often make the assumption that\nevaluative teacher feedback is perfect, which is a restrictive assumption. In\npractice, such feedback can be noisy due to limited teacher expertise or other\nexacerbating factors like cognitive load, availability, distraction, etc. In\nthis work, we propose the CANDERE-COACH algorithm, which is capable of learning\nfrom noisy feedback by a nonoptimal teacher. We propose a noise-filtering\nmechanism to de-noise online feedback data, thereby enabling the RL agent to\nsuccessfully learn with up to 40% of the teacher feedback being incorrect.\nExperiments on three common domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach.",

The next frontier is LLM personalization, where a\nfoundation model can be fine-tuned with user/task-specific data. Given the\nsensitive nature of such private data, it is desirable to fine-tune these\nmodels on edge devices to improve user trust. However, fine-tuning on\nresource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to\nsubstantial memory and computational demands, as well as limited infrastructure\nsupport. We observe that inference engines (e.g., ExecuTorch) can be repurposed\nfor fine-tuning by leveraging zeroth-order (ZO) optimization, which uses\nmultiple forward passes to approximate gradients. However, directly applying ZO\nmethods on edge devices is impractical due to the high computational cost of\nmultiple model perturbations required to achieve accuracy improvements. Based\non these observations, we propose a memory- and computation-efficient LLM\nfine-tuning method for edge devices. Our approach has three key innovations:\n(1) We introduce a parallelized randomized gradient estimation (P-RGE)\ntechnique that achieves high parallel efficiency by leveraging outer-loop and\ninner-loop parallelization. This enables multiple function queries and forward\npasses to be executed in parallel, reducing training time. (2) We integrate\nP-RGE with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (e.g. LoRA) to further\nreduce computational and memory overhead. (3) We implement a P-RGE LoRA-FA\nmodule that fully supports fine-tuning with ExecuTorch. Our approach requires\nno modifications to ExecuTorch's runtime code, as it can be implemented with\nserver-side code changes only.

However,\ndiffusion models often require a large number of neural function evaluations\nper sample in order to deliver accurate posterior samples. As a result, using\ndiffusion models as stochastic samplers for Monte Carlo integration in Bayesian\ncomputation can be highly computationally expensive, particularly in\napplications that require a substantial number of Monte Carlo samples for\nconducting uncertainty quantification analyses. This cost is especially high in\nlarge-scale inverse problems such as computational imaging, which rely on large\nneural networks that are expensive to evaluate. With quantitative imaging\napplications in mind, this paper presents a Multilevel Monte Carlo strategy\nthat significantly reduces the cost of Bayesian computation with diffusion\nmodels.

We show that in the\nlimit of the weak electromagnetic field, each of our solutions become a\ntraversable wormhole of the electromagnetically charged Ellis-Bronnikov\nwormhole type. Additionally, we present a theorem that establishes when an\nelectrically and magnetically charged Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, with null\n$\\mathcal{F}$, can be supported by a GR-ED-DF theory.",

    "abstract": "Radio detections of stellar systems provide a window onto stellar magnetic\nactivity and the space weather conditions of extrasolar planets, information\nthat is difficult to attain at other wavelengths. There have been recent\nadvances observing auroral emissions from radio-bright low-mass stars and\nexoplanets largely due to the maturation of low-frequency radio instruments and\nthe plethora of wide-field radio surveys. To guide us in placing these recent\nresults in context, we introduce the foremost local analogues for the field:\nSolar bursts and the aurorae found on Jupiter. We detail how radio bursts\nassociated with stellar flares are foundational to the study of stellar\ncoronae, and time-resolved radio dynamic spectra offers one of the best\nprospects of detecting and characterising coronal mass ejections from other\nstars. We highlight the prospects of directly detecting coherent radio emission\nfrom exoplanetary magnetospheres, and early tentative results. We bridge this\ndiscussion to the field of brown dwarf radio emission, in which their larger\nand stronger magnetospheres are amenable to detailed study with current\ninstruments. Bright, coherent radio emission is also predicted from magnetic\ninteractions between stars and close-in planets. We discuss the underlying\nphysics of these interactions and implications of recent provisional detections\nfor exoplanet characterisation. We conclude with an overview of outstanding\nquestions in theory of stellar, star-planet interaction, and exoplanet radio\nemission, and the prospects of future facilities in answering them.",

In this work,\nwe introduce a segmented sensor architecture that addresses this important\nchallenge by facilitating resonance-tracking readout using a fixed-wavelength\nlaser. The architecture incorporates an in-resonator phase shifter modulated by\nCMOS drivers to periodically sweep and acquire the resonance peak shifts as\nwell as a distinct high-sensitivity sensing region, maintaining high\nperformance at a fraction of the cost and size. We show, for the first time,\nthat fixed-wavelength sensor readout can offer similar performance to\ntraditional tunable laser readout, demonstrating a system limit of detection of\n6.1 x 10-5 RIU as well as immunoassay-based detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike\nprotein.

For stripes of activity, we observe a transition from\ntwo-dimensional to one-dimensional active turbulence as the maximum active\nforce and distance between activity stripes increases, followed by a transition\nto stable vortices ordered antiferromagnetically along the stripes and\nferromagnetically transverse to the stripes. By comparing to a triangular\nlattice of activity circles, we find that transitions to two-dimensional active\nturbulence emerge from interplays between the active length scale and activity\ndensity, independent of the patterning geometry. The vortex ordering, on the\nother hand, is highly sensitive to patterning geometry, which we show by\ncomparing the activity stripes to columns of activity circles, where the vortex\nordering is lost.

Notice that Dijkstra's algorithm itself\nis not efficient in the distributed setting due to its need for repeatedly\ncomputing the minimum-distance unvisited node in the entire network. Our\nadapted approach has other implications, as we outline next.\n  As a step toward the above end-result, we obtain a simple deterministic\nalgorithm for exact SSSP with near-optimal time and message complexities of\n$\\tilde{O}(n)$ and $\\tilde{O}(m)$, in which each edge communicates only\n$poly(\\log n)$ messages. Therefore, one can simultaneously run $n$ instances of\nit for $n$ sources, using a simple random delay scheduling.

Hardware-based defenses have been ineffective,\ndue to considerable cost, delays in commercial adoption, and attackers'\nrepeated ability to circumvent them. Meanwhile, more flexible software-based\nsolutions either incur substantial performance and memory capacity overheads,\nor offer limited forms of protection. Citadel is a new memory allocator design\nthat prevents Rowhammer-initiated security exploits by addressing the\nvulnerability's root cause: physical adjacency of DRAM rows. Citadel enables\ncreation of flexible security domains and isolates different domains in\nphysically disjoint memory regions, guaranteeing security by design. On a\nserver system, Citadel supports thousands of security domains at a modest 7.4%\naverage memory overhead and no performance loss. In contrast, recent domain\nisolation schemes fail to support many workload scenarios due to excessive\noverheads, and incur 4--6x higher overheads for supported scenarios. As a\nsoftware solution, Citadel offers readily deployable Rowhammer-aware isolation\non legacy, current, and future systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a fast and robust method for simplifying surface\ntriangle meshes in the wild while maintaining high visual quality. While\nprevious methods achieve excellent results on manifold meshes by using the\nquadric error metric, they suffer from producing high-quality outputs for\nuser-created meshes, which often contain non-manifold elements and multiple\nconnected components. In this work, we begin by outlining the pitfalls of\nexisting mesh simplification techniques and highlighting the discrepancy in\ntheir formulations with existing mesh data. We then propose a method for\nsimplifying these (non-manifold) triangle meshes, while maintaining quality\ncomparable to the existing methods for manifold inputs. Our key idea is to\nreformulate mesh simplification as a problem of decimating simplicial\n2-complexes. This involves a novel construction to turn a triangle soup into a\nsimplicial 2-complex, followed by iteratively collapsing 1-simplices (vertex\npairs) with our modified quadric error metric tailored for topology changes.\nBesides, we also tackle textured mesh simplification. Instead of following\nexisting strategies to preserve mesh UVs, we propose a novel perspective that\nonly focuses on preserving texture colors defined on the surface, regardless of\nthe layout in the texture UV space. This leads to a more robust method for\ntextured mesh simplification that is free from the texture bleeding artifact.\nOur mesh simplification enables level-of-detail algorithms to operate on\narbitrary triangle meshes in the wild. We demonstrate improvements over prior\ntechniques through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, along\nwith user studies.",

We investigate here the contribution of these\nfaint AGN to hydrogen and the early stages of helium reionization using the\nGPU-based radiative transfer code ATON-HE by post-processing a cosmological\nhydrodynamical simulation from the sherwood-relics suite of simulations. We\nstudy four models: two galaxy-only late-end reionization models, a QSO-assisted\nand a QSO-only model. In the QSO-assisted model, 1% of the haloes host AGN,\nwith AGN luminosities scaled to contribute 17% of the total hydrogen-ionizing\nemissivity. In the QSO-only model, quasars account for all the\nhydrogen-ionizing emissivity, with 10% of the haloes hosting AGN. The SED of\nAGN is assumed to be a power-law with $\\alpha=-1.7$ each with a 10 Myr\nlifetime. All models are calibrated to the observed mean Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest\ntransmission at $5\\lesssim z\\lesssim6.2$. The QSO-assisted model requires an\nemissivity similar to the galaxy-only models and fits the observed distribution\nof the Lyman-$\\alpha$ optical depths well. The QSO-only model is inconsistent\nwith the observed Lyman-$\\alpha$ optical depths distribution, and produces\nexcessively high IGM temperatures at $z\\lesssim 5$ due to an early onset of\nHeII reionization, unless the escape fraction of HeII-ionizing photons is\nassumed to be low.

    "abstract": "Cosmic rays may be dynamically very important in driving large-scale galactic\nwinds. Edge-on galaxies give us an outsider's view of the radio halo, which\nshows the presence of extra-planar cosmic-ray electrons and magnetic fields. We\npresent a new radio continuum imaging study of the nearby edge-on galaxy NGC\n4217 in order to study the distribution of extra-planar cosmic rays and\nmagnetic fields. We both observe with the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) in the\nS-band (2-4 GHz) and with LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) at 144 MHz. We measure\nvertical intensity profiles and exponential scale heights. We re-image both\nJVLA and LOFAR data at matched angular resolution in order to measure radio\nspectral indices between 144 MHz and 3 GHz. Confusing point-like sources were\nsubtracted prior to imaging. Intensity profiles are then fitted with cosmic-ray\nelectron advection models, where we use an isothermal wind model that is driven\nby a combination of pressure from the hot gas and cosmic rays. We discover a\nlarge-scale radio halo on one (northwestern) side of the galactic disc. The\nmorphology is reminiscent of a bubble extending up to 20 kpc away from the\ndisc. We find spectral ageing in the bubble which allows us to measure\nadvection speeds of the cosmic-ray electrons accelerating from 300 to 600 $\\rm\nkm\\, s^{-1}$ . Assuming energy equipartition between the cosmic rays and the\nmagnetic field, we estimate the bubble can be inflated by a modest 10 per cent\nof the kinetic energy injected by supernovae over its dynamical time-scale of\n35 Myr. While no active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been detected, such activity\nin the recent past cannot be ruled out. Non-thermal bubbles with sizes of tens\nof kiloparsec may be a ubiquitous feature of star-forming galaxies showing the\ninfluence of feedback. To determine possible contributions by AGN feedback,\nwill require deeper observations.",

In our research, we have developed a correction map method,\nspecifically the dissipated correction map method with trapezoidal rule, for\nnumerical simulations of gravitational waves from spinning compact binary\nsystems. This new correction map method, denoted as $CM3$, has shown remarkable\nperformance in various simulation results, such as phase space distance,\ndissipated energy error, and gravitational waveform, closely resembling the\nhigh-order precision implicit Gaussian algorithm. When compared to the\npreviously used midpoint map which denoted as $C_2$, the $CM3$ consistently\nexhibits a closer alignment with the highly accurate Gaussian algorithm in\nwaveform evolution and orbital trajectory analysis. Through detailed\ncomparisons and analyses, it is evident that $CM3$ outperforms other\nalgorithms, including $CM2$ and $C_2$ mentioned in this paper, in terms of\naccuracy and precision in simulating spinning compact binary systems. The\nincorporation of the trapezoidal rule and the optimization with a scale factor\n$\\gamma$ have significantly enhanced the performance of $CM3$, making it a\npromising method for future numerical simulations in astrophysics. With the\ngroundbreaking detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO/VIRGO\ncollaboration, interest in this research domain has soared.

One\nexplanation is a mental reconstruction of the occluded face parts which is\nbiased towards a more attractive percept as shown in face-attractiveness rating\ntasks. We aimed to test for this hypothesis by using a delayed\nmatching-to-sample task, which directly requires mental reconstruction. In two\nonline experiments, we presented observers with unattractive, neutral or\nattractive synthetic reconstructions of the occluded face parts using a\nstate-of-the-art diffusion-based image generator. Our experiments do not\nsupport the initial hypothesis and reveal an unattractiveness bias for occluded\nfaces instead. This suggests that facial attractiveness rating tasks do not\nprompt reconstructions.

In particular, we study the unified\nfirst law, the generalized second law, and thermodynamic stability in our\nmodel. The specific heat capacities are taken into account for the study of\nthermodynamic stability. Our study reveals a nice result! The ratio of the\nspecific heat capacity at constant pressure and that at constant volume in a\nflat FLRW universe with dissipation is nothing but the negative of the\ndeceleration parameter. In classical thermodynamics, this ratio is known as the\nisentropic expansion factor or (for ideal gases) the adiabatic index.

    "abstract": "The emergence of magnetic flux from the deep convection zone plays an\nimportant role in the solar magnetism, such as the generation of active regions\nand triggering of various eruptive phenomena, including jets, flares, and\ncoronal mass ejections. To investigate the effects of magnetic twist on flux\nemergence, we performed numerical simulations of flux tube emergence using the\nradiative magnetohydrodynamic code R2D2, and conducted a systematic survey on\nthe initial twist. Specifically, we varied the twist of the initial tube both\npositively and negatively from zero to twice the critical value for kink\ninstability. As a result, regardless of the initial twist, the flux tube was\nlifted by the convective upflow and reached the photosphere to create sunspots.\nHowever, when the twist was too weak, the photospheric flux was quickly\ndiffused and not retained long as coherent sunspots. The degree of magnetic\ntwist measured in the photosphere conserved the original twist relatively well,\nand was comparable to actual solar observations. Even in the untwisted case, a\nfinite amount of magnetic helicity was injected into the upper atmosphere\nbecause the background turbulence added helicity. However, when the initial\ntwist exceeded the critical value for kink instability, the magnetic helicity\nnormalized by the total magnetic flux was found to be unreasonably larger than\nthe observations, indicating that the kink instability of the emerging flux\ntube may not be a likely scenario for the formation of flare-productive active\nregions.",

Steward operates by receiving\nnatural language instructions and reactively planning and executing a sequence\nof actions on websites, looping until completion, making it a practical tool\nfor developers and researchers to use. It achieves high efficiency, completing\nactions in 8.52 to 10.14 seconds at a cost of $0.028 per action or an average\nof $0.18 per task, which is further reduced to 4.8 seconds and $0.022 through a\ncaching mechanism.

Archival Chandra\nX-ray observations show that the older and oldest episodes have excavated two\ngenerations of cavities in the hot gas of the cluster. The outermost X-ray\ncavity has a clear mushroom-head shape, likely caused by its buoyant rise in\nthe cluster's potential. Cooling of the hot gas is ongoing in the innermost 20\nkpc, where H$\\alpha$-bright warm filaments are visible in VLT-MUSE data. The\nH$\\alpha$-filaments are stretched towards the mushroom-head cavity, which may\nhave stimulated ICM cooling in its wake.

The\nrecent development of the field of positive geometries provides us with a\nsuitable framework for this endeavour. In particular, we will give a detailed\naccount of the amplituhedron, the momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM momentum\namplituhedron. Alongside these geometries, we will also discuss the ABHY\nassociahedron, which encapsulates tree-level scattering amplitudes in\nbi-adjoint scalar theory. We provide a detailed introduction to these positive\ngeometries, which includes a comprehensive discussion of their structure. For\nthe momentum amplituhedron, ABJM momentum amplituhedron, and ABHY associahedron\nwe give a full stratification of their boundaries, which equivalently\nelucidates the singularity structure of the tree-level scattering amplitudes.\nNotably, we show that the ABJM momentum amplituhedron has an Euler\ncharacteristic equal to one. Furthermore, we explore the interconnections\nbetween these, and other, positive geometries. These connections are in part\nobtained via push forwards through the scattering equations. We develop\ntechniques to calculate these push forwards which circumvents the necessity to\nsolve the scattering equations explicitly. Beyond tree-level, we illustrate how\npositive geometries can be used to describe loop integrands in planar N=4 SYM\nand ABJM. A new framework is established to investigate these loop geometries\nin the space of dual momenta. The construction relies solely on lightcones and\ntheir intersections, and the framework simultaneously encompasses the loop\nlevel structure of the amplituhedron, momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM\nmomentum amplituhedron. This further leads to compact general formulae for all\none-loop integrands in N=4 SYM and ABJM.",

    "abstract": "We describe the spectrophotometric calibration of the Mid-Infrared\nInstrument's (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) aboard the James Webb\nSpace Telescope (JWST). This calibration is complicated by a time-dependent\nevolution in the effective throughput of the MRS; this evolution is strongest\nat long wavelengths, approximately a factor of 2 at 25um over the first two\nyears of the mission. We model and correct for this evolution through regular\nobservations of internal calibration lamps. Pixel flatfields are constructed\nfrom observations of the infrared-bright planetary nebula NGC 7027, and\nphotometric aperture corrections from a combination of theoretical models and\nobservations of bright standard stars. We tie the 5--18um flux calibration to\nhigh signal/noise (S/N; ~ 600-1000) observations of the O9 V star 10 Lacertae,\nscaled to the average calibration factor of nine other spectrophotometric\nstandards. We calibrate the 18--28um spectral range using a combination of\nobservations of main belt asteroid 515 Athalia and the circumstellar disk\naround young stellar object SAO 206462. The photometric repeatability is stable\nto better than 1% in the wavelength range 5--18um, and the S/N ratio of the\ndelivered spectra is consistent between bootstrapped measurements, pipeline\nestimates, and theoretical predictions. The MRS point-source calibration agrees\nwith that of the MIRI imager to within 1% from 7 to 21um and is approximately\n1% fainter than prior Spitzer observations, while the extended source\ncalibration agrees well with prior Cassini/CIRS and Voyager/IRIS observations.",

    "abstract": "Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) enables the control of\nlight-matter interactions at the single-photon level, rendering it a key\ncomponent of many quantum technologies. Its practical realization, however, is\ncomplex since it involves placing individual quantum emitters close to mirror\nsurfaces within a high-finesse cavity. In this work, we propose a cavity QED\narchitecture fully based on atoms trapped in free space. In particular, we show\nthat a pair of two-dimensional, ordered arrays of atoms can be described by\nconventional cavity QED parameters. Such an atom-array cavity exhibits the same\ncooperativity as a conventional counterpart with matching mirror specifications\neven though the cavity coupling strength and decay rate are modified by the\nnarrow bandwidth of the atoms. We estimate that an array cavity composed of\n$^{87}\\mathrm{Rb}$ atoms in an optical lattice can reach a cooperativity of\nabout $10$. This value can be increased suppressing atomic motion with larger\ntrap depths and may exceed $10^4$ with an ideal placement of the atoms. To\nreduce the experimental complexity of our scheme, we propose a spatially\ndependent AC Stark shift as an alternative to curving the arrays, which may be\nof independent interest. In addition to presenting a promising platform for\ncavity QED, our work creates opportunities for exploring novel phenomena based\non the intrinsic nonlinearity of atom arrays and the possibility to dynamically\ncontrol them.",

The\npairing order collapses at larger doping to a superfluid of single-boson\ncondensation with the spin background polarized to a ferromagnetic (FM) order\nsimultaneously. This pairing phase will disappear once a hidden quantum\nmany-body Berry phase in the model is artificially switched off. Such a Berry\nphase, termed the phase string, introduces the sole ``sign problem'' in this\nbosonic model and imposes quantum phase frustration in the interference pattern\nbetween spin and charge degrees of freedom. Only via tightly pairing of doped\nholes, can such quantum frustration be most effectively erased in an AFM\nbackground. By contrast, the pairing vanishes as such a Berry phase trivializes\nin an FM background or is switched off by a sign-problem-free model (the\nBose-Hubbard model at large $U$). The pairing mechanism proposed here is\ninherently quantum and many-body, stemming from exotic interference patterns\ncaused by strong correlation effects, which is distinct from the semi-classical\nmechanisms based on bosonic fluctuations. Experimental schemes have been\nrecently proposed to realize the bosonic $t$-$J$ model on ultracold Rydberg\natom arrays, offering a useful platform to test the present unconventional\npairing mechanism, which is also relevant to the fermionic case associated with\nhigh-temperature superconductors.",

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary disks exhibit a rich variety of substructure in millimeter\ncontinuum emission, often attributed to unseen planets. As these planets carve\ngaps in the gas, dust particles can accumulate in the resulting pressure bumps,\nforming bright features in the dust continuum. We investigate the role of dust\ndynamics in the gap-opening process with 2D radiation hydrodynamics simulations\nof planet--disk interaction and a two-population dust component modeled as a\npressureless fluid. We consider the opacity feedback and backreaction due to\ndrag forces as mm grains accumulate in pressure bumps at different stages of\ndust growth. We find that dust dynamics can significantly affect the resulting\nsubstructure driven by the quasi-thermal-mass planet with\n$M_p/M_\\star=10^{-4}$. Opacity feedback causes nonaxisymmetric features to\nbecome more compact in azimuth, whereas the drag-induced backreaction tends to\ndissolve nonaxisymmetries. For our fiducial model, this results in multiple\nconcentric rings of dust rather than the expected vortices and corotating dust\nclumps found in models without dust feedback. A higher coagulation fraction\ndisproportionately enhances the effect of dust opacity feedback, favoring the\nformation of crescents rather than rings. Our results suggest that turbulent\ndiffusion is not always necessary to explain the rarity of observed\nnonaxisymmetric features, and that incorporating dust dynamics is vital for\ninterpreting the observed substructure in protoplanetary disks. We also\ndescribe and test the implementation of the publicly-available dust fluid\nmodule in the PLUTO code.",

The image orientation and black hole mass estimates were obtained\nvia a scoring and an approximate rescaling procedure. Lifting such\napproximations, probing the space of parameters continuously, and extending the\nparameter space of theoretical models is both desirable and computationally\nprohibitive with existing methods. To address this, we introduce a new Bayesian\nscheme that adaptively explores the parameter space of ray-traced, GRMHD\nmodels. The general relativistic radiative transfer code \\ipole is integrated\nwith the EHT parameter estimation tool THEMIS. The pipeline produces a\nray-traced model image from GRMHD data, computes predictions for VLBI\nobservables from the image for a specific VLBI array configuration and compares\nto data thereby sampling the likelihood surface via an MCMC scheme. At this\nstage we focus on four parameters: accretion rate, electron thermodynamics,\ninclination, and source position angle. Our scheme faithfully recovers\nparameters from simulated VLBI data and accommodates time-variabibility via an\ninflated error budget.

Our sample comprises 17 short-period giant\nplanets orbiting stars that exhibit a broad range of activity levels.

    "abstract": "Wide, highly eccentric ($e>0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as\nprogenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to\nhave a significant population in the mHz band (e.g., $\\sim 3-45$ detectable\nstellar-mass binary black holes with $e>0.9$ in the Milky Way), with their GW\nsignals characterized by \"repeated bursts\" emitted upon each pericenter\npassage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from\nhighly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly\nconstrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative\nmeasurement error of $\\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\\sim 1\\%$ for\neccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the\nbinary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital orientation may be less\nprecisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform\nmock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly\neccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems\ncould be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary\nGaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work\nhighlights the potential of extracting the signal of \"bursting'' LISA sources\nto provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding\nenvironment, and formation channels.",

    "abstract": "Dwarf spheroidal galaxies are known to be dominated by old stellar\npopulations. This has led to the assumption that their gas-rich progenitors\nlost their gas during their infall in the Milky Way (MW) halo at distant\nlook-back times. Here, we report a discovery of a tiny but robustly detected\npopulation of possibly young ($\\sim$ 1 Gyr old) and intermediate-mass ($\\rm 1.8\nM_{\\odot} \\le M < 3 M_{\\odot}$) stars in MW dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This was\nestablished on the basis of their positions in color-magnitude diagrams, after\nfiltering out the bulk of the foreground MW using Gaia DR3 proper motions. We\nhave considered the possibility that this population is made of evolved blue\nstragglers. For Sculptor, it seems unlikely, because 95.5% of its stars are\nolder than 8 Gyr, leading to masses smaller than 0.9 M$_{\\odot}$. This would\nonly allow blue straggler masses of less than 1.8 M$_{\\odot}$, which is much\nlower than what we observed. Alternatively, it would require the merger of\nthree turnoff stars, which appears even more unlikely. On the other hand, the\nrecent Gaia proper motion measurements of MW dwarf galaxies infer their low\nbinding energies and large angular momenta, pointing to a more recent, $\\le$ 3\nGyr, infall. Although the nature of the newly discovered stars still needs\nfurther confirmation, we find that they are consistent with the recent infall\nof the dwarf galaxies into the MW halo, when star formation occurred from the\nram pressurization of their gas content before its removal by the hot Galactic\ncorona. The abundance of this plausibly young population of stars is similar to\nthe expectations drawn from hydrodynamical simulations. These results point to\na novel origin for MW dwarf spheroidal galaxies.",

Considering a wide range of initial\nconditions, we conducted $N$-body simulations of globular clusters (GCs) around\nthe Milky Way. In particular, we assume a canonical IMF for all GCs without\nnatal kicks for supernovae remnants, namely neutron stars or black holes. Our\nresults demonstrate that clusters with larger degrees of primordial mass\nsegregation reach their DSC phase earlier and spend a larger fraction of their\ndissolution time in such a phase, compared to clusters without mass\nsegregation. In primordially segregated clusters, the maximum Galactocentric\ndistance that the clusters can have to enter the DSC phase is almost twice that\nof the clusters without primordial mass segregation. Primordially segregated\nclusters evolve with a higher number of stellar mass black holes, accelerating\nenergy creation in their central regions and consequently increasing\nevaporation rates and cluster sizes during dark phases. The simulations reveal\nthat aggregating heavy components at the centre doubles the time spent in the\ndark phase. Additionally, the study identifies potential links between\nsimulated dark clusters and initial conditions of Milky Way globular clusters,\nsuggesting some may transition to dark phases before dissolution. Higher\nprimordial mass segregation coefficients amplify the average binary black hole\nformation rate by 2.5 times, raising higher expectations for gravitational wave\nemissions.",

Previous work has identified the presence of\nmetal-rich and metal-poor stars in the NSD, suggesting that they have different\norigins. The recent publication of photometric, metallicity, proper motion, and\norbital catalogues allows the NSD stellar population to be characterised with\nunprecedented detail. We aim to explore the proper motions and orbits of NSD\nstars with different metallicities to assess whether they have different\norigins and to better understand the metallicity distribution in the NSD. We\ndistinguished between metal-rich and metal-poor stars by applying a Gaussian\nmixture model, as done in previous work, and analysed the proper motions,\norbits, and spatial distribution of stars with different metallicities. We find\nthat metal-rich stars exhibit a lower velocity dispersion, suggesting that they\ntrace a kinematically cooler component compared to metal-poor ones.\nFurthermore, z-tube orbits are predominant among metal-rich stars, while\nchaotic/box orbits are more common among metal-poor ones. We also find that\nmetal-rich and metal-poor stars show a similar extinction and are present\nthroughout the analysed regions. As a secondary result, we detected a\nmetallicity gradient in the metal-rich population with higher metallicity\ntowards the centre of the NSD and a tentative gradient for the metal-poor\nstars, which is consistent with previous studies that did not distinguish\nbetween the two populations. Our results suggest that metal-rich stars trace\nthe NSD, whereas metal-poor ones are related to the Galactic bar and probably\nconstitute Galactic bar interlopers and/or are NSD stars that originated from\naccreted clusters. The detected metallicity gradients aligns with the currently\naccepted inside-out formation of the NSD.",

To this end, this report provides a comprehensive\nexploration of o1 on different medical scenarios, examining 3 key aspects:\nunderstanding, reasoning, and multilinguality. Specifically, our evaluation\nencompasses 6 tasks using data from 37 medical datasets, including two newly\nconstructed and more challenging question-answering (QA) tasks based on\nprofessional medical quizzes from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)\nand The Lancet. These datasets offer greater clinical relevance compared to\nstandard medical QA benchmarks such as MedQA, translating more effectively into\nreal-world clinical utility.

Notably, o1 surpasses the previous GPT-4 in accuracy by an average\nof 6.2% and 6.6% across 19 datasets and two newly created complex QA scenarios.\nBut meanwhile, we identify several weaknesses in both the model capability and\nthe existing evaluation protocols, including hallucination, inconsistent\nmultilingual ability, and discrepant metrics for evaluation.

We present radial trends in star-formation-rate\n(SFR) surface density ($\\Sigma_{SFR}$) for 150 post-merger galaxies with\nmoderate to extremely heightened global SFRs using observations from the\nMapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. We\njuxtapose these profiles with those of noninteracting galaxies (excluding both\ngalaxy pairs and post-merger galaxies) with similarly enhanced global SFRs.\nPost-merger galaxies have a much stronger central starburst than isolated\ngalaxies with similar global star-formation enhancements. Indeed, isolated\nstarburst galaxies (SBs) lack a marked central enhancement and instead show a\nfairly uniform enhancement in $\\Sigma_{SFR}$ with radius. Moreover, the\ndifference in central star formation between post-merger galaxies and\nnoninteracting galaxies is more radially extended and pronounced when the\nglobal enhancement in star formation is larger. We conclude that post-merger\ngalaxies create a unique signature in their resolved star-forming properties\nthat is distinct from secular processes that can trigger similar global SFR\nenhancements.",

Interestingly, some recent results suggest that\nthe electron-phonon coupling may suppress CDW order and enhance SC. In this\nwork, we consider the square-lattice Hubbard model with the Holstein or\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon coupling at the large-$U$ and\nantiadiabatic (infinite phonon frequency) limit, which gives an effective\n$t$-$J$ model with either a density attractive interaction $V$ or a $J_P$ term\nthat contributes a larger spin exchange and a density repulsive interaction. To\nexplore how these effective couplings may suppress CDW and give a SC, we\nimplement the density matrix renormalization group simulation on the\n$t$-$t'$-$J$ model with $V$ or $J_P$ coupling. We focus on the {\\it six-leg}\ncylinder system with the next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$, which hosts\npartially filled stripe and $d$-wave SC in phase diagram. By tuning $t'/t > 0$\nand $V$ or $J_P$, we establish two quantum phase diagrams. In the SC phases,\nthe increased $V$ or $J_P$ coupling can enhance the quasi-long-range SC order,\nconsistent with some previous findings. Nonetheless, no SC emerges when the\npartially filled stripe phase disappears with increased $V$ or $J_P$. Instead,\nthe system has a transition to either a phase-separation-like regime or a\nfilled stripe phase. On the other hand, with increased $t'/t$, not only the\npartially filled stripe but the phase separation and filled stripe can also be\ntuned to SC phase. Our results suggest that although $V$ and $J_P$ couplings\nmay strengthen hole binding, the hole dynamics controlled by $t'/t$ appears to\nplay more crucial role for obtaining a SC in $t$-$J$ model.",

    "abstract": "We consider the Brown measure of $a+\\mathfrak{c}$, where $a$ lies in a\ncommutative tracial von Neumann algebra $\\mathcal{B}$ and $\\mathfrak{c}$ is a\n$\\cal{B}$-valued circular element. Under certain regularity conditions on $a$\nand the covariance of $\\mathfrak{c}$ this Brown measure has a density with\nrespect to the Lebesgue measure on the complex plane which is real analytic\napart from jump discontinuities at the boundary of its support. With the\nexception of finitely many singularities this one-dimensional spectral edge is\nreal analytic. We provide a full description of all possible edge singularities\nas well as all points in the interior, where the density vanishes. The edge\nsingularities are classified in terms of their local edge shape while internal\nzeros of the density are classified in terms of the shape of the density\nlocally around these points. We also show that each of these countably\ninfinitely many singularity types occurs for an appropriate choice of $a$ when\n$\\mathfrak{c}$ is a standard circular element. The Brown measure of\n$a+\\mathfrak{c}$ arises as the empirical spectral distribution of a diagonally\ndeformed non-Hermitian random matrix with independent entries when its\ndimension tends to infinity.",

    "abstract": "While previous years have seen great progress in the 3D reconstruction of\nhumans from monocular videos, few of the state-of-the-art methods are able to\nhandle loose garments that exhibit large non-rigid surface deformations during\narticulation. This limits the application of such methods to humans that are\ndressed in standard pants or T-shirts. Our method, ReLoo, overcomes this\nlimitation and reconstructs high-quality 3D models of humans dressed in loose\ngarments from monocular in-the-wild videos. To tackle this problem, we first\nestablish a layered neural human representation that decomposes clothed humans\ninto a neural inner body and outer clothing. On top of the layered neural\nrepresentation, we further introduce a non-hierarchical virtual bone\ndeformation module for the clothing layer that can freely move, which allows\nthe accurate recovery of non-rigidly deforming loose clothing. A global\noptimization jointly optimizes the shape, appearance, and deformations of the\nhuman body and clothing via multi-layer differentiable volume rendering. To\nevaluate ReLoo, we record subjects with dynamically deforming garments in a\nmulti-view capture studio. This evaluation, both on existing and our novel\ndataset, demonstrates ReLoo's clear superiority over prior art on both indoor\ndatasets and in-the-wild videos.",

These are then combined with\nsegmentation results from the semantic segmentation model to precisely\ndelineate the boundaries of the detected changes.

Specifically, we consider a\nheterogeneous collection of $M \\ge 1$ regularized M-estimators, each trained\nwith (possibly different) subsample sizes, convex differentiable losses, and\nconvex regularizers. We operate under the proportional asymptotics regime,\nwhere the sample size $n$, feature size $p$, and subsample sizes $k_m$ for $m\n\\in [M]$ all diverge with fixed limiting ratios $n/p$ and $k_m/n$. Key to our\nanalysis is a new result on the joint asymptotic behavior of correlations\nbetween the estimator and residual errors on overlapping subsamples, governed\nthrough a (provably) contractible nonlinear system of equations. Of independent\ninterest, we also establish convergence of trace functionals related to degrees\nof freedom in the non-ensemble setting (with $M = 1$) along the way, extending\npreviously known cases for square loss and ridge, lasso regularizers.\n  When specialized to homogeneous ensembles trained with a common loss,\nregularizer, and subsample size, the risk characterization sheds some light on\nthe implicit regularization effect due to the ensemble and subsample sizes\n$(M,k)$. For any ensemble size $M$, optimally tuning subsample size yields\nsample-wise monotonic risk. For the full-ensemble estimator (when $M \\to\n\\infty$), the optimal subsample size $k^\\star$ tends to be in the\noverparameterized regime $(k^\\star \\le \\min\\{n,p\\})$, when explicit\nregularization is vanishing.

One possibility to exploit this\nhydrodynamics/gravity analogy is to create analogue black holes within\nBose-Einstein condensates. At low temperatures, phonons-low energy\nexcitations-behave like a massless scalar field in an emergent acoustic metric\ndetermined by the condensate. An acoustic black hole is created by transonic\nfluid, and quantum fluctuations at the acoustic horizon lead to thermal\nradiation of phonons, akin to Hawking radiation. This emission has been\nnumerically simulated and experimentally verified in Bose-Einstein condensates.\nThe goal of my Master's thesis is to design a system in which an acoustic\nhorizon is excited by a gravitational wave-like perturbation. The thesis is\ndivided into two main parts: the first reviews essential topics of general\nrelativity, quantum field theory in curved spacetimes and analogue gravity;\nwhile the second presents my results. Firstly, I propose a method to reproduce\na gravitational wave perturbation on a flat background acoustic metric emergent\nfrom a Bose-Einstein condensate. Secondly, I demonstrate how to implement an\nimpinging gravitational wave-like perturbation at an acoustic horizon.

We prove that the\nfollowing hardness assumptions are equivalent. (1) The hardness of\napproximating the probability assigned to a randomly chosen string in the\nsupport of certain efficiently sampleable distributions (upto inverse\npolynomial multiplicative error).(2) The existence of one-way puzzles, where a\nquantum sampler outputs a pair of classical strings -- a puzzle and its key --\nand where the hardness lies in finding the key corresponding to a random\npuzzle. These are known to imply quantum bit commitments [Khurana and Tomer,\nSTOC'24]. (3) The existence of state puzzles, or one-way state synthesis, where\nit is hard to synthesize a secret quantum state given a public classical\nidentifier. These capture the hardness of search problems with quantum inputs\n(secrets) and classical outputs (challenges).

Finally, using\nalmost 100 FeII lines rising from energy levels between 0 and 33000 cm-1, we\nderive the complete excitation diagram of Fe+ in the comet. The transiting gas\nis found to be populated at an excitation temperature of 8190+-160 K, very\nclose to the stellar effective temperature (8052 K).

In this regime, the\nexcitation of Fe+ is controlled by the stellar flux, and do not depend on the\nlocal electronic temperature or density.

    "abstract": "Plant morphological traits, their observable characteristics, are fundamental\nto understand the role played by each species within their ecosystem. However,\ncompiling trait information for even a moderate number of species is a\ndemanding task that may take experts years to accomplish. At the same time,\nmassive amounts of information about species descriptions is available online\nin the form of text, although the lack of structure makes this source of data\nimpossible to use at scale. To overcome this, we propose to leverage recent\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) and devise a mechanism for gathering\nand processing information on plant traits in the form of unstructured textual\ndescriptions, without manual curation. We evaluate our approach by\nautomatically replicating three manually created species-trait matrices. Our\nmethod managed to find values for over half of all species-trait pairs, with an\nF1-score of over 75%. Our results suggest that large-scale creation of\nstructured trait databases from unstructured online text is currently feasible\nthanks to the information extraction capabilities of LLMs, being limited by the\navailability of textual descriptions covering all the traits of interest.",

However, it is challenging\nto integrate camera-based optical tactile sensing into a soft gripper without\ncompromising the flexibility and adaptability of the fingers, while also\nensuring that the precision of tactile perception remains unaffected by passive\ndeformations of the soft structure during object contact. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate a modular soft two-fingered gripper with a 3D-printed optical\ntactile sensor (the TacTip) integrated in the palm. We propose a soft-grasping\nstrategy that includes three functions: light contact detection, grasp pose\nadjustment and loss-of-contact detection, so that objects of different shapes\nand sizes can be grasped stably and placed precisely, which we test with both\nartificial and household objects. By sequentially implementing these three\nfunctions, the grasp success rate progressively improves from 45% without any\nfunctions, to 59% with light contact detection, 90% with grasp pose adjustment,\nand 97% with loss-of-contact detection, achieving a sub-millimeter placement\nprecision.

By\nperforming Observing System Simulation Experiments, we demonstrate how the\nEnsemble Kalman Filter technique, when used with a SFT model, can be utilized\nto make ``posterior'' estimates of flow profiles into the future that can be\nused to drive the model forward to forecast photospheric magnetic field\ndistribution.",

These\nbinaries are placed in the m12i synthetic Milky-Way-like galaxy, and their\nsignal-to-noise ratio for the LISA instrument is estimated, considering a\ngalactic gravitational wave foreground informed by the population. Through the\nuse of Fisher estimates, we construct a likelihood function for the measurement\nerror of the LISA-bright DWD binaries (> 20 SNR, fGW > 5mHz), in their\ngravitational wave frequency (fGW) and chirp mass. By repeating this process\nfor different assumptions of the common envelope ejection efficiency, we apply\nBayesian hierarchical inference to find the best match to an injected\nastrophysical assumption for a fiducial population model.

Gravitational lens systems on milli-arcsecond scales\n(milli-lenses) are expected for a population of dense DM halos (free-floating\nor sub-halos) and free-floating supermassive black holes in the mass range of\n$10^6$ to $10^9\\,M_\\odot$. In this paper, we aim to look for milli-lens systems\nvia a systematic search in a large sample of radio-loud AGN observed with\nvery-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We present the observational strategy\nto discriminate milli-lenses from contaminant objects mimicking a milli-lens\nmorphology. In a pilot project, we have investigated VLBI images from 13,828\nsources from the Astrogeo VLBI image database and reduced the number of\ncandidates to 40 in a first step. We present here the images and analysis of\nnew sensitive follow-up observations with the EVN at 5 and 22 GHz and\nstreamline our analysis to reject milli-lens candidates. By using constraints\nsuch as the surface brightness ratio, conservation of spectral shape, stability\nof flux ratios over time, and changes in morphology, we can confidently\ndiscriminate between milli-lenses and contaminant objects that mimick them.\nUsing the above constraints, we rule out 31 out of our initial 40 candidates of\nmilli-lens systems, demonstrating the power of our approach. Also, we found\nmany new candidate compact symmetric objects, which are thought to be primarily\nshort-lived jetted radio sources. This serves as a pathfinder for the final\nsample used for the Search for MIlli-LEnses (SMILE) project, which will allow\nus to constrain DM models by comparing the results to theoretical predictions.\nThis SMILE sample will consist of $\\sim$5,000 sources based on the VLA CLASS\nsurvey, including many observations obtained for this project specifically.",

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus\non general code generation without considering API-oriented code generation,\ni.e., generating code that invokes APIs from specific libraries. Given the\ngrowing demand for API-oriented code generation, there is a pressing need for a\nsystematic and automated approach to evaluate LLM on API-oriented code\ngeneration. To address this gap, we propose AutoAPIEval, a lightweight and\nautomated framework designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in\nAPI-oriented code generation. Our framework works with any library that\nprovides API documentation and focuses on two unit tasks: API recommendation\nand code example generation, along with four metrics to evaluate the generated\nAPIs and code examples, such as the proportion of incorrect API recommendations\nfor Task 1, and the proportion of code examples where no specific API is\ninvoked and uncompilable/unexecutable code examples for Task 2. In addition, we\nconducted a case study on three LLMs (ChatGPT, MagiCoder, and DeepSeek Coder)\nand Java Runtime Environment 8 to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.\nOur findings reveal substantial variability in LLM performance across tasks,\nwith ChatGPT adhering better to instructions, while sharing similar\neffectiveness in code example generation with its counterparts (i.e., MagiCoder\nand DeekSeek Coder). We also identify key factors associated with code quality,\nsuch as API popularity and model confidence, and build classifiers that achieve\nhigh accuracy in detecting incorrect API recommendations and erroneous code\nexamples.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in soft actuators have enabled soft continuum swimming\nrobots to achieve higher efficiency and more closely mimic the behaviors of\nreal marine animals. However, optimizing the design and control of these soft\ncontinuum robots remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a\npractical framework for the co-optimization of the design and control of soft\ncontinuum robots, approached from a geometric locomotion analysis perspective.\nThis framework is based on the principles of geometric mechanics, accounting\nfor swimming at both low and high Reynolds numbers. By generalizing geometric\nprinciples to continuum bodies, we achieve efficient geometric variational\nco-optimization of designs and gaits across different power consumption metrics\nand swimming environments. The resulting optimal designs and gaits exhibit\ngreater efficiencies at both low and high Reynolds numbers compared to\nthree-link or serpenoid swimmers with the same degrees of freedom, approaching\nor even surpassing the efficiencies of infinitely flexible swimmers and those\nwith higher degrees of freedom.",

The kernel of the code is based on the theoretical\nframework set forth by NASA's computer program CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with\nApplications) while incorporating new algorithms that significantly improve\nboth convergence rate and robustness. The thermochemical properties are\ncomputed under the ideal gas approximation using an up-to-date version of\nNASA's 9-coefficient polynomial fits. These fits use the Third Millennium\ndatabase, which includes the available values from Active Thermochemical\nTables. Combustion Toolbox is programmed in MATLAB with an object-oriented\narchitecture composed of three main modules: CT-EQUIL, CT-SD, and CT-ROCKET.\nThe kernel module, CT-EQUIL, minimizes the Gibbs/Helmholtz free energy of the\nsystem using the technique of Lagrange multipliers combined with a\nmultidimensional Newton-Raphson method, upon the condition that two state\nfunctions are used to define the mixture properties (e.g., enthalpy and\npressure). CT-SD solves processes involving strong changes in dynamic pressure,\nsuch as steady shock and detonation waves under normal and oblique incidence\nangles. Finally, CT-ROCKET estimates rocket engine performance under highly\nidealized conditions. The new tool is equipped with a versatile Graphical User\nInterface and has been successfully used for teaching and research activities\nover the last four years. Results are in excellent agreement with CEA, Cantera\nwithin Caltech's Shock and Detonation Toolbox (SD-Toolbox), and the\nThermochemical Equilibrium Abundances (TEA) code.

While\nNewton-type algorithms achieve linear convergence in communication rounds,\ntransmitting full Hessian matrices is often impractical due to quadratic\ncomplexity. We introduce Federated Learning with Enhanced Nesterov-Newton\nSketch (FLeNS), a novel method that harnesses both the acceleration\ncapabilities of Nesterov's method and the dimensionality reduction benefits of\nHessian sketching. FLeNS approximates the centralized Newton's method without\nrelying on the exact Hessian, significantly reducing communication overhead. By\ncombining Nesterov's acceleration with adaptive Hessian sketching, FLeNS\npreserves crucial second-order information while preserving the rapid\nconvergence characteristics. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in statistical\nlearning, demonstrates that FLeNS achieves super-linear convergence rates in\ncommunication rounds - a notable advancement in federated optimization. We\nprovide rigorous convergence guarantees and characterize tradeoffs between\nacceleration, sketch size, and convergence speed. Extensive empirical\nevaluation validates our theoretical findings, showcasing FLeNS's\nstate-of-the-art performance with reduced communication requirements,\nparticularly in privacy-sensitive and edge-computing scenarios.

We used publicly available PSF-matched deep photometric\ndata from the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes to infer the spatially\nresolved star formation history of this galaxy. F0083 shows clear signs of\nram-pressure stripping (RPS), with a recently enhanced star formation rate\n(SFR) orientated towards the south-west quadrant of the stellar disc. The\nstellar mass surface density is heavily asymmetric, with a variation of nearly\n1 dex between the western spiral arm and the postulated tidal feature. This\nfeature appears to contain a high proportion of older stars, ruling out RPS as\nthe cause of this `unwinding'. We identified two potential interaction\ncandidates, 28171 and 26055, with masses\n$\\log_{10}(M_*/\\rm{M}_{\\odot})=8.56\\pm0.06$ and\n$\\log_{10}(M_*/\\rm{M}_{\\odot})=9.24\\pm0.09$, respectively, and projected\nseparations of 31 kpc and 46 kpc. The star formation history (SFH) of the tidal\nfeature in F0083 indicates a steep change in SFR at lookback times\n$t_L\\lesssim1\\,$Gyr, consistent with a burst in the SFH of 26055. The most\nprobable formation scenario of F0083 thus indicates a significant tidal\ninteraction, followed by RPS as the combined system approaches pericentre\npassage. Our results demonstrate that by using photometric data we are able to\ndistinguish between these consecutive processes, and represent the first\nobservational analysis of the contributions of each process at this redshift.",

    "abstract": "In the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era, the control over the\nqubits is limited due to the errors caused by quantum decoherence, crosstalk,\nand imperfect calibration. Hence, it is necessary to reduce the size of the\nlarge-scale classical data, such as images, when they are to be processed by\nquantum networks. Conventionally input classical data are reduced in the\nclassical domain using classical networks such as autoencoders and,\nsubsequently, analyzed in the quantum domain. These conventional techniques\ninvolve training an enormous number of parameters, making them computationally\ncostly. In this paper, a dynamic patch-based quantum domain data reduction\nnetwork with a classical attention mechanism is proposed to avoid such data\nreductions, and subsequently coupled with a novel quantum classifier to perform\nclassification tasks. The architecture processes the classical data\nsequentially in patches and reduces them using a quantum convolutional-inspired\nreduction network and further enriches them using a self-attention technique,\nwhich utilizes a classical mask derived from simple statistical operations on\nthe native classical data, after measurement. The reduced representation is\npassed through a quantum classifier, which re-encodes it into quantum states,\nprocesses them through quantum ansatzes, and finally measures them to predict\nclasses. This training process involves a joint optimization scheme that\nconsiders both the reduction and classifier networks, making the reduction\noperation dynamic. The proposed architecture has been extensively tested on the\npublicly available Fashion MNIST dataset, and it has excellent classification\nperformance using significantly reduced training parameters.",

Water stations are interconnected,\nand this connectivity influences the measurements at other stations. However,\nthe dynamic and implicit nature of water flow paths makes it challenging to\nextract a priori knowledge of the connectivity structure. We hypothesize that\nterrain elevation significantly affects flow and connectivity. To incorporate\nthis, we use LiDAR terrain elevation data encoded through a Vision Transformer\n(ViT). The ViT, which has demonstrated excellent performance in image\nclassification by directly applying transformers to sequences of image patches,\nefficiently captures spatial features of terrain elevation. To account for both\nspatial and temporal features, we employ GRU blocks enhanced with graph\nconvolution, a method widely used in the literature. We propose a hybrid graph\nlearning structure that combines static and dynamic graph learning. A static\ngraph, derived from transformer-encoded LiDAR data, captures terrain elevation\nrelationships, while a dynamic graph adapts to temporal changes, improving the\noverall graph representation. We apply graph convolution in two layers through\nthese static and dynamic graphs. Our method makes daily predictions up to 12\ndays ahead. Empirical results from multiple water stations in Quebec\ndemonstrate that our method significantly reduces prediction error by an\naverage of 10\\% across all days, with greater improvements for longer\nforecasting horizons.",

Their multiplicity\nforms an important anchor point in single and binary population models for\npredicting gravitational-wave progenitors. Recent spectroscopic campaigns have\nsuggested incompatible multiplicity fractions and period distributions for N-\nand C-rich Galactic WRs (WNs and WCs) at short as well as long orbital periods,\nin contradiction with evolutionary model predictions. In this work, we employed\ninfrared interferometry using the $K$-band instrument GRAVITY at the VLTI to\ninvestigate the multiplicity of WRs at long periods and explore the nature of\ntheir companions. We present a survey of 39 Galactic WRs, including 11 WN, 15\nWC and 13 H-rich WN (WNh) stars. We detected wide companions with GRAVITY for\nonly four stars: WR 48, WR 89, WR 93 and WR 115. Combining with spectroscopic\nstudies, we arrived at multiplicity fractions of $f^{\\rm WN}_{\\rm obs} =\n0.55\\pm0.15$, $f^{\\rm WC}_{\\rm obs} = 0.40\\pm0.13$ and $f^{\\rm WNh}_{\\rm obs} =\n0.23\\pm0.12$. In addition, we also found other features in the GRAVITY dataset\nsuch as (i) a diffuse extended component in over half the WR sample; (ii) five\nknown spectroscopic binaries resolved in differential phase data and (iii)\nspatially resolved winds in four stars: WR 16, WR 31a, WR 78 and WR 110. Our\nsurvey reveals a lack of intermediate (few 100s d) and long- (few years to\ndecades) period WR systems. The 200-d peak in the period distributions of WR+OB\nand BH+OB binaries predicted by Case B mass-transfer binary evolution models is\nnot seen in our data. The rich companionship of their O-type progenitors in\nthis separation range suggest that the WR progenitor stars expand and interact\nwith their companions, most likely through unstable mass-transfer, resulting in\neither a short-period system or a merger.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents chemical abundances of twelve elements (C, Na, Mg, Al,\nSi, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe) for 80 FGK dwarfs in the Pleiades open\ncluster, which span a temperature range of $\\sim$2000 K in T$_{\\rm eff}$, using\nthe high-resolution (R$\\sim$22,500) near-infrared SDSS-IV/APOGEE spectra\n($\\lambda$1.51--1.69 \\micron). Using a 1D LTE abundance analysis, we determine\nan overall metallicity of [Fe/H]=+0.03$\\pm$0.04 dex, with the elemental ratios\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]=+0.01$\\pm$0.05, [odd-z/Fe]=-0.04$\\pm$0.08, and [iron\npeak/Fe]=-0.02$\\pm$0.08. These abundances for the Pleiades are in line with the\nabundances of other open clusters at similar galactocentric distances as\npresented in the literature. Examination of the abundances derived from each\nindividual spectral line revealed that several of the stronger lines displayed\ntrends of decreasing abundance with decreasing $T_{\\rm eff}$. The list of\nspectral lines that yield abundances that are independent of $T_{\\rm eff}$ are\npresented and used for deriving the final abundances. An investigation into\npossible causes of the temperature-dependent abundances derived from the\nstronger lines suggests that the radiative codes and the APOGEE line list we\nemploy may inadequately model van der Waals broadening, in particular in the\ncooler K dwarfs.",

This much more efficient\nnuclear rocket propulsion FFRE design was first proposed in the 1980s with the\nintent of greatly reducing transit times in long$\\unicode{x2013}$duration space\ntravel. Our objective is to enhance the operational efficiency of this nuclear\nrocket while gaining deeper insights into the behavior of fuel particles and of\nthe fission$\\unicode{x2013}$fragment ejecta within strong magnetic fields\nexperimentally. Through a combination of simulations and experimental work, we\nestablished a method for the production and detection of alpha particles as a\nsurrogate for fission fragments.

By simulating, measuring, and analyzing the emitted\nalpha particle flux, we gained valuable information about the distribution and\nlikelihood of escape of fission fragments in a future FFRE design. This\napproach could potentially achieve both high specific impulse and power density\nin advanced nuclear propulsion systems, such as the FFRE.

As a result, our algorithm is fast, provides guarantees on\nthe amount of memory used, and exploits the additional information provided by\nthe predictor to produce highly accurate estimates. We also propose a simple\nand domain-independent predictor, based on the degree of nodes, that can be\neasily computed with one pass on a stream of edges when the stream is available\nbeforehand.\n  Our analytical results show that, when the predictor provides useful\ninformation on the heaviness of edges, it leads to estimates with reduced\nvariance compared to the state-of-the-art, even when the predictions are far\nfrom perfect. Our experimental results show that, when analyzing a single graph\nstream, our algorithm is faster than the state-of-the-art for a given memory\nbudget, while providing significantly more accurate estimates.

    "abstract": "This paper proves optimal tradeoffs between the locality and parameters of\nquantum error-correcting codes. Quantum codes give a promising avenue towards\nquantum fault tolerance, but the practical constraint of locality limits their\nquality. The seminal Bravyi-Poulin-Terhal (BPT) bound says that a $[[n,k,d]]$\nquantum stabilizer code with 2D-locality must satisfy $kd^2\\le O(n)$. We answer\nthe natural question: for better code parameters, how much \"non-locality\" is\nneeded? In particular, (i) how long must the long-range interactions be, and\n(ii) how many long-range interactions must there be?\n  We give a complete answer to both questions for all $n,k,d$: above the BPT\nbound, any 2D-embedding must have at least $\\Omega(\\#^*)$ interactions of\nlength $\\Omega(\\ell^*)$, where $\\#^*= \\max(k,d)$ and\n$\\ell^*=\\max\\big(\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\big( \\frac{kd^2}{n} \\big)^{1/4} \\big)$.\nConversely, we exhibit quantum codes that show, in strong ways, that our\ninteraction length $\\ell^*$ and interaction count $\\#^*$ are asymptotically\noptimal for all $n,k,d$.\n  Our results generalize or improve all prior works on this question, including\nthe BPT bound and the results of Baspin and Krishna. One takeaway of our work\nis that, for any desired distance $d$ and dimension $k$, the number of\nlong-range interactions is asymptotically minimized by a good qLDPC code of\nlength $\\Theta(\\max(k,d))$. Following Baspin and Krishna, we also apply our\nresults to the codes implemented in the stacked architecture and obtain better\nbounds. In particular, we rule out any implementation of hypergraph product\ncodes in the stacked architecture.",

    "abstract": "Aspect-Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) is a recently proposed task of\naspect-based sentiment analysis that consists in extracting (aspect phrase,\nopinion phrase, sentiment polarity) triples from a given sentence. Recent\nstate-of-the-art methods approach this task by first extracting all possible\ntext spans from a given text, then filtering the potential aspect and opinion\nphrases with a classifier, and finally considering all their pairs with another\nclassifier that additionally assigns sentiment polarity to them. Although\nseveral variations of the above scheme have been proposed, the common feature\nis that the final result is constructed by a sequence of independent classifier\ndecisions. This hinders the exploitation of dependencies between extracted\nphrases and prevents the use of knowledge about the interrelationships between\nclassifier predictions to improve performance. In this paper, we propose a new\nASTE approach consisting of three transformer-inspired layers, which enables\nthe modelling of dependencies both between phrases and between the final\nclassifier decisions. Experimental results show that the method achieves higher\nperformance in terms of F1 measure than other methods studied on popular\nbenchmarks. In addition, we show that a simple pre-training technique further\nimproves the performance of the model.",

    "abstract": "Unlike most human-engineered systems, many biological systems rely on\nemergent behaviors from low-level interactions, enabling greater diversity and\nsuperior adaptation to complex, dynamic environments. This study explores\nemergent decentralized rotation in the Loopy multicellular robot, composed of\nhomogeneous, physically linked, 1-degree-of-freedom cells. Inspired by\nbiological systems like sunflowers, Loopy uses simple local\ninteractions-diffusion, reaction, and active transport of simulated chemicals,\ncalled morphogens-without centralized control or knowledge of its global\nmorphology. Through these interactions, the robot self-organizes to achieve\ncoordinated rotational motion and forms lobes-local protrusions created by\nclusters of motor cells. This study investigates how these interactions drive\nLoopy's rotation, the impact of its morphology, and its resilience to actuator\nfailures. Our findings reveal two distinct behaviors: 1) inner valleys between\nlobes rotate faster than the outer peaks, contrasting with rigid body dynamics,\nand 2) cells rotate in the opposite direction of the overall morphology. The\nexperiments show that while Loopy's morphology does not affect its angular\nvelocity relative to its cells, larger lobes increase cellular rotation and\ndecrease morphology rotation relative to the environment. Even with up to\none-third of its actuators disabled and significant morphological changes,\nLoopy maintains its rotational abilities, highlighting the potential of\ndecentralized, bio-inspired strategies for resilient and adaptable robotic\nsystems.",

Numerous studies have been conducted to predict short-term vehicle\ntrajectories in the immediate future. However, long-term trajectory prediction\nremains a major challenge due to accumulated errors and uncertainties.\nAdditionally, balancing accuracy with interpretability in the prediction is\nanother challenging issue in predicting vehicle trajectory. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory\nPrediction Model (GNP). The GNP model simplifies vehicle trajectory prediction\ninto a two-stage process: determining the vehicle's goal and then choosing the\nappropriate trajectory to reach this goal. The GNP model contains two\nsub-modules to achieve this process. The first sub-module employs a multi-head\nattention mechanism to accurately predict goals. The second sub-module\nintegrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to\nprogressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals. The\nGNP demonstrates state-of-the-art long-term prediction accuracy compared to\nfour baseline models.

All the models were evaluated with fivefold\ncross-validation in terms of the Dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff\ndistance. Our proposed double U-Net model trained with input sequences [T1,\nT1C, FL + T2, T1C] achieved a better mean Dice score of 0.8585 and Hausdorff\ndistance of 4.1942 compared to all the baseline models and ensemble models\ntrained. The presence of infiltrating tumors and vasogenic edema in the\npost-operative MRI scans tends to reduce segmentation accuracy when considering\nthe MRI sequences T1, T2, T1C, and FL together for model training. The double\nU-Net approach of combining subsets of the MRI sequences as distinct inputs for\nmodel training improves segmentation accuracy by 7% when compared with the\nconventional method of model training with all four sequences.",

    "abstract": "A spike camera is a specialized high-speed visual sensor that offers\nadvantages such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic range compared to\nconventional frame cameras. These features provide the camera with significant\nadvantages in many computer vision tasks. However, the tasks of novel view\nsynthesis based on spike cameras remain underdeveloped. Although there are\nexisting methods for learning neural radiance fields from spike stream, they\neither lack robustness in extremely noisy, low-quality lighting conditions or\nsuffer from high computational complexity due to the deep fully connected\nneural networks and ray marching rendering strategies used in neural radiance\nfields, making it difficult to recover fine texture details. In contrast, the\nlatest advancements in 3DGS have achieved high-quality real-time rendering by\noptimizing the point cloud representation into Gaussian ellipsoids. Building on\nthis, we introduce SpikeGS, the method to learn 3D Gaussian fields solely from\nspike stream. We designed a differentiable spike stream rendering framework\nbased on 3DGS, incorporating noise embedding and spiking neurons. By leveraging\nthe multi-view consistency of 3DGS and the tile-based multi-threaded parallel\nrendering mechanism, we achieved high-quality real-time rendering results.\nAdditionally, we introduced a spike rendering loss function that generalizes\nunder varying illumination conditions. Our method can reconstruct view\nsynthesis results with fine texture details from a continuous spike stream\ncaptured by a moving spike camera, while demonstrating high robustness in\nextremely noisy low-light scenarios. Experimental results on both real and\nsynthetic datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in\nterms of rendering quality and speed.

We formulate this as a Stochastic\nOptimal Control problem of the Path Integral Control type, with a cost function\ncomprising (in its basic form) a quadratic control term, a quadratic state\nterm, and a terminal constraint. This framework, which we refer to as Harmonic\nPath Integral Diffusion (H-PID), leverages an analytical solution through a\nmapping to an auxiliary quantum harmonic oscillator in imaginary time.\n  The H-PID framework results in a set of efficient sampling algorithms,\nwithout the incorporation of Neural Networks. The algorithms are validated on\ntwo standard use cases: a mixture of Gaussians over a grid and images from\nCIFAR-10. The transparency of the method allows us to analyze the algorithms in\ndetail, particularly revealing that the current weighted state is an order\nparameter for the dynamic phase transition, signaling earlier, at $t<1$, that\nthe sample generation process is almost complete. We contrast these algorithms\nwith other sampling methods, particularly simulated annealing and path integral\nsampling, highlighting their advantages in terms of analytical control,\naccuracy, and computational efficiency on benchmark problems.\n  Additionally, we extend the methodology to more general cases where the\nunderlying stochastic differential equation includes an external deterministic,\npossibly non-conservative force, and where the cost function incorporates a\ngauge potential term.",

However, there are many parameters to\noptimize in just the retrieval system alone. This paper presents an ablation\nstudy exploring how different embedding models and pooling methods affect\ninformation retrieval for the clinical domain.\n  Methods: Evaluating on three retrieval tasks on two electronic health record\n(EHR) data sources, we compared seven models, including medical- and\ngeneral-domain models, specialized encoder embedding models, and off-the-shelf\ndecoder LLMs. We also examine the choice of embedding pooling strategy for each\nmodel, independently on the query and the text to retrieve.\n  Results: We found that the choice of embedding model significantly impacts\nretrieval performance, with BGE, a comparatively small general-domain model,\nconsistently outperforming all others, including medical-specific models.\nHowever, our findings also revealed substantial variability across datasets and\nquery text phrasings. We also determined the best pooling methods for each of\nthese models to guide future design of retrieval systems.\n  Discussion: The choice of embedding model, pooling strategy, and query\nformulation can significantly impact retrieval performance and the performance\nof these models on other public benchmarks does not necessarily transfer to new\ndomains.

This raises a critical\nquestion:\n  Do the established principles that proved successful in the\ngeneralization-centric era remain valid in this new era of scaling?\n  This paper examines several influential regularization-based principles that\nmay no longer hold true in the scaling-centric, large language model (LLM) era.\nThese principles include explicit L2 regularization and implicit regularization\nthrough small batch sizes and large learning rates.

    "abstract": "Leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs), recent LLM-based robot task planning methods yield promising results.\nHowever, they mainly focus on single or multiple homogeneous robots on simple\ntasks. Practically, complex long-horizon tasks always require collaboration\namong multiple heterogeneous robots especially with more complex action spaces,\nwhich makes these tasks more challenging. To this end, we propose COHERENT, a\nnovel LLM-based task planning framework for collaboration of heterogeneous\nmulti-robot systems including quadrotors, robotic dogs, and robotic arms.\nSpecifically, a Proposal-Execution-Feedback-Adjustment (PEFA) mechanism is\ndesigned to decompose and assign actions for individual robots, where a\ncentralized task assigner makes a task planning proposal to decompose the\ncomplex task into subtasks, and then assigns subtasks to robot executors. Each\nrobot executor selects a feasible action to implement the assigned subtask and\nreports self-reflection feedback to the task assigner for plan adjustment. The\nPEFA loops until the task is completed. Moreover, we create a challenging\nheterogeneous multi-robot task planning benchmark encompassing 100 complex\nlong-horizon tasks. The experimental results show that our work surpasses the\nprevious methods by a large margin in terms of success rate and execution\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "When planning a clinical trial for a time-to-event endpoint, we require an\nestimated effect size and need to consider the type of effect. Usually, an\neffect of proportional hazards is assumed with the hazard ratio as the\ncorresponding effect measure. Thus, the standard procedure for survival data is\ngenerally based on a single-stage log-rank test. Knowing that the assumption of\nproportional hazards is often violated and sufficient knowledge to derive\nreasonable effect sizes is usually unavailable, such an approach is relatively\nrigid. We introduce a more flexible procedure by combining two methods designed\nto be more robust in case we have little to no prior knowledge. First, we\nemploy a more flexible adaptive multi-stage design instead of a single-stage\ndesign. Second, we apply combination-type tests in the first stage of our\nsuggested procedure to benefit from their robustness under uncertainty about\nthe deviation pattern. We can then use the data collected during this period to\nchoose a more specific single-weighted log-rank test for the subsequent stages.\nIn this step, we employ Royston-Parmar spline models to extrapolate the\nsurvival curves to make a reasonable decision. Based on a real-world data\nexample, we show that our approach can save a trial that would otherwise end\nwith an inconclusive result.

Current neural\nreconstruction methods require multispectral images to be upsampled with a\npansharpening method using the spatial data in the panchromatic image. However,\nthese methods may introduce biases and hallucinations due to domain gaps.\nFusionRF introduces joint image fusion during optimization through a novel\ncross-resolution kernel that learns to resolve spatial resolution loss present\nin multispectral images. As input, FusionRF accepts the original multispectral\nand panchromatic data, eliminating the need for image preprocessing. FusionRF\nalso leverages multimodal appearance embeddings that encode the image\ncharacteristics of each modality and view within a uniform representation. By\noptimizing on both modalities, FusionRF learns to fuse image modalities while\nperforming reconstruction tasks and eliminates the need for a pansharpening\npreprocessing step.

We introduce a new approach\nCamal, which boasts the following features: (1) ML-Aided: Camal is the first\nattempt to apply active learning to tune LSM-tree based key-value stores. The\nlearning process is coupled with traditional cost models to improve the\ntraining process; (2) Decoupled Active Learning: backed by rigorous analysis,\nCamal adopts active learning paradigm based on a decoupled tuning of each\nparameter, which further accelerates the learning process; (3) Easy\nExtrapolation: Camal adopts an effective mechanism to incrementally update the\nmodel with the growth of the data size; (4) Dynamic Mode: Camal is able to tune\nLSM-tree online under dynamically changing workloads; (5) Significant System\nImprovement: By integrating Camal into a full system RocksDB, the system\nperformance improves by 28% on average and up to 8x compared to a\nstate-of-the-art RocksDB design.",

We consider the asymptotic motion\nof the projectile, i.e., the motion on a sufficiently large time interval. The\nequations of motion are written both in Cartesian coordinates and in natural\naxes. The aim of the study is the analytical determination of the\ncharacteristics of asymptotic motion - the limiting angle of inclination of the\ntrajectory to the horizontal and the terminal velocity, and obtaining an\nanalytical representation for the velocity hodograph. No restrictions are\nimposed on the initial throwing conditions and other parameters. The equations\nof motion in Cartesian coordinates are used to find the angle of inclination of\nthe trajectory and the terminal velocity. The equations of motion in natural\naxes are used to determine velocity hodograph. The velocity hodograph is\ndefined in the form an approximate implicit analytical formula linking the\ntrajectory angle of the projectile to its velocity. The motion of a golf ball,\nis presented as example. Numerical calculations show a complete coincidence of\nanalytically found values of required quantities with numerically found values.\nThe proposed analytical formulas can be useful for all researchers of this\nclassical problem",

Further\nperformance improvements can be achieved by optimizing the phase shifters on\nthe expanded antenna arrays at the collaborative devices. These findings are\ncorroborated by ray-tracing simulations.

Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have great potential to improve the\nquality of decision-making in this continuous, highly dynamic and interactive\nenvironment because of their stronger sensing and communicating ability.

Our analysis of a recent Azure LLM inference trace\nreveals a highly skewed long-tail distribution of input lengths, with\napproximately 80% of inputs shorter than 2K tokens. Long inputs constitute only\na small fraction. Existing cluster-level LLM scheduling strategies, including\nFirst-In-First-Out (FIFO), reservation-based, and priority-based approaches,\nprimarily target short-input requests with lengths below 2K and fail to address\nthis heterogeneity, leading to inefficiencies such as head-of-line blocking,\nresource underutilization, and starvation of long-input requests.

We solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation - the state-of-the-art\ndescription of excitons - by explicitly accounting for phonon-assisted\nscreening effects in the screened Coulomb interaction. In the examples of the\npolar semiconductors ZnS, MgO, and GaN, the exciton binding energies at the\nabsorption onset are found to be renormalized by a few tens of meV. Similar\neffects are also found for higher-lying unbound electron-hole pairs, leading to\nred-shifts of the absorption peaks by up to 50 meV. Our analysis reveals that\nvibrational screening is dictated by long-range Fr\\\"ohlich coupling involving\npolar longitudinal optical phonons, whereas the remaining vibrational degrees\nof freedom are negligible. Overall, by elucidating the influence of phonon\nscreening on the excitonic states and absorption spectra of these selected\nionic semiconductors, this study contributes to advancing the ab initio\nmethodology and the fundamental understanding of exciton-phonon coupling in\nsolids.",

In the context of Open\nRAN, the importance of Energy Saving (ES) is heightened, especially with the\ncurrent direction of network densification in sixth generation of mobile\nnetworks (6G). Traditional energy-saving methods in RAN struggle with the\nincreasing dynamics of the network. This paper proposes using Reinforcement\nLearning (RL), a subset of Machine Learning (ML), to improve ES. We present a\nnovel deep RL method for ES in 6G O-RAN, implemented as xApp (ES-xApp). We\ndeveloped two Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based ES-xApps. ES-xApp-1 uses RSS and User\nEquipment (UE) geolocations, while ES-xApp-2 uses only RSS. The proposed models\nsignificantly outperformed heuristic and baseline xApps, especially with over\n20 UEs. With 50 UEs, 50% of Radio Cards (RCs) were switched off, compared to\n17% with the heuristic algorithm. We have observed that more informative inputs\nmay lead to more stable training and results.

Previous estimations have used in situ measurements near the\nEarth, and consequently suffer from electron beam propagation effects. In this\nstudy, we deduce properties of a rapid sequence of escaping electron beams that\nwere accelerated during a solar flare on 22 May 2013 and produced type III\nradio bursts, including the first estimate of energy density from remote\nsensing observations. We use extreme-ultraviolet observations to infer the\nmagnetic structure of the source active region NOAA 11745, and Nan\\c{c}ay\nRadioheliograph imaging spectroscopy to estimate the speed and origin of the\nescaping electron beams. Using the observationally deduced electron beam\nproperties from the type III bursts and co-temporal hard X-rays, we simulate\nelectron beam properties to estimate the electron number density and energy in\nthe acceleration region. We find an electron density (above $30\\ \\mathrm{keV}$)\nin the acceleration region of $10^{2.5}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and an energy\ndensity of $2\\times10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{erg\\ cm}^{-3}$.

In fact it comes: 1) from a confusion\nbetween logical and thermodynamic irreversibilities and between logical and\nthermodynamic states, which is reminiscent of the classic Gibbs' paradox about\nthe joining of two volumes of the same gas; and 2) from two unnecessary\nconstraints imposed on the erase procedure. Clarifying these points permits: to\ndissociate the notions of logical and thermodynamic irreversibilities; to\ninvalidate Landauer's result as being a general physical principle; and to open\nthe door to hardware implementations allowing erasure to follow a\nthermodynamically reversible, or at least quasistatic, path.",

The flow is forced by an axisymmetric beam of progressive sound waves\nattenuating over a significant part of a closed cylindrical vessel where the\njet is confined. We focus on the steady, axisymmetric and laminar regime. The\njet typically displays a strong acceleration close to the source before\nreaching a peak velocity. At further distances from the transducer, the on-axis\njet velocity smoothly decays before reaching the opposite wall. For each of\nthese flow regions along the jet, we derive scaling laws for the on-axis\nvelocity with the magnitude of the acoustic force and the diffraction of the\ndriving acoustic beam. These laws highlight the different flow regimes along\nthe jet and establish a clear picture of its spatial structure, able to inform\nthe design of experimental or industrial setups involving Eckart streaming\njets.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm designed\nfor privacy-sensitive applications that run on resource-constrained devices\nwith non-Identically and Independently Distributed (IID) data. Traditional FL\nframeworks adopt the client-server model with a single-level aggregation (AGR)\nprocess, where the server builds the global model by aggregating all trained\nlocal models received from client devices. However, this conventional approach\nencounters challenges, including susceptibility to model/data poisoning\nattacks. In recent years, advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge\ncomputing have enabled the development of hierarchical FL systems with a\ntwo-level AGR process running at edge and cloud servers. In this paper, we\npropose a Secure Hierarchical FL (SHFL) framework to address poisoning attacks\nin hierarchical edge networks. By aggregating trained models at the edge, SHFL\nemploys two novel methods to address model/data poisoning attacks in the\npresence of client adversaries: 1) a client selection algorithm running at the\nedge for choosing IoT devices to participate in training, and 2) a model AGR\nmethod designed based on convex optimization theory to reduce the impact of\nedge models from networks with adversaries in the process of computing the\nglobal model (at the cloud level). The evaluation results reveal that compared\nto state-of-the-art methods, SHFL significantly increases the maximum accuracy\nachieved by the global model in the presence of client adversaries applying\nmodel/data poisoning attacks.",

Nevertheless, DC-QAOA introduces\nmore CNOT gates per layer, so the overall circuit complexity is a tradeoff\nbetween the number of CNOT gates per layer and the circuit depth and must be\ncarefully assessed. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of\nDC-QAOA and QAOA on MaxCut problem with the total number of CNOT gates held\nequal, and we focus on one implementation of counterdiabatic terms using nested\ncommutators in DC-QAOA, termed as DC-QAOA(NC). We have found that DC-QAOA(NC)\nreduces the overall circuit complexity as compared to QAOA only for\nsufficiently large problems, and for MaxCut problem the number of qubits must\nexceed 16 for DC-QAOA(NC) to outperform QAOA. Additionally, we benchmark\nDC-QAOA(NC) against QAOA on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model under realistic\nnoise conditions, finding that DC-QAOA(NC) exhibits significantly improved\nrobustness compared to QAOA, maintaining higher fidelity as the problem size\nscales.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have showcased remarkable capabilities of decoder-only models\nin many NLP tasks, including translation. Yet, the machine translation field\nhas been largely dominated by encoder-decoder models based on the Transformer\narchitecture. As a consequence, scaling laws of encoder-decoder models for\nneural machine translation have already been well studied, but decoder-only\nmodels have received less attention. This work explores the scaling laws of\ndecoder-only models on the multilingual and multidomain translation task. We\ntrained a collection of six decoder-only models, ranging from 70M to 7B\nparameters, on a sentence-level, multilingual and multidomain dataset. We\nconducted a series of experiments showing that the loss of decoder-only models\ncan be estimated using a scaling law similar to the one discovered for large\nlanguage models, but we also show that this scaling law has difficulties to\ngeneralize to too large models or to a different data distribution. We also\nstudy different scaling methods and show that scaling the depth and the width\nof a model lead to similar test loss improvements, but with different impact on\nthe model's efficiency.",

Although academia and industry\nemploy methods like software composition analysis (SCA) to address this issue,\nexisting approaches often lack timely and comprehensive intelligence updates.\nThis paper introduces PackageIntel, a novel platform that revolutionizes the\ncollection, processing, and retrieval of malicious package intelligence. By\nutilizing exhaustive search techniques, snowball sampling from diverse sources,\nand large language models (LLMs) with specialized prompts, PackageIntel ensures\nenhanced coverage, timeliness, and accuracy. We have developed a comprehensive\ndatabase containing 20,692 malicious NPM and PyPI packages sourced from 21\ndistinct intelligence repositories. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nPackageIntel achieves a precision of 98.6% and an F1 score of 92.0 in\nintelligence extraction. Additionally, it detects threats on average 70%\nearlier than leading databases like Snyk and OSV, and operates cost-effectively\nat $0.094 per intelligence piece. The platform has successfully identified and\nreported over 1,000 malicious packages in downstream package manager mirror\nregistries. This research provides a robust, efficient, and timely solution for\nidentifying and mitigating threats within the software supply chain ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the proposals aiming at enabling Vertical,\ntwo-sided markets with a Single Marketplace (or exchange) (VSMs) for computing\nand data resources/services (products) offerings in a multi-cloud and\ncrowdsourced IoT-edge sensing environment. A VSM is designed vertically from\nbottom up with a broker being a built-in component of the marketplace. While\npreventing seller lock-in and improving efficiency and availability, a VSM\nsuffers from a key weakness from a buyer's perspective, i.e., the broker and\nthe corresponding marketplace lock-in, which may lead to suboptimal shopping\nexperience for buyers, due to marketplace monopoly by the broker and limited\nchoice of products in the marketplace. In this position paper, we argue that a\nHorizontal two-sided market with Multiple Marketplaces (HMM), resembling the\nglobal stock market, should be developed. In an HMM, different marketplaces may\nbe operated by different parties and sell similar and/or different types of\nproducts, e.g., computing and/or sensory data products. A broker is no longer a\nbuilt-in component of any given marketplace. Instead, it may cover multiple\nmarketplaces at the same time and there can be more than one broker in the HMM.\nBoth the number and types of marketplaces and brokers may grow independently or\nscale horizontally to meet the growing demand. A buyer shops for a broker\nthrough whom the buyer gains access to the needed products sold in the\nmarketplace(s) the broker covers and from whom the buyer receives various\npossible services, e.g., discount, value-added, or full services. An HMM not\nonly overcomes the key weakness of a VSM but also allows the market to grow\nincrementally and organically. Finally, two example use cases are given to\nillustrate the benefits of HMM.",

This manuscript focuses on the competition set-up, the proposed\nmethods and their respective results. The challenge aims at producing novel\ncamera view synthesis of diverse scenes from sparse image observations. It is\ncomposed of two tracks, with differing levels of sparsity; 3 views in Track 1\n(very sparse) and 9 views in Track 2 (sparse). Participants are asked to\noptimise objective fidelity to the ground-truth images as measured via the Peak\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metric. For both tracks, we use the newly\nintroduced Sparse Rendering (SpaRe) dataset and the popular DTU MVS dataset. In\nthis challenge, 5 teams submitted final results to Track 1 and 4 teams\nsubmitted final results to Track 2. The submitted models are varied and push\nthe boundaries of the current state-of-the-art in sparse neural rendering. A\ndetailed description of all models developed in the challenge is provided in\nthis paper.",

We collect the data\nby posing exercises in an intelligent tutoring system and analyzing student\ninput.

    "abstract": "Recent developments in differentiable and neural rendering have made\nimpressive breakthroughs in a variety of 2D and 3D tasks, e.g. novel view\nsynthesis, 3D reconstruction. Typically, differentiable rendering relies on a\ndense viewpoint coverage of the scene, such that the geometry can be\ndisambiguated from appearance observations alone. Several challenges arise when\nonly a few input views are available, often referred to as sparse or few-shot\nneural rendering. As this is an underconstrained problem, most existing\napproaches introduce the use of regularisation, together with a diversity of\nlearnt and hand-crafted priors. A recurring problem in sparse rendering\nliterature is the lack of an homogeneous, up-to-date, dataset and evaluation\nprotocol. While high-resolution datasets are standard in dense reconstruction\nliterature, sparse rendering methods often evaluate with low-resolution images.\nAdditionally, data splits are inconsistent across different manuscripts, and\ntesting ground-truth images are often publicly available, which may lead to\nover-fitting. In this work, we propose the Sparse Rendering (SpaRe) dataset and\nbenchmark. We introduce a new dataset that follows the setup of the DTU MVS\ndataset. The dataset is composed of 97 new scenes based on synthetic,\nhigh-quality assets. Each scene has up to 64 camera views and 7 lighting\nconfigurations, rendered at 1600x1200 resolution. We release a training split\nof 82 scenes to foster generalizable approaches, and provide an online\nevaluation platform for the validation and test sets, whose ground-truth images\nremain hidden. We propose two different sparse configurations (3 and 9 input\nimages respectively). This provides a powerful and convenient tool for\nreproducible evaluation, and enable researchers easy access to a public\nleaderboard with the state-of-the-art performance scores.

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the derivation of necessary conditions for the\noptimal shape of a design problem governed by a non-smooth PDE. The main\nparticularity thereof is the lack of differentiability of the nonlinearity in\nthe state equation, which, at the same time, is solved on an unknown domain. We\nfollow the functional variational approach introduced in [37] where the set of\nadmissible shapes is parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. It\nhas been recently established [4] that each parametrization associated to an\noptimal shape is the limit of a sequence of global optima of minimization\nproblems with convex admissible set consisting of functions. Though non-smooth,\nthese problems allow for the derivation of an optimality system equivalent with\nthe first order necessary optimality condition [5]. In the present manuscript\nwe let the approximation parameter vanish therein. The final necessary\nconditions for the non-smooth shape optimization problem consist of an adjoint\nequation, a limit gradient equation that features a measure concentrated on the\nboundary of the optimal shape and, because of the non-smoothness, an inclusion\nthat involves its Clarke subdifferential.",

    "abstract": "Separation is a crucial step in the analysis of living microparticles. In\nparticular, the selective microseparation of phytoplankton by size and shape\nremains an open problem, even though these criteria are essential for their\ngender and/or species identification. However, microseparation devices\nnecessitate physical membranes which complicate their fabrication, reduce the\nsample flow rate and can cause unwanted particle clogging. Recent advances in\nmicrofabrication such as High Precision Capillary Printing allow to rapidly\nbuild electrode patterns over wide areas. In this study, we introduce a new\nconcept of membrane-less dielectrophoretic (DEP) microseparation suitable for\nlarge scale microfabrication processes. The proposed design involves two pairs\nof interdigitated electrodes at the top and the bottom of a microfluidic\nchannel. We use finite-element calculations to analyse how the DEP force field\nthroughout the channel, as well as the resulting trajectories of particles\ndepend on the geometry of the system, on the physical properties of the\nparticles and suspending medium and on the imposed voltage and flow rates. We\nnumerically show that in the negative DEP regime, particles are focused in the\nchannel mid-planes and that virtual pillars array leads either to their\ntrapping at specific stagnation points, or to their focusing along specific\nlines, depending on their dielectrophoretic mobility. Simulations allow to\nunderstand how particles can be captured and to quantify the particle\nseparation conditions by introducing a critical dielectrophoretic mobility. We\nfurther illustrate the principle of membrane-less dielectrophoretic\nmicroseparation using the proposed setup, by considering the separation of a\nbinary mixture of polystyrene particles with different diameters, and validate\nit experimentally.",

For example, it is expected to occur in the ion acceleration of solid\ndensity targets driven by high intensity lasers and is crucial for the\nacceleration process. Yet, it is essential to understand the dynamics of the RT\ninstability, a typical way to measure this phenomenon requires sophisticated\ndiagnostics such as streak X ray radiography. Here, we report on experimental\nobservation on periodic modulation in the energy spectrum of laser accelerated\nproton beams. Interestingly, theoretical model and two-dimensional\nparticle-in-cell simulations, in good agreement with the experimental finding,\nindicated that such modulation is associated with periodic modulated electron\ndensity induced by transverse Rayleigh-Taylor-like instability. Furthermore,\nthe correlation between the RT instability and the ion acceleration provides an\ninterpretation to trace the development of the RT instability from the\nmodulated proton spectrum. Our results thus suggest a possible tool to diagnose\nthe evolution of the RT instability, and may have implications for further\nunderstanding for the accelerating mechanisms as well as optimization\nstrategies for laser driven ion acceleration.",

The core excited states\nof allyl were studied experimentally using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS),\nand the primary characteristic peaks were assigned using the MCSCF approach,\nbut not entirely. In this work, the recently developed CVS-icMRCISD scheme was\nused to simulate the excitation and ionization processes of C's K-shell\nelectrons within allyl radicals, cations, and anions, respectively.

In RI, an array of antennas probes cosmic signals\ncoming from the observed region of the sky. The covariance matrix of the vector\ngathering all these antenna measurements offers, by leveraging the Van\nCittert-Zernike theorem, an incomplete and noisy Fourier sensing of the image\nof interest. The number of noisy Fourier measurements -- or visibilities --\nscales as $\\mathcal O(Q^2B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration\n(STI) intervals. We address the challenges posed by this vast volume of data,\nwhich is anticipated to increase significantly with the advent of large antenna\narrays, by proposing a compressive sensing technique applied directly at the\nlevel of the antenna measurements. First, this paper shows that beamforming --\na common technique of dephasing antenna signals -- usually used to focus some\nregion of the sky, is equivalent to sensing a rank-one projection (ROP) of the\nsignal covariance matrix. We build upon our recent work arXiv:2306.12698v3\n[eess.IV] to propose a compressive sensing scheme relying on random\nbeamforming, trading the $Q^2$-dependence of the data size for a smaller number\n$P$ ROPs. We provide image recovery guarantees for sparse image reconstruction.\nSecondly, the data size is made independent of $B$ by applying $M$ Bernoulli\nmodulations of the ROP vectors obtained for the STI. The resulting sample\ncomplexities, theoretically derived in a simpler case without modulations and\nnumerically obtained in phase transition diagrams, are shown to scale as\n$\\mathcal O(K)$ where $K$ is the image sparsity.

We\ncompare this first ever neuromorphic-hardware implementation of an SSM on\nsMNIST, psMNIST, and sCIFAR to a recurrent and a convolutional implementation\nof S4D on Jetson Orin Nano (Jetson). While we find Jetson to perform better in\nan offline sample-by-sample based batched processing mode, Loihi 2 outperforms\nduring token-by-token based processing, where it consumes 1000 times less\nenergy with a 75 times lower latency and a 75 times higher throughput compared\nto the recurrent implementation of S4D on Jetson. This opens up new avenues\ntowards efficient real-time streaming applications of SSMs.",

To overcome\nthis limitation, we introduce a new decoder called Cross Branch Feature Fusion\nCBFF, which combines the strengths of both local convolutional branch and\nglobal transformer branch. The convolutional branch is easy to learn and can\nproduce high-quality features with a small amount of labeled data.

In our\nstudy, we assess model sensitivity in order to compare real activations to\nsynthetic activations composed of SAE latents. Our findings indicate that\nsynthetic activations closely resemble real activations when we control for the\nsparsity and cosine similarity of the constituent SAE latents.

In macroscopic approaches, it is expected that the large value of\nthe relative orbital angular momentum, of the order of 100~$\\hbar$ is\ntransferred through tangential dissipation to the fragments' intrinsic spin by\nsliding and rolling friction.\n  The goal is to investigate the angular momentum transfer from the initial\nrelative orbital angular momentum to the fragments' spin. How is the\ntransferred spin shared between the fragments? What is the time scale\nassociated with the different mechanisms? How does deformation play a role?\n  A TDDFT simulation in the TDHF-Skyrme framework is used to describe several\nreactions at different impact parameters with increasing complexity. A method\nis proposed to study the evolution of the fragments' total spin as a function\nof time and angular velocity.\n  The increasingly complex reaction allows for careful analysis of all the\nmechanisms responsible for the transfer of spin. In particular, it is shown\nthat the transfer of nucleons, and neck formation can significantly affect the\ntransfer of spin through tangential friction.\n  Several mechanisms are in contradiction with previous macroscopic\ncalculations.

Especially, in the case of test\nchips, where the aim is to study the feasibility of the design, time is a\ncrucial factor. Pre-silicon functional verification is one of the main\ncontributors that makes up a large portion of the product development cycle.\nVerification engineers often loosely verify test chips that turn out to be\nnon-functional on the silicon, ultimately resulting in expensive re-spins. To\nleft-shift the verification efforts, formal verification is a powerful\nmethodology that aims to exhaustively verify designs, giving better confidence\nin the overall quality. This paper focuses on the pragmatic formal verification\nof a mixed signal Intellectual Property (IP) that has a combination of digital\nand analog blocks. This paper discusses a novel approach of including the\nanalog behavioral model into the formal verification setup. Digital and Analog\nMixed-Signal (AMS) designs, which are fundamentally different in nature, are\nintegrated seamlessly in a formal verification setup, a concept that can be\nreferred to as \"Analogous Alignments\". Our formal setup leverages powerful\nformal techniques such as FPV, CSR verification, and connectivity checks. The\nproperties used for FPV are auto-generated using a metamodeling framework. The\npaper also discusses the challenges faced especially related to state-space\nexplosion, non-compatibility of formal with AMS models, and techniques to\nmitigate them such as k-induction. With this verification approach, we were\nable to exhaustively verify the design within a reasonable time and with\nsufficient coverage.

While generative approaches have addressed\nthis challenge by leveraging priors from internet-scale datasets, with recent\nstudies showing state-of-the-art results using fine-tuned text-to-image\ndiffusion models, there is still room for improvement. Notably, autoregressive\ngenerative approaches, particularly Visual AutoRegressive modeling, have\ndemonstrated superior results compared to diffusion models in conditioned image\nsynthesis, while offering faster inference times. In this work, we apply Visual\nAutoregressive Transformer (VAR) to the monocular depth estimation problem.\nHowever, the conventional GPT-2-style training procedure (teacher forcing)\ninherited by VAR yields suboptimal results for depth estimation. To address\nthis limitation, we introduce DepthART - a novel training method formulated as\na Depth Autoregressive Refinement Task. Unlike traditional VAR training with\nstatic inputs and targets, our method implements a dynamic target formulation\nbased on model outputs, enabling self-refinement. By utilizing the model's own\npredictions as inputs instead of ground truth token maps during training, we\nframe the objective as residual minimization, effectively reducing the\ndiscrepancy between training and inference procedures. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed training approach significantly enhances the\nperformance of VAR in depth estimation tasks.

This study aims to develop a robust\nframework that generalizes well to real colonoscopy images, overcoming\nchallenges like non-Lambertian surface reflection and diverse data\ndistributions. Methods: We propose a framework combining a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) for capturing local features and a Transformer for capturing\nglobal information. An uncertainty-based fusion block was designed to enhance\ngeneralization by identifying complementary contributions from the CNN and\nTransformer branches.

That is, instead of having all the\nantenna elements co-located at a single AP, multiple APs, each equipped with a\nfew or a single antenna element, jointly cooperate to serve the active users in\nthe coverage area. In this work, we evaluate the performance of different\nD-MIMO setups under Rician fading, and considering different receive combining\nschemes.

    "abstract": "We explore the advection-diffusion of a passive vector described by\n$\\partial_t u + U \\cdot \\nabla u = - \\nabla p + \\nu \\Delta u$, where both $U$\nand $u$ are divergence-free velocity fields. We approach this equation from an\ninput/output perspective, with $U$ as the input and $u$ as the output. This\ninput/output viewpoint has been widely applied in recent studies on passive\nscalar equation, in the context of anomalous dissipation, mixing, optimal\nscalar transport, and nonuniqueness problems. What makes the passive vector\nequation considerably more challenging compared to the passive scalar equation\nis the lack of a Lagrangian perspective due to the presence of pressure.\n  In this paper, rather than requiring $U$ and $u$ to be identical (as in the\nNavier-Stokes equation), we require $U$ and $u$ to be identical only in certain\ncharacteristics. We focus on the case where the characteristics in question are\nanomalous and enhanced dissipation. We study the advection-diffusion of a\npassive vector in a Couette flow configuration. The main result of this paper\nis a construction of the velocity field $U$ for which the energy dissipation\nscales as $(\\log \\nu^{-1})^{-2}$ such that the energy dissipation in velocity\nfield $u$ scales at least as $(\\log \\nu^{-1})^{-2}$. This means that both $U$\nand $u$ exhibit near-anomalous dissipation, where the rate of energy\ndissipation decreases more slowly than any power-law $\\nu^{\\alpha}$ for any\n$\\alpha > 0$. The result in this paper is not just a mathematical construct; it\nclosely resembles the behavior of turbulent flow in a channel. The $(\\log\n\\nu^{-1})^{-2}$ decrease of energy dissipation is predicted by phenomenological\ntheories of wall-bounded turbulence, a prediction that has been extensively\nvalidated through experiments and numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic alignment of galaxies is a key factor in modeling weak-lensing\nobservations and can serve as a valuable signal for both cosmological and\nastrophysical studies. Modelling this signal requires understanding how galaxy\nshapes form, and their relations to the large-scale gravitational field --\ntypically encoded in the value of large-scale shape-bias parameters. In this\narticle we contribute to this topic in three ways: (i) developing new\nestimators of Lagrangian shape-biases (ii) applying them to measure the\nshape-biases of dark-matter halos (iii) interpreting these measurements to gain\ninsight on the process of halo-shape formation. We show that our estimators\nproduce results consistent with previous literature, and that they possess\nadvantages with respect to previous methods, namely that the measurement of\neach bias parameter is completely independent from the others, and that bias\nparameters can be defined for each individual object. We measure universal\nrelations between shape-bias parameters and peak-significance, $\\nu$. This\nrelation for the first-order shape-bias parameter is linear at high $\\nu$, and\nconverges to zero at low $\\nu$, which we interpret as strong evidence against\nthe proposed scenario according to which galaxy shapes arise due to\npost-formation interaction with the large-scale tidal-field. We anticipate our\nestimators to be very useful in analyzing hydrodynamical simulations to extract\nphysical understandings of galaxy shape formation, as well as establishing\npriors on the values of intrinsic-alignment biases.",

Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of\nmulti-modal generative AI, including multi-modal LLMs, diffusions, and the\nunification for understanding and generation. To lay a solid foundation for\nunified models, we first provide a detailed review of both multi-modal LLMs and\ndiffusion models respectively, including their probabilistic modeling\nprocedure, multi-modal architecture design, and advanced applications to\nimage/video LLMs as well as text-to-image/video generation. Furthermore, we\nexplore the emerging efforts toward unified models for understanding and\ngeneration. To achieve the unification of understanding and generation, we\ninvestigate key designs including autoregressive-based and diffusion-based\nmodeling, as well as dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We then\nintroduce several strategies for unified models, analyzing their potential\nadvantages and disadvantages.

The current de facto quality metrics are edge coverage and the number\nof discovered bugs, but they are frequently discredited by inconclusive,\nexaggerated, or even counter-intuitive results.\n  To establish a more reliable quality metric, we first note that fuzzing aims\nto reduce the number of unknown abnormal behaviors by observing more\ninteresting (i.e., relating to unknown abnormal) behaviors. The more\ninteresting behaviors a fuzzer has observed, the stronger guarantee it can\nprovide about the absence of unknown abnormal behaviors. This suggests that the\nnumber of observed interesting behaviors must directly indicate the fuzzing\nquality.\n  In this work, we propose logic state coverage as a proxy metric to count\nobserved interesting behaviors. A logic state is a set of satisfied branches\nduring one execution, where its coverage is the count of individual observed\nlogic states during a fuzzing campaign. A logic state distinguishes less\nrepetitive (i.e., more interesting) behaviors in a finer granularity, making\nthe amount of logic state coverage reliably proportional to the number of\nobserved interesting behaviors. We implemented logic state coverage using a\nbloom filter and performed a preliminary evaluation with AFL++ and XMLLint.",

Existing gradient flows that transport\nsamples from source distribution to target distribution with only target\nsamples, either lack tractable numerical implementation ($f$-divergence flows)\nor require strong assumptions, and modifications such as noise injection, to\nensure convergence (Maximum Mean Discrepancy flows). In contrast, DrMMD flow\ncan simultaneously (i) guarantee near-global convergence for a broad class of\ntargets in both continuous and discrete time, and (ii) be implemented in closed\nform using only samples. The former is achieved by leveraging the connection\nbetween the DrMMD and the $\\chi^2$-divergence, while the latter comes by\ntreating DrMMD as MMD with a de-regularized kernel. Our numerical scheme uses\nan adaptive de-regularization schedule throughout the flow to optimally trade\noff between discretization errors and deviations from the $\\chi^2$ regime. The\npotential application of the DrMMD flow is demonstrated across several\nnumerical experiments, including a large-scale setting of training\nstudent/teacher networks.",

The mortar finite element method is usually employed to\ndiscretize the variational form on the meshed contact surfaces, leading to a\nlarge-scale discretized saddle point system. Due to the indefiniteness of the\ndiscretized system, it is a challenge to solve the saddle point algebraic\nsystem. For two-dimensional tied contact problem, an efficient DOFs\ncondensation technique is developed.

In this paper, we eliminate these\ncomplexities with a vanilla encoder-decoder based detector. Firstly, we design\na bilateral encoder to decouple the extraction process of location features and\nsemantic features. Since the location branch no longer provides cues for the\nsemantic branch, the richness of features can be further compressed, which is\nthe key to make our model more compact. We propose a cascaded feature fusion\ndecoder, where the location features are progressively refined by semantic\nfeatures. The refined location features are the only basis for generating the\nedge map. The coarse original location features and semantic features are\navoided from direct contact with the final result. So the noise in the location\nfeatures and the location error in the semantic features can be suppressed in\nthe generated edge map. The proposed New Baseline for Edge Detection (NBED)\nachieves superior performance consistently across multiple edge detection\nbenchmarks, even compared with those methods with huge computational cost and\ncomplex training strategy. The ODS of NBED on BSDS500 is 0.838, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance. Our study shows that what really matters in the\ncurrent edge detection is high-quality features, and we can make the\nencoder-decoder based detector great again even without complex training\nstrategies and huge computational cost.

However, in structured populations, despite their unbiased\nactions, the bots spontaneously generate distinct impacts on cooperators and\ndefectors, leading to enhanced cooperation.

Secondly, the reward function of\nreinforcement learning is designed based on the spatial behaviour of\npedestrians, and the robot is punished for the state where the angle changes\ntoo much, so as to achieve the requirement of comfortable obstacle avoidance;\nFinally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the deep reinforcement\nlearning-based mobile robot obstacle avoidance algorithm in the warehouse\nenvironment in the complex environment of the warehouse are verified through\nsimulation experiments.",

Our numerical simulations reveal a rich interplay of normal\nand anomalous diffusion depending on the system parameters. To describe\ndiffusion in normal regimes, we develop a unit cell hopping model that, in the\nsingle-hop limit, recovers the Machta-Zwanzig approximation and converges\ntoward the numerical diffusion coefficient as the number of hops increases.\nAnomalous diffusion is characterized by quasiballistic orbits forming\nKolmogorov-Arnold-Moser islands in phase space, alongside a complex tongue\nstructure in parameter space defined by the interscatterer distance and\npotential softness. The distributions of the particle displacement vector show\nnotable similarities to both analytical and numerical results for a hard-wall\nsquare Lorentz gas, exhibiting Gaussian behavior in normal diffusion and long\ntails due to quasiballistic orbits in anomalous regimes. Our work thus provides\na catalog of key dynamical system properties that characterize the intricate\nchanges in diffusion when transitioning from hard billiards to soft potentials.",

The\nzero-shot assumption is essential to avoid the need for re-training the\nclassifier every time a new product is introduced into stock or an existing\nproduct undergoes rebranding. In this paper, we make three key contributions.\nFirstly, we introduce the MIMEX dataset, comprising 28 distinct product\ncategories. Unlike existing datasets in the literature, MIMEX focuses on\nfine-grained product classification and includes a diverse range of retail\nproducts. Secondly, we benchmark the zero-shot object classification\nperformance of state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the proposed\nMIMEX dataset. Our experiments reveal that these models achieve unsatisfactory\nfine-grained classification performance, highlighting the need for specialized\napproaches. Lastly, we propose a novel ensemble approach that integrates\nembeddings from CLIP and DINOv2 with dimensionality reduction techniques to\nenhance classification performance. By combining these components, our ensemble\napproach outperforms VLMs, effectively capturing visual cues crucial for\nfine-grained product discrimination. Additionally, we introduce a class\nadaptation method that utilizes visual prototyping with limited samples in\nscenarios with scarce labeled data, addressing a critical need in retail\nenvironments where product variety frequently changes. To encourage further\nresearch into zero-shot object classification for smart retail applications, we\nwill release both the MIMEX dataset and benchmark to the research community.\nInterested researchers can contact the authors for details on the terms and\nconditions of use.

Second, MSARS utilizes\nmeta-learning to enable the graph neural network to quickly adapt to\nenvironmental changes ensuring adaptability in highly dynamic microservice\nenvironments. Third, MSARS generates auto-scaling policies for each\nmicroservice based on an improved Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (TD3) model. The adaptive auto-scaling policy integrates the SLO\nresource allocation strategy into the scheduling algorithm to satisfy SLOs.\nFinally, we compare MSARS with state-of-the-art resource auto-scaling\nalgorithms that utilize neural networks and reinforcement learning, MSARS takes\n40% less time to adapt to new environments, 38% reduction of SLO violations,\nand 8% less resources cost.",

Neither first principles- nor force field-based molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations satisfy these three criteria unequivocally. Herein, we report the\ndevelopment of a machine learning potential (MLP) for a classic glass,\nB$_2$O$_3$, which meets these goals well. The MLP is trained on condensed phase\nconfigurations whose energies and forces on the atoms are obtained using\nperiodic quantum density functional theory. Deep potential MD (DPMD)\nsimulations based on this MLP accurately predict the equation of state and the\ndensification of the glass with slower quenching from the melt. At ambient\nconditions, quenching rates larger than 10$^{11}$ K/s are shown to lead to\nartifacts in the structure. Pressure-dependent X-ray and neutron structure\nfactors from the simulations compare excellently with experimental data.\nHigh-pressure simulations of the glass show varied coordination geometries of\nboron and oxygen, which concur with experimental observations.",

We say that such\nfunction is $k$-periodic if it is invariant under translations in $k$ linearly\nindependent directions. It is known that if a configuration has a non-trivial\nannihilator, that is, if some non-trivial linear combination of its\ntranslations is the zero function, then it is a sum of finitely many periodic\nfunctions. This result is known as the periodic decomposition theorem. We prove\ntwo different improvements of it. The first improvement gives a\ncharacterization on annihilators of a configuration to guarantee the\n$k$-periodicity of the functions in its periodic decomposition -- for any $k$.\nThe periodic decomposition theorem is then a special case of this result with\n$k=1$.

    "abstract": "The Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) is a simple extension of the Standard\nModel (SM), which provides a rich and very interesting phenomenology. To remove\nthe undesirable flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNCs), an additional\n$\\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry is usually imposed into the 2HDM. However, FCNCs can be\navoided in a much more general way by assuming a similar Yukawa structure for\nthe two scalar doublets. But one can circumvent the issue of FCNCs by assuming\nsimilar Yukawa structure for the two scalar doublets too. The model with this\nintriguing feature is termed the Aligned Two Higgs Doublet Model (A2HDM). The\nphenomenological constraints on the A2HDM are much weaker than the ones on the\nusual $\\mathcal Z_2$ models, opening a broader range of possible scenarios.\nMoreover, the A2HDM also provides a generic framework to study, as particular\ncases, the different varieties of $\\mathcal Z_2$-symmetric 2HDMs. Here, we\nillustrate a global fit of the A2HDM using the package HEPfit. We study the\npossibility of having new scalar particles lighter than the SM Higgs. For this\nglobal fit we perform a Bayesian analysis, including stability and\nperturbativity bounds, flavour and electroweak precision observables, and\nscalar (and pseudoscalar) searches at LEP and LHC.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to reproduce dynamic appearance textures with\nspace-stationary but time-varying visual statistics. While most previous work\ndecomposes dynamic textures into static appearance and motion, we focus on\ndynamic appearance that results not from motion but variations of fundamental\nproperties, such as rusting, decaying, melting, and weathering. To this end, we\nadopt the neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to learn the underlying\ndynamics of appearance from a target exemplar. We simulate the ODE in two\nphases. At the \"warm-up\" phase, the ODE diffuses a random noise to an initial\nstate. We then constrain the further evolution of this ODE to replicate the\nevolution of visual feature statistics in the exemplar during the generation\nphase. The particular innovation of this work is the neural ODE achieving both\ndenoising and evolution for dynamics synthesis, with a proposed temporal\ntraining scheme. We study both relightable (BRDF) and non-relightable (RGB)\nappearance models. For both we introduce new pilot datasets, allowing, for the\nfirst time, to study such phenomena: For RGB we provide 22 dynamic textures\nacquired from free online sources; For BRDFs, we further acquire a dataset of\n21 flash-lit videos of time-varying materials, enabled by a simple-to-construct\nsetup. Our experiments show that our method consistently yields realistic and\ncoherent results, whereas prior works falter under pronounced temporal\nappearance variations. A user study confirms our approach is preferred to\nprevious work for such exemplars.",

This fact implies the use of unstable and difficult\npredictable variables which may give rise to a possible problem for the\nplausibility of the proposed techniques and methodologies in particular\nconditions. In this line, our goal is to provide a decision support system for\nphotovoltaic fault detection avoiding meteorological conditions.\n  This paper has developed a mathematical mechanism based on fuzzy sets in\norder to optimize the energy production in the photovoltaic facilities,\ndetecting anomalous behaviors in the energy generated by the facilities over\ntime. Specifically, the incorrect and correct behaviors of the photovoltaic\nfacilities have been modeled through the use of different membership mappings.\nFrom these mappings, a decision support system based on OWA operators informs\nof the performances of the facilities per day, by using natural language.\nMoreover, a state machine is also designed to determine the stage of each\nfacility based on the stages and the performances from previous days. The main\nadvantage of the designed system is that it solves the problem of \"constant\nloss of energy production\", without the consideration of meteorological\nconditions and being able to be more profitable. Moreover, the system is also\nscalable and portable, and complements previous works in energy production\noptimization. Finally, the proposed mechanism has been tested with real data,\nprovided by Grupo Energ\\'etico de Puerto Real S.A. which is an enterprise in\ncharge of the management of six photovoltaic facilities in Puerto Real,\nC\\'adiz, Spain, and good results have been obtained for faulting detection.",

Techniques for\nintegrating external data into LLMs, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) and fine-tuning, are gaining increasing attention and widespread\napplication. Nonetheless, the effective deployment of data-augmented LLMs\nacross various specialized fields presents substantial challenges. These\nchallenges encompass a wide range of issues, from retrieving relevant data and\naccurately interpreting user intent to fully harnessing the reasoning\ncapabilities of LLMs for complex tasks. We believe that there is no\none-size-fits-all solution for data-augmented LLM applications. In practice,\nunderperformance often arises from a failure to correctly identify the core\nfocus of a task or because the task inherently requires a blend of multiple\ncapabilities that must be disentangled for better resolution. In this survey,\nwe propose a RAG task categorization method, classifying user queries into four\nlevels based on the type of external data required and primary focus of the\ntask: explicit fact queries, implicit fact queries, interpretable rationale\nqueries, and hidden rationale queries. We define these levels of queries,\nprovide relevant datasets, and summarize the key challenges and most effective\ntechniques for addressing these challenges.

    "abstract": "Recent constraints on neutron star mass and radius have advanced our\nunderstanding of the equation of state (EOS) of cold dense matter. Some of them\nhave been obtained by modeling the pulses of three millisecond X-ray pulsars\nobserved by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). Here, we\npresent a Bayesian parameter inference for a fourth pulsar, PSR J1231$-$1411,\nusing the same technique with NICER and XMM-Newton data. When applying a broad\nmass-inclination prior from radio timing measurements and the emission region\ngeometry model that can best explain the data, we find likely converged results\nonly when using a limited radius prior. If limiting the radius to be consistent\nwith the previous observational constraints and EOS analyses, we infer the\nradius to be $12.6 \\pm 0.3$ km and the mass to be $1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05}$\n$M_\\odot$, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the\n$16\\,\\%$ and $84\\,\\%$ quantiles. If using an uninformative prior but limited\nbetween $10$ and $14$ km, we find otherwise similar results, but\n$R_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 13.5_{-0.5}^{+0.3}$ km for the radius. In both cases, we\nfind a nonantipodal hot region geometry where one emitting spot is at the\nequator or slightly above, surrounded by a large colder region, and where a\nnoncircular hot region lies close to southern rotational pole. If using a wider\nradius prior, we only find solutions that fit the data significantly worse. We\ndiscuss the challenges in finding the better fitting solutions, possibly\nrelated to the weak interpulse feature in the pulse profile.",

This paper focuses on vehicle to everything (V2X)\nnetwork, where vehicles should cooperatively implement information obtaining,\ndata sharing, and information postprocessing. Conventionally, the above three\noperations are considered in different layers or separated waveforms, leading\nto unavoidable interference and inefficient resource management when the number\nof devices becomes large. In this paper, we exploit the hybrid beamforming to\ndesign a cost-effective over-the-air integrated framework, and further consider\nthe integrated waveform design problem with the constant-modulus constrain\n(CMC) and similarity constraint (SC). To solve these non-convex problems, an\nalternating optimization (AO) approach is proposed to jointly optimize the\ndigital precoder as well as the hybrid combiner, using the successive convex\napproximation (SCA) and Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm.\nAdditionally, we use the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method to handle the\npractical waveform design problem.

Beyond the conventional intraband contribution that depends\non Bloch bands, we show that pair size also has a geometric contribution\ngoverned by the quantum-metric tensor of the Bloch states and their\nband-resolved quantum-metric tensors. As a concrete example, we investigate the\npyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that, while the pair size\ndiverges in the weakly interacting BCS regime of dispersive bands, it remains\nfinite and relatively small in the flat-band regime, even for infinitesimal\ninteraction, perfectly matching the exact two-body result in the dilute limit.",

A process is said to\nbelong to the KPZ universality class if one can associate to it an appropriate\n'height function' and show that its 3:2:1 (time : space: fluctuation) scaling\nlimit, see 1.2, converges to a universal random process, the KPZ fixed point.\nAlternatively, membership is loosely characterised by having: 1. Local\ndynamics; 2. A smoothing mechanism; 3. Slope-dependent growth rate (lateral\ngrowth); 4. Space-time random forcing with the rapid decay of correlations.\n  The central object that we will study is the so-called KPZ fixed point, which\nbelongs to the KPZ universality class. Many strides have been made in the last\ncouple of decades in this field, with constructions of the KPZ fixed point from\ncertain processes such as the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (with\narbitrary initial condition) and Brownian last passage percolation.\n  In this article, we: 1. delineate the origins of KPZ universality; 2.\ndescribe and motivate canonical models; 3. give an overview of recent\ndevelopments, especially those in the 2018 Dauvergne, Ortmann and Virag (DOV)\npaper; 4. present the strategy of and key points in the proof of the absolute\ncontinuity result of the KPZ fixed point by Sarkar and Virag; 5. conclude with\nremarks for future directions.

To investigate this, we analyse\nthe ability of VLMs and LLMs to demonstrate sound symbolism (i.e., to recognise\na non-arbitrary link between sounds and concepts) as well as their ability to\n\"hear\" via the interplay of the language and vision modules of open and\nclosed-source multimodal models. We perform multiple experiments, including\nreplicating the classic Kiki-Bouba and Mil-Mal shape and magnitude symbolism\ntasks, and comparing human judgements of linguistic iconicity with that of\nLLMs. Our results show that VLMs demonstrate varying levels of agreement with\nhuman labels, and more task information may be required for VLMs versus their\nhuman counterparts for in silico experimentation.

    "abstract": "Embodied AI agents responsible for executing interconnected, long-sequence\nhousehold tasks often face difficulties with in-context memory, leading to\ninefficiencies and errors in task execution. To address this issue, we\nintroduce KARMA, an innovative memory system that integrates long-term and\nshort-term memory modules, enhancing large language models (LLMs) for planning\nin embodied agents through memory-augmented prompting. KARMA distinguishes\nbetween long-term and short-term memory, with long-term memory capturing\ncomprehensive 3D scene graphs as representations of the environment, while\nshort-term memory dynamically records changes in objects' positions and states.\nThis dual-memory structure allows agents to retrieve relevant past scene\nexperiences, thereby improving the accuracy and efficiency of task planning.\nShort-term memory employs strategies for effective and adaptive memory\nreplacement, ensuring the retention of critical information while discarding\nless pertinent data. Compared to state-of-the-art embodied agents enhanced with\nmemory, our memory-augmented embodied AI agent improves success rates by 1.3x\nand 2.3x in Composite Tasks and Complex Tasks within the AI2-THOR simulator,\nrespectively, and enhances task execution efficiency by 3.4x and 62.7x.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that KARMA's plug-and-play capability allows for\nseamless deployment on real-world robotic systems, such as mobile manipulation\nplatforms.Through this plug-and-play memory system, KARMA significantly\nenhances the ability of embodied agents to generate coherent and contextually\nappropriate plans, making the execution of complex household tasks more\nefficient.

Using direct\nnumerical simulations, this study exemplifies how the complex interplay between\nelasticity (in terms of elastic stress relaxation) and yield stress influences\nthe transient interfacial phenomena of bursting bubbles. We investigate how\nbursting dynamics depends on capillary, elastic, and yield stresses by\nexploring the parameter space of the Deborah number $De$ (dimensionless\nrelaxation time of elastic stresses) and the plastocapillary number\n$\\mathcal{J}$ (dimensionless yield-stress of the medium), delineating four\ndistinct characteristic behaviours. Overall, we observe a non-monotonic effect\nof elastic stress relaxation on the jet development while plasticity of the\nelasto-viscoplastic medium is shown to affect primarily the jet evolution only\nat faster relaxation times (low $De$). The role of elastic stresses on jet\ndevelopment is elucidated with the support of energy budgets identifying\ndifferent modes of energy transfer within the elasto-viscoplastic medium.

We show how our method can\nenable a cooperative task where a robot and human must work together to\nmaneuver objects through space. We first demonstrate the skill on an impedance\ncontrol-capable robot equipped with tactile sensing, then show the positive\ntransfer of the tactile policy to a planar prismatic robot that is only capable\nof position control and does not come equipped with any sort of force/torque\nfeedback, yet is able to comply to the human motions only using tactile\nfeedback.

The key\nidea lies in utilizing quadratic cuts, rather than the traditional linear cuts,\nand solving an outer approximation problem at each iteration in the form of a\nQuadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) problem.\n  The primary result demonstrated in this work is that every convergent\nsubsequence generated by the proposed outer approximation scheme converges to a\nglobal minimizer of the general weakly convex optimization problem under\nconsideration. To enhance the practical implementation of this method, we also\npropose two variants of the algorithm.\n  The efficacy of our approach is illustrated through its application to two\ndistinct problems: the circular packing problem and the Neyman-Pearson\nclassification problem, both of which are reformulated within the framework of\nweakly convex constrained optimization.",

Understanding the LSS can provide\nobservational support for the Cosmological Principle (CP) and the Standard\nCosmological Model ($\\Lambda$CDM). In recent years, many discoveries have been\nmade of LSSs that are so large that they become difficult to understand within\n$\\Lambda$CDM. Reasons for this are: they potentially challenge the CP, (i.e.\nthe scale of homogeneity); and their formation and origin are not fully\nunderstood. In this article we review two recent LSS discoveries: the Giant Arc\n(GA, $\\sim 1$ Gpc) and the Big Ring (BR, $\\sim 400$ Mpc). Both structures are\nin the same cosmological neighbourhood -- at the same redshift $z \\sim 0.8$ and\nwith a separation on the sky of only $\\sim 12^\\circ$. Both structures exceed\nthe often-cited scale of homogeneity (Yadav+ 2010), so individually and\ntogether, these two intriguing structures raise more questions for the validity\nof the CP and potentially hint at new physics beyond the Standard Model.

We simultaneously fit the time-averaged energy spectrum of the\nsource and the fractional rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO with the\ntime-dependent Comptonization model vKompth. The data can be explained by two\nphysically connected coronae interacting with the accretion disc via a feedback\nloop of X-ray photons.

The properties of both coronae during the reflare are similar\nto those during the low/hard state of the main outburst, reinforcing the idea\nthat both the outburst and the reflare are driven by the same physical\nmechanisms.

The first one is to find $k$ edge-disjoint forests in $G$ of\nmaximal size such that the indegree of each vertex in these forests is at most\n$k$. We describe a min-max characterization for this problem and show that it\ncan be solved in $O(k \\delta m \\log n)$ time, where $(n,m)$ is the size of $G$\nand $\\delta$ is the difference between $k$ and the edge connectivity of the\ngraph. The second problem is the directed edge-connectivity augmentation\nproblem, which has been extensively studied before: find a smallest set of\ndirected edges whose addition to the graph makes it strongly $k$-connected. We\nimprove the complexity for this problem from $O(k \\delta (m+\\delta n)\\log n)$\n[Gabow, STOC 1994] to $O(k \\delta m \\log n)$, by exploiting our solution for\nthe first problem. A similar approach with the same complexity also works for\nthe undirected version of the problem.",

By integrating practical,\nscientific, and artistic innovations, living structures provide a theoretical\nframework for designing healing environments and understanding urban\ncomplexity. We conceptualize spaces through hierarchical transformations,\ncalculating livingness (L) as L = S * H, where S is the number of substructures\nand H is the inherent hierarchy of those substructures. Living structure is\ngoverned by the scaling law and Tobler's law, and guided by differentiation and\nadaptation principles, and it fosters vibrant and engaging spaces that enhance\nhuman well-being and a sense of place. Urban informatics, urban planning, and\narchitecture must evolve beyond just understanding and prediction to include\npurposeful design. This new kind of science integrates the theory of living\nstructure and emphasizes creation and design, thus transforming those\ndisciplines. This chapter looks at environments that have high structural\nbeauty, as defined by the 15 properties that Christopher Alexander proposed,\nand discusses the application of those properties in architecture, urban\ninformatics, and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, with\nthe aim of making built environments more vibrant and conducive to human\nwell-being.\n  Keywords: Livable cities, structural beauty, differentiation, adaptation,\narchitectural design, urban complexity",

Conventional machine learning approaches for\nautomatically analyzing these policies demand significant resources and\nsubstantial domain-specific training, causing adaptability issues. Moreover,\nthey depend on extensive datasets that may require regular maintenance due to\nchanging privacy concerns.\n  In this paper, we propose, apply, and assess PAPEL (Privacy Policy Analysis\nthrough Prompt Engineering for LLMs), a framework harnessing the power of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) through prompt engineering to automate the analysis of\nprivacy policies. PAPEL aims to streamline the extraction, annotation, and\nsummarization of information from these policies, enhancing their accessibility\nand comprehensibility without requiring additional model training. By\nintegrating zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot learning approaches and the\nchain-of-thought prompting in creating predefined prompts and prompt templates,\nPAPEL guides LLMs to efficiently dissect, interpret, and synthesize the\ncritical aspects of privacy policies into user-friendly summaries. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PAPEL with two applications: (i) annotation\nand (ii) contradiction analysis. We assess the ability of several LLaMa and GPT\nmodels to identify and articulate data handling practices, offering insights\ncomparable to existing automated analysis approaches while reducing training\nefforts and increasing the adaptability to new analytical needs. The\nexperiments demonstrate that the LLMs PAPEL utilizes (LLaMA and Chat GPT\nmodels) achieve robust performance in privacy policy annotation, with F1 scores\nreaching 0.8 and above (using the OPP-115 gold standard), underscoring the\neffectiveness of simpler prompts across various advanced language models.",

Mammography images typically have\nextremely high resolution, with lesions occupying only a very small area.\nDown-sampling in neural networks can easily lead to the loss of\nmicrocalcifications or subtle structures, making it difficult for traditional\nneural network architectures to address these issues. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a Context Clustering Network with triple information\nfusion. Firstly, compared to CNNs or transformers, we find that Context\nclustering methods (1) are more computationally efficient and (2) can more\neasily associate structural or pathological features, making them suitable for\nthe clinical tasks of mammography. Secondly, we propose a triple information\nfusion mechanism that integrates global information, feature-based local\ninformation, and patch-based local information. The proposed approach is\nrigorously evaluated on two public datasets, Vindr-Mammo and CBIS-DDSM, using\nfive independent splits to ensure statistical robustness. Our method achieves\nan AUC of 0.828 on Vindr-Mammo and 0.805 on CBIS-DDSM, outperforming the next\nbest method by 3.1% and 2.4%, respectively. These improvements are\nstatistically significant (p<0.05), underscoring the benefits of Context\nClustering Network with triple information fusion.

In this paper, we present our approach to\nbuilding large and open speech-and-text-aligned datasets of less-resourced\nlanguages based on transcripts of parliamentary proceedings and their\nrecordings. Our starting point are the ParlaMint comparable corpora of\ntranscripts of parliamentary proceedings of 26 national European parliaments.\nIn the pilot run on expanding the ParlaMint corpora with aligned publicly\navailable recordings, we focus on three Slavic languages, namely Croatian,\nPolish, and Serbian.

The results of this pilot run are three high-quality\ndatasets that span more than 5,000 hours of speech and accompanying text\ntranscripts.

    "abstract": "An interaction site-based model of two-dimensional alcohols is proposed as a\nfollow up of the recent SSMB site-site model for 2D water [J. Mol. Liq. 386\n(2023 122475]. Computer simulation studies indicate that the model exhibits\nhbond-type clustering based on the same charge order feature observed in real\nalcohols. Hence, the equivalent of 2D mono-ols ranging from methanol to octanol\nwere studied for their clustering properties, focusing on how the\nmicro-structure affects the shape of the site-site pair correlation functions\nand structure factors, as well as the combination of the latter into the\nradiation scattering intensities. The major finding is the apparent\ncontradiction between the existence of large pre-peaks in the structure\nfactors, usually associated to the existence of clusters, and the exponential\ndecay of the cluster distribution indicating the absence of specific clusters,\ncontrary to the 3D case. This is resolved by realizing that the pair\ncorrelation function is an observable of the local density fluctuations, hence\nthe pre-peak witnesses fluctuations around clustering tendencies, which are the\nresult of charge ordering of the polar groups, and visible in the snapshots.\nThe scattering pre-peak witnesses only fluctuations due to charge ordering, and\nnot the clusters themselves, underlining the fact that these are labile\nentities. The study highlights how charge order through atomic sites is a\nuniversal feature behind the micro-structure of organized liquids, and, in the\nparticular case of 2D liquids, a more realistic alternative to orientation\nbased models such as the Mercedes-Benz model, for instance.",

However, it requires the exploration of a\nsufficiently large number of state-action pairs, many of which may be unsafe or\nunimportant. For instance, online model-free learning can be hazardous and\ninefficient in the absence of guarantees that a certain set of desired states\nwill be reached during an episode. An increasingly common approach to address\nsafety involves the addition of a shielding system that constrains the RL\nactions to a safe set of actions. In turn, a difficulty for such frameworks is\nhow to effectively couple RL with the shielding system to make sure the\nexploration is not excessively restricted. This work presents a novel safe\nmodel-free RL agent called Critic As Lyapunov Function (CALF) and showcases how\nCALF can be used to improve upon control baselines in robotics in an efficient\nand convenient fashion while ensuring guarantees of stable goal reaching. The\nlatter is a crucial part of safety, as seen generally. With CALF all\nstate-action pairs remain explorable and yet reaching of desired goal states is\nformally guaranteed.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in various tasks but are still\nvulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where attackers create jailbreak prompts to\nmislead the model to produce harmful or offensive content. Current jailbreak\nmethods either rely heavily on manually crafted templates, which pose\nchallenges in scalability and adaptability, or struggle to generate\nsemantically coherent prompts, making them easy to detect. Additionally, most\nexisting approaches involve lengthy prompts, leading to higher query costs. In\nthis paper, to remedy these challenges, we introduce a novel jailbreaking\nattack framework called PAPILLON, which is an automated, black-box jailbreaking\nattack framework that adapts the black-box fuzz testing approach with a series\nof customized designs. Instead of relying on manually crafted\ntemplates,PAPILLON starts with an empty seed pool, removing the need to search\nfor any related jailbreaking templates. We also develop three novel\nquestion-dependent mutation strategies using an LLM helper to generate prompts\nthat maintain semantic coherence while significantly reducing their length.\nAdditionally, we implement a two-level judge module to accurately detect\ngenuine successful jailbreaks. We evaluated PAPILLON on 7 representative LLMs\nand compared it with 5 state-of-the-art jailbreaking attack strategies. For\nproprietary LLM APIs, such as GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, and Gemini-Pro, PAPILLONs\nachieves attack success rates of over 90%, 80%, and 74%, respectively,\nexceeding existing baselines by more than 60\\%. Additionally, PAPILLON can\nmaintain high semantic coherence while significantly reducing the length of\njailbreak prompts. When targeting GPT-4, PAPILLON can achieve over 78% attack\nsuccess rate even with 100 tokens. Moreover, PAPILLON demonstrates\ntransferability and is robust to state-of-the-art defenses.

Not only they may be sensitive to small perturbations in their\ninitial conditions, but they are often composed of processes acting at multiple\nscales. Classical approaches based on the Lyapunov spectrum rely on the\nknowledge of the dynamic forward operator, or of a data-derived approximation\nof it. This operator is typically unknown, or the data are too noisy to derive\na faithful representation. Here, we propose a new data-driven approach to\nanalyze the local predictability of dynamical systems. This method, based on\nthe concept of recurrence, is closely linked to the well-established framework\nof local dynamical indices. Applied to both idealized systems and real-world\ndatasets, this new index shows results consistent with existing knowledge,\nproving its effectiveness in estimating local predictability. Additionally, we\ndiscuss its relationship with local dynamical indices, illustrating how it\ncomplements the previous framework as a more direct measure of predictability.\nFurthermore, we explore its reflection of the scale-dependent nature of\npredictability, its extension that includes a weighting strategy, and its\nreal-time application.

    "abstract": "We consider a class of non-standard, two-dimensional (2D) Hamiltonian models\nthat may show features of active particle dynamics, and therefore, we refer to\nthese models as active Hamiltonian (AH) systems. The idea is to consider a spin\nfluid where -- on top of spin-spin and particle-particle interactions -- spins\nare coupled to the particle's velocities via a vector potential. Continuous\nspin variables interact with each other as in a standard $XY$ model. Typically,\nthe AH models exhibit non-standard thermodynamic properties (e.g., for\ntemperature and pressure) and equations of motion with non-standard forces.\nThis implies that the derivation of symplectic algorithms to solve Hamilton's\nequations of motion numerically, as well as the thermostatting for these\nsystems, is not straightforward. Here, we derive a symplectic integration\nscheme and propose a Nos\\'e-Poincar\\'e thermostat, providing a correct sampling\nin the canonical ensemble. The expressions for AH systems that we find for\ntemperature and pressure might have parallels with the ongoing debate about the\ndefinition of pressure and the equation of state in active matter systems. For\na specific AH model, recently proposed by Casiulis et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n{\\bf 124}, 198001 (2020)], we rationalize the symplectic algorithm and the\nproposed thermostatting, and investigate the transition from a fluid at high\ntemperature to a cluster phase at low temperature where, due to the coupling of\nvelocities and spins, the cluster phase shows a collective motion that is\nreminiscent to that observed in a variety of active systems.",

We have observed large, positive, and\nnon-saturated magnetoresistance (MR) in CrSb, which well obeys Kohler's rule,\nindicating its classic Lorentz scattering origins. Remarkably, a nonlinear\nmagnetic field dependence of Hall effect resembling the spontaneous anomalous\nHall is identified over a wide temperature range.

According to\nthe Fermi surface analyses of CrSb, we applied the three-carrier model to fit\nthe conductivity data, yielding good agreement. The extracted carrier\nconcentration and mobility indicates that CrSb behaves more like a semimetal,\nwith the highest mobility reaching 3*103 cm2V-1s-1.

In addition to tailored instrumental facilities implementing\nadaptive optics and coronagraphy, post-processing methods combining several\nimages recorded in pupil tracking mode are needed to attenuate the nuisances\ncorrupting the signals of interest. Most of these post-processing methods build\na model of the nuisances from the target observations themselves, resulting in\nstrongly limited detection sensitivity at short angular separations due to the\nlack of angular diversity. To address this issue, we propose to build the\nnuisance model from an archive of multiple observations by leveraging\nsupervised deep learning techniques. The proposed approach casts the detection\nproblem as a reconstruction task and captures the structure of the nuisance\nfrom two complementary representations of the data. Unlike methods inspired by\nreference differential imaging, the proposed model is highly non-linear and\ndoes not resort to explicit image-to-image similarity measurements and\nsubtractions. The proposed approach also encompasses statistical modeling of\nlearnable spatial features. The latter is beneficial to improve both the\ndetection sensitivity and the robustness against heterogeneous data. We apply\nthe proposed algorithm to several datasets from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, and\ndemonstrate a superior precision-recall trade-off compared to the PACO\nalgorithm.

For these two translation\ntasks, we use training strategies such as regularized dropout, bidirectional\ntraining, data diversification, forward translation, back translation,\nalternated training, curriculum learning, and transductive ensemble learning to\ntrain neural machine translation (NMT) models based on the deep Transformer-big\narchitecture. Furthermore, to explore whether large language model (LLM) can\nhelp improve the translation quality of NMT systems, we use supervised\nfine-tuning to train llama2-13b as an Automatic post-editing (APE) model to\nimprove the translation results of the NMT model on the multi-domain machine\ntranslation task. By using these plyometric strategies, our submission achieves\na competitive result in the final evaluation.",

However, most of the\nheterogeneous co-processors are designed to achieve high throughput, with their\nmicro-architectures executing the workloads in a streaming manner. This\nstreaming execution is often non-preemptive or limited-preemptive, preventing\ntasks' prioritisation based on their importance and resulting in frequent\noccurrences of algorithmic priority and/or criticality inversions. Such\nproblems present a significant barrier to guaranteeing the systems' real-time\npredictability, especially when co-processors dominate the execution of the\nworkloads (e.g., DNNs and transformers).\n  In contrast to existing works that typically enable coarse-grained context\nswitch by splitting the workloads/algorithms, we demonstrate a method that\nprovides fine-grained context switch on a widely used open-source DNN\naccelerator by enabling instruction-level preemption without any\nworkloads/algorithms modifications. As a systematic solution, we build a real\nsystem, i.e., Make Each Switch Count (MESC), from the SoC and ISA to the OS\nkernel. A theoretical model and analysis are also provided for timing\nguarantees. Experimental results reveal that, compared to conventional MCSs\nusing non-preemptive DNN accelerators, MESC achieved a 250x and 300x speedup in\nresolving algorithmic priority and criticality inversions, with less than 5\\%\noverhead.

Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our model aligns perfectly with human preferences while\nretaining the original expressive capacity using only 0.0086% of the trainable\nparameters, suggesting an effective regularization against overfitting.\nSpecifically, RoPO outperforms DPO by up to 10 points on MT-Bench and by up to\n2.8 points on AlpacaEval 2, while enhancing the generation diversity by an\naverage of 6 points.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, digital watermarking techniques based on deep learning have\nbeen widely studied. To achieve both imperceptibility and robustness of image\nwatermarks, most current methods employ convolutional neural networks to build\nrobust watermarking frameworks. However, despite the success of CNN-based\nwatermarking models, they struggle to achieve robustness against geometric\nattacks due to the limitations of convolutional neural networks in capturing\nglobal and long-range relationships. To address this limitation, we propose a\nrobust watermarking framework based on the Swin Transformer, named RoWSFormer.\nSpecifically, we design the Locally-Channel Enhanced Swin Transformer Block as\nthe core of both the encoder and decoder. This block utilizes the\nself-attention mechanism to capture global and long-range information, thereby\nsignificantly improving adaptation to geometric distortions. Additionally, we\nconstruct the Frequency-Enhanced Transformer Block to extract frequency domain\ninformation, which further strengthens the robustness of the watermarking\nframework. Experimental results demonstrate that our RoWSFormer surpasses\nexisting state-of-the-art watermarking methods. For most non-geometric attacks,\nRoWSFormer improves the PSNR by 3 dB while maintaining the same extraction\naccuracy. In the case of geometric attacks (such as rotation, scaling, and\naffine transformations), RoWSFormer achieves over a 6 dB improvement in PSNR,\nwith extraction accuracy exceeding 97\\%.",

Saliency maps are widely\nexploited in various applications, including video compression, quality\nassessment, visual perception studies, the advertising industry, etc. For this\ncompetition, a previously unused large-scale audio-visual mouse saliency\n(AViMoS) dataset of 1500 videos with more than 70 observers per video was\ncollected using crowdsourced mouse tracking. The dataset collection methodology\nhas been validated using conventional eye-tracking data and has shown high\nconsistency. Over 30 teams registered in the challenge, and there are 7 teams\nthat submitted the results in the final phase. The final phase solutions were\ntested and ranked by commonly used quality metrics on a private test subset.\nThe results of this evaluation and the descriptions of the solutions are\npresented in this report. All data, including the private test subset, is made\npublicly available on the challenge homepage -\nhttps://challenges.videoprocessing.ai/challenges/video-saliency-prediction.html.",

    "abstract": "Recently, tool-augmented LLMs have gained increasing attention. Given an\ninstruction, tool-augmented LLMs can interact with various external tools in\nmultiple rounds and provide a final answer. However, previous LLMs were trained\non overly detailed instructions, which included API names or parameters, while\nreal users would not explicitly mention these API details. This leads to a gap\nbetween trained LLMs and real-world scenarios. In addition, most works ignore\nwhether the interaction process follows the instruction. To address these\nissues, we constructed a training dataset called MGToolBench, which contains\nstatement and category-level instructions to better reflect real-world\nscenarios. In addition, we propose ToolPlanner, a two-stage reinforcement\nlearning framework that utilizes path planning and two feedback mechanisms to\nenhance the LLM's task completion and instruction-following capabilities.\nExperimental results show that ToolPlanner significantly improves the Match\nRate, Pass Rate and Win Rate by 26.8%, 20.2%, and 5.6% compared to the SOTA\nmodel. Human evaluation verifies that the multi-granularity instructions can\nbetter align with users' usage habits. Our data and code will be released upon\nacceptance.",

To fill this gap, in this\npaper, we focus on the historical analogy acquisition task, which aims to\nacquire analogous historical events for a given event. We explore retrieval and\ngeneration methods for acquiring historical analogies based on different large\nlanguage models (LLMs).

Second, the newly discovered coupling constant\n$\\mathfrak{c}_{0}$ is the electrostatic capacity of the interaction potential,\ncorresponding to the scattering length of the hard-core potential. Furthermore,\nin other limiting regimes, including those beyond the Gross--Pitaevskii regime,\nwe find that the limiting equation is described by an eikonal system, offering\na rigorous first-principle justification for using the ``geometric optics\napproximation'' to describe the dynamics of ultracold Bose gases.",

This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as\nusers are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic\nfile names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file\nsystem ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional\napproaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with\nfiles through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management.\nAt the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file\nmanagement functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update\nmonitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level,\nwe store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement\nsyscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered\nby vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant\nimprovements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the\ndiversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file\noperations.

Previous sequential recommendation\nalgorithms primarily employ neural networks to extract features of user\ninterests, achieving good performance.

Recently, a series\nof sequential recommendation algorithms based on large pre-trained language\nmodels have been proposed. Nonetheless, given the real-time demands of\nrecommendation systems, the challenge remains in applying pre-trained language\nmodels for rapid recommendations in real scenarios. To address this, we propose\na sequential recommendation algorithm based on a pre-trained language model and\nknowledge distillation. The key of proposed algorithm is to transfer\npre-trained knowledge across domains and achieve lightweight inference by\nknowledge distillation. The algorithm operates in two stages: in the first\nstage, we fine-tune the pre-trained language model on the recommendation\ndataset to transfer the pre-trained knowledge to the recommendation task; in\nthe second stage, we distill the trained language model to transfer the learned\nknowledge to a lightweight model.

We develop\na methodological framework designed to optimally extract information on the ICM\npressure fluctuation power spectrum statistics, and publicly release the\nassociated software named PITSZI. We apply this tool to the NIKA data of the\nmerging cluster MACSJ0717 to measure its pressure fluctuation power spectrum at\nhigh significance, and to investigate the implications for its nonthermal\ncontent. Depending on the choice of the radial pressure model and the details\nof the applied methodology, we measure an energy injection scale $L_{inj} \\sim\n800$ kpc. The power spectrum normalization corresponds to a characteristic\namplitude reaching $A(k_{peak}) \\sim 0.4$. These results are are obtained\nassuming that MACSJ0717 can be described as pressure fluctuations on top of a\nsingle (smooth) halo, and are dominated by systematics due to the choice of the\nradial pressure model. Using simulations, we estimate that fitting a radial\nmodel to the data can suppress the observed fluctuations by up to 50\\%, while a\npoorly representative radial model can induce spurious fluctuations, which we\nalso quantify. Assuming standard scaling relations between the pressure\nfluctuations and turbulence, we find that MACSJ0717 presents a turbulent\nvelocity dispersion $\\sigma_v \\sim 1200$ km/s, a kinetic to kinetic plus\nthermal pressure fraction $P_{k} / P_{k+th} \\sim 20\\%$, and we estimate the\nhydrostatic mass bias to $b_{HSE} \\sim 0.3-0.4$.

We focus on cases where photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) are estimated\nempirically. Identifying galaxies that are poorly represented in spectroscopic\ndata is crucial, as their photo-$z$ may be unreliable due to extrapolation\nbeyond the training sample. Our approach uses a self-organizing map (SOM) to\nproject a multi-dimensional parameter space of magnitudes and colors onto a 2-D\nmanifold, allowing us to analyze the resulting patterns as a function of\nvarious galaxy properties. Using SOM, we compare the Kilo-Degree Survey bright\ngalaxy sample (KiDS-Bright), limited to $r<20$ mag, with various spectroscopic\nsamples, including the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA). Our analysis reveals\nthat GAMA under-represents KiDS-Bright at its faintest ($r\\gtrsim19.5$) and\nhighest-redshift ($z\\gtrsim0.4$) ranges, however no strong trends in color or\nstellar mass. By incorporating additional spectroscopic data from the SDSS,\n2dF, and early DESI, we identify SOM cells where photo-$z$ are estimated\nsuboptimally. We derive a set of SOM-based criteria to refine the photometric\nsample and improve photo-$z$ statistics. For the KiDS-Bright sample, this\nimprovement is modest: exclusion of the least represented 20% of the sample\nreduces photo-$z$ scatter by less than 10%. We conclude that GAMA, used for\nKiDS-Bright photo-$z$ training, is sufficiently representative for reliable\nredshift estimation across most of the color space. Future spectroscopic data\nfrom surveys such as DESI should be better suited for exploiting the full\nimprovement potential of our method.",

    "abstract": "DNA fingerprinting and matching for identifying suspects has been a common\npractice in criminal investigation. Such proceedings involve multiple parties\nsuch as investigating agencies, suspects and forensic labs. A major challenge\nin such settings is to carry out the matching process between the suspects' DNA\nsamples and the samples obtained from the crime scene without compromising the\nprivacy of the suspects' DNA profiles. Additionally, it is necessary that\nsensitive details pertaining to the investigation such as the identities of the\nsuspects and evidence obtained from the crime scene must be kept private to the\ninvestigating agency. We present a novel DNA matching scheme, termed as\nPrivaMatch, which addresses multiple concerns about privacy of the suspects'\nDNA profiles and the crime scene evidence. In the proposed scheme, the\ninvestigating agencies oblivious transfer and zero-knowledge proofs to\nprivately obtain the DNA profiles of the suspects from the forensic lab's\ndatabase.In addition, we present a clever data obfuscation technique using\nhomomorphic encryption and modular arithmetic for the investigating agency to\nprivately obtain the DNA profile of the crime scene's sample, keeping the\nprofile oblivious from the forensic lab. The DNA profile of the crime scene\nsample is operated on using a homomorphic cryptosystem such that neither of the\nparties (e.g., the investigation agency, forensic labs, DNA database owners)\nlearns about the private data of the other parties. The proposed scheme is\nanalysed formally and the practicality of its security strengths is verified\nusing simulations under standard assumptions.",

Here we show that when the eigenmodes\nof a target system are obtained by the resonant-state expansion, using the\nmodes of a basis system embedding the target system, the completeness extends\nbeyond the boundary of the target system. We illustrate this by using the\nMittag-Leffler series of the Green's function expressed in terms of the\neigenmodes, which converges to the correct solution anywhere within the basis\nsystem, including the space outside the target system. Importantly, this\nproperty allows one to treat pertubations outside the target system and to\ncalculate the scattering cross-section using the boundary conditions for the\nbasis system. Choosing a basis system of spherical geometry, these boundary\nconditions have simple analytical expressions, allowing for an efficient\ncalculation of the response of the target system, as we demonstrate for a\nresonator in a form of a finite dielectric cylinder.",

We prove that the condition\nnumbers of the the diagonal blocks of the corresponding multiscale system\nremain bounded independently of the particular level, allowing us to use an\niterative solver with a bounded number of iterations for the numerical\nsolution.

    "abstract": "For a positive integer $s$, an $s$-club in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices\ninducing a subgraph with diameter at most $s$. As generalizations of cliques,\n$s$-clubs offer a flexible model for real-world networks. This paper addresses\nthe problems of partitioning and disjoint covering of vertices with $s$-clubs\non bipartite graphs. First we prove that for any fixed $s \\geq 6$ and fixed $k\n\\geq 5$, determining whether the vertices of $G$ can be partitioned into at\nmost $k$ disjoint $s$-clubs is NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. Note that\nour NP-completeness result is stronger than the one in Abbas and Stewart\n(1999), as we assume that both $s$ and $k$ are constants and not part of the\ninput.\n  Additionally, we study the Maximum Disjoint $(t,s)$-Club Covering problem\n(MAX-DCC($t,s$)), which aims to find a collection of vertex-disjoint\n$(t,s)$-clubs (i.e. $s$-clubs with at least $t$ vertices) that covers the\nmaximum number of vertices in $G$. We prove that it is NP-hard to achieve an\napproximation factor of $\\frac{95}{94} $ for MAX-DCC($t,3$) for any fixed\n$t\\geq 8$ and for MAX-DCC($t,2$) for any fixed $t\\geq 5$ even for bipartite\ngraphs.

In this paper, we consider an SAGIN supported MEC system, where a low\nEarth orbit satellite and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are\ndispatched to provide computing services for MUs. An energy efficiency\nmaximization problem is formulated, with the joint optimization of the MU-UAV\nassociation, the UAV trajectory, the task offloading decision, the computing\nfrequency, and the transmission power control.

This lack of transparency poses challenges to scientific evaluation and\nethical deployment. Recently, pretraining data detection approaches, which\ninfer whether a given text was part of an LLM's training data through black-box\naccess, have been explored. The Min-K\\% Prob method, which has achieved\nstate-of-the-art results, assumes that a non-training example tends to contain\na few outlier words with low token probabilities. However, the effectiveness\nmay be limited as it tends to misclassify non-training texts that contain many\ncommon words with high probabilities predicted by LLMs. To address this issue,\nwe introduce a divergence-based calibration method, inspired by the\ndivergence-from-randomness concept, to calibrate token probabilities for\npretraining data detection. We compute the cross-entropy (i.e., the divergence)\nbetween the token probability distribution and the token frequency distribution\nto derive a detection score. We have developed a Chinese-language benchmark,\nPatentMIA, to assess the performance of detection approaches for LLMs on\nChinese text.

However, these\ntonal variations not only confine to the state of MDD but also on the language,\nwhich has unique tonal patterns. This work analyzes automatic speech-based\ndepression detection across two languages, English and Malayalam, which\nexhibits distinctive prosodic and phonemic characteristics. We propose an\napproach that utilizes speech data collected along with self-reported labels\nfrom participants reading sentences from IViE corpus, in both English and\nMalayalam. The IViE corpus consists of five sets of sentences: simple\nsentences, WH-questions, questions without morphosyntactic markers, inversion\nquestions and coordinations, that can naturally prompt speakers to speak in\ndifferent tonal patterns. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for\ndetecting depression from speech. The CNN model is trained to identify acoustic\nfeatures associated with depression in speech, focusing on both languages. The\nmodel's performance is evaluated on the collected dataset containing recordings\nfrom both depressed and non-depressed speakers, analyzing its effectiveness in\ndetecting depression across the two languages.

In optimization-based signal recovery,\nmultilayered convex regularization functions based on the L1 and nuclear-norms\nnot only guarantee a global optimal solution but also offer more accurate\nestimation than single-layered ones, thanks to their faithful modeling of\nstructured sparsity and low-rankness in high-dimensional signals. However,\nthese functions are known to yield biased solutions (estimated with smaller\namplitude values than the true ones). To address this issue, multilayered\nnon-convex regularization functions have been considered, although they face\ntheir own challenges: 1) their closed-form proximity operators are unavailable,\nand 2) convergence may result in a local optimal solution. In this paper, we\nresolve the two issues with an approach based on epigraphical relaxation (ER).\nFirst, ER decomposes a multilayered non-convex regularization function into the\noutermost function and epigraph constraints for the inner functions,\nfacilitating the computation of proximity operators. Second, the relaxed\nregularization functions by ER are integrated into a non-convexly regularized\nconvex optimization model to estimate a global optimal solution with less bias.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate the bias reduction achieved by the proposed\nmethod in image recovery and principal component analysis.",

We utilize a computational model to evaluate\ndifferent indirect methods for estimating ANF neural health.Two distinct\nmeasures for estimating neural health,(i)the threshold levels for focused\nquadrupolar stimulation and (ii) the change in the electrically evoked compound\naction potential (eCAP) amplitude growth function for different inter-phase\ngaps (IPGs), were evaluated in a computational model of an electrically\nstimulated implanted cochlea.

Our experiments simulated different neural health conditions (healthy,\nshrinked, and degenerated) to model dead regions in different locations of the\ncochlea.The results from the computational experiments demonstrated that the\nthreshold levels with focused quadrupolar stimulation were more sensitive to\nneural health deficits than thresholds with monopolar stimulation. From our\ndata, the difference in threshold levels between quadrupolar and monopolar\nstimulation seems to be a promising measure of neural health status.

We implement two algorithms, in which the\ntwo-stage algorithm obtains initial depth maps by pairwise stereo matching of\nmultiple cameras and fuses the multiple depth maps to achieve the final depth\nestimation; the one-stage algorithm adopts spherical sweeping based on\nhypothetical depths to construct a uniform spherical matching cost of the\nmulti-camera images and obtain the depth.

To overcome panorama distortion, a spherical feature extractor is\nimplemented. Furthermore, a synthetic 360-degree dataset consisting of 12K road\nscene panoramas and 3K ground truth depth maps is presented to train and\nevaluate 360-degree depth estimation algorithms. Our dataset takes soiled\ncamera lenses and glare into consideration, which is more consistent with the\nreal-world environment.

The rotated surface code uses approximately half the number of qubits as\nthe unrotated surface code to create a logical qubit with the same\nerror-correcting distance. However, instead of distance, a more useful\nqubit-saving metric would be based on logical error rates. In this work we find\nthe well-below-threshold scaling of logical to physical error rates under\ncircuit-level noise for both codes at high odd and even distances, then compare\nthe number of qubits used by each code to achieve equal logical error rates. We\nperform Monte Carlo sampling of memory experiment circuits with all valid CNOT\norders, using the stabiliser simulator Stim and the uncorrelated minimum-weight\nperfect-matching decoder PyMatching 2.

However, many advanced methods rely on in-house data subject to\nvarious constraints, and other current studies fail to generate high-resolution\nface videos, which is mainly attributed to the significant lack of large-scale,\nhigh-quality face video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a human face\nvideo dataset, \\textbf{DH-FaceVid-1K}. Our collection spans 1,200 hours in\ntotal, encompassing 270,043 video clips from over 20,000 individuals. Each\nsample includes corresponding speech audio, facial keypoints, and text\nannotations. Compared to other publicly available datasets, ours distinguishes\nitself through its multi-ethnic coverage and high-quality, comprehensive\nindividual attributes. We establish multiple face video generation models\nsupporting tasks such as text-to-video and image-to-video generation. In\naddition, we develop comprehensive benchmarks to validate the scaling law when\nusing different proportions of proposed dataset.

    "abstract": "The precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix\nelements is very important, because it could be a clue to new physics beyond\nStandard Theory. This is particular true of $V_{ud}$, because it is the main\ncontribution to the unitary condition of the CKM matrix elements. The level of\naccuracy for the test of the unitarity involving the element $V_{ud}$ is now of\nthe order of $10^{-4}$. Because the precise data for $V_{ud}$ is usually\nextracted from super-allowed nuclear $\\beta$ decay, it is quite significant to\ninvestigate the breaking of SU(3) flavor symmetry on the weak vector coupling\nconstant in nuclear matter. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the\nisoscalar scalar ($\\sigma$) and the isovector scalar ($\\delta$ or $a_0$)\nmean-fields affect the weak vector and axial-vector coupling constants for\nsemileptonic baryon (neutron, $\\Lambda$ or $\\Xi^-$) decay in asymmetric nuclear\nmatter. To do so, we use the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, where nuclear\nmatter consists of nucleons including quark degrees of freedom bound by the\nself-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. We pay careful attention\nto the center of mass correction to the quark currents in matter. We then find\nthat, for neutron $\\beta$ decay in asymmetric nuclear matter, the defect of the\nvector coupling constant due to the $\\delta$ field can be of the order of\n$10^{-4}$ at the nuclear saturation density, which is the same amount as the\nlevel of the current uncertainty in the measurements. It is also interesting\nthat, in neutron-rich matter, there exists a certain low density at which\nisospin symmetry is restored, that is, the $u$-$d$ quark mass difference\nvanishes. We conclude that the effect of the isoscalar scalar and the isovector\nscalar fields should be considered in baryon semileptonic decays in nuclei.",

    "abstract": "We consider an interface with surface tension that separates a perfectly\nconducting inviscid fluid from a vacuum. The fluid flow is governed by the\nequations of ideal compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), while the electric\nand magnetic fields in vacuum satisfy the Maxwell equations. With boundary\nconditions on the interface this forms a nonlinear hyperbolic problem with a\ncharacteristic free boundary. For the corresponding linearized problem we\nderive an energy a priori estimate in a conormal Sobolev space without assuming\nany stability conditions on the unperturbed flow. This verifies the stabilizing\neffect of surface tension because, as was shown in [Mandrik and Trakhinin, in\nCommun. Math. Sci. 12 (2014), 1065-1100], a sufficiently large vacuum electric\nfield can make the linearized problem ill-posed for the case of zero surface\ntension. The main ingredients in proving the energy estimate are a suitable\nsecondary symmetrization of the Maxwell equations in vacuum and making full use\nof the boundary regularity enhanced from the surface tension.",

    "abstract": "Chirality, a fundamental concept describing an object cannot superpose with\nits mirror image, is crucial in optics and photonics and leads to various\nexotic phenomena, such as circular dichroism, and optical activity. Recent\nfindings reveal that, besides electric and magnetic dipoles, toroidal dipoles,\nan elusive part of dynamic multipoles, can also contribute significantly to\nchirality. However, as toroidal dipoles are typically represented by solenoidal\ncurrents circulating on a three-dimensional (3D) torus, toroidal circular\ndichroism is usually observed in 3D intricate microstructures. Facing\ncorresponding challenges in fabrication, integration and application, it is\ngenerally difficult to employ toroidal circular dichroism in compact\nmetasurfaces for flexible modulation of chiral interactions between\nelectromagnetic waves and matter. To overcome these stringent challenges, we\npropose and experimentally demonstrate the giant toroidal circular dichroism in\na bilayer metasurface that is comprised of only planar layers, effectively\nbypassing various restrictions imposed by 3D microstructures. With the\nintroduction of a displacement, or bilayer offset, between the opposite layers,\nwe experimentally achieve giant chiral responses with the intrinsic circular\ndichroism (CD) reaching 0.69 in measurements, and the CD can be quantitatively\nmanipulated in a simple manner. The giant intrinsic chirality primarily\noriginates from distinct excitations of in-plane toroidal dipole moments under\ncircular polarized incidences, and the toroidal chiral response is\nquantitatively controlled by the bilayer offset. Therefore, our work provides a\nstraightforward and versatile approach for development of giant and flexible\nintrinsic chirality through toroidal dipoles with inherently planar layers,\nimportant for applications in communications, sensing, and chiroptical devices.",

In this\npaper, we present a framework that combines optimization and learning to\nachieve compliant catching on mobile manipulators (CCMM). First, we propose a\nhigh-level capture planner for mobile manipulators (MM) that calculates the\noptimal capture point and joint configuration. Next, the pre-catching (PRC)\nplanner ensures the robot reaches the target joint configuration as quickly as\npossible. To learn compliant catching strategies, we propose a network that\nleverages the strengths of LSTM for capturing temporal dependencies and\npositional encoding for spatial context (P-LSTM). This network is designed to\neffectively learn compliant strategies from human demonstrations. Following\nthis, the post-catching (POC) planner tracks the compliant sequence output by\nthe P-LSTM while avoiding potential collisions due to structural differences\nbetween humans and robots. We validate the CCMM framework through both\nsimulated and real-world ball-catching scenarios, achieving a success rate of\n98.70% in simulation, 92.59% in real-world tests, and a 28.7% reduction in\nimpact torques.

In\nparticular, extreme events such as flares and coronal mass ejections have a\nprofound effect on planetary atmospheres. In May this year, a magnetic active\nregion on the Sun (AR 13664) -- with a size exceeding hundred times that of\nEarth -- unleashed a large number of high energy X-class flares and associated\nmass ejections. The resulting Earth impact (geomagnetic storm) on May 10-11 was\nthe strongest in the last two decades. We perform the first comprehensive\nanalysis of the magnetic properties of the active region that spawned these\nflares and identify this to be a super active region with very rare physical\ncharacteristics. We also demonstrate how the rate of energization of the system\nis related to the flaring process. Our work illuminates how flare productive\nsuper active regions on the Sun and stars can be identified and what are their\nsalient physical properties. Specifically, we put AR 13664 in historical\ncontext over the cumulative period of 1874 May-2024 June. We find that AR 13664\nstands at 99.95 percentile in the distribution of area over 1874 May-2024 June,\nand at 99.10 percentile in terms of flux content among all ARs over the period\n1996 April-2024 June. Our analysis indicates that five of its magnetic\nproperties rank highest among all ARs recorded in SHARP data series during 2010\nMay-2024 June by the Solar Dynamic Observatory. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat AR 13664 reached its most dynamic flare productive state following a rapid\nrate of rise of its flare-relevant parameters and that the X-class flares it\nspawned were more frequent near their peak values. Our analyses establish AR\n13644 to be solar super active region and provide a paradigm for investigating\ntheir flare-relevant physical characteristics.",

In recent years, radar-vision fusion models have demonstrated\nperformance close to that of LiDAR-based models, offering advantages in terms\nof lower hardware costs and better resilience in extreme conditions. However,\nmany radar-vision fusion models treat radar as a sparse LiDAR, underutilizing\nradar-specific information. Additionally, these multi-modal networks are often\nsensitive to the failure of a single modality, particularly vision. To address\nthese challenges, we propose the Radar Depth Lift-Splat-Shoot (RDL) module,\nwhich integrates radar-specific data into the depth prediction process,\nenhancing the quality of visual Bird-Eye View (BEV) features. We further\nintroduce a Unified Feature Fusion (UFF) approach that extracts BEV features\nacross different modalities using shared module. To assess the robustness of\nmulti-modal models, we develop a novel Failure Test (FT) ablation experiment,\nwhich simulates vision modality failure by injecting Gaussian noise. We conduct\nextensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4D datasets. The results\ndemonstrate that our proposed Unified BEVFusion (UniBEVFusion) network\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on the TJ4D dataset, with\nimprovements of 1.44 in 3D and 1.72 in BEV object detection accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Non-Factoid (NF) Question Answering (QA) is challenging to evaluate due to\ndiverse potential answers and no objective criterion. The commonly used\nautomatic evaluation metrics like ROUGE or BERTScore cannot accurately measure\nsemantic similarities or answers from different perspectives. Recently, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have been resorted to for NFQA evaluation due to their\ncompelling performance on various NLP tasks. Common approaches include\npointwise scoring of each candidate answer and pairwise comparisons between\nanswers. Inspired by the evolution from pointwise to pairwise to listwise in\nlearning-to-rank methods, we propose a novel listwise NFQA evaluation approach,\nthat utilizes LLMs to rank candidate answers in a list of reference answers\nsorted by descending quality. Moreover, for NF questions that do not have\nmulti-grade or any golden answers, we leverage LLMs to generate the reference\nanswer list of various quality to facilitate the listwise evaluation. Extensive\nexperimental results on three NFQA datasets, i.e., ANTIQUE, the TREC-DL-NF, and\nWebGLM show that our method has significantly higher correlations with human\nannotations compared to automatic scores and common pointwise and pairwise\napproaches.",

A common\nstrategy is to minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and\nadverse weather conditions. However, this technique typically relies on\nutilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain in\npractice. Furthermore, this method typically targets a single adverse\ncondition, and thus perform poorly when confronting a mixture of multiple\nadverse weather conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a\nreference-free and Adverse weather-Immune scheme (called AdvImmu) that\nleverages the invariance of weather conditions over short periods (seconds).\nSpecifically, AdvImmu includes three components: Locally Sequential Mechanism\n(LSM), Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM), and Unfolded Regularizers (URs). LSM\nleverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to enhance model\nperformance. GSM is proposed to shuffle LSM segments to prevent overfitting of\ntemporal patterns. URs are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed\nregularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather\ngeneralization. In addition, to overcome the over-reliance on consecutive\nframe-wise annotations in the training of AdvImmu (typically unavailable in AD\nscenarios), we incorporate a foundation model named Segment Anything Model\n(SAM) to assist to annotate frames, and additionally propose a cluster\nalgorithm (denoted as SBICAC) to surmount SAM's category-agnostic issue to\ngenerate pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nAdvImmu outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 88.56% in mean\nIntersection over Union (mIoU).",

Chapter 1 introduces key concepts, focusing\non the extended Hubbard model, double quantum dot systems, and electron-phonon\ncoupling. Chapter 2 explores electron-phonon coupling in multielectron double\nquantum dots under unbiased and biased scenarios via detuning variations. In\nthe unbiased case, dephasing due to electron-phonon coupling generally\nincreases with more electrons in the right dot; this trend is inconsistent in\nthe biased case, suggesting potential advantages of multielectron quantum dots\nunder certain conditions. Chapter 3 investigates entanglement entropy in a\nmultielectron quantum dot spin chain described by the extended Hubbard model.\nLocal and pairwise entanglement are influenced by Coulomb interactions,\ntunneling strengths, electronic configurations, and site potential energies.\nThe entanglement diagram reveals phase transitions significantly impacted by\ncoupling strength ratios and potential energy variations; adjusting the\npotential energy of a specific dot critically influences ground state\nconfigurations and entanglement entropy. Chapter 4, inspired by the\ndecoherence-free subspace concept, explores operation sequences in a nine-spin,\nnine-quantum-dot system defined by the Heisenberg model, with bases determined\nby total angular momentum quantum numbers.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained widespread use in various\napplications due to their powerful capability to generate human-like text.\nHowever, prompt injection attacks, which involve overwriting a model's original\ninstructions with malicious prompts to manipulate the generated text, have\nraised significant concerns about the security and reliability of LLMs.\nEnsuring that LLMs are robust against such attacks is crucial for their\ndeployment in real-world applications, particularly in critical tasks.\n  In this paper, we propose PROMPTFUZZ, a novel testing framework that\nleverages fuzzing techniques to systematically assess the robustness of LLMs\nagainst prompt injection attacks. Inspired by software fuzzing, PROMPTFUZZ\nselects promising seed prompts and generates a diverse set of prompt injections\nto evaluate the target LLM's resilience. PROMPTFUZZ operates in two stages: the\nprepare phase, which involves selecting promising initial seeds and collecting\nfew-shot examples, and the focus phase, which uses the collected examples to\ngenerate diverse, high-quality prompt injections. Using PROMPTFUZZ, we can\nuncover more vulnerabilities in LLMs, even those with strong defense prompts.\n  By deploying the generated attack prompts from PROMPTFUZZ in a real-world\ncompetition, we achieved the 7th ranking out of over 4000 participants (top\n0.14%) within 2 hours. Additionally, we construct a dataset to fine-tune LLMs\nfor enhanced robustness against prompt injection attacks. While the fine-tuned\nmodel shows improved robustness, PROMPTFUZZ continues to identify\nvulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of robust testing for LLMs. Our\nwork emphasizes the critical need for effective testing tools and provides a\npractical framework for evaluating and improving the robustness of LLMs against\nprompt injection attacks.",

Control variates are crucial in reducing the\nvariance of Monte Carlo integration, but they hinge on finding a function that\nboth correlates with the integrand and has a known analytical integral.\nTraditional approaches rely on heuristics to choose this function, which might\nnot be expressive enough to correlate well with the integrand. Recent research\nalleviates this issue by modeling the integrands with a learnable parametric\nmodel, such as a neural network. However, the challenge remains in creating an\nexpressive parametric model with a known analytical integral. This paper\nproposes a novel approach to construct learnable parametric control variates\nfunctions from arbitrary neural network architectures. Instead of using a\nnetwork to approximate the integrand directly, we employ the network to\napproximate the anti-derivative of the integrand. This allows us to use\nautomatic differentiation to create a function whose integration can be\nconstructed by the antiderivative network. We apply our method to solve partial\ndifferential equations using the Walk-on-sphere algorithm. Our results indicate\nthat this approach is unbiased and uses various network architectures to\nachieve lower variance than other control variate methods.",

However,\nlimited bandwidth, latency, rain attenuation, long propagation delays, and\nco-channel interference pose challenges to efficient satellite communication.\nTherefore, semantic communication (SC) has emerged as a promising solution to\nimprove transmission efficiency and address these issues. In this paper, we\nexplore the potential of SC as a bandwidth-efficient, latency-minimizing\nstrategy specifically suited to 6G satellite communications. While existing SC\nmethods have demonstrated efficacy in direct satellite-terrestrial\ntransmissions, they encounter limitations in satellite networks due to\ndistortion accumulation across gateway hop-relays. Additionally, certain ground\nusers (GUs) experience poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), making direct\nsatellite communication challenging. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel framework that optimizes gateway hop-relay selection for GUs with low SNR\nand integrates gateway-based denoising mechanisms to ensure\nhigh-quality-of-service (QoS) in satellite-based SC networks. This approach\ndirectly mitigates distortion, leading to significant improvements in satellite\nservice performance by delivering customized services tailored to the unique\nsignal conditions of each GU. Our findings represent a critical advancement in\nreliable and efficient data transmission from the Earth observation satellites,\nthereby enabling fast and effective responses to urgent events.

Benefiting from the use of polygons to concisely\nand accurately depict environmental occupancy, the prior polygon map achieves\nlong-term reliable pose tracking while ensuring a compact form. More\nimportantly, pose tracking is carried out under pure LiDAR mode, and the dense\n3D point cloud is transformed into a sparse 2D scan through ground removal and\nobstacle selection. On this basis, a novel cost function for pose estimation\nthrough point-polygon matching is introduced, encompassing two distinct\nconstraint forms: point-to-vertex and point-to-edge.

    "abstract": "Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are the most luminous transients in the universe. The\ninteraction of the relativistic jet with the circumburst medium produces an\nafterglow and generates multiwavelength emission. In this work, we present\nsimultaneous multiband photometry of GRB~240825A with the Multi-channel\nPhotometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) and analyze its temporal and spectral\nproperties. The measurement began 128 seconds after the GRB trigger and\ncontinued until the fourth day when the afterglow essentially diminished and\nthe measured brightness was close to that of the host galaxy. Based on the\nmultiband light curves in the $uvgriz$ bands, we find that the optical flux\ndensity satisfies $F_{\\nu,{\\rm obs}}\\propto t^{-1.34}\\nu^{-2.48}$ with a\nspectral index of $2.48$ much larger than those of most other GRBs. To\nreconcile the measured much softer spectral energy distribution (SED) with that\npredicted by the standard afterglow model, an extra host-galaxy extinction of\n$E_{B-V}\\sim(0.37-0.57)$ mag is required. We interpreted this excess as arising\nfrom a dense circumburst medium. We further find that the SED of the optical\nafterglow hardened as the afterglow decayed and the color excess $E_{B-V}$\ndecreased $\\sim0.26$ mag from 100 seconds to 3000 seconds after the GRB\ntrigger. Finally, we analyze the properties of the host galaxy of GRB~240825A\nbased on data from the SDSS, PanSTARRS and HSC-SSP surveys. For a host redshift\nof $z=0.659$, the stellar mass and star formation rate of the host galaxy are\nestimated to be $\\log(M_*/M_\\odot)=10.0^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ and $\\log({\\rm\nSFR}/M_{\\odot}{\\rm yr}^{-1})= 0.6^{+0.8}_{-3.3}$, respectively, pointing to a\ngas-rich, star-forming, medium-size galaxy.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by large-scale applications, there is a recent trend of research on\nusing first-order methods for solving LP. Among them, PDLP, which is based on a\nprimal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm, may be the most promising one. In\nthis paper, we present a geometric viewpoint on the behavior of PDHG for LP. We\ndemonstrate that PDHG iterates exhibit a spiral pattern with a closed-form\nsolution when the variable basis remains unchanged. This spiral pattern\nconsists of two orthogonal components: rotation and forward movement, where\nrotation improves primal and dual feasibility, while forward movement advances\nthe duality gap. We also characterize the different situations in which basis\nchange events occur. Inspired by the spiral behavior of PDHG, we design a new\ncrossover algorithm to obtain a vertex solution from any optimal LP solution.\nThis approach differs from traditional simplex-based crossover methods. Our\nnumerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm,\nshowcasing its potential as an alternative option for crossover.",

Following the scaling laws of\ninstruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), LLVMs either have further\nincreased their sizes, reaching 26B, 34B, and even 80B parameters. While this\nincrease in model size has yielded significant performance gains, it demands\nsubstantially more hardware resources for both training and inference.\nConsequently, there naturally exists a strong need for efficient LLVMs that\nachieve the performance of larger models while being smaller in size. To\nachieve this need, we present a new efficient LLVM family with model sizes of\n0.5B, 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B parameters, Phantom, which significantly enhances\nlearning capabilities within limited structures. By temporarily increasing the\nlatent hidden dimension during multi-head self-attention (MHSA), we make LLVMs\nprepare to look and understand much more vision-language knowledge on the\nlatent, without substantially increasing physical model sizes. To maximize its\nadvantage, we introduce Phantom Optimization (PO) using both autoregressive\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO)-like\nconcept, which effectively follows correct answers while eliminating incorrect\nand ambiguous ones.

Previous\nwork has shown that making such an assumption in the analysis of SW-CRTs when\nthe true underlying treatment effect varies by exposure time can produce\nseverely misleading estimates. Alternatively, the true underlying treatment\neffect might vary by calendar time. Comparatively less work has examined\ntreatment effect structure misspecification in this setting. Here, we evaluate\nthe behavior of the mixed effects model-based immediate treatment effect,\nexposure time-averaged treatment effect, and calendar time-averaged treatment\neffect estimators in different scenarios where they are misspecified for the\ntrue underlying treatment effect structure. We show that the immediate\ntreatment effect estimator is relatively robust to bias when estimating a true\nunderlying calendar time-averaged treatment effect estimand. However, when\nthere is a true underlying calendar (exposure) time-varying treatment effect,\nmisspecifying an analysis with an exposure (calendar) time-averaged treatment\neffect estimator can yield severely misleading estimates and even converge to a\nvalue of the opposite sign of the true calendar (exposure) time-averaged\ntreatment effect estimand. In this article, we highlight the two different time\nscales on which treatment effects can vary in SW-CRTs and clarify potential\nvulnerabilities that may arise when considering different types of time-varying\ntreatment effects in a SW design.

Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem,\naiming to maximize the sum SE of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system by\noptimizing the power-splitting factor and power-control coefficient.\nImportantly, we improve a generative AI (GAI) algorithm to address this complex\nand nonconvexity problem by using a diffusion model to obtain solutions.\nSimulation results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in mitigating\ninterference, especially in dynamic environments.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Recent method developments involving path integral simulations have come a\nlong way in making these techniques practical for studying condensed phase\nnon-equilibrium phenomena. One of the main difficulties that still needs to be\nsurmounted is the scaling of the algorithms with the system dimensionality. The\nmajority of recent techniques have only changed the order of this scaling\n(going from exponential to possibly a very high ordered polynomial) and not\neased the dependence on the system size. In this current work, we introduce an\nadaptive kink filtration technique for path generation approach that leverages\nthe locality of the interactions present in the system and the consequent\nsparsity of the propagator matrix to remove the asymptotic size dependence of\nthe simulations for the propagation of reduced density matrices. This enables\nthe simulation of larger systems at a significantly reduced cost. This\ntechnique can be used both for simulation of non-equilibrium dynamics and for\nequilibrium correlation functions, and is demonstrated here using examples from\nboth -- simulating the excitonic dynamics in bacteriochlorophyll chains and\ntheir absorption and emission spectra. We show that the cost becomes constant\nwith the dimensionality of the system. The only place where a system\nsize-dependence still remains is the calculation of the dynamical maps or\npropagators which are important for the transfer tensor method. The cost of\ncalculating this solvent-renormalized propagator is the same as the cost of\npropagating all the elements of the reduced density matrix, which scales as the\nsquare of the size. This adaptive kink-filtration technique promises to be\ninstrumental in extending the affordability of path integral simulations for\nvery large systems.",

In this paper, we propose two graph\nstate-based routing protocols for sharing GHZ states, achieving larger sizes\nthan the existing works, for given network topologies. For this improvement, we\nconsider tree structures connecting the users participating in the final GHZ\nstates, as opposed to the linear configurations used in the earlier ones. For\narbitrary network topologies, we show that if such a tree is balanced, it\nachieves a larger size than unbalanced trees. In particular, for grid networks,\nwe show special constructions of the above-mentioned tree that achieve optimal\nresults. Moreover, if the user nodes among whom the entanglement is to be\nrouted are pre-specified, we propose a strategy to accomplish the required\nrouting.",

While various models like regression and Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs) have been explored for this purpose, studies have shown that\nLong Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) are the most effective.

To address this issue, in this paper, we\nconsider low-resolution discrete PSs at the XL-array which are practically more\nenergy efficient, and investigate the impact of PS resolution on the near-field\nbeam-focusing effect. To this end, we propose a new Fourier series expansion\nmethod to efficiently tackle the difficulty in characterizing the beam pattern\nproperties under phase quantization. Interestingly, we analytically show, for\nthe first time, that 1) discrete PSs introduce additional grating lobes; 2) the\nmain lobe still exhibits the beam-focusing property with its beam power\nincreasing with PS resolution; and 3) there are two types of grating lobes,\nfeatured by the beam-focusing and beam-steering properties, respectively. In\naddition, we provide intuitive understanding for the appearance of grating\nlobes under discrete PSs from an array-of-subarrays perspective. Finally,\nnumerical results demonstrate that the grating lobes generally degrade\ncommunication rate performance.

Many RS utilize embedding-based\nretrieval (EBR) approaches to retrieve candidates for recommendation. In an EBR\nsystem, the embedding quality is key. According to recent literature,\nself-supervised multitask learning (SSMTL) has showed strong performance on\nacademic benchmarks in embedding learning and resulted in an overall\nimprovement in multiple downstream tasks, demonstrating a larger resilience to\nthe adverse conditions between each downstream task and thereby increased\nrobustness and task generalization ability through the training objective.\nHowever, whether or not the success of SSMTL in academia as a robust training\nobjectives translates to large-scale (i.e., over hundreds of million users and\ninteractions in-between) industrial RS still requires verification. Simply\nadopting academic setups in industrial RS might entail two issues. Firstly,\nmany self-supervised objectives require data augmentations (e.g., embedding\nmasking/corruption) over a large portion of users and items, which is\nprohibitively expensive in industrial RS. Furthermore, some self-supervised\nobjectives might not align with the recommendation task, which might lead to\nredundant computational overheads or negative transfer. In light of these two\nchallenges, we evaluate using a robust training objective, specifically SSMTL,\nthrough a large-scale friend recommendation system on a social media platform\nin the tech sector, identifying whether this increase in robustness can work at\nscale in enhancing retrieval in the production setting. Through online A/B\ntesting with SSMTL-based EBR, we observe statistically significant increases in\nkey metrics in the friend recommendations, with up to 5.45% improvements in new\nfriends made and 1.91% improvements in new friends made with cold-start users.",

A biased evaluation\nmisleads and hinders decision-making modification and development. Current\nplanning evaluation metrics include deviation from the real driver trajectory\nand objective driving experience indicators. The former category does not\nnecessarily indicate good driving performance since human drivers also make\nerrors and has been proven to be ineffective in interactive close-loop systems.\nOn the other hand, existing objective driving experience models only consider\nlimited factors, lacking comprehensiveness. And the integration mechanism of\nvarious factors relies on intuitive experience, lacking precision. In this\nresearch, we propose S2O, a novel integrated decision-making evaluation method\nbridging subjective human feeling to objective evaluation. First, modified\nfundamental models of four kinds of driving factors which are safety, time\nefficiency, comfort, and energy efficiency are established to cover common\ndriving factors. Then based on the analysis of human rating distribution\nregularity, a segmental linear fitting model in conjunction with a\ncomplementary SVM segment classifier is designed to express human's subjective\nrating by objective driving factor terms. Experiments are conducted on the D2E\ndataset, which includes approximately 1,000 driving cases and 40,000 human\nrating scores. Results show that S2O achieves a mean absolute error of 4.58 to\nground truth under a percentage scale. Compared with baselines, the evaluation\nerror is reduced by 32.55%.

However, a critical factor influencing DAOD - context bias\nresulting from learned foreground-background (FG-BG) associations - has\nremained underexplored. We address three key questions regarding FG BG\nassociations in object detection: are FG-BG associations encoded during the\ntraining, is there a causal relationship between FG-BG associations and\ndetection performance, and is there an effect of FG-BG association on DAOD. To\nexamine how models capture FG BG associations, we analyze class-wise and\nfeature-wise performance degradation using background masking and feature\nperturbation, measured via change in accuracies (defined as drop rate). To\nexplore the causal role of FG-BG associations, we apply do-calculus on FG-BG\npairs guided by class activation mapping (CAM). To quantify the causal\ninfluence of FG-BG associations across domains, we propose a novel metric -\ndomain association gradient - defined as the ratio of drop rate to maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD). Through systematic experiments involving background masking,\nfeature-level perturbations, and CAM, we reveal that convolution-based object\ndetection models encode FG-BG associations. Our results demonstrate that\ncontext bias not only exists but causally undermines the generalization\ncapabilities of object detection models across domains. Furthermore, we\nvalidate these findings across multiple models and datasets, including\nstate-of-the-art architectures such as ALDI++.

    "abstract": "Real-world applications of large language models (LLMs) in computational\nsocial science (CSS) tasks primarily depend on the effectiveness of instruction\ntuning (IT) or in-context learning (ICL). While IT has shown highly effective\nat fine-tuning LLMs for various tasks, ICL offers a rapid alternative for task\nadaptation by learning from examples without explicit gradient updates. In this\npaper, we evaluate the classification performance of LLMs using IT versus ICL\nin few-shot CSS tasks. The experimental results indicate that ICL consistently\noutperforms IT in most CSS tasks. Additionally, we investigate the relationship\nbetween the increasing number of training samples and LLM performance. Our\nfindings show that simply increasing the number of samples without considering\ntheir quality does not consistently enhance the performance of LLMs with either\nICL or IT and can sometimes even result in a performance decline. Finally, we\ncompare three prompting strategies, demonstrating that ICL is more effective\nthan zero-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Our research highlights the\nsignificant advantages of ICL in handling CSS tasks in few-shot settings and\nemphasizes the importance of optimizing sample quality and prompting strategies\nto improve LLM classification performance.

Corpora for training such models often pose sparsity challenges given\nthat there often is limited scored data from teachers, in addition to the score\ndistribution across proficiency levels being often imbalanced among student\ncohorts. Automatic scoring is thus not robust when faced with under-represented\nsamples or out-of-distribution samples, which inevitably exist in real-world\ndeployment scenarios. This paper proposes to address such challenges by\nexploiting semi-supervised pre-training and objective regularization to\napproximate subjective evaluation criteria.

An anchor model is trained using pseudo labels to predict the\ncorrectness of pronunciation.

Compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods on a public data-set, this approach not only achieves\nhigh performance while evaluating the entire test-set as a whole, but also\nbrings the most evenly distributed prediction error across distinct proficiency\nlevels.

    "abstract": "Visual content on social media plays a key role in entertainment and\ninformation sharing, yet some images gain more engagement than others. We\npropose that image memorability - the ability to be remembered - may predict\nviral potential. Using 1,247 Reddit image posts across three timepoints, we\nassessed memorability with neural network ResMem and correlated the predicted\nmemorability scores with virality metrics. Memorable images are consistently\nassociated with more comments, even after controlling for image categories with\nResNet-152. Semantic analysis revealed that memorable images relate to more\nneutral-affect comments, suggesting a distinct pathway to virality from\nemotional contents. Additionally, visual consistency analysis showed that\nmemorable posts inspired diverse, externally-associated comments. By analyzing\nResMem's layers, we found that semantic distinctiveness was key to both\nmemorability and virality even after accounting for image category effects.\nThis study highlights memorability as a unique correlate of social media\nvirality, offering insights into how visual features and human cognitive\nbehavioral interactions are associated with online engagement.",

    "abstract": "When the charge density is sufficiently low, interacting two-dimensional\nelectron gas (2DEG) would undergo a phase transition from homogeneous Fermi\nliquid to an electronic crystal state, known as Wigner crystal. Besides\nconventional 2DEG, various topological fermionic excitations may also be\nrealized in 2D materials. For example, ``high-order\" Dirac fermions exhibiting\nnontrivial Berry phases may approximately characterize the low-energy\nexcitations in rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In this work, we develop\na beyond-mean-field theoretical framework to study the interacting ground\nstates and single-particle excitations in slightly charge-doped RMG under\nvertical electric field. We find that transitions from Fermi liquid to trivial\nWigner-crystal states would occur at critical carrier density $\\sim\n10^{10}\\,\\textrm{cm}^{-2}$ for all $n$-layer RMG (with $n=2, 3, 4, 5, 6$) which\nare approximately described by $n$-order Dirac-fermion models. Most saliently,\nusing a more realistic modeling of bilayer graphene including trigonal warping\neffects, we find that an anomalous Hall crystal state with spontaneous\nquantized anomalous Hall conductivity would emerge when the carrier density is\nbelow $\\sim 1\\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}$, and it becomes the unique ground\nstate over trivial Wigner crystal when the density is further lower. Counter\nintuitively, such topological anomalous Hall crystal becomes more stable than\nthe trivial Wigner crystal due to the lower correlation energy gained from\ndynamical charge fluctuations, which is beyond mean-field description. Our work\nsuggests that slightly carrier-doped bilayer graphene is one of the most\npromising candidates to realize anomalous Hall crystal. Moreover, the method\ndeveloped in this work can be readily applied to other interacting 2D systems\nincluding moir\\'e superlattices.",

Existing graph sampling-enhanced\nFedGCN training approaches ignore graph structural information or dynamics of\noptimization, resulting in high variance and inaccurate node embeddings.

The\nproposed adaptive importance-based sampling method jointly considers the graph\nstructural heterogeneity and the optimization dynamics to achieve optimal\ntrade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Extensive evaluations against five\nstate-of-the-art baselines on five real-world graph datasets show that FedAIS\nachieves comparable or up to 3.23% higher test accuracy, while saving\ncommunication and computation costs by 91.77% and 85.59%.",

Its space usage, $O(r)$ where $r$ is the number of runs in the\nBurrows--Wheeler Transform of the text, is however higher than Lempel--Ziv (LZ)\nand grammar-based indexes, and makes it uninteresting in various real-life\nscenarios of milder repetitiveness. We introduce the $sr$-index, a variant that\nlimits the space to $O(\\min(r,n/s))$ for a text of length $n$ and a given\nparameter $s$, at the expense of multiplying by $s$ the time per occurrence\nreported. The $sr$-index is obtained subsampling the text positions indexed by\nthe $r$-index, being still able to support pattern matching with guaranteed\nperformance. Our experiments show that the theoretical analysis falls short in\ndescribing the practical advantages of the $sr$-index, because it performs much\nbetter on real texts than on synthetic ones: the $sr$-index retains the\nperformance of the $r$-index while using 1.5--4.0 times less space, sharply\noutperforming {\\em virtually every other} compressed index on repetitive texts\nin both time and space. Only a particular LZ-based index uses less space than\nthe $sr$-index, but it is an order of magnitude slower.\n  Our second contribution are the $r$-csa and $sr$-csa indexes. Just like the\n$r$-index adapts the well-known FM-Index to repetitive texts, the $r$-csa\nadapts Sadakane's Compressed Suffix Array (CSA) to this case. We show that the\nprinciples used on the $r$-index turn out to fit naturally and efficiently in\nthe CSA framework. The $sr$-csa is the corresponding subsampled version of the\n$r$-csa. While the CSA performs better than the FM-Index on classic texts with\nalphabets larger than DNA, we show that the $sr$-csa outperforms the $sr$-index\non repetitive texts over those larger alphabets and some DNA texts as well.",

This paper introduces TEERollup, an efficient\nrollup protocol that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to achieve\nboth low gas costs and short withdrawal delays.

    "abstract": "Mixed-effects regression models represent a useful subclass of regression\nmodels for grouped data; the introduction of random effects allows for the\ncorrelation between observations within each group to be conveniently captured\nwhen inferring the fixed effects. At a time where such regression models are\nbeing fit to increasingly large datasets with many groups, it is ideal if (a)\nthe time it takes to make the inferences scales linearly with the number of\ngroups and (b) the inference workload can be distributed across multiple\ncomputational nodes in a numerically stable way, if the dataset cannot be\nstored in one location. Current Bayesian inference approaches for mixed-effects\nregression models do not seem to account for both challenges simultaneously. To\naddress this, we develop an expectation propagation (EP) framework in this\nsetting that is both scalable and numerically stable when distributed for the\ncase where there is only one grouping factor. The main technical innovations\nlie in the sparse reparameterisation of the EP algorithm, and a moment\npropagation (MP) based refinement for multivariate random effect factor\napproximations. Experiments are conducted to show that this EP framework\nachieves linear scaling, while having comparable accuracy to other scalable\napproximate Bayesian inference (ABI) approaches.",

However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering\nthem susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example,\nrevealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations.\nHence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One\ncommonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work\nby Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and\naggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details,\nobfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was\nevaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and\nsubsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery\nattack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the\npreprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage\nstill exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also\nindicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We\nrelease all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible\nand, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing\na series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield\nhigher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future\nresearch in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online\nexecution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously\nconsidered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage.

    "abstract": "Charge layering in the close vicinity of charged interfaces is a well known\neffect, extensively reported in both experiments and simulations of Room\nTemperature Ionic Liquids (RTIL) and concentrated aqueous-like electrolytes.\nThe traditional Poisson-Fermi (PF) theory is able to successfully describe\novercrowding effects, but fails to reproduce charge ordering even in strong\ncoupling regimes. Simple models, yet capable to investigate the interplay\nbetween these important interfacial phenomena, are still lacking. In order to\nbridge this gap, we herein present a modified PF (mPF) approach which is able\nto capture layering effects in strong coupling regimes typical of RTIL. The\nmodification is based on the introduction of charge cavities around\ntest-particles, which simply extend the exclusion volume effects to also\nincorporate the accompanying depletion of charges due to particle insertion.\nAddition of this simple ingredient is shown to reproduce overscreening and\ncharge ordering, thereby extending the predictive power of the PF approach to\nstrong coupling regimes. Using a linear response theory, we are able to study\nthe emergence of charge ordering based on two characteristic lengths: a\nwavelength responsible by charge layering, along with a dumping length which\nscreens charge oscillations. At large ionic strengths and strong couplings, the\nsystem undergoes a transition to undumped charge layering. The transition takes\nplace when the poles of the Fourier components of the linear potential become\nreal-valued. This criteria allows one to identify the transition line across\nthe parameter space, thus delimiting the region of stability against unscreneed\ncharge ordering.",

    "abstract": "Human navigation is facilitated through the association of actions with\nlandmarks, tapping into our ability to recognize salient features in our\nenvironment. Consequently, navigational instructions for humans can be\nextremely concise, such as short verbal descriptions, indicating a small memory\nrequirement and no reliance on complex and overly accurate navigation tools.\nConversely, current autonomous navigation schemes rely on accurate positioning\ndevices and algorithms as well as extensive streams of sensory data collected\nfrom the environment. Inspired by this human capability and motivated by the\nassociated technological gap, in this work we propose a hierarchical end-to-end\nmeta-learning scheme that enables a mobile robot to navigate in a previously\nunknown environment upon presentation of only a few sample images of a set of\nlandmarks along with their corresponding high-level navigation actions. This\ndramatically simplifies the wayfinding process and enables easy adoption to new\nenvironments. For few-shot waypoint detection, we implement a metric-based\nfew-shot learning technique through distribution embedding. Waypoint detection\ntriggers the multi-task low-level maneuver controller module to execute the\ncorresponding high-level navigation action. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe scheme using a small-scale autonomous vehicle on novel indoor navigation\ntasks in several previously unseen environments.",
