In\nthis letter, we reveal the formation of CDWs in the newly discovered kagome\nmetal LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. We observe a precursor CDW correlation that features a\n\"yield sign\"-like hollow triangle diffuse scattering pattern and nearly\ncomplete softening of a flat optical phonon band near Q$_H$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/2).\nThe scattering intensity of the precursor CDW displays divergent behavior as\ndecreasing temperature until T$_{CDW}$=70 K, where a competing CDW at\nQ$_{CDW}$=(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) emerges. Using scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy/spectroscopy, we image the frustrated CDW patterns that show a short\nphase coherence length about ~20 nm in real space. Combined with first\nprinciples calculations, our observations support frustrated lattice\ninteractions that are modulated by the FS topology.

Multi-Document Summarization (MDS), a fundamental task in NLG,\npresents unique challenges by requiring models to extract and synthesize\nessential information across multiple lengthy documents. Unlike reasoning\ntasks, MDS demands a more nuanced approach to prompt design and ensemble\nmethods, as no single \"best\" prompt can satisfy diverse summarization\nrequirements. We propose a novel framework leveraging test-time scaling for\nMDS. Our approach employs prompt ensemble techniques to generate multiple\ncandidate summaries using various prompts, then combines them with an\naggregator to produce a refined summary. To evaluate our method effectively, we\nalso introduce two new LLM-based metrics: the Consistency-Aware Preference\n(CAP) score and LLM Atom-Content-Unit (LLM-ACU) score, which assess summary\nquality while addressing the positional bias inherent in traditional automatic\nevaluation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework\nsignificantly enhances summary quality while also revealing the practical\nscaling boundaries to MDS tasks.",

While these reasoning strategies have\ndemonstrated effectiveness across various challenging language or vision tasks,\ntheir applicability and impact on time-series forecasting (TSF), particularly\nthe challenging zero-shot TSF, remain largely unexplored. In particular, it is\nunclear whether zero-shot TSF benefits from reasoning and, if so, what types of\nreasoning strategies are most effective. To bridge this gap, we propose ReC4TS,\nthe first benchmark that systematically evaluates the effectiveness of popular\nreasoning strategies when applied to zero-shot TSF tasks. ReC4TS conducts\ncomprehensive evaluations across datasets spanning eight domains, covering both\nunimodal and multimodal with short-term and longterm forecasting tasks. More\nimportantly, ReC4TS provides key insights: (1) Self-consistency emerges as the\nmost effective test-time reasoning strategy; (2) Group-relative policy\noptimization emerges as a more suitable approach for incentivizing reasoning\nability during post-training; (3) Multimodal TSF benefits more from reasoning\nstrategies compared to unimodal TSF.

Current verification methods typically rely\non analyzing the generated output to determine the source model. However, these\ntechniques are susceptible to adversarial attacks, operate in a post-hoc\nmanner, and may require access to the model weights to inject a verifiable\nfingerprint. In this paper, we propose a novel passive and non-invasive\nfingerprinting technique that operates in real-time and remains effective even\nunder encrypted network traffic conditions. Our method leverages the intrinsic\nautoregressive generation nature of language models, which generate text one\ntoken at a time based on all previously generated tokens, creating a unique\ntemporal pattern like a rhythm or heartbeat that persists even when the output\nis streamed over a network. We find that measuring the Inter-Token Times\n(ITTs)-time intervals between consecutive tokens-can identify different\nlanguage models with high accuracy. We develop a Deep Learning (DL) pipeline to\ncapture these timing patterns using network traffic analysis and evaluate it on\n16 Small Language Models (SLMs) and 10 proprietary LLMs across different\ndeployment scenarios, including local host machine (GPU/CPU), Local Area\nNetwork (LAN), Remote Network, and Virtual Private Network (VPN).

In certain quantum gravity theories and\nsemi-classical frameworks, black holes (or other exotic compact objects)\nexhibit reflective properties that cause quasi-normal modes of a binary merger\nwaveform to partially reflect off the horizon. If these reflections reach the\ndetector, the measured gravitational wave signal may show echo-like features\nfollowing the initial ringdown phase.

However, since most tasks\ninvolve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals\nmay suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a\nnovel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect,\nlow-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples\nthe backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error\nsignal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We\nbegin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms\nthe foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear,\nconvolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that\neven minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can\nachieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore,\nour rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have\npreviously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error.\nThis breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate\nmodels of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on\nhigh-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings\nsuggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as\nhigh-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in\nhigh-dimensional systems.

    "abstract": "We study the coverage properties of full conformal regression in the\nproportional asymptotic regime where the ratio of the dimension and the sample\nsize converges to a constant. In this setting, existing theory tells us only\nthat full conformal inference is unbiased, in the sense that its average\ncoverage lies at the desired level when marginalized over both the new test\npoint and the training data. Considerably less is known about the behaviour of\nthese methods conditional on the training set. As a result, the exact benefits\nof full conformal inference over much simpler alternative methods is unclear.\nThis paper investigates the behaviour of full conformal inference and natural\nuncorrected alternatives for a broad class of $L_2$-regularized linear\nregression models. We show that in the proportional asymptotic regime the\ntraining-conditional coverage of full conformal inference concentrates at the\ntarget value. On the other hand, simple alternatives that directly compare test\nand training residuals realize constant undercoverage bias. While these results\ndemonstrate the necessity of full conformal in correcting for high-dimensional\noverfitting, we also show that this same methodology is redundant for the\nrelated task of tuning the regularization level. In particular, we show that\nfull conformal inference still yields asymptotically valid coverage when the\nregularization level is selected using only the training set, without\nconsideration of the test point. Simulations show that our asymptotic\napproximations are accurate in finite samples and can be readily extended to\nother popular full conformal variants, such as full conformal quantile\nregression and the LASSO, that do not directly meet our assumptions.",

For bond lifetimes shorter than the chain\nend-to-end relaxation time, the polymers exhibit essentially Rouse like\ndynamics, but with an apparently increased local friction relative to the\nnon-sticky analog. For longer bond lifetimes, the chains exhibit two modes of\nrelaxation: the faster mode is independent of bond lifetime, but the slower\nmode is controlled by it. However, these slower mode results are not consistent\nwith the predictions of the sticky Rouse model.

PFformer integrates two novel embedding strategies: Enhanced\nFeature-based Embedding (EFE) and Auto-Encoder-based Embedding (AEE). EFE\neffectively encodes inter-variable dependencies by mapping related sequence\nsubsets to high-dimensional spaces without positional constraints, enhancing\nthe encoder's functionality. PFformer shows superior forecasting accuracy\nwithout the traditional limitations of positional encoding in MTS modeling. We\nevaluated PFformer across four challenging datasets, focusing on two key\nforecasting scenarios: long sequence prediction for 3 days ahead and rolling\npredictions every four hours to reflect real-time decision-making processes in\nwater management.

This framework treats an LVLM as a hypothesis\ngenerator, where each generated text detail (or claim) is considered an\nindividual hypothesis. It then applies a statistical hypothesis testing\nprocedure to verify each claim using efficient heuristic uncertainty measures\nto filter out unreliable claims before returning any responses to users. We\nconduct extensive experiments covering three representative application\ndomains, including general scene understanding, medical radiology report\ngeneration, and document understanding. Remarkably, ConfLVLM reduces the error\nrate of claims generated by LLaVa-1.5 for scene descriptions from 87.8\\% to\n10.0\\% by filtering out erroneous claims with a 95.3\\% true positive rate. Our\nresults further demonstrate that ConfLVLM is highly flexible, and can be\napplied to any black-box LVLMs paired with any uncertainty measure for any\nimage-conditioned free-form text generation task while providing a rigorous\nguarantee on controlling the risk of hallucination.",

Our decoding technique is compatible with a wide range of quantum\nerror correction codes and general logical circuits. Using this decoder, we\nidentify strategies for detecting and correcting atom loss based on the logical\ncircuit structure. For deep circuits with a large number of gate layers prior\nto logical measurements, we explore methods to integrate loss detection into\nsyndrome extraction with minimal overhead, identifying optimal strategies\ndepending on the qubit loss fraction in the noise. In contrast, many\nalgorithmic subroutines involve frequent gate teleportation, shortening the\ncircuit depth before logical measurement and naturally replacing qubits without\nadditional overhead. We simulate such a teleportation-based algorithm,\ninvolving a toy model for small-angle synthesis and find a significant\nimprovement in logical error rates as the loss fraction increases, with loss\nhandled solely through teleportation.

We turn it into a naturally exact, local\nsymmetry by coupling the quantum number $B-L$ to an Abelian gauge field. Gauge\nanomalies are cancelled by adding right-handed neutrinos $\\nu_R$, which are not\nsterile in this case. Therefore the usual Majorana term is forbidden by gauge\nsymmetry, but we arrange for a $\\nu_R$-mass by adding a Higgs-type 1-component\ncomplex scalar field. Thus we arrive at a modest, well-motivated extension of\nthe Standard Model.\n  In this framework, we investigate the field equations in the extended\ngauge-Higgs sector, involving both Higgs fields and the non-standard U(1) gauge\nfield. They are given by a set of coupled, non-linear differential equations,\nwhich we solve numerically, focusing on the structures of cosmic strings. For a\nvariety of parameters, we identify the string profiles and energy densities,\nassuming appropriate boundary conditions. In particular, these profiles depend\non the winding number of each of the Higgs fields. As an amazing peculiarity,\nwe discover -- for high winding numbers -- ``overshooting'' and ``co-axial''\nsolutions; in the latter case, the profile of the standard Higgs field changes\nits sign near the core of the cosmic string.",

It\nis found that their extreme X-ray variability can be ascribed to changing\naccretion state or changing obscuration from dust-free absorbers. For five\nAGNs, their X-ray variability is attributed to changing accretion state,\nsupported by contemporaneous multiwavelength variability and the absence of\nX-ray absorption in the low-state spectra. With new Multiple Mirror Telescope\n(MMT) spectra for four of these sources, we confirm one changing-look AGN. One\nMMT AGN lacks multi-epoch spectroscopic observations, while the other two AGNs\ndo not exhibit changing-look behavior, likely because the MMT observations did\nnot capture their high states. The X-ray variability of the other three AGNs is\nexplained by changing obscuration, and they show only mild long-term optical/IR\nvariability.

    "abstract": "Type classes are a popular tool for implementing generic algorithms and data\nstructures without loss of efficiency, bridging the gap between parametric and\nad-hoc polymorphism. Since their initial development in Haskell, they now\nfeature prominently in numerous other industry-ready programming languages,\nnotably including Swift, Rust, and Scala. The success of type classes hinges in\nlarge part on the compilers' ability to infer arguments to implicit parameters\nby means of a type-directed resolution. This technique, sometimes dubbed\n**implicit programming**, lets users elide information that the language\nimplementation can deduce from the context, such as the implementation of a\nparticular type class.\n  One drawback of implicit programming is that a type-directed resolution may\nyield ambiguous results, thereby threatening coherence, the property that valid\nprograms have exactly one meaning. This issue has divided the community on the\nright approach to address it. One side advocates for flexibility where implicit\nresolution is context-sensitive and often relies on dependent typing features\nto uphold soundness. The other holds that context should not stand in the way\nof equational reasoning and typically imposes that type class instances be\nunique across the entire program to fend off ambiguities.\n  Although there exists a large body of work on type classes and implicit\nprogramming, most of the scholarly literature focuses on a few select languages\nand offers little insight into other mainstream projects. Meanwhile, the latter\nhave evolved similar features and/or restrictions under different names, making\nit difficult for language users and designers to get a sense of the full design\nspace. To alleviate this issue, we set to examine Swift, Rust, and Scala, three\npopular languages featuring type classes heavily, and relate their approach to\ncoherence to Haskell's. It turns out that, beyond superficial syntactic\ndifferences, Swift, Rust, and Haskell are actually strikingly similar in that\nthe three languages offer comparable strategies to work around the limitations\nof the uniqueness of type class instances.",

    "abstract": "Context: Developers have come to appreciate the simplicity of message-passing\nactors for concurrent programming tasks. The actor model of computation is easy\nto grasp; it is just a conversation among actors with a common goal.\nImportantly, it eliminates some basic pitfalls of the dominant shared-memory\nmodel, most critically data races.\n  Inquiry: A close look at real-world conversations suggests, however, that\nthey are not mere exchanges of messages. Participants must keep in mind\nconversational context, and participants joining late can and often must\nacquire some of this context. In addition, some settings call for engaging in\nseveral conversations in parallel; in others, participants conduct temporarily\nlimited sub-conversations to clarify a point. Existing actor code exhibits\ncomplex design patterns that get around the underlying limitations of the pure\nmessage-passing model.\n  Approach: These patterns suggest a number of elements involved in programming\nconversational computations. Translated into terms of language design, they\ncall for two kinds of facilities: (1) one for sharing conversational context\nand (2) another one for organizing individual actors around on-going\nconversations and their contexts.\n  Knowledge: This paper presents Syndicate, a language designed to directly\nsupport the programming of conversing actors. Beyond message passing, it\nsupplies (1) a dataspace, which allows actors to make public assertions, to\nwithdraw them, and to query what other actors have asserted; and (2) the facet\nnotation, which enables programmers to express individual actors as a\nreflection of the on-going conversations.\n  Grounding: A worked example introduces these concepts and illustrates\nconversational programming in Syndicate. A comparison with other research and\nindustrial concurrent languages demonstrates the unique support Syndicate\nprovides.\n  Importance: Syndicate advances concurrent actor programming with enhancements\nthat address some observed limitations of the underlying model. While\nmessage-passing simplifies concurrent programming, it falls short in handling\nthe complexities of actual computational conversations. By introducing a\ndataspace actor for sharing conversational context and the facet notation for\norganizing actors around ongoing conversations, Syndicate enables developers to\nnaturally express and manage the nuanced interactions often required in\nconcurrent systems. These innovations reduce the need for complex design\npatterns and provide unique support for building robust, context-aware\nconcurrent applications.",

As the leading material in\nthin-film solar technology, cadmium telluride (CdTe) faces challenges from\nsurface reflective losses across the solar spectrum and weak absorption in the\nnear-infrared (NIR) range. This computational study addresses these limitations\nby employing a dual light trapping technique: the top surfaces of both the CdS\nand CdTe layers are tapered as nanocones (NCs), while germanium (Ge) spherical\nnanoparticles (NPs) are embedded within the CdTe absorber layer to enhance\nbroadband absorption.

These frameworks distribute their applications\nover a cluster in order to scale horizontally along with the amount of incoming\ndata.\n  Inquiry: Crucial for the performance of such applications is the\n**distribution strategy** that is used to partition data and computations over\nthe cluster nodes. In some DSPFs, like Apache Spark or Flink, the distribution\nstrategy is hardwired into the framework which can lead to inefficient\napplications. The other end of the spectrum is offered by Apache Storm, which\noffers a low-level model wherein programmers can implement their own\ndistribution strategies on a per-application basis to improve efficiency.\nHowever, this model conflates distribution and data processing logic, making it\ndifficult to modify either.

    "abstract": "As software grows increasingly complex, the quantity and diversity of\nconcerns to be addressed also rises. To answer this diversity of concerns,\ndevelopers may end up using multiple programming languages in a single software\nproject, a practice known as polyglot programming. This practice has gained\nmomentum with the rise of execution platforms capable of supporting polyglot\nsystems. However, despite this momentum, there is a notable lack of development\ntooling support for developers working on polyglot programs, such as in\ndebugging facilities. Not all polyglot execution platforms provide debugging\ncapabilities, and for those that do, implementing support for new languages can\nbe costly.\n  This paper addresses this gap by introducing a novel debugger framework that\nis language-agnostic yet leverages existing language-specific debuggers. The\nproposed framework is dynamically extensible to accommodate the evolving\ncombination of languages used in polyglot software development. It utilizes the\nDebug Adapter Protocol (DAP) to integrate and coordinate existing debuggers\nwithin a debugging session. We found that using our approach, we were able to\nimplement polyglot debugging support for three different languages with little\ndevelopment effort. We also found that our debugger did not introduce an\noverhead significant enough to hinder debugging tasks in many scenarios;\nhowever performance did deteriorate with the amount of polyglot calls, making\nthe approach not suitable for every polyglot program structure. The\neffectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through the development of a\nprototype, PolyDebug, and its application to use cases involving C, JavaScript,\nand Python. We evaluated PolyDebug on a dataset of traditional benchmark\nprograms, modified to fit our criteria of polyglot programs. We also assessed\nthe development effort by measuring the source lines of code (SLOC) for the\nprototype as a whole as well as its components. Debugging is a fundamental part\nof developing and maintaining software. Lack of debug tools can lead to\ndifficulty in locating software bugs and slow down the development process.

Moreover, each kind of data structure\ntypically comes with a variety of implementations that focus on scalability,\nmemory efficiency, performance, thread-safety, or similar aspects. Choosing the\n*right* data structure for a particular use case can be difficult or even\nimpossible if the data structure is part of a framework over which the user has\nno control.

We present an approach to automatically replace\ndata structures in Java applications. We use profiling to determine\nallocation-site-specific metrics about data structures and their usages, and\nthen automatically replace their allocations with customized versions, focusing\non memory efficiency. Our approach is integrated into GraalVM Native Image, an\nAhead-of-Time compiler for Java applications. By analyzing the generated data\nstructure profiles, we show how standard benchmarks and microservice-based\napplications use data structures and demonstrate the impact of customized data\nstructures on the memory usage of applications.

We argue that our work demonstrates that\nchoosing appropriate data structures can reduce the memory usage of\napplications. While acknowledge that our approach does not provide benefits for\nall kinds of workloads, our work nevertheless shows how automated profiling and\nreplacement can be used to optimize data structures in general.

    "abstract": "Context: Many systems require receiving data from multiple information\nsources, which act as distributed network devices that asynchronously send the\nlatest data at their own pace to generalize various kinds of devices and\nconnections, known as the Internet of Things (IoT). These systems often perform\ncomputations both **reactively** and **retroactively** on information received\nfrom the sources for monitoring and analytical purposes, respectively.\n  Inquiry: It is challenging to design a programming language that can describe\nsuch systems at a high level of abstraction for two reasons: (1) reactive and\nretroactive computations in these systems are performed alongside the execution\nof other application logic; and (2) information sources may be distributed, and\ndata from these sources may arrive late or be lost entirely. Addressing these\ndifficulties is our fundamental problem.\n  Approach: We propose a programming language that supports the following\nfeatures. First, our language incorporates reactive time-varying values (also\nknown as signals) embedded within an imperative language. Second, it supports\nmultiple information sources that are distributed and represented as signals,\nmeaning they can be declaratively composed to form other time-varying values.\nFinally, it allows computation over past values collected from information\nsources and recovery from inconsistency caused by packet loss. To address the\naforementioned difficulties, we develop a core calculus for this proposed\nlanguage.\n  Knowledge: This calculus is a hybrid of reactive/retroactive computations and\nimperative ones. Because of this hybrid nature, the calculus is inherently\ncomplex; however, we have simplified it as much as possible.

    "abstract": "A gradual type system allows developers to declare certain types to be\nenforced by the compiler (i.e., statically typed), while leaving other types to\nbe enforced via runtime checks (i.e., dynamically typed). When runtime checks\nfail, debugging gradually typed programs becomes cumbersome, because these\nfailures may arise far from the original point where an inconsistent type\nassumption is made. To ease this burden on developers, some gradually typed\nlanguages produce a blame report for a given type inconsistency. However, these\nreports are sometimes misleading, because they might point to program points\nthat do not need to be changed to stop the error.\n  To overcome the limitations of blame reports, we propose using dynamic\nprogram slicing as an alternative approach to help programmers debug run-time\ntype errors. We describe a proof-of-concept for TypeSlicer, a tool that would\npresent dynamic program slices to developers when a runtime check fails. We\nperformed a Wizard-of-Oz user study to investigate how developers respond to\ndynamic program slices through a set of simulated interactions with TypeScript\nprograms. This formative study shows that developers can understand and apply\ndynamic slice information to provide change recommendations when debugging\nruntime type errors.",

In this work, we present a fine-grained analysis of the learning\ndynamics of (deep) linear networks (DLNs) within the deep matrix factorization\nloss beyond EOS. For DLNs, loss oscillations beyond EOS follow a\nperiod-doubling route to chaos. We theoretically analyze the regime of the\n2-period orbit and show that the loss oscillations occur within a small\nsubspace, with the dimension of the subspace precisely characterized by the\nlearning rate. The crux of our analysis lies in showing that the\nsymmetry-induced conservation law for gradient flow, defined as the balancing\ngap among the singular values across layers, breaks at EOS and decays\nmonotonically to zero. Overall, our results contribute to explaining two key\nphenomena in deep networks: (i) shallow models and simple tasks do not always\nexhibit EOS; and (ii) oscillations occur within top features. We present\nexperiments to support our theory, along with examples demonstrating how these\nphenomena occur in nonlinear networks and how they differ from those which have\nbenign landscape such as in DLNs.",

With the technology, multiple versions of one software system can\nco-exist and exchange data even when the system's data structure evolves along\nwith versions.\n  Inquiry: While there have been developed MSVDM theories and implementations\nfor relational databases, they are not directly applicable to persistent\nobjects. Since persistent objects are commonly implemented by means of\nobject-relational mapping (OR-mapping), we need a right level of abstraction in\norder to describe evolution of data structures and translate data accesses in\nbetween different versions.\n  Approach: We propose a new evolution language consisting of a set of\nevolution operations, each denoting a modification of the source code and\nimplicitly defining the corresponding modification to the database schema.\nGiven the existence of multiple mapping mechanisms from persistent objects to\ndatabases, we designed the evolution language at two levels. At the abstract\nlevel, it handles scenarios such as refactoring and adding classes and fields.\nAt the concrete level, we provide definitions for different mapping mechanisms\nseparately, leveraging the existing database evolution language that supports\nMSVDM.\n  Knowledge: Our evolution language is designed to support existing evolution\noperations proposed in prior work.

Using our proposal, two concrete mapping mechanisms,\nnamely, a JPA-like mapping and signal classes, can be provided separately.\nFurthermore, our evolution language preserves program behavior and covers\ncommon evolution operations in practice.\n  Grounding: This work is supported by the formal definition of both the target\nabstract core language and the proposed evolution language, the formulation of\nseveral theorems demonstrating the soundness of our proposals, and the proofs\nof these theorems. Additionally, an empirical study was conducted to\ninvestigate the evolution histories of three open-source projects.\n  Importance: To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first evolution\nlanguage for persistent objects that supports MSVDM.

    "abstract": "Human-computer dialog plays a prominent role in interactions conducted at\nkiosks (e.g., withdrawing money from an atm or filling your car with gas), on\nsmartphones (e.g., installing and configuring apps), and on the web (e.g.,\nbooking a flight). Some human-computer dialogs involve an exchange of\nsystem-initiated and user-initiated actions. These dialogs are called\n*mixed-initiative dialogs* and sometimes also involve the pursuit of multiple\ninterleaved sub-dialogs, which are woven together in a manner akin to\ncoroutines. However, existing dialog-authoring languages have difficulty\nexpressing these dialogs concisely. In this work, we improve the expressiveness\nof a dialog-authoring language we call *dialog specification language* (dsl),\nwhich is based on the programming concepts of functional application, partial\nfunction application, currying, and partial evaluation, by augmenting it with\nadditional abstractions to support concise specification of task-based,\nmixed-initiative dialogs that resemble concurrently executing coroutines. We\nalso formalize the semantics of dsl -- the process of simplifying and staging\nsuch dialogs specified in the language. We demonstrate that dialog\nspecifications are compressed by to a higher degree when written in dsl using\nthe new abstractions. We also operationalize the formal semantics of dsl in a\nHaskell functional programming implementation. The Haskell implementation of\nthe simplification/staging rules provides a proof of concept that the formal\nsemantics are sufficient to implement a dialog system specified with the\nlanguage. We evaluate dsl from practical (i.e., case study), conceptual (i.e.,\ncomparisons to similar systems such as VoiceXML and State Chart XML), and\ntheoretical perspectives. The practical applicability of the new language\nabstractions introduced in this work is demonstrated in a case study by using\nit to model portions of an online food ordering system that can be concurrently\nstaged. Our results indicate that dsl enables concise representation of dialogs\ncomposed of multiple concurrent sub-dialogs and improves the compression of\ndialog expressions reported in prior research. We anticipate that the extension\nof our language and the formalization of the semantics can facilitate concise\nspecification and smooth implementation of task-based, mixed-initiative,\nhuman-computer dialog systems across various domains such as atms and\ninteractive, voice-response systems.",

GuideLM has been integrated into the Debugging C\nCompiler (DCC), an educational C compiler that leverages LLMs to generate\npedagogically sound error explanations. Previously, DCC relied on off-the-shelf\nOpenAI models, which, while accurate, often over-assisted students by directly\nproviding solutions despite contrary prompting.\n  To address this, we employed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of 528\nstudent-question/teacher-answer pairs, creating two models: GuideLM and\nGuideLM-mini, fine-tuned on ChatGPT-4o and 4o-mini, respectively.

Over the last\nfew decades, a large number of libraries using different approaches have been\ndeveloped for this purpose.\n  Inquiry: Prior work in introductory programming that uses graphics as input\nand output has shown positive results in terms of engagement, but research is\nscarce on whether learners are able to use programming concepts learned through\ngraphics for programming in other domains, transferring what they have learned.\n  Approach: We conducted a randomized, controlled experiment with 145 students\nas participants divided into two groups. Both groups programmed using graphics\nin Python, but used different approaches: one group used a compositional\ngraphics library named PyTamaro; the other used the Turtle graphics library\nfrom Python's standard library. Student engagement was assessed with surveys,\nand programming knowledge with a post-test on general programming concepts and\nprogramming tasks in the domain of graphics.\n  Knowledge: We find few differences between the two groups on the post-test,\ndespite the PyTamaro group having practiced on problems isomorphic to those in\nthe post-test. The participants traced a compositional graphics program more\naccurately than a 'comparable' turtle graphics program. Both groups report high\nengagement and perceived learning; both perform well on simple program-writing\ntasks to create graphics.\n  Grounding: Our findings are based on a controlled experiment with a count of\n145 participants, which exceeds the sample size indicated by power analysis to\ndetect a medium effect size.

Compositional graphics code appears to be easier\nto trace than turtle graphics code. As for conceptual knowledge, our results\nindicate that practicing on programming tasks isomorphic to those of the test\ncan still not be enough to achieve better transfer.

Garbage collection is a key aspect of memory management in programming\nlanguages like Java, but it often competes with application threads for CPU\ntime, leading to delays in processing requests and consequent increases in\nlatency. This work explores if opportunistic scheduling in ZGC, a fully\nconcurrent garbage collector (GC), can reduce application latency on\nmiddle-range CPU utilization, a topical deployment, and potentially delay\nhorizontal scaling. We implemented an opportunistic scheduling that schedules\nGC threads during periods when CPU resources would otherwise be idle. This\nmethod prioritizes application threads over GC workers when it matters most,\nallowing the system to handle higher workloads without increasing latency. Our\nfindings show that this technique can significantly improve performance in\nserver applications.

Additionally, applications like Hazelcast showed a mean\nlatency reduction of up to 40% compared to ZGC without opportunistic\nscheduling. The feasibility and effectiveness of this approach were validated\nthrough empirical testing on two widely used benchmarks, showing that the\nmethod consistently improves performance under various workloads.

We\nprovide an analysis to characterize this aspect and propose a solution.\nFinally, we discuss implications for theoretical science as well as for the\ndevelopment of quantum technologies.",

In both cases, we employ a\nspacetime foliation given in terms of compactified hyperboloidal slices. These\nslices intersect future null infinity, so our method is well-suited to study\nthe long-time behaviour of waves. Moreover, our construction is adapted to the\npresence of the time--dependent scale factor that describes the underlying\nspacetime expansion. First, we investigate decay rates for solutions to the\nlinear wave equation in a large class of expanding FLRW spacetimes, whose\nnon--compact spatial sections have either zero or negative curvature. By means\nof a hyperboloidal foliation, we provide new numerical evidence for the\nsharpness of decay--in--time estimates for linear waves propagating in such\nspacetimes. Then, in the spatially-flat case, we present numerical results in\nsupport of small data global existence of solutions to semi-linear wave\nequations in FLRW spacetimes having a decelerated expansion, provided that a\ngeneralized null condition holds. In absence of this null condition and in the\nspecific case of $ \\square_g \\phi = (\\partial_t \\phi)^2 $ (Fritz John's\nchoice), the results we obtain suggest that, when the spacetime expansion is\nsufficiently slow, solutions diverge in finite time for every choice of initial\ndata.",

However, a theoretical understanding of transfer\nlearning between GIAA and PIAA, particularly concerning the impact of group\ncomposition, group size, aesthetic differences between groups and individuals,\nand demographic correlations, is lacking. This work establishes a theoretical\nfoundation for IAA, proposing a unified model that encodes individual\ncharacteristics in a distributional format for both individual and group\nassessments.

Experiments with varying group\ncompositions, including sub-sampling by group size and disjoint demographics,\nreveal significant performance variation even for GIAA, indicating that mean\nscores do not fully eliminate individual subjectivity. Performance variations\nand Gini index analysis reveal education as the primary factor influencing\naesthetic differences, followed by photography and art experience, with\nstronger individual subjectivity observed in artworks than in photos.

These plasmons can be guided and controlled by plasmonic waveguides,\nwhich can be created by patterning different materials or by structuring the\ndielectric environment. We have constructed a semi-analytical theory to\ndescribe plasmonic waveguides, and, more generally, plasmons in spatially\ninhomogeneous systems. Our theory employs techniques from semiclassical\nanalysis, and is therefore applicable when the electron wavelength is much\nsmaller than the characteristic length scale of changes in the system\nparameters. We obtain an effective classical Hamiltonian that describes the\ndynamics of quantum plasmons, given by the Lindhard function with spatially\nvarying parameters. Adding the wave-like character of the plasmons to the\nclassical trajectories generated by this Hamiltonian, we find two different\nmechanisms for waveguiding. In the first case, a localized plasmonic state\narises due to total internal reflection similar to photonic waveguides. The\nsecond mechanism relies on a varying dielectric environment, which locally\nmodifies the screening of the electrons. Here, a quasi-localized state arises\ndue to local changes in the amplitude of the plasmonic excitation. Our results\nprovide a solid basis to understand previous numerical studies.",

The study identifies 77\nmassive young stellar object (MYSO) candidates in and around the three regions.\nSgr B2 appears to host the youngest MYSOs and have much higher extinction than\nthe other regions, containing several radio sources not detected in the\nmid-infrared even at 37 microns. Meanwhile, cm radio continuum regions of Sgr\nB1 shows remarkable correspondence to its mid-infrared emission. Sgr C has\nfewer confirmed MYSOs, and seems to have a higher fraction of low-mass young\nstellar objects and contamination from more evolved interloper/foreground\nstars. Derived MYSO densities are consistent with GHII regions elsewhere in the\nGalactic plane, though the CMZ GHII regions appear to have less prolific\npresent star formation overall. Unlike Sgr B2, the cm continuum emission in Sgr\nB1 and Sgr C GHII regions appears to be absent cold dust and molecular gas,\nsuggesting environmental differences, possibly driven by turbulence and rapid\ndynamical changes near the Galactic Center. Furthermore, unlike typical GHII\nregions, Sgr B1 and Sgr C are significantly ionized by evolved interloper\nstars, which likely did not form within these regions. In these ways, Sgr B1\nand Sgr C deviate from classical GHII region behavior, thus potentially\nrepresenting a new category of GHII region or challenging their classification\nas GHII regions.",

Consequently, LLMs have made\nsignificant strides in processing and integrating multimodal information.\nHowever, even though human personas can be expressed in both text and image,\nthe extent to which the modality of a persona impacts the embodiment by the LLM\nremains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate how do different\nmodalities influence the expressiveness of personas in multimodal LLMs. To this\nend, we create a novel modality-parallel dataset of 40 diverse personas varying\nin age, gender, occupation, and location. This consists of four modalities to\nequivalently represent a persona: image-only, text-only, a combination of image\nand small text, and typographical images, where text is visually stylized to\nconvey persona-related attributes. We then create a systematic evaluation\nframework with 60 questions and corresponding metrics to assess how well LLMs\nembody each persona across its attributes and scenarios. Comprehensive\nexperiments on $5$ multimodal LLMs show that personas represented by detailed\ntext show more linguistic habits, while typographical images often show more\nconsistency with the persona.

Further work is therefore needed to understand the atmospheres of\nthese planets, starting with observing a larger sample. To this end, we present\nthe 3-5 micron transmission spectrum of TOI-776 c, a warm (Teq ~420 K), ~2\nRearth, ~7 Mearth planet orbiting an M1V star, measured with JWST\nNIRSpec/G395H. By combining two visits, we measure a median transit precision\nof ~18 ppm and ~32 ppm in the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, respectively. We compare\nthe transmission spectrum to both non-physical and physical models, and find no\nstrong evidence for molecular features. For cloud-top pressures larger than\n10^-3 bar, we rule out atmospheric metallicities less than 180-240x solar\n(depending on the reduction and modeling technique), which corresponds to a\nmean molecular weight of ~6-8 g/mol. However, we find simple atmosphere mixture\nmodels (H2O+H2/He or CO2+H2/He) give more pessimistic constraints, and caution\nthat mean molecular weight inferences are model dependent. We compare TOI-776 c\nto the similar planet TOI-270 d, and discuss possible options for further\nconstraining TOI-776 c's atmospheric composition. Overall, we suggest these\nTOI-776 c observations may represent a combination of planetary and stellar\nparameters that fall just below the threshold of detectable features in small\nplanet spectra; finding this boundary is one of the main goals of the COMPASS\nprogram.",

In this work, we investigate the impact of certain data\ndistributional properties, as inductive biases for the SG ability of a\nmulti-modal language model.

Third, latent intervention, where\na particular latent factor is altered randomly during training. We find that\nall three factors significantly enhance SG, with diversity contributing an 89%\nabsolute increase in accuracy in the most affected property. Through a series\nof experiments, we test various hypotheses to understand why these properties\npromote SG. Finally, we find that Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between\nlatent attributes in the training distribution is strongly predictive of\nout-of-distribution generalization. We find that a mechanism by which lower NMI\ninduces SG is in the geometry of representations. In particular, we find that\nNMI induces more parallelism in neural representations (i.e., input features\ncoded in parallel neural vectors) of the model, a property related to the\ncapacity of reasoning by analogy.",

    "abstract": "Software development depends on the use of libraries whose specifications\nconstrain the client's code and impose obligations on the implementation. It\nfollows that any approach to verification at scale must also be modular, while\npermitting specification of both behavior and cost. Hoare's notion of an\nabstraction function provides an elegant and effective methodology for such\nverifications, separating the implementation from the abstraction, and using an\nabstraction function to demonstrate the behavioral correctness of the former\nrelative to the latter.\n  For all of its influence, much of the Hoare methodology remains informal in\nthat it relies on conventional separation between implementation and\nabstraction, and provides no linguistic support for ensuring that these\nconventions are obeyed. The purpose of this paper is to propose a synthetic\naccount of Hoare's methodology within univalent dependent type theory based on\nthe principle that all types have abstract and concrete aspects by regarding\nabstraction functions as types, and thus enjoy the full range of typing\nconstructs found in dependent type theory. Achieving this relies crucially on\nthe notion of a phase distinction in type theory which gives rise to modalities\nthat isolate, or fracture, a type into its concrete and abstract parts, and\nthat permit the definition of a type given these aspects using a technique\ncalled gluing. Moreover, this approach scales to permit the specification and\nverification of the cost of programs, as well as their behavior, allowing\nclients to verify their own cost relative to these specifications and permit\nthe implementor to realize them with tighter bounds. The resulting theory\nsupports modular development of programs and proofs in a manner that hides\ntechnical details of no concern to clients while permitting precise\nspecifications of both the cost and behavior of programs.",

At high altitudes, the MRI-active wind merges with\nthe laminar disk wind, leaving only the jet and disk wind as distinct\ncomponents. The jet is powered by a novel mechanism in the star formation\ncontext: a lightly mass-loaded outflow driven by toroidal magnetic pressure in\nthe low-density polar funnel near the system's rotation axis. A geometric\nanalysis of the magnetic field structure confirms that magnetic tension does\nnot contribute to the outflow acceleration, with magnetic pressure acting as\nthe dominant driver. While the outflow in our model shares similarities with\nthe magneto-centrifugal model-such as angular momentum extraction from the\naccreting disk-centrifugal forces play a negligible role in jet acceleration.\nIn particular, the flow near the jet base does not satisfy the conditions for\nmagneto-centrifugal wind launching. Additionally, the jet in our simulation\nexhibits strong spatial and temporal variability. These differences challenge\nthe applicability of rotation-outflow velocity relations derived from\nsteady-state, axisymmetric magneto-centrifugal jet models for estimating the\njet's launching radius.

However, the growing prominence of proprietary,\nalgorithmically curated feeds has concealed what factors influence the\npresentation of content on social media feeds and how that presentation affects\nuser behavior. This lack of transparency can be detrimental to users, from\nreducing users' agency over their content consumption to the propagation of\nmisinformation and toxic content. To uncover details about how these feeds\noperate and influence user behavior, we conduct an empirical audit of Reddit's\nalgorithmically curated trending feed called r/popular. Using 10K r/popular\nposts collected by taking snapshots of the feed over 11 months, we find that\nrecent comments help a post remain on r/popular longer and climb the feed. We\nalso find that posts below rank 80 correspond to a sharp decline in activity\ncompared to posts above. When examining the effects of having a higher\nproportion of undesired behavior -- i.e., moderator-removed and toxic comments\n-- we find no significant evidence that it helps posts stay on r/popular for\nlonger. Although posts closer to the top receive more undesired comments, we\nfind this increase to coincide with a broader increase in overall engagement --\nrather than indicating a disproportionate effect on undesired activity.

The simplest mechanism is a hierarchy of universes indexed by\na sequence of levels, typically the naturals. To improve reusability of\ndefinitions, they can be made level polymorphic, abstracting over level\nvariables and adding a notion of level expressions. For even more expressive\npower, level expressions can be made first-class as terms themselves, and level\npolymorphism is subsumed by dependent functions quantifying over levels.\nFurthermore, bounded level polymorphism provides more expressivity by being\nable to explicitly state constraints on level variables. While semantics for\nfirst-class levels with constraints are known, syntax and typing rules have not\nbeen explicitly written down. Yet pinning down a well-behaved syntax is not\ntrivial; there exist prior type theories with bounded level polymorphism that\nfail to satisfy subject reduction. In this work, we design an explicit syntax\nfor a type theory with bounded first-class levels, parametrized over arbitrary\nwell-founded sets of levels. We prove the metatheoretic properties of subject\nreduction, type safety, consistency, and canonicity, entirely mechanized from\nsyntax to semantics in Lean.",

The system enables arithmetic operations, namely\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, by encoding numerical\nvalues into two types of molecules emitted by each transmitter to represent\npositive and negative values, respectively.

Across multiple datasets and models, we identify a\npromote-then-suppress mechanism: the model first recalls all answers, and then\nsuppresses previously generated ones. Specifically, LMs use both the subject\nand previous answer tokens to perform knowledge recall, with attention\npropagating subject information and MLPs promoting the answers. Then, attention\nattends to and suppresses previous answer tokens, while MLPs amplify the\nsuppression signal. Our mechanism is corroborated by extensive experimental\nevidence: in addition to using early decoding and causal tracing, we analyze\nhow components use different tokens by introducing both Token Lens, which\ndecodes aggregated attention updates from specified tokens, and a knockout\nmethod that analyzes changes in MLP outputs after removing attention to\nspecified tokens. Overall, we provide new insights into how LMs' internal\ncomponents interact with different input tokens to support complex factual\nrecall.

AC FDI attacks are potentially more harmful as they can easily\nbypass bad data detection (BDD) algorithms. In this paper, we present a unified\napproach to investigate the impact of AC FDI attacks on power transmission\nlines using the PowerWorld simulator.

Our findings demonstrate that in\ndesigning optimal AC FDI attacks, a trade-off between the residuals of state\nvariables and the corresponding impacts of the proposed attack should be\nconsidered. This is because optimal attacks result in fewer changes in the\nattacked variable states and their estimated residuals compared to arbitrary AC\nFDI attacks. Moreover, the impacts of optimal AC FDI attacks can be less severe\nthan those of arbitrary attacks.

If its mass is below the Hubble scale during\ninflation, long-wavelength modes of this scalar will be excited during\ninflation, and their subsequent evolution may lead to the correct relic density\nof dark matter. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the\nevolution of a spectator scalar. We examine three cases: (1) a non-interacting\nmassive scalar, (2) a massive scalar with self-interactions of the form\n$\\lambda_\\chi \\chi^p$, and (3) a massive scalar coupled to the inflaton $\\phi$\nthrough an interaction term of the form $\\sigma_{n,m} \\phi^n \\chi^m$. In all\ncases, we assume minimal coupling to gravity and compare these results with the\nproduction of short-wavelength modes arising from single graviton exchange. The\nevolution is tracked during the reheating phase. Our findings are summarized\nusing $(m_\\chi, T_{\\rm RH})$ parameter planes, where $m_\\chi$ is the mass of\nthe scalar field and $T_{\\rm RH}$ is the reheating temperature after inflation.\nThe non-interacting scalar is highly constrained, requiring $m_\\chi > 3 \\times\n10^{12}~\\rm {GeV}$ and $ T_{\\rm RH} \\lesssim 7~\\text{TeV}$ for an inflationary\npotential with a quadratic minimum. However, when self-interactions or\ncouplings to the inflaton are included, the viable parameter space expands\nconsiderably. In these cases, sub-GeV and even sub-eV scalar masses can yield\nthe correct relic abundance, opening new possibilities for light dark matter\ncandidates. In all cases, we also impose additional constraints arising from\nthe production of isocurvature fluctuations, the prevention of a secondary\ninflationary phase triggered by the spectator field, and the fragmentation of\nscalar condensates.",

Here, we investigate whether people maintain a distinction\nbetween impossibility and inconceivability, and how such distinctions might be\nmade. We find that people can readily distinguish the impossible from the\ninconceivable, using categorization studies similar to those used to\ninvestigate the differences between impossible and improbable (Experiment 1).\nHowever, this distinction is not explained by people's subjective ratings of\nevent likelihood, which are near zero and indistinguishable between impossible\nand inconceivable event descriptions (Experiment 2). Finally, we ask whether\nthe probabilities assigned to event descriptions by statistical language models\n(LMs) can be used to separate modal categories, and whether these probabilities\nalign with people's ratings (Experiment 3). We find high-level similarities\nbetween people and LMs: both distinguish among impossible and inconceivable\nevent descriptions, and LM-derived string probabilities predict people's\nratings of event likelihood across modal categories. Our findings suggest that\nfine-grained knowledge about exceedingly rare events (i.e., the impossible and\ninconceivable) may be learned via statistical learning over linguistic forms,\nyet leave open the question of whether people represent the distinction between\nimpossible and inconceivable as a difference not of degree, but of kind.",

For this type of device, the operational\nstatus can only be assessed at a specific inspection time, determining whether\nfailure occurred before or after it. Consequently, lifetimes are subject to\nleft- or right-censoring. One-shot devices are usually highly reliables. To\nanalyze the reliability of such products, an accelerated life test (ALT) plan\nis typically employed by subjecting the devices to increased levels of stress\nfactors, thus allowing life characteristics observed under high-stress\nconditions to be extrapolated to normal operating conditions. By accelerating\nthe degradation process, ALT significantly reduces both the time required for\ntesting and the associated experimental costs.\n  Recently, robust inferential methods have gained considerable interest in\nstatistical analysis. Among them, weighted minimum density power divergence\nestimators (WMDPDEs) are widely recognized for their robust statistical\nproperties with small loss of efficiency. In this work, robust WMDPDE and\nassociated statistical tests are developed under a log-logistic lifetime\ndistribution with multiple stresses.

We introduced dye-tagged protein\nsolution into a petri dish with sugar solutions, which had higher density than\nthe added protein solution. Initially, the protein spread and became more\nuniformly distributed at the air-water interface. Subsequently, it concentrated\nin specific areas to form spiral patterns.

Our work suggests that Turing\nreaction-diffusion patterns can be replicated by replacing the reaction-induced\ninhomogeneous solute distribution by evaporation-induced inhomogeneity. In both\ncases, the fast diffusive or Marangoni spreading of the solute is counteracted\nby a slower step that serves to reverse the solute homogenization. In showing\nthat dissipative patterns can form in the absence of thermal gradients or\nchemical reactions, our findings significantly expand the conditions that lead\nto pattern formation.

Most\nresearch has focused on DC-based FDI attacks; however, designing AC FDI attacks\ninvolves solving a nonlinear optimization problem, presenting additional\nchallenges in assessing their feasibility.

    "abstract": "Many of today's most pressing issues require a more robust understanding of\nhow information spreads in populations. Current models of information spread\ncan be thought of as falling into one of two varieties:\nepidemiologically-inspired rumor spreading models, which do not account for the\nnoisy nature of communication, or information theory-inspired communication\nmodels, which do not account for spreading dynamics in populations. The viral\nproliferation of misinformation and harmful messages seen both online and\noffline, however, suggests the need for a model that accounts for both noise in\nthe communication process, as well as disease-like spreading dynamics.\n  In this work, we leverage communication theory to meaningfully synthesize\nmodels of rumor spreading with models of noisy communication to develop a model\nfor the noisy spread of structurally encoded messages. Furthermore, we use this\nmodel to develop a framework that allows us to consider not only the dynamics\nof messages, but the amount of information in the average message received by\nmembers of the population at any point in time. We find that spreading models\nand noisy communication models constitute the upper and lower bounds for the\namount of information received, while our model fills the space in between. We\nconclude by considering our model and findings with respect to both modern\ncommunication theory and the current information landscape to glean important\ninsights for the development of communication-based interventions to fight\nrising threats to democracy, public health, and social justice.",

    "abstract": "Turbulence is a complex phenomenon that plays a critical role in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). Previous simulations and observations show that the\nprobability density function (PDF) of gas density in isothermal and\ncompressible systems under turbulence exhibits a near lognormal shape, with a\nstrong empirical relation between the variance ($\\sigma^2$) and Mach number\n($M$). In this work, we aim to explain the $\\sigma^2$-$M$ relation and the\ndeviation from the lognormal shape from a thermodynamic and cascading\nperspective. By introducing a virtual dissipation process, during which\nturbulent entropy and structural dissipation are assumed to be coupled, we\nderive the empirical relation $ \\sigma^2 = \\ln(1 + M)^2 $. Additionally, by\nintroducing a delay parameter $q$ for the local gas temperature, we derive the\ndeviation from the empirical relation at high $M$. We further argue that the\nexponential tails of PDFs (on the $s = \\ln(\\rho)$ scale) arise from the\nconvolution of PDF kernels, which can be skewed at both the low-$s$ and\nhigh-$s$ ends. Skewness has limited influence on the $\\sigma^2$-$M$ relation.\nTwo density-fraction strategies--the mass-fraction and volume-fraction\napproaches--are introduced to explain the physical origins of the low-$s$ and\nhigh-$s$ skewed PDF kernels. These two types of PDF kernels are dual to each\nother and exhibit highly symmetric mathematical structures. We speculate that\nthe high-$s$ skewed PDF kernels are physical and may be analogous to the\nhigh-density tails of column-density PDFs in molecular clouds, which are\ninfluenced by gravity. Inspired by this, we propose a form of an \"isothermal\"\nturbulent system that likely favors the volume-fraction strategy.",

We evaluate the\nperformance of the network on simulated spectra for a range of signal-to-noise\n(S/N) levels and dust extinction, and the superposition of different nebulae\nalong the line of sight. At infinite S/N the network achieves perfect\npredictive performance, while as the S/N decreases, the classification accuracy\ndeclines, reaching an average of ~80% at S/N(H$\\alpha$)=20. We apply our model\nto real spectra from MUSE observations of the galaxy M33, where it provides a\nrobust classification of individual spaxels, even at low S/N, identifying HII\nregions and PNe and distinguishing them from SNRs and diffuse ionized gas,\nwhile identifying overlapping nebulae. We then compare the network's\nclassification with traditional diagnostics and find satisfactory agreement.\nUsing activation maximisation maps, we find that at high S/N the model mainly\nrelies on weak lines (e.g. auroral lines of metal ions and He recombination\nlines), while at the S/N level typical of our dataset the model effectively\nemulates traditional diagnostic methods by leveraging strong nebular lines.",

These percentages vary considerably across different\nmetallicity-stratified groups. Also, a large age gap is identified between\nchurned and blurred/undisturbed sub-samples within each HC-based group, being\nthe outward-churned stars systematically the oldest, inward-churned stars the\nyoungest, and blurred/undisturbed stars in intermediate ages.

We used deep and\nhomogeneous archival $Hubble$ $Space$ $Telescope$ data, and applied\nisochrone-fitting to derive homogeneous age estimates. We find that the\nmajority of the selected clusters form a well-defined age-metallicity relation,\nwith a few outliers. Among these, NGC 288 and NGC 6205 are more than 2 Gyr\nolder than the other GSE globular clusters at similar metallicity, and are\ntherefore interpreted as of likely in-situ origin. Moreover, NGC 7099 is\nsomewhat younger than the average GSE trend, this suggesting a possible\nalternative dwarf galaxy progenitor, while NGC 5286 is mildly older, as if its\nprogenitor was characterised by an higher star-formation efficiency. Another\nremarkable feature of the resulting age-metallicity relation is the presence of\ntwo epochs of globular cluster formation, with a duration of $\\sim0.3$ Gyr each\nand separated by $\\sim2$ Gyr. These findings are in excellent agreement with\nthe age-metallicity relation of halo field stars found by Gonz\\'alez-Koda et\nal., clearly hinting at episodic star-formation in GSE. The age of the two\nformation epochs is similar to the mean age of the two groups of in-situ\nglobular clusters previously studied by CARMA. These epochs might therefore be\nprecisely pinpointing two important dynamical events that GSE had with the\nMilky Way during its evolutionary history. Finally, we discuss the correlation\nbetween the recent determination of Si and Eu with the clusters age and origin.",

Our unique framework incorporates the\nimpact of patchy reionization by adopting the large-scale radiation field\ntopology from the parent THESAN simulation box rather than assuming a spatially\nuniform UV background. In total, THESAN-ZOOM comprises $60$ simulations,\nincluding both fiducial runs and complementary variations designed to\ninvestigate the impact of numerical and physical parameters on galaxy\nproperties. The fiducial simulation set reproduces a wealth of high-redshift\nobservational data such as the stellar-to-halo-mass relation, the star-forming\nmain sequence, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, and the mass-metallicity\nrelation. While our simulations slightly overestimate the abundance of low-mass\nand low-luminosity galaxies they agree well with observed stellar and UV\nluminosity functions at the higher mass end. Moreover, the star-formation rate\ndensity closely matches the observational estimates from $z=3-14$. These\nresults indicate that the simulations effectively reproduce many of the\nessential characteristics of high-redshift galaxies, providing a realistic\nframework to interpret the exciting new observations from JWST.",

However, these approaches were often constrained by\nobservational limitations and did not necessarily provide a clear physical\nboundary for galaxy outskirts. With modern deep imaging surveys, a new\nphysically motivated definition has emerged using the radial position of the\nstar formation threshold as the galaxy size, approximated by the stellar mass\ndensity contour at 1 Msun pc^-2 (R_1). We test this definition using three\nstate-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation suites, analyzing stellar surface\ndensity profiles across a wide range of stellar masses and redshifts. We\nmeasure the galaxy sizes according to this new definition and compare them with\nthe most traditional size metric, the stellar half-mass radius. Our analysis\ndemonstrates that the R_1-M_star relation exhibits consistent behaviour across\nboth low and high-stellar mass galaxies, with remarkably low scatter. This\nrelation is independent of redshift and holds across the three different\ncosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites, highlighting its robustness to\nvariations in galaxy formation models. Furthermore, we explore the connection\nbetween a galaxy's total mass within R1 and its stellar mass, finding very\nlittle scatter in this relation. This suggests that R1 could serve as a\nreliable observational tracer for the galaxy's dynamical mass. The size-stellar\nmass relation proposed provides a reliable and physically motivated method for\ndefining the outskirts of galaxies. This method remains consistent not only at\nz=0 but also throughout the evolutionary history of galaxies, offering a robust\nand meaningful framework for galaxy evolution studies.",

In this work, we study concept-based models in a more\nrealistic, dynamic setting where new classes may rely on older concepts in\naddition to introducing new concepts themselves. We show that concepts and\nclasses form a complex web of relationships, which is susceptible to\ndegradation and needs to be preserved and augmented across experiences.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) modeling, known for its next-token prediction paradigm,\nunderpins state-of-the-art language and visual generative models.\nTraditionally, a ``token'' is treated as the smallest prediction unit, often a\ndiscrete symbol in language or a quantized patch in vision. However, the\noptimal token definition for 2D image structures remains an open question.\nMoreover, AR models suffer from exposure bias, where teacher forcing during\ntraining leads to error accumulation at inference. In this paper, we propose\nxAR, a generalized AR framework that extends the notion of a token to an entity\nX, which can represent an individual patch token, a cell (a $k\\times k$\ngrouping of neighboring patches), a subsample (a non-local grouping of distant\npatches), a scale (coarse-to-fine resolution), or even a whole image.\nAdditionally, we reformulate discrete token classification as continuous entity\nregression, leveraging flow-matching methods at each AR step. This approach\nconditions training on noisy entities instead of ground truth tokens, leading\nto Noisy Context Learning, which effectively alleviates exposure bias. As a\nresult, xAR offers two key advantages: (1) it enables flexible prediction units\nthat capture different contextual granularity and spatial structures, and (2)\nit mitigates exposure bias by avoiding reliance on teacher forcing. On\nImageNet-256 generation benchmark, our base model, xAR-B (172M), outperforms\nDiT-XL/SiT-XL (675M) while achieving 20$\\times$ faster inference. Meanwhile,\nxAR-H sets a new state-of-the-art with an FID of 1.24, running 2.2$\\times$\nfaster than the previous best-performing model without relying on vision\nfoundation modules (e.g., DINOv2) or advanced guidance interval sampling.",

    "abstract": "Strategic decision-making involves interactive reasoning where agents adapt\ntheir choices in response to others, yet existing evaluations of large language\nmodels (LLMs) often emphasize Nash Equilibrium (NE) approximation, overlooking\nthe mechanisms driving their strategic choices. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce an evaluation framework grounded in behavioral game theory,\ndisentangling reasoning capability from contextual effects. Testing 22\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, we find that GPT-o3-mini, GPT-o1, and DeepSeek-R1\ndominate most games yet also demonstrate that the model scale alone does not\ndetermine performance. In terms of prompting enhancement, Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) prompting is not universally effective, as it increases strategic\nreasoning only for models at certain levels while providing limited gains\nelsewhere. Additionally, we investigate the impact of encoded demographic\nfeatures on the models, observing that certain assignments impact the\ndecision-making pattern. For instance, GPT-4o shows stronger strategic\nreasoning with female traits than males, while Gemma assigns higher reasoning\nlevels to heterosexual identities compared to other sexual orientations,\nindicating inherent biases. These findings underscore the need for ethical\nstandards and contextual alignment to balance improved reasoning with fairness.",

We use two\ncomplementary approaches: (i) determining the initial density contrast and its\nevolution rate for a given collapse scale factor, (ii) computing the collapse\nscale factor for a specified initial density contrast and evolution rate. We\nderive analytical solutions for the growth rate $f=\\Omega_{\\rm m}^\\gamma$ and\ngrowth index $\\gamma$ in both models. Prior to the transition, the AdS-like\n$\\Lambda$ reduces cosmic friction, causing linear matter density perturbations\nto grow more rapidly than in $\\Lambda$CDM; this effect is most pronounced just\nbefore the transition, with a growth rate around $15\\%$ higher than\n$\\Lambda$CDM around $z\\sim2$. After the transition, $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM\nbehaves similarly to $\\Lambda$CDM but features a larger cosmological constant,\nleading to higher $H(z)$ and greater cosmic friction that more effectively\nsuppresses growth. Before the transition, $\\gamma$ remains below both the\n$\\Lambda$CDM and EdS values ($\\gamma\\approx6/11$); during the transition, it\nincreases rapidly and then grows gradually, paralleling $\\Lambda$CDM while\nremaining slightly higher in the post-transition era-though overall, it stays\nnear $\\gamma\\sim0.55$. Using the Planck best-fit values, $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}=0.28$\nfor $\\Lambda_{\\mathrm{s}}$CDM and $\\Omega_{\\rm m0}=0.32$ for $\\Lambda$CDM, we\nfind $f=0.49$ and $f=0.53$, respectively. $\\Lambda_{\\rm s}$CDM predicts a value\nof $f=0.48$, recently obtained from LSS data when $\\gamma$ is treated as a free\nparameter in $\\Lambda$CDM.

The recent deformable Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a robust solution\nto represent real-world dynamic scenes. However, it often leads to heavily\nredundant Gaussians, attempting to fit every training view at various time\nsteps, leading to slower rendering speeds. Additionally, the attributes of\nGaussians in static areas are time-invariant, making it unnecessary to model\nevery Gaussian, which can cause jittering in static regions. In practice, the\nprimary bottleneck in rendering speed for dynamic scenes is the number of\nGaussians.

    "abstract": "Given a predictor and a loss function, how well can we predict the loss that\nthe predictor will incur on an input? This is the problem of loss prediction, a\nkey computational task associated with uncertainty estimation for a predictor.\nIn a classification setting, a predictor will typically predict a distribution\nover labels and hence have its own estimate of the loss that it will incur,\ngiven by the entropy of the predicted distribution. Should we trust this\nestimate? In other words, when does the predictor know what it knows and what\nit does not know?\n  In this work we study the theoretical foundations of loss prediction. Our\nmain contribution is to establish tight connections between nontrivial loss\nprediction and certain forms of multicalibration, a multigroup fairness notion\nthat asks for calibrated predictions across computationally identifiable\nsubgroups. Formally, we show that a loss predictor that is able to improve on\nthe self-estimate of a predictor yields a witness to a failure of\nmulticalibration, and vice versa. This has the implication that nontrivial loss\nprediction is in effect no easier or harder than auditing for multicalibration.\nWe support our theoretical results with experiments that show a robust positive\ncorrelation between the multicalibration error of a predictor and the efficacy\nof training a loss predictor.",

The first result\nis that under circuit-level depolarizing noise, a version of the DQE algorithm\napplied to the geometrically local, stabilizer-encoded Hamiltonians that arise\nnaturally when fermionic Hamiltonians are represented in qubits, can suppress\nthe additive error in the ground space overlap of the final output state\nexponentially in the code distance.

We argue that these settings fail to model the\nprocess of real-life two-character interactions, where humans will react to\ntheir counterparts in real time and act as independent individuals. In\ncontrast, we propose an online reaction policy, called Ready-to-React, to\ngenerate the next character pose based on past observed motions.

Our policy is implemented by incorporating a\ndiffusion head into an auto-regressive model, which can dynamically respond to\nthe counterpart's motions while effectively mitigating the error accumulation\nthroughout the generation process.

OpenTAD also facilitates straightforward benchmarking across various\ndatasets and enables fair and in-depth comparisons among different methods.\nWith OpenTAD, we comprehensively study how innovations in different network\ncomponents affect detection performance and identify the most effective design\nchoices through extensive experiments. This study has led to a new\nstate-of-the-art TAD method built upon existing techniques for each component.\nWe have made our code and models available at\nhttps://github.com/sming256/OpenTAD.",

    "abstract": "Selfish miners selectively withhold blocks to earn disproportionately high\nrevenue. The vast majority of the selfish mining literature focuses exclusively\non block rewards. Carlsten et al. [2016] is a notable exception, observing that\nsimilar strategic behavior is profitable in a zero-block-reward regime (the\nendgame for Bitcoin's quadrennial halving schedule) if miners are compensated\nwith transaction fees alone. Neither model fully captures miner incentives\ntoday. The block reward remains 3.125 BTC, yet some blocks yield significantly\nhigher revenue. For example, congestion during the launch of the Babylon\nprotocol in August 2024 caused transaction fees to spike to 9.52 BTC. Our\nresults are both practical and theoretical. Of practical interest, we study\nselfish mining profitability under a combined reward function that more\naccurately models miner incentives. This analysis enables us to make\nquantitative claims about protocol risk (e.g., the mining power at which a\nselfish strategy becomes profitable is reduced by 22% when optimizing over the\ncombined reward function versus block rewards alone) and qualitative\nobservations (e.g., a miner considering both block rewards and transaction fees\nwill mine more or less aggressively respectively). These practical results\nfollow from our novel model and methodology, which constitute our theoretical\ncontributions. We model general, time-accruing stochastic rewards, which\nrequires explicit treatment of difficult adjustment and randomness; we\ncharacterize reward function structure through a set of properties (e.g., that\nrewards accrue only as a function of time). We present a new methodology to\nanalytically calculate expected selfish miner rewards under a broad class of\nstochastic reward functions and validate our method numerically by comparing it\nwith the existing literature and simulating the combined reward sources\ndirectly.",

Although powering down unused\nnodes can improve energy efficiency, choosing the wrong time to do so can\ndegrade quality of service by delaying job execution. Machine learning, in\nparticular reinforcement learning (RL), has shown promise in determining\noptimal times to switch nodes on or off. In this study, we enhance the\nperformance of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent for HPC power\nmanagement by integrating curriculum learning (CL), a training approach that\nintroduces tasks with gradually increasing difficulty. Using the Batsim-py\nsimulation framework, we compare the proposed CL-based agent to both a baseline\nDRL method (without CL) and the conventional fixed-time timeout strategy.\nExperimental results confirm that an easy-to-hard curriculum outperforms other\ntraining orders in terms of reducing wasted energy usage. The best agent\nachieves a 3.73% energy reduction over the baseline DRL method and a 4.66%\nimprovement compared to the best timeout configuration (shutdown every 15\nminutes of idle time). In addition, it reduces average job waiting time by\n9.24% and maintains a higher job-filling rate, indicating more effective\nresource utilization. Sensitivity tests across various switch-on durations,\npower levels, and cluster sizes further reveal the agent's adaptability to\nchanging system parameters without retraining.

    "abstract": "We envision a marketplace where diverse entities offer specialized \"modules\"\nthrough APIs, allowing users to compose the outputs of these modules for\ncomplex tasks within a given budget. This paper studies the market design\nproblem in such an ecosystem, where module owners strategically set prices for\ntheir APIs (to maximize their profit) and a central platform orchestrates the\naggregation of module outputs at query-time. One can also think about this as a\nfirst-price procurement auction with budgets. The first observation is that if\nthe platform's algorithm is to find the optimal set of modules then this could\nresult in a poor outcome, in the sense that there are price equilibria which\nprovide arbitrarily low value for the user. We show that under a suitable\nversion of the \"bang-per-buck\" algorithm for the knapsack problem, an\n$\\varepsilon$-approximate equilibrium always exists, for any arbitrary\n$\\varepsilon > 0$. Further, our first main result shows that with this\nalgorithm any such equilibrium provides a constant approximation to the optimal\nvalue that the buyer could get under various constraints including (i) a budget\nconstraint and (ii) a budget and a matroid constraint. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat these efficient equilibria can be learned through decentralized price\nadjustments by module owners using no-regret learning algorithms.",

We extract a wide range of linguistic features\nfrom six dimensions: phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and\npragmatics. We extract, evaluate, and intervene on these features by\nconstructing minimal contrast datasets and counterfactual sentence datasets. We\nintroduce two indices-Feature Representation Confidence (FRC) and Feature\nIntervention Confidence (FIC)-to measure the ability of linguistic features to\ncapture and control linguistic phenomena. Our results reveal inherent\nrepresentations of linguistic knowledge in LLMs and demonstrate the potential\nfor controlling model outputs.

While multi-axis AM enhances\nmanufacturability by enabling flexible material deposition in multiple\norientations, challenges remain in addressing overhang structures, potential\ncollisions, and material anisotropy caused by varying build orientations. To\novercome these limitations, this study proposes a novel space-time topology\noptimization framework for multi-axis AM. The framework employs a pseudo-time\nfield as a design variable to represent the fabrication sequence,\nsimultaneously optimizing the density distribution and build orientations. This\napproach ensures that the overhang angles remain within manufacturable limits\nwhile also mitigating collisions. Moreover, by incorporating material\nanisotropy induced by diverse build orientations into the design process, the\nframework can take the scan path-dependent structural behaviors into account\nduring the design optimization. Numerical examples demonstrate that the\nproposed framework effectively derives feasible and optimal designs that\naccount for the manufacturing characteristics of multi-axis AM.",

These systems may have primarily formed in a gas-rich environment,\npotentially hosted more planets and were more compact. We extend previous\nsimulations of the formation of the TRAPPIST-1 system to 100 Myr to test the\nstability of these systems without gas. We find the absence of a strong mean\nmotion resonance in the innermost planet pair and the absence of three body\nresonances throughout the system are likely to result in the merging and\nejection of planets after the gas disk disperses. The runs that experience such\nan instability tend to produce final systems with lower multiplicities, period\nratios larger than two, increased orbital spacings, higher planetary angular\nmomentum deficits, and slightly smaller mass ratios between adjacent planets.\nRemarkably, we find these same trends in the observations of M-dwarf\nmulti-planet systems containing no large planets. Our work allows us to\nidentify specific systems that may have experienced an instability and suggests\nthat only ~25% of these systems formed in their current observed state while\nmost systems were likely more compact and multiplicitous earlier in time.\nPrevious research indicates that systems that have experienced a late stage\ngiant impact may host planets potentially more habitable than the systems that\ndid not.

Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan\ndurations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data,\nand recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with\nthe reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most\ncurrent T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not\nexploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential.

    "abstract": "The emergence of long-context large language models (LLMs) offers a promising\nalternative to traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for processing\nextensive documents. However, the computational overhead of long-context\ninference presents significant efficiency challenges. While Speculative\nDecoding (SD) traditionally accelerates inference using smaller draft models,\nits effectiveness diminishes substantially in long-context scenarios due to\nmemory-bound KV cache operations. We introduce Retrieval-Augmented Speculative\nDecoding (RAPID), which leverages RAG for both accelerating and enhancing\ngeneration quality in long-context inference. RAPID introduces the RAG\ndrafter-a draft LLM operating on shortened retrieval contexts-to speculate on\nthe generation of long-context target LLMs. Our approach enables a new paradigm\nwhere same-scale or even larger LLMs can serve as RAG drafters while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. To fully leverage the potentially\nsuperior capabilities from stronger RAG drafters, we develop an inference-time\nknowledge transfer that enriches the target distribution by RAG. Extensive\nexperiments on the LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen2.5 backbones demonstrate that RAPID\neffectively integrates the strengths of both RAG and long-context LLMs,\nachieving significant performance improvements (e.g., from 39.33 to 42.83 on\nInfiniteBench for LLaMA-3.1-8B) with more than 2x speedups for long-context\ninference. Our analyses also reveal the robustness of RAPID across various\ncontext lengths and retrieval quality.",

We advocate for a Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL)-based guidance mechanism, utilising the Twin\nDelayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. To improve the efficiency\nof the training process, we incorporate an Artificial Potential Field\n(APF)-based reward structure, enabling the agent to refine its movements,\nthereby promoting smoother paths and enhanced obstacle avoidance in indoor\ncontexts. Furthermore, we tackle the issue of task distribution among\ncooperative UAVs through a DRL-trained Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). This\nGCN represents the interactions between drones and tasks, facilitating dynamic\nand real-time task allocation that reflects the current environmental\nconditions and the capabilities of the drones. Such an approach fosters\neffective coordination and collaboration among multiple drones during search\nand rescue operations or other exploratory endeavours. Lastly, to ensure\nprecise odometry in environments lacking GNSS, we employ Light Detection And\nRanging Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping complemented by a depth camera to\nmitigate the hallway problem. This integration offers robust localisation and\nmapping functionalities, thereby enhancing the systems dependability in indoor\nnavigation. The proposed multi-drone framework not only elevates individual\nnavigation capabilities but also optimises coordinated task allocation in\ncomplex, obstacle-laden environments.

Consequently, existing work suffers from leaking\noccupancy information into the decoder and has significant computational\ncomplexity, thereby limiting the SSL pre-training to only 2D bird's eye view\nencoders in practice. In this work, we propose the novel neighborhood occupancy\nMAE (NOMAE) that overcomes the aforementioned challenges by employing masked\noccupancy reconstruction only in the neighborhood of non-masked voxels. We\nincorporate voxel masking and occupancy reconstruction at multiple scales with\nour proposed hierarchical mask generation technique to capture features of\nobjects of different sizes in the point cloud. NOMAEs are extremely flexible\nand can be directly employed for SSL in existing 3D architectures. We perform\nextensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets for the\ndownstream perception tasks of semantic segmentation and 3D object detection,\ncomparing with both discriminative and generative SSL methods. The results\ndemonstrate that NOMAE sets the new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks for\nmultiple point cloud perception tasks.",

In this work, we outline a\ngeometric method for spin estimation by using the interferometric shape of the\nfirst photon ring ($n=1$) as an approximation to the critical curve, which,\ngiven an assumed value of the black hole inclination, is then mapped to a spin\nvalue. While future space-based missions will capture a wealth of data on the\nfirst photon ring--including the full angle-dependent diameter, angular\nbrightness profile, and astrometric offset from the $n=0$ ring--our analysis is\nrestricted to using only two angle-dependent diameters to compute its shape\nasymmetry and infer spin. Focusing on low inclinations and moderate-to-high\nspins, we test the method across various emission models, baselines, and noise\nsources, including a mock space-based observation. Although the size of the\n$n=1$ ring depends on the emission model, its interferometric shape remains a\nrobust spin probe at low inclinations. We find that the inferred asymmetry of\nthe $n=1$ image may be biased by the critical curve morphology, and it can be\nheavily skewed by the presence of noise, whether astrophysical or instrumental.\nIn low-noise limits at low viewing inclination, significant contributions from\nthe $n=0$ image at short baselines may lead to a downward bias in asymmetry\nestimates. While our method can estimate high spins in noise-free time-averaged\nimages, increasing the noise and astrophysical variability degrades the\nresulting constraints, providing only lower bounds on the spin when applied to\nsynthetic observed data. Remarkably, even using only the ring's asymmetry, we\ncan establish lower bounds on the spin, underscoring the promise of photon\nring-based spin inference in future space-based very long baseline\ninterferometry missions, such as the proposed Black Hole Explorer.",

While many methods for\ngaze estimation exist, they rely heavily on data-hungry deep learning to\nachieve high performance. This reliance often forces practitioners to harvest\ntraining data from unverified public datasets, outsource model training, or\nrely on pre-trained models. However, such practices expose gaze estimation\nmodels to backdoor attacks. In such attacks, adversaries inject backdoor\ntriggers by poisoning the training data, creating a backdoor vulnerability: the\nmodel performs normally with benign inputs, but produces manipulated gaze\ndirections when a specific trigger is present. This compromises the security of\nmany gaze-based applications, such as causing the model to fail in tracking the\ndriver's attention. To date, there is no defense that addresses backdoor\nattacks on gaze estimation models. In response, we introduce SecureGaze, the\nfirst solution designed to protect gaze estimation models from such attacks.\nUnlike classification models, defending gaze estimation poses unique challenges\ndue to its continuous output space and globally activated backdoor behavior. By\nidentifying distinctive characteristics of backdoored gaze estimation models,\nwe develop a novel and effective approach to reverse-engineer the trigger\nfunction for reliable backdoor detection.

Time-to-dropout and\ntime-to-completion in MOOCs, like other time-to-event prediction tasks, can be\neffectively modeled using survival analysis (SA) methods. In this study, we\napply SA methods to improve collaborative filtering recommendation performance\nby considering time-to-event in the context of MOOCs. Our proposed approach\ndemonstrates superior performance compared to collaborative filtering methods\ntrained based on learners' interactions with MOOCs, as evidenced by two\nperformance measures on three publicly available datasets. The findings\nunderscore the potential of integrating SA methods with RSs to enhance\npersonalization in MOOCs.",

In this paper, we make three contributions: (i) We present\nM3Builder, a novel multi-agent system designed to automate machine learning\n(ML) in medical imaging. At its core, M3Builder employs four specialized agents\nthat collaborate to tackle complex, multi-step medical ML workflows, from\nautomated data processing and environment configuration to self-contained auto\ndebugging and model training. These agents operate within a medical imaging ML\nworkspace, a structured environment designed to provide agents with free-text\ndescriptions of datasets, training codes, and interaction tools, enabling\nseamless communication and task execution. (ii) To evaluate progress in\nautomated medical imaging ML, we propose M3Bench, a benchmark comprising four\ngeneral tasks on 14 training datasets, across five anatomies and three imaging\nmodalities, covering both 2D and 3D data. (iii) We experiment with seven\nstate-of-the-art large language models serving as agent cores for our system,\nsuch as Claude series, GPT-4o, and DeepSeek-V3. Compared to existing ML agentic\ndesigns, M3Builder shows superior performance on completing ML tasks in medical\nimaging, achieving a 94.29% success rate using Claude-3.7-Sonnet as the agent\ncore, showing huge potential towards fully automated machine learning in\nmedical imaging.",

    "abstract": "Fake news poses global risks by influencing elections and spreading\nmisinformation, making detection critical. Existing NLP and supervised Machine\nLearning methods perform well under cross-validation but struggle to generalise\nacross datasets, even within the same domain. This issue stems from coarsely\nlabelled training data, where articles are labelled based on their publisher,\nintroducing biases that token-based models like TF-IDF and BERT are sensitive\nto. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise, their application in fake\nnews detection remains limited. This study demonstrates that meaningful\nfeatures can still be extracted from coarsely labelled data to improve\nreal-world robustness. Stylistic features-lexical, syntactic, and semantic-are\nexplored due to their reduced sensitivity to dataset biases. Additionally,\nnovel social-monetisation features are introduced, capturing economic\nincentives behind fake news, such as advertisements, external links, and social\nmedia elements. The study trains on the coarsely labelled NELA 2020-21 dataset\nand evaluates using the manually labelled Facebook URLs dataset, a gold\nstandard for generalisability. Results highlight the limitations of token-based\nmodels trained on biased data and contribute to the scarce evidence on LLMs\nlike LLaMa in this field.

The connection of the\nnanochannel to a microfluidic in-and outlet system enables such measurements in\ncontinuous flow conditions, and the integrated online optical reference system\nensures their long-term stability.

The algorithm, dubbed Pontryagin-Bellman Differential Dynamic\nProgramming (PDDP), is the result of the incorporation of Pontryagin Minimum\nPrinciple (PMP) into the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) formulation.\nUnlike traditional indirect methods that rely on first-order shooting\ntechniques to determine the optimal costate, PDDP optimizes the costates using\na null-space trust-region method, solving a series of quadratic subproblems\nderived from first- and second-order sensitivities. Terminal equality\nconstraints are handled via a general augmented Lagrangian method, while\nstate-path constraints are enforced using a quadratic penalty approach. The\nresulting solution method represents a significant improvement over classical\nindirect methods, which are known to be ineffective for state-constrained\nproblems. The use of DDP to optimize the costate partially reduces the inherent\nsensitivities of indirect methods, thereby improving the robustness to poor\ninitial guess. Finally, the incorporation of PMP within the DDP formulation\nenables the design of long-duration, multi-spiral low-thrust trajectories with\nfewer optimization variables compared to classical DDP formulations.

    "abstract": "This paper concerns the security of the electric power transmission grid\nfacing the threat of malicious cyber-physical attackers. We posit that there is\nno such thing as perfectly effective cyber-security. Rather, any cyber-security\nmeasure comes with the possibility that a highly skilled attacker could\n(eventually find a way to) bypass it. On these grounds, we formulate a\ntri-level decision making problem seeking to co-optimize preventive physical\nand cyber-security measures under uncertainty on the ability of an exogenous\ncyber-physical attacker to overcome the latter. Preventive physical security\nmeasures refer to the \\emph{ex-ante} procurement of reserve capacity, which\ntranslates into ramping restrictions in real-time. Cyber-security measures\nrefer to updating the firewall rules so as to impede an intruder from taking\nover the cyber infrastructure of the grid and disconnecting power generators\nand transmission branches. We adopt standard assumptions to formalize the inner\noptimization problems corresponding to the cyber-physical attacker and power\ngrid operator and focus on uncertainty management at the uppermost level of the\nproblem. Our findings establish that physical- and cyber-security measures are\nnon-exchangeable complements in keeping the power grid operation secure.",

Multi-source data are\ncollected from different high-throughput technologies while multi-way data are\ncollected over multiple dimensions, yielding multiple tensor arrays.\nIntegrative analysis of these data sets is needed, e.g., to capture and\nsynthesize different facets of complex biological systems. However, despite\ngrowing interest in multi-source and multi-way factorization techniques,\nmethods that can handle data that are both multi-source and multi-way are\nlimited. In this work, we propose a Multiple Linked Tensors Factorization\n(MULTIFAC) method extending the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition to\nsimultaneously reduce the dimension of multiple multi-way arrays and\napproximate underlying signal. We first introduce a version of the CP\nfactorization with L2 penalties on the latent factors, leading to rank\nsparsity. When extended to multiple linked tensors, the method automatically\nreveals latent components that are shared across data sources or individual to\neach data source. We also extend the decomposition algorithm to its\nexpectation-maximization (EM) version to handle incomplete data with\nimputation. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate\nMULTIFAC's ability to (i) approximate underlying signal, (ii) identify shared\nand unshared structures, and (iii) impute missing data.

Our proposed TAJJs effectively mitigate the detrimental orbital\neffects while robustly hosting Majorana end modes (MEMs) at both ends of the\njunction.

The distinct spin-polarization of the MEMs\nprovides an unambiguous experimental signature for the spin-resolved\nmeasurement. Furthermore, by harnessing the synergy between the\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet and its superconducting counterpart, our\nproposal extends to high-$T_c$ platforms naturally.

    "abstract": "Many applications in aerodynamics depend on the use of sensors to estimate\nthe evolving state of the flow. In particular, a wide variety of traditional\nand learning-based strategies for closed-loop control rely on some knowledge of\nthe aerodynamic state in order to decide on actions. This estimation task is\ninherently accompanied by uncertainty due to the noisy measurements of sensors\nor the non-uniqueness of the underlying mapping, and knowledge of this\nuncertainty can be as important for decision-making as that of the state\nitself. The tracking of uncertainty is challenged by the often-nonlinear\nrelationship between the sensor measurements and the flow state. For example, a\ncollection of passing vortices leaves a footprint in wall pressure sensors that\ndepends nonlinearly on the strengths and positions of the vortices. In this\npaper, we will review the recent body of work on flow estimation. We will\ndiscuss the basic tools of probability, including sampling and estimation, in\nthe powerful setting of Bayesian inference and demonstrate these tools in\nstatic flow estimation examples. We will then proceed to unsteady examples and\nillustrate the application of sequential estimation, and particularly, the\nensemble Kalman filter. Finally, we will discuss uncertainty quantification in\nneural network approximations of the mappings between sensor measurements and\nflow states. Recent aerodynamic applications of neural networks have shown that\nthe flow state can be encoded into a very low-dimensional latent space, and we\nwill discuss the implications of this encoding on uncertainty.",

Real-time AutoML\nenables the design process to happen while the ML algorithm is being applied to\na task. Real-time AutoML is an emerging research area, as such existing\nreal-time AutoML techniques need improvement with respect to the quality of\ndesigns and time taken to create designs. To address these issues, this study\nproposes an Online Meta-learning for AutoML in Real-time (OnMAR) approach.\nMeta-learning gathers information about the optimisation process undertaken by\nthe ML algorithm in the form of meta-features. Meta-features are used in\nconjunction with a meta-learner to optimise the optimisation process. The OnMAR\napproach uses a meta-learner to predict the accuracy of an ML design. If the\naccuracy predicted by the meta-learner is sufficient, the design is used, and\nif the predicted accuracy is low, an optimisation technique creates a new\ndesign. A genetic algorithm (GA) is the optimisation technique used as part of\nthe OnMAR approach. Different meta-learners (k-nearest neighbours, random\nforest and XGBoost) are tested. The OnMAR approach is model-agnostic (i.e. not\nspecific to a single real-time AutoML application) and therefore evaluated on\nthree different real-time AutoML applications, namely: composing an image\nclustering algorithm, configuring the hyper-parameters of a convolutional\nneural network, and configuring a video classification pipeline.

For example,\nbounds on homomorphism thresholds give such a statement if $G$ has sufficiently\nhigh minimum degree, and the approximate homomorphism theorem gives such a\nstatement for all $G$, if one weakens the notion of homomorphism appropriately.\n  In this paper, we study asymmetric versions of these results, where the\nassumptions on $G$ and $\\Gamma$ need not match. For example, we prove that if\n$G$ is a graph with odd girth at least $9$ and minimum degree at least $\\delta\n|G|$, then $G$ is homomorphic to a triangle-free graph whose size depends only\non $\\delta$. Moreover, the odd girth assumption can be weakened to odd girth at\nleast $7$ if $G$ has bounded VC dimension or bounded domination number. This\ngives a new and improved proof of a result of Huang et al.\n  We also prove that in the asymmetric approximate homomorphism theorem, the\nbounds exhibit a rather surprising ``double phase transition'': the bounds are\nsuper-exponential if $G$ is only assumed to be triangle-free, they become\nexponential if $G$ is assumed to have odd girth $7$ or $9$, and become linear\nif $G$ has odd girth at least $11$.\n  Our proofs use a wide variety of techniques, including entropy arguments, the\nFrieze--Kannan weak regularity lemma, properties of the generalised Mycielskian\nconstruction, and recent work on abundance and the asymmetric removal lemma.",

In this study, we aim to improve infection\ndetection by introducing Synthetic Caption Augmented Retrieval for Wound\nInfection Detection (SCARWID), a novel deep learning framework that leverages\nsynthetic textual descriptions to augment DFU images. SCARWID consists of two\ncomponents: (1) Wound-BLIP, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) fine-tuned on\nGPT-4o-generated descriptions to synthesize consistent captions from images;\nand (2) an Image-Text Fusion module that uses cross-attention to extract\ncross-modal embeddings from an image and its corresponding Wound-BLIP caption.\nInfection status is determined by retrieving the top-k similar items from a\nlabeled support set. To enhance the diversity of training data, we utilized a\nlatent diffusion model to generate additional wound images. As a result,\nSCARWID outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving average sensitivity,\nspecificity, and accuracy of 0.85, 0.78, and 0.81, respectively, for wound\ninfection classification.

Specifically, longitudinal polarization provides\na more significant improvement compared to transverse polarization, with the\nenhancement being more pronounced for single-step decays than for multi-step\ndecays. With the expected statistics from the BESIII experiment, the estimated\nEDM sensitivities for $\\Lambda$ and $\\Sigma^{+}$ are on the order of\n$10^{-19}~e~\\rm cm$, while those for $\\Xi^{-}$ and $\\Xi^{0}$ are\n$10^{-18}~e~\\rm cm$.

Since WINERED-HVS1 is gravitationally bound to the Milky\nWay and is not necessarily young, it is not an unambiguous HVS candidate from a\nkinematic perspective, unlike the previously confirmed A-type main-sequence HVS\nknown as S5-HVS1.

The abundance pattern of this star -- including the\npattern of [$\\alpha$/Fe], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Mg], and [Ca/Mg] -- is consistent with\nthat of the nuclear star cluster surrounding the SMBH, further supporting our\nview.

While existing approaches\nuse temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random\nsplit can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag\nbetween training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our\nproposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various\nmethods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular\nrepresentations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial\nperiodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a\nplug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to\nlearn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to\nhandle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal\nembedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more\neffective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data.",

Such attacks can degrade the performance of neural code search\nsystems, leading to biased or insecure code suggestions.

This work aims to develop a\ncomprehensive and operational framework for assessing the sustainability of DFL\nsystems. To address it, this work provides a systematic method for quantifying\nenergy consumption and carbon emissions, offering insights into improving the\nsustainability of DFL.

GreenDFL\nsystematically analyzes the impact of various factors, including hardware\naccelerators, model architecture, communication medium, data distribution,\nnetwork topology, and federation size, on the sustainability of DFL systems.\nBesides, a sustainability-aware aggregation algorithm (GreenDFL-SA) and a node\nselection algorithm (GreenDFL-SN) are developed to optimize energy efficiency\nand reduce carbon emissions in DFL training. Empirical experiments are\nconducted on multiple datasets, measuring energy consumption and carbon\nemissions at different phases of the DFL lifecycle.

Whether\nquark matter is more stable than ordinary nuclei has been a long-standing\nquestion, which requires understanding of the QCD vacuum energy. In this work,\nwe employ both theoretical and data-driven methods to derive the QCD vacuum\nenergy, utilizing the GMOR relation, the low-energy theorem, the equation of\nstate from Lattice QCD, and the instanton gas/liquid model. The QCD vacuum\nenergy is determined to be between $(163\\,\\mbox{MeV})^4$ and\n$(190\\,\\mbox{MeV})^4$. Alongside the quark matter pressure calculated from\nperturbative QCD calculations, both the 2-flavor (via Bodmer) and 2+1-flavor\n(via Witten) quark matter are found to be more than 100 MeV per baryon heavier\nthan the nucleons.

Newly generated entanglement may be used to\npurify the stored entanglement, which degrades over time. Stored entanglement\nmay be removed due to failed purification or consumption. We derive analytical\nexpressions for the system performance, which is measured using the\nentanglement availability and the average fidelity upon consumption.

We show that purification must be performed as frequently as possible\nto maximise the average fidelity of entanglement upon consumption, even if this\noften leads to the loss of high-quality entanglement due to purification\nfailures. Moreover, we obtain heuristics for the design of good purification\npolicies in practical systems.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks can acquire many aspects of human knowledge from\ndata, making them promising as models of human learning. But what those\nnetworks can learn depends upon their inductive biases -- the factors other\nthan the data that influence the solutions they discover -- and the inductive\nbiases of neural networks remain poorly understood, limiting our ability to\ndraw conclusions about human learning from the performance of these systems.\nCognitive scientists and machine learning researchers often focus on the\narchitecture of a neural network as a source of inductive bias. In this paper\nwe explore the impact of another source of inductive bias -- the initial\nweights of the network -- using meta-learning as a tool for finding initial\nweights that are adapted for specific problems. We evaluate four widely-used\narchitectures -- MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers -- by meta-training 430\ndifferent models across three tasks requiring different biases and forms of\ngeneralization. We find that meta-learning can substantially reduce or entirely\neliminate performance differences across architectures and data\nrepresentations, suggesting that these factors may be less important as sources\nof inductive bias than is typically assumed. When differences are present,\narchitectures and data representations that perform well without meta-learning\ntend to meta-train more effectively. Moreover, all architectures generalize\npoorly on problems that are far from their meta-training experience,\nunderscoring the need for stronger inductive biases for robust generalization.",

Although we show profile swap regret is NP-hard to\ncompute given a transcript of play, we show it is nonetheless possible to\ndesign efficient learning algorithms that guarantee at most $O(\\sqrt{T})$\nprofile swap regret. Finally, we explore the correlated equilibrium notion\ninduced by low-profile-swap-regret play, and demonstrate a gap between the set\nof outcomes that can be implemented by this learning process and the set of\noutcomes that can be implemented by a third-party mediator (in contrast to the\nsituation in normal-form games).",

Besides localization, its other goal is to\nidentify (detect) which of the nodes participating in the process are\nmalicious. This problem becomes extremely important with the forthcoming\nexpansion of IoT and smart cities applications, that depend on accurate\nlocalization, and the presence of malicious attackers can represent serious\nsecurity threats if not taken into consideration. This is the case with most\nexisting localization systems which makes them highly vulnerable to spoofing\nattacks. In addition, existing methods that are intended for adversarial\nsettings consider very specific settings or require additional knowledge about\nthe system model, making them only partially secure. Therefore, this work\nproposes a novel voting scheme based on clustering and weighted central mass to\nsecurely solve the localization problem and detect attackers. The proposed\nsolution has two main phases: 1) Choosing a cluster of suitable points of\ninterest by taking advantage of the problem geometry to assigning votes in\norder to localize the target, and 2) Attacker detection by exploiting the\nlocation estimate and basic statistics. The proposed method is assessed in\nterms of localization accuracy, success in attacker detection, and\ncomputational complexity in different settings. Computer simulations and\nreal-world experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, showing that it can accomplish an error\nreduction of $30~\\%$ and is capable of achieving almost perfect attacker\ndetection rate when the ratio between attacker intensity and noise standard\ndeviation is significant.",

We derive multi-linear sufficient reductions for the\nregression or classification problem by modeling the conditional distribution\nof the predictors given the response as a member of the quadratic exponential\nfamily. We develop estimation procedures of sufficient reductions for both\ncontinuous and binary tensor-valued predictors. We prove the consistency and\nasymptotic normality of the estimated sufficient reduction using manifold\ntheory. For continuous predictors, the estimation algorithm is highly\ncomputationally efficient and is also applicable to situations where the\ndimension of the reduction exceeds the sample size.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel topology-aware dimensionality reduction approach\naiming at accurately visualizing the cyclic patterns present in high\ndimensional data. To that end, we build on the Topological Autoencoders\n(TopoAE) formulation. First, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of its\nassociated loss and show that a zero loss indeed induces identical persistence\npairs (in high and low dimensions) for the $0$-dimensional persistent homology\n(PH$^0$) of the Rips filtration. We also provide a counter example showing that\nthis property no longer holds for a naive extension of TopoAE to PH$^d$ for\n$d\\ge 1$. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel generalization of\nTopoAE to $1$-dimensional persistent homology (PH$^1$), called TopoAE++, for\nthe accurate generation of cycle-aware planar embeddings, addressing the above\nfailure case. This generalization is based on the notion of cascade distortion,\na new penalty term favoring an isometric embedding of the $2$-chains filling\npersistent $1$-cycles, hence resulting in more faithful geometrical\nreconstructions of the $1$-cycles in the plane. We further introduce a novel,\nfast algorithm for the exact computation of PH for Rips filtrations in the\nplane, yielding improved runtimes over previously documented topology-aware\nmethods. Our method also achieves a better balance between the topological\naccuracy, as measured by the Wasserstein distance, and the visual preservation\nof the cycles in low dimensions.

Speech has been proved an\nobjective marker for the early recognition of depression. For this reason, many\nstudies have been developed aiming to recognize depression through speech.\nHowever, existing methods rely on the usage of only the spontaneous speech\nneglecting information obtained via read speech, use transcripts which are\noften difficult to obtain (manual) or come with high word-error rates\n(automatic), and do not focus on input-conditional computation methods. To\nresolve these limitations, this is the first study in depression recognition\ntask obtaining representations of both spontaneous and read speech, utilizing\nmultimodal fusion methods, and employing Mixture of Experts (MoE) models in a\nsingle deep neural network. Specifically, we use audio files corresponding to\nboth interview and reading tasks and convert each audio file into log-Mel\nspectrogram, delta, and delta-delta. Next, the image representations of the two\ntasks pass through shared AlexNet models. The outputs of the AlexNet models are\ngiven as input to a multimodal fusion method. The resulting vector is passed\nthrough a MoE module. In this study, we employ three variants of MoE, namely\nsparsely-gated MoE and multilinear MoE based on factorization.

Unlike previous mesh-based methods\nthat learn vertex-based deformation fields, our method learns a continuous\nvelocity field in Euclidean space.

Additionally, our method does not require\nintermediate-shape supervision during training; instead, we incorporate\nphysical and geometrical constraints to regularize the velocity field. We\nreconstruct intermediate surfaces using a modified level-set equation, directly\nlinking our NIR with the velocity field. Experiments show that our method\nsignificantly outperforms previous NIR approaches across various scenarios\n(e.g., noisy, partial, topology-changing, non-isometric shapes) and, for the\nfirst time, enables new applications like 4D Kinect sequence upsampling and\nreal-world high-resolution mesh deformation.",

On\ntop of this time-dependent structure that in turn has a time-dependent\ngravitational potential, we solve the motion equations of test particles with\ninitial conditions associated to circular orbits at different radii. Our\nresults indicate that: 1) no trajectory remains circular, 2) the trajectories\nare sensitive to initial conditions and 3) the departure of initially near\ntrajectories has always a positive Lyapunov exponent.

    "abstract": "The interaction between pions and nucleons plays a crucial role in hadron\nphysics.

This work studies the\np-$\\pi^{\\pm}$ dynamics using femtoscopic correlations in high-multiplicity pp\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV measured by ALICE at the LHC. As the\nfinal-state interaction between protons and pions is well constrained by\nscattering experiments and the study of pionic hydrogen, the results give\naccess to information on the particle-emitting source in pp collisions using\nthe femtoscopy methods. The scaling of the source size of primordial protons\nand pions against their pair transverse mass is extracted. The results are\ncompared with the source sizes studied with p-p, p-K$^+$, and\n$\\pi^{\\pm}$-$\\pi^{\\pm}$ pairs by ALICE in the same collision system and are\nfound to be in agreement for the different particle pairs. This reinforces\nrecent findings by ALICE of a common emission source for all hadron-pairs in pp\ncollisions at LHC energies. Furthermore, the p-p-$\\pi^{\\pm}$ systems are\nstudied using three-particle femtoscopy in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s} = 13$\nTeV. The presence of three-body effects is analyzed utilizing the cumulant\nexpansion method. In this formalism, the known two-body interactions are\nsubtracted in order to isolate the three-body effects. For both, p-p-$\\pi^{+}$\nand p-p-$\\pi^{-}$, a non-zero cumulant is found, indicating effects beyond\npairwise interactions. These results give information on the coupling of the\npion to multiple nucleons.",

Existing benchmarks\nencounter two primary challenges: (1) handle the heterogeneous and diverse\nnature of tasks, (2) distinguish between generality and specificity within the\ne-commerce field. To address these problems, we propose \\textbf{ChineseEcomQA},\na scalable question-answering benchmark focused on fundamental e-commerce\nconcepts.

Additionally, by carefully balancing generality and specificity,\nChineseEcomQA effectively differentiates between broad e-commerce concepts,\nallowing for precise validation of domain capabilities. We achieve this through\na scalable benchmark construction process that combines LLM validation,\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) validation, and rigorous manual\nannotation.

To address convergence uncertainty from\nrelaxed assignment dependencies, TianJi proposes a distributed strategy based\non the balance of sample production and consumption. The strategy controls the\nstaleness of samples to correct their quality, ensuring convergence. We\nconducted extensive experiments. TianJi achieves a convergence time\nacceleration ratio of up to 4.37 compared to related comparison systems.

Quantum\nLow-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes have been recently shown to provide a\npath towards QEC with low qubit overhead and small logical error probabilities.\nHere, we demonstrate that when the dominant errors are erasures -- as can be\nengineered in different quantum computing architectures -- quantum LDPC codes\nadditionally provide high thresholds and even stronger logical error\nsuppression in parameter regimes that are accessible to current experiments.\nUsing large-scale circuit-level QEC simulations, we benchmark the performance\nof two families of high-rate quantum LDPC codes, namely Clifford-deformed\nLa-cross codes and Bivariate Bicycle codes, under a noise model strongly biased\ntowards erasure errors. Both codes outperform the surface code by offering up\nto orders of magnitude lower logical error probabilities.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong task-specific capabilities\nthrough fine-tuning, but merging multiple fine-tuned models often leads to\ndegraded performance due to overlapping instruction-following components. Task\nArithmetic (TA), which combines task vectors derived from fine-tuning, enables\nmulti-task learning and task forgetting but struggles to isolate task-specific\nknowledge from general instruction-following behavior. To address this, we\npropose Layer-Aware Task Arithmetic (LATA), a novel approach that assigns\nlayer-specific weights to task vectors based on their alignment with\ninstruction-following or task-specific components. By amplifying task-relevant\nlayers and attenuating instruction-following layers, LATA improves task\nlearning and forgetting performance while preserving overall model utility.\nExperiments on multiple benchmarks, including WikiText-2, GSM8K, and HumanEval,\ndemonstrate that LATA outperforms existing methods in both multi-task learning\nand selective task forgetting, achieving higher task accuracy and alignment\nwith minimal degradation in output quality. Our findings highlight the\nimportance of layer-wise analysis in disentangling task-specific and\ngeneral-purpose knowledge, offering a robust framework for efficient model\nmerging and editing.",

Based on the AE-CQTL\nframework, we designed and implemented two CQTL neural network models: Transfer\nlearning Quantum Neural Network (TLQNN) and Transfer Learning Quantum\nConvolutional Neural Network (TLQCNN). Both models significantly expand the\nparameter capacity of quantum circuits, elevating the parameter scale from a\nfew dozen to over one hundred parameters. In cross-experiments with three\nbenchmark datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10) and three source models\n(ResNet18, ResNet50 and DenseNet121), TLQNN and TLQCNN have exceeded the\nbenchmark classical classifier in multiple performance metrics, including\naccuracy, convergence, stability, and generalization capability.

This approximate\nself-similarity allows us to analytically derive the subhalo PMF for subhalos\naccreted at any level (i.e., for sub-sub...halos) through self-convolutions of\nthe level-1 PMF, and the resulting model shows good agreement with simulation\nmeasurements. We further derive a number of analytical properties on the\nhierarchical origin of subhalos. We show that higher-level subhalos dominate at\nprogressively lower peak mass in the PMF and are more likely to originate from\nmajor mergers than lower-level ones. At a given merger mass ratio, the subhalo\naccretion rates at each level track the growth rate of the host halo. At a\nfixed final mass ratio, however, subhalos of higher-level, higher-mass-ratio\nand in more massive haloes tend to be accreted more recently.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for robot learning.\nHowever, model-free RL (MFRL) requires a large number of environment\ninteractions to learn successful control policies. This is due to the noisy RL\ntraining updates and the complexity of robotic systems, which typically involve\nhighly non-linear dynamics and noisy sensor signals. In contrast, model-based\nRL (MBRL) not only trains a policy but simultaneously learns a world model that\ncaptures the environment's dynamics and rewards. The world model can either be\nused for planning, for data collection, or to provide first-order policy\ngradients for training. Leveraging a world model significantly improves sample\nefficiency compared to model-free RL. However, training a world model alongside\nthe policy increases the computational complexity, leading to longer training\ntimes that are often intractable for complex real-world scenarios. In this\nwork, we propose a new method for accelerating model-based RL using state-space\nworld models. Our approach leverages state-space models (SSMs) to parallelize\nthe training of the dynamics model, which is typically the main computational\nbottleneck. Additionally, we propose an architecture that provides privileged\ninformation to the world model during training, which is particularly relevant\nfor partially observable environments. We evaluate our method in several\nreal-world agile quadrotor flight tasks, involving complex dynamics, for both\nfully and partially observable environments. We demonstrate a significant\nspeedup, reducing the world model training time by up to 10 times, and the\noverall MBRL training time by up to 4 times. This benefit comes without\ncompromising performance, as our method achieves similar sample efficiency and\ntask rewards to state-of-the-art MBRL methods.",

Motivated by\nrecent efforts towards enhanced chiral responses in planar structures, we\ndemonstrate that maximum chirality can be achieved in a planar dielectric\nmetasurface through controlled in-plane asymmetries.

Although previous models can perform digital coloring\nwell, they still suffer from (i) coloring only through the pixel features that\nare not prominent in HE, which is easy to cause information loss in the\ncoloring process; (ii) The lack of pixel-perfect H&E-IHC groundtruth pairs\nposes a challenge to the classical L1 loss.To address the above challenges, we\npropose an adaptive information enhanced coloring framework based on feature\nextractors. We first propose the VMFE module to effectively extract the color\ninformation features using multi-scale feature extraction and wavelet transform\nconvolution, while combining the shared decoder for feature fusion. The\nhigh-performance dual feature extractor of H&E-IHC is trained by contrastive\nlearning, which can effectively perform feature alignment of HE-IHC in high\nlatitude space. At the same time, the trained feature encoder is used to\nenhance the features and adaptively adjust the loss in the HE section staining\nprocess to solve the problems related to unclear and asymmetric information.

Different regimes of rapidly-rotating, unmagnetised, turbulent\nconvection exist depending on the importance of viscous and inertial forces in\nthe dynamics, and hence different theoretical predictions for the dominant flow\nlengthscale have been proposed.

This manual process is time-consuming and operator dependent.\nAutomating this process is challenging for preclinical data due to variations\nin brain geometry, resolution, and tissue contrast. While existing methods for\nMRI skull stripping exist, they often struggle with the low resolution and\nvarying slice sizes in preclinical fMRI data. This study proposes a novel\nmethod called SST-DUNet, that integrates a dense UNet-based architecture with a\nfeature extractor based on Smart Swin Transformer (SST) for fMRI skull\nstripping. The Smart Shifted Window Multi-Head Self-Attention (SSW-MSA) module\nin SST is adapted to replace the mask-based module in the Swin Transformer\n(ST), enabling the learning of distinct channel-wise features while focusing on\nrelevant dependencies within brain structures. This modification allows the\nmodel to better handle the complexities of fMRI skull stripping, such as low\nresolution and variable slice sizes. To address the issue of class imbalance in\npreclinical data, a combined loss function using Focal and Dice loss is\nutilized. The model was trained on rat fMRI images and evaluated across three\nin-house datasets with a Dice similarity score of 98.65%, 97.86%, and 98.04%.\nThe fMRI results obtained through automatic skull stripping using the SST-DUNet\nmodel closely align with those from manual skull stripping for both seed-based\nand independent component analyses.

Textbook wisdom holds that collinear Heisenberg magnets follow a\ndichotomy: ferromagnets host stable magnons, while antiferromagnetic magnons\nmay decay depending on dispersion curvature. Up to now, relativistic spin-orbit\ncoupling and noncollinear order that connect spin space to real space, were\nshown to introduce more complex magnon instability mechanisms.

Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate a quantum heat engine based on superconducting circuits, using a\nsingle-junction quantum-circuit refrigerator (QCR) as a two-way tunable heat\nreservoir coupled to a flux-tunable transmon qubit acting as the working medium\nof the engine. We implement a quantum Otto cycle by a tailored drive on the QCR\nto sequentially induce cooling and heating, interleaved with flux ramps that\ncontrol the qubit frequency. Utilizing single-shot qubit readout, we monitor\nthe evolution of the qubit state during several cycles of the heat engine and\nmeasure positive output powers and efficiencies that agree with our simulations\nof the quantum evolution. Our results verify theoretical models on the\nthermodynamics of quantum heat engines and advance the control of\ndissipation-engineered thermal environments. These proof-of-concept results\npave the way for explorations on possible advantages of QHEs with respect to\nclassical heat engines.",

We define an \"Extended Equilibrium\" by requiring that no\nplayer can improve her expected utility via a unilateral change of strategy,\nand the emergent subjective priors are such that they maximize the expected\nregret of the players. A fixed-point argument -- based on Brouwer's fixed point\ntheorem and mimicking the construction of Nash -- ensures existence.\nAdditionally, the \"No Fictional Faith\" theorem shows that any subjective\nequilibrium prior must stay non-concentrated if the parameter truly matters to\na player.

    "abstract": "Digital soil mapping (DSM) relies on a broad pool of statistical methods, yet\ndetermining the optimal method for a given context remains challenging and\ncontentious. Benchmarking studies on multiple datasets are needed to reveal\nstrengths and limitations of commonly used methods. Existing DSM studies\nusually rely on a single dataset with restricted access, leading to incomplete\nand potentially misleading conclusions. To address these issues, we introduce\nan open-access dataset collection called Precision Liming Soil Datasets\n(LimeSoDa). LimeSoDa consists of 31 field- and farm-scale datasets from various\ncountries. Each dataset has three target soil properties: (1) soil organic\nmatter or soil organic carbon, (2) clay content and (3) pH, alongside a set of\nfeatures. Features are dataset-specific and were obtained by optical\nspectroscopy, proximal- and remote soil sensing. All datasets were aligned to a\ntabular format and are ready-to-use for modeling. We demonstrated the use of\nLimeSoDa for benchmarking by comparing the predictive performance of four\nlearning algorithms across all datasets. This comparison included multiple\nlinear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), categorical boosting\n(CatBoost) and random forest (RF). The results showed that although no single\nalgorithm was universally superior, certain algorithms performed better in\nspecific contexts. MLR and SVR performed better on high-dimensional spectral\ndatasets, likely due to better compatibility with principal components. In\ncontrast, CatBoost and RF exhibited considerably better performances when\napplied to datasets with a moderate number (< 20) of features. These\nbenchmarking results illustrate that the performance of a method is highly\ncontext-dependent. LimeSoDa therefore provides an important resource for\nimproving the development and evaluation of statistical methods in DSM.",

    "abstract": "Accurate regional climate forecast calls for high-resolution downscaling of\nGlobal Climate Models (GCMs). This work presents a deep-learning-based\nmulti-model evaluation and downscaling framework ranking 32 Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models using a Deep Learning-TOPSIS\n(DL-TOPSIS) mechanism and so refines outputs using advanced deep-learning\nmodels. Using nine performance criteria, five K\\\"oppen-Geiger climate zones --\nTropical, Arid, Temperate, Continental, and Polar -- are investigated over four\nseasons. While TaiESM1 and CMCC-CM2-SR5 show notable biases, ranking results\nshow that NorESM2-LM, GISS-E2-1-G, and HadGEM3-GC31-LL outperform other models.\nFour models contribute to downscaling the top-ranked GCMs to 0.1$^{\\circ}$\nresolution: Vision Transformer (ViT), Geospatial Spatiotemporal Transformer\nwith Attention and Imbalance-Aware Network (GeoSTANet), CNN-LSTM, and CNN-Long\nShort-Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Effectively capturing temperature extremes (TXx,\nTNn), GeoSTANet achieves the highest accuracy (Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) =\n1.57$^{\\circ}$C, Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) = 0.89, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency\n(NSE) = 0.85, Correlation ($r$) = 0.92), so reducing RMSE by 20% over ConvLSTM.\nCNN-LSTM and ConvLSTM do well in Continental and Temperate zones; ViT finds\nfine-scale temperature fluctuations difficult. These results confirm that\nmulti-criteria ranking improves GCM selection for regional climate studies and\ntransformer-based downscaling exceeds conventional deep-learning methods. This\nframework offers a scalable method to enhance high-resolution climate\nprojections, benefiting impact assessments and adaptation plans.",

While recent\nmodels can locally explain a single decision, to provide a faithful global\nexplanation about an accurate model's general behavior is a more challenging\nopen task. Towards that goal, we introduce the Quadratic Programming Enhanced\nModel (QPM), which learns globally interpretable class representations. QPM\nrepresents every class with a binary assignment of very few, typically 5,\nfeatures, that are also assigned to other classes, ensuring easily comparable\ncontrastive class representations. This compact binary assignment is found\nusing discrete optimization based on predefined similarity measures and\ninterpretability constraints. The resulting optimal assignment is used to\nfine-tune the diverse features, so that each of them becomes the shared general\nconcept between the assigned classes.

To help mitigate the influence of misinformation on\nhuman beliefs, algorithmic labels providing context about content accuracy and\nsource reliability have been developed. Since the linguistic features used by\nalgorithms to estimate information accuracy can change across time, it is\nimportant to understand their temporal dynamics. As a result, this study uses\nnatural language processing to analyze PolitiFact statements spanning between\n2010 and 2024 to quantify how the sources and linguistic features of\nmisinformation change between five-year time periods. The results show that\nstatement sentiment has decreased significantly over time, reflecting a\ngenerally more negative tone in PolitiFact statements. Moreover, statements\nassociated with misinformation realize significantly lower sentiment than\naccurate information. Additional analysis shows that recent time periods are\ndominated by sources from online social networks and other digital forums, such\nas blogs and viral images, that contain high levels of misinformation\ncontaining negative sentiment. In contrast, most statements during early time\nperiods are attributed to individual sources (i.e., politicians) that are\nrelatively balanced in accuracy ratings and contain statements with neutral or\npositive sentiment. Named-entity recognition was used to identify that\npresidential incumbents and candidates are relatively more prevalent in\nstatements containing misinformation, while US states tend to be present in\naccurate information.

    "abstract": "Although multimodal learning~(MML) has garnered remarkable progress, the\nexistence of modality imbalance hinders multimodal learning from achieving its\nexpected superiority over unimodal models in practice. To overcome this issue,\nmainstream multimodal learning methods have placed greater emphasis on\nbalancing the learning process. However, these approaches do not explicitly\nenhance the classification ability of weaker modalities, leading to limited\nperformance promotion. By designing a sustained boosting algorithm, we propose\na novel multimodal learning approach to dynamically balance the classification\nability of weak and strong modalities. Concretely, we first propose a sustained\nboosting algorithm in multimodal learning by simultaneously optimizing the\nclassification and residual errors using a designed configurable classifier\nmodule. Then, we propose an adaptive classifier assignment strategy to\ndynamically facilitate the classification performance of weak modality. To this\nend, the classification ability of strong and weak modalities is expected to be\nbalanced, thereby mitigating the imbalance issue. Empirical experiments on\nwidely used datasets reveal the superiority of our method through comparison\nwith various state-of-the-art~(SoTA) multimodal learning baselines.",

Our proposed algorithm demonstrates the potential to\ninfer stroke sequences in unknown artworks.

Additionally, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to\nhandle a wide variety of input image types such as line art, face sketches,\npaintings, and photographic images.

It\nis based on approximating the tail probability in question with the most\nprobable realization of the stochastic process, and local perturbations around\nthis realization. We first recall and contextualize the relevant classical\ntheoretical result on precise Laplace asymptotics of diffusion processes [Ben\nArous (1988), Stochastics, 25(3), 125-153], and then show how to compute the\ninvolved infinite-dimensional quantities - operator traces and\nCarleman-Fredholm determinants - numerically in a way that is scalable with\nrespect to the time discretization and remains feasible in high spatial\ndimensions. Using tools from automatic differentiation, we achieve a\nstraightforward black-box numerical computation of the SORM estimates in JAX.\nThe method is illustrated in examples of SDEs and stochastic partial\ndifferential equations, including a two-dimensional random advection-diffusion\nmodel of a passive scalar.

However, in real life, human learning does not follow any of\nthese techniques exclusively. The way a human learns is basically a combination\nof forward learning, backward propagation and cooperation. Humans start\nlearning a new concept by themselves and try to refine their understanding\nhierarchically during which they might come across several doubts. The most\ncommon approach to doubt solving is a discussion with peers, which can be\ncalled cooperation. Cooperation/discussion/knowledge sharing among peers is one\nof the most important steps of learning that humans follow. However, there\nmight still be a few doubts even after the discussion. Then the difference\nbetween the understanding of the concept and the original literature is\nidentified and minimized over several revisions. Inspired by this, the paper\nintroduces Forward-Cooperation-Backward (FCB) learning in a deep neural network\nframework mimicking the human nature of learning a new concept. A novel deep\nneural network architecture, called Multi Encoding Uni Decoding neural network\nmodel, has been designed which learns using the notion of FCB. A special\nlateral synaptic connection has also been introduced to realize cooperation.\nThe models have been justified in terms of their performance in dimension\nreduction on four popular datasets. The ability to preserve the granular\nproperties of data in low-rank embedding has been tested to justify the quality\nof dimension reduction. For downstream analyses, classification has also been\nperformed. An experimental study on convergence analysis has been performed to\nestablish the efficacy of the FCB learning strategy.",

A six-layer MoSe$_2$ film exhibited the\nhighest capacitance, reaching $96 \\mu\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$ in the dark and $115\n\\mu\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$ under illumination at a current density of $5\n\\mu\\mathrm{A/cm^2}$. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Many-Body Perturbation\nTheory calculations reveal that Van Hove singularities and band nesting\nsignificantly enhance optical absorption and quantum capacitance. These results\nhighlight APCVD-grown 2D MoSe$_2$'s potential as light-responsive,\nhigh-performance energy storage electrodes, paving the way for innovative\nenergy storage systems.",

We propose a framework that enables movability-aware planning\nto overcome this challenge without relying on explicit obstacle placement.

A physics\nengine is adopted to simulate the interaction result of the rollouts with the\nenvironment, and generate trajectories that minimize contact force.

It serves as an essential testing ground for\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To advance this field, we introduced\na new REC dataset in our previous conference paper, characterized by two key\nfeatures. First, it is designed with controllable difficulty levels, requiring\nmulti-level fine-grained reasoning across object categories, attributes, and\nmulti-hop relationships. Second, it incorporates negative text and images\ngenerated through fine-grained editing and augmentation, explicitly testing a\nmodel's ability to reject scenarios where the target object is absent, an often\noverlooked yet critical challenge in existing datasets. In this extended work,\nwe propose two new methods to tackle the challenges of fine-grained REC by\ncombining the strengths of Specialist Models and MLLMs. The first method\nadaptively assigns simple cases to faster, lightweight models and reserves\ncomplex ones for powerful MLLMs, balancing accuracy and efficiency. The second\nmethod lets a specialist generate a set of possible object regions, and the\nMLLM selects the most plausible one using its reasoning ability. These\ncollaborative strategies lead to significant improvements on our dataset and\nother challenging benchmarks.

Indeed, quantum theory based on\nreal Hilbert spaces cannot explain the predictions of quantum theory over\ncomplex Hilbert spaces [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Here, we revisit the\nindependence assumption underlying this work. We show that assuming partial\nindependence is sufficient for showing the inadequacy of quantum theory over\nreal Hilbert spaces. We derive a trade-off between source independence and the\nBell value achievable in real quantum theory, which also lower bounds the\nsource correlations required to explain previous experiments with real quantum\nsystems. We further show that 1 bit of entanglement is necessary and sufficient\nfor recovering the complex quantum correlations by means of real quantum theory\nin the scenario from [Renou et al., Nature 600, 2021]. Finally, building on\n[McKague et al., PRL 102, 2009], we provide a construction to simulate any\ncomplex quantum setup with m independent sources by means of real quantum\ntheory, by allowing the sources to share a m real-qubit entangled state in the\nfirst round of the experiment.",

Standard Qini curve\nestimation assumes no interference between units: that is, that treating one\nunit does not influence the outcome of any other unit. In many real-life\napplications such as public policy or marketing, however, the presence of\ninterference is common. Ignoring interference in these scenarios can lead to\nsystematically biased Qini curves that over- or under-estimate a treatment\npolicy's cost-effectiveness. In this paper, we address the problem of Qini\ncurve estimation under clustered network interference, where interfering units\nform independent clusters. We propose a formal description of the problem\nsetting with an experimental study design under which we can account for\nclustered network interference. Within this framework, we introduce three\ndifferent estimation strategies suited for different conditions.

However, modern ConvNets remain confined\nto a pyramid structure that successively downsamples the feature map for\nreceptive field expansion, neglecting this crucial biomimetic principle. We\npresent OverLoCK, the first pure ConvNet backbone architecture that explicitly\nincorporates a top-down attention mechanism. Unlike pyramid backbone networks,\nour design features a branched architecture with three synergistic\nsub-networks: 1) a Base-Net that encodes low/mid-level features; 2) a\nlightweight Overview-Net that generates dynamic top-down attention through\ncoarse global context modeling (i.e., overview first); and 3) a robust\nFocus-Net that performs finer-grained perception guided by top-down attention\n(i.e., look closely next).

However, existing\nmodels primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often\nneglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes\nof human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the\ntrue intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in\nlong-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a\nCognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept,\nPerceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived\nSafety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different\ndriving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module\nthat includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk\nlevels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing\ndriver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed\nto capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements on three well-established datasets.

We supplement our study with a historical NuSTAR and all 2024\npre-outburst NICER observations. The outburst is marked by an X-ray flux\nenhancement of a factor 1.6 compared to the historical level, predominantly\ndriven by a newly-formed non-thermal emitting component with a photon index\n$\\Gamma=1.5$. This flux showed a 20% decay at the end of our monitoring\ncampaign. The radio monitoring did not reveal any pulsed radio emission with an\nupper-limit of 20 mJy and 50 mJy ms on the mean flux density and single pulse\nfluence, respectively. We detect a spin-up glitch at outburst onset with a\n$\\Delta\\nu=6.1\\times10^{-8}$ Hz and a $\\Delta\\dot{\\nu}=-1.4\\times10^{-14}$ Hz\ns$^{-1}$, consistent with the near-universality of this behavior among the\ncontinuously-monitored magnetars. Most intriguingly, the 1E 1841-045 2-10 keV\npulse profile is markedly different compared to pre-outburst; it shows a new,\nnarrow (0.1 cycles) peak that appears to shift towards merging with the main,\npersistently-present, pulse. This is the second case of pulse-peak migration\nobserved in magnetars after SGR 1830$-$0645, and the two sources exhibit a\nsimilar rate of phase shift. This implies that this phenomenon is not unique\nand might present itself in the broader population. The newly-formed peak for\n1E 1841-045 is non-thermal, with emission extending to $\\gtrsim20$ keV, in\ncontrast to the case of SGR 1830$-$0645.

    "abstract": "The development of exascale and post-exascale HPC and AI systems integrates\nthousands of CPUs and specialized accelerators, making energy optimization\ncritical as power costs rival hardware expenses. To reduce consumption,\nfrequency and voltage scaling techniques are widely used, but their\neffectiveness depends on adapting to application demands in real-time. However,\nfrequency scaling incurs a switching latency, impacting the responsiveness of\ndynamic tuning approaches. We propose a methodology to systematically evaluate\nthe frequency switching latency of accelerators, with an implementation for\nCUDA.\n  Our approach employs an artificial iterative workload designed for precise\nruntime measurements at different frequencies. The methodology consists of\nthree phases: (1) measuring workload execution time across target frequencies,\n(2) determining switching latency by tracking the transition from an initial to\na target frequency, and (3) filtering out outliers caused by external factors\nsuch as CUDA driver management or CPU interruptions. A robust statistical\nsystem ensures accuracy while minimizing execution time.\n  We demonstrate this methodology on three Nvidia GPUs - GH200, A100, and RTX\nQuadro 6000 - revealing significant variations in switching latency. These\nfindings are crucial for designing energy-efficient runtime systems, helping\ndetermine optimal frequency change rates and avoiding transitions with\nexcessive overhead.",

In\nthe localized regime, we find that increasing the non-Hermitian parameter\nalways induces a transition from a phase where the states exhibit PT symmetry\nto one where PT symmetry is spontaneously broken. In contrast, in the\ndelocalized regime, the existence of such a transition depends on whether the\nreduced system is PT symmetric. If the reduced system is not PT symmetric, PT\nsymmetry remains in the broken phase regardless of the non-Hermitian parameter.\nWe further analyze the spectral statistics of the system in the delocalized\nregime. For real energy spectra, the level-spacing distribution transitions\nfrom Wigner-Dyson statistics, associated with the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble,\nto Poisson statistics as the non-Hermitian parameter increases, with the\nintermediate regime well described by the Brody distribution.

A deadlock pattern is characterized by a cyclic chain of\nlock acquisitions, where each lock is held by one thread while being requested\nby the next. However, it is well known that not all deadlock patterns\nidentified in this way correspond to true deadlocks, as they may be impossible\nto manifest under any schedule.\n  We tackle this deficiency by proposing a new method based on partial orders\nto eliminate false positives: lock acquisitions must be unordered under a given\npartial order, and not preceded by other deadlock patterns. We prove soundness\n(no falsely predicted deadlocks) for the novel TRW partial order, and\ncompleteness (no deadlocks missed) for a slightly weakened variant of TRW.

However, aligning LLMs remains challenging due to the\ninherent disconnect between the complexity of human values and the narrow\nnature of the technological approaches designed to address them. Current\nalignment methods often lead to misspecified objectives, reflecting the broader\nissue of incomplete contracts, the impracticality of specifying a contract\nbetween a model developer, and the model that accounts for every scenario in\nLLM alignment. In this paper, we argue that improving LLM alignment requires\nincorporating insights from societal alignment frameworks, including social,\neconomic, and contractual alignment, and discuss potential solutions drawn from\nthese domains. Given the role of uncertainty within societal alignment\nframeworks, we then investigate how it manifests in LLM alignment.

    "abstract": "Accurate and robust state estimation at nighttime is essential for autonomous\nrobotic navigation to achieve nocturnal or round-the-clock tasks. An intuitive\nquestion arises: Can low-cost standard cameras be exploited for nocturnal state\nestimation? Regrettably, most existing visual methods may fail under adverse\nillumination conditions, even with active lighting or image enhancement. A\npivotal insight, however, is that streetlights in most urban scenarios act as\nstable and salient prior visual cues at night, reminiscent of stars in deep\nspace aiding spacecraft voyage in interstellar navigation. Inspired by this, we\npropose Night-Voyager, an object-level nocturnal vision-aided state estimation\nframework that leverages prior object maps and keypoints for versatile\nlocalization. We also find that the primary limitation of conventional visual\nmethods under poor lighting conditions stems from the reliance on pixel-level\nmetrics. In contrast, metric-agnostic, non-pixel-level object detection serves\nas a bridge between pixel-level and object-level spaces, enabling effective\npropagation and utilization of object map information within the system.\nNight-Voyager begins with a fast initialization to solve the global\nlocalization problem. By employing an effective two-stage cross-modal data\nassociation, the system delivers globally consistent state updates using\nmap-based observations. To address the challenge of significant uncertainties\nin visual observations at night, a novel matrix Lie group formulation and a\nfeature-decoupled multi-state invariant filter are introduced, ensuring\nconsistent and efficient estimation. Through comprehensive experiments in both\nsimulation and diverse real-world scenarios (spanning approximately 12.3 km),\nNight-Voyager showcases its efficacy, robustness, and efficiency, filling a\ncritical gap in nocturnal vision-aided state estimation.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse speckle contrast analysis (DSCA), also called speckle contrast\noptical spectroscopy(SCOS), has emerged as a groundbreaking optical imaging\ntechnique for tracking dynamic biological processes, including blood flow and\ntissue perfusion. Recent advancements in single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)\ncameras have unlocked exceptional capabilities in sensitivity, time resolution,\nand high frame rate imaging. Despite this, the application of large-format SPAD\narrays in speckle contrast analysis is still relatively uncommon. In this\nstudy, we introduce a pioneering use of a large format SPAD camera for DSCA. By\nharnessing the camera's high temporal resolution and photon detection\nefficiency, we significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of speckle\ncontrast measurements. Our experimental results demonstrate the system's\nremarkable ability to capture rapid temporal variations over a broad field of\nview, enabling detailed spatiotemporal analysis. Through simulations, phantom\nexperiments, and in vivo studies, we validate the approach's potential for a\nwide range of biomedical applications, such as cuff occlusion tests and\nfunctional tissue monitoring. This work highlights the transformative impact of\nlarge SPAD cameras on DSCA, paving the way for new breakthroughs in optical\nimaging.",

    "abstract": "3D Affordance detection is a challenging problem with broad applications on\nvarious robotic tasks. Existing methods typically formulate the detection\nparadigm as a label-based semantic segmentation task. This paradigm relies on\npredefined labels and lacks the ability to comprehend complex natural language,\nresulting in limited generalization in open-world scene. To address these\nlimitations, we reformulate the traditional affordance detection paradigm into\n\\textit{Instruction Reasoning Affordance Segmentation} (IRAS) task. This task\nis designed to output a affordance mask region given a query reasoning text,\nwhich avoids fixed categories of input labels. We accordingly propose the\n\\textit{3D-AffordanceLLM} (3D-ADLLM), a framework designed for reasoning\naffordance detection in 3D open-scene. Specifically, 3D-ADLLM introduces large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to 3D affordance perception with a custom-designed\ndecoder for generating affordance masks, thus achieving open-world reasoning\naffordance detection. In addition, given the scarcity of 3D affordance datasets\nfor training large models, we seek to extract knowledge from general\nsegmentation data and transfer it to affordance detection. Thus, we propose a\nmulti-stage training strategy that begins with a novel pre-training task, i.e.,\n\\textit{Referring Object Part Segmentation}~(ROPS). This stage is designed to\nequip the model with general recognition and segmentation capabilities at the\nobject-part level. Then followed by fine-tuning with the IRAS task, 3D-ADLLM\nobtains the reasoning ability for affordance detection. In summary, 3D-ADLLM\nleverages the rich world knowledge and human-object interaction reasoning\nability of LLMs, achieving approximately an 8\\% improvement in mIoU on\nopen-vocabulary affordance detection tasks.",

Current research is mainly dependent on camera-only approaches,\nwhich often falter in suboptimal conditions, such as low-light environments. In\nresponse to this challenge, we present FuseGrasp, the first radar-camera fusion\nsystem tailored to enhance the transparent objects manipulation. FuseGrasp\nexploits the weak penetrating property of millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals,\nwhich causes transparent materials to appear opaque, and combines it with the\nprecise motion control of a robotic arm to acquire high-quality mmWave radar\nimages of transparent objects. The system employs a carefully designed deep\nneural network to fuse radar and camera imagery, thereby improving depth\ncompletion and elevating the success rate of object grasping. Nevertheless,\ntraining FuseGrasp effectively is non-trivial, due to limited radar image\ndatasets for transparent objects. We address this issue utilizing large RGB-D\ndataset, and propose an effective two-stage training approach: we first\npre-train FuseGrasp on a large public RGB-D dataset of transparent objects,\nthen fine-tune it on a self-built small RGB-D-Radar dataset. Furthermore, as a\nbyproduct, FuseGrasp can determine the composition of transparent objects, such\nas glass or plastic, leveraging the material identification capability of\nmmWave radar. This identification result facilitates the robotic arm in\nmodulating its grip force appropriately. Extensive testing reveals that\nFuseGrasp significantly improves the accuracy of depth reconstruction and\nmaterial identification for transparent objects.

First, the Oppositional-Based\nLearning (OBL) strategy is used to improve the initial population. Second,\ncontrol parameters are refined to achieve a better balance between exploration\nand exploitation.

While systematic reviews address\nsustainability in the context of Smart Cities (a category of SoS), a systematic\nstudy synthesizing the existing knowledge on environmental sustainability\napplied to SoS in general does not exist. Although literature includes other\ntypes of sustainability, such as financial and social, this study focuses on\nenvironmental sustainability, analyzing how SoS contribute to sustainable\npractices such as carbon emission reduction, energy efficiency, and\nbiodiversity conservation. We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study to identify\nthe application domains of SoS in sustainability, the challenges faced, and\nresearch opportunities. We planned and executed a research protocol including\nan automated search over four scientific databases. Of 926 studies retrieved,\nwe selected, analyzed, and reported the results of 39 relevant studies. Our\nfindings reveal that most studies focus on Smart Cities and Smart Grids, while\napplications such as sustainable agriculture and wildfire prevention are less\nexplored. We identified challenges such as system interoperability,\nscalability, and data governance. Finally, we propose future research\ndirections for SoS and environmental sustainability.",

Existing affordance-based methods primarily predict\ncoarse interaction regions and cannot directly constrain the grasping posture,\nleading to a disconnection between visual perception and manipulation. To\naddress this issue, we propose a multi-keypoint affordance representation for\nfunctional dexterous grasping, which directly encodes task-driven grasp\nconfigurations by localizing functional contact points. Our method introduces\nContact-guided Multi-Keypoint Affordance (CMKA), leveraging human grasping\nexperience images for weak supervision combined with Large Vision Models for\nfine affordance feature extraction, achieving generalization while avoiding\nmanual keypoint annotations. Additionally, we present a Keypoint-based Grasp\nmatrix Transformation (KGT) method, ensuring spatial consistency between hand\nkeypoints and object contact points, thus providing a direct link between\nvisual perception and dexterous grasping actions. Experiments on public\nreal-world FAH datasets, IsaacGym simulation, and challenging robotic tasks\ndemonstrate that our method significantly improves affordance localization\naccuracy, grasp consistency, and generalization to unseen tools and tasks,\nbridging the gap between visual affordance learning and dexterous robotic\nmanipulation.

    "abstract": "A glitch is a rare and sudden increase in the otherwise steadily decreasing\nrotation rate of a pulsar. Its cause is widely attributed to the transfer of\nangular momentum to the crust of the star from the array of superfluid vortices\nenclosed within. The magnitude of such an increase defines the size of the\nglitch. The distribution of glitch sizes in individual pulsars, the power-law\nbeing the most argued for, is shrouded in uncertainty due to the small sample\nsize. From a Bayesian perspective, we revisit the data for PSR J0537-6910, the\npulsar with the most glitches, and find a bimodality in the distribution,\nreminiscent of the Bactrian camel. To understand this bimodality, we use a\nsuperfluid vortex simulator and study three independent neutron star paradigms:\n(i) Annular variation in pinning strength to account for the predicted\ndifferences between the crust and the core; (ii) Sectorial triggers to mimic\nlocal disturbances; and (iii) Stress-waves to model global disturbances. We\nfind that annular variation in pinning introduces a bimodality in the\nglitch-size distribution and that sectorial triggers do so weakly. Stress-waves\ndo not lead to any such features for the range of parameters tested. This\nprovides us with new insights into the effects of various perturbations on the\nvortex dynamics and the glitch statistics of neutron stars.",

In randomized controlled trials comparing immunotherapy with\nconventional chemotherapy or placebo, late difference and early crossing\nsurvivals scenarios are commonly observed. In such cases, window mean survival\ntime (WMST), the area under the survival curve within a pre-specified interval\n$[\\tau_0, \\tau_1]$, has gained increasing attention due to its superior power\ncompared to restricted mean survival time (RMST), the area under the survival\ncurve up to a pre-specified time point. Considering the increasing use of\nprogression-free survival as a co-primary endpoint alongside overall survival,\nthere is a critical need to establish a WMST estimation method for\ninterval-censored data; however, sufficient research has yet to be conducted.\nTo bridge this gap, this study proposes a WMST inference method utilizing\none-point imputations and Turnbull's method. Extensive numerical simulations\ndemonstrate that the WMST estimation method using mid-point imputation for\ninterval-censored data exhibits comparable performance to that using Turnbull's\nmethod. Since the former facilitates standard error calculation, we adopt it as\nthe standard method. Numerical simulations on two-sample tests confirm that the\nproposed WMST testing method have higher power than RMST in late difference and\nearly crossing survival scenarios, while having compatible power to the\nlog-rank test under the PH. Furthermore, even when pre-specified $\\tau_0$\ndeviated from the clinically desirable time point, WMST consistently maintains\nhigher power than RMST in late difference and early crossing survivals\nscenarios.",

For all these cases, the total conduction electron spin\npolarization has a universal character since i) the oscillator strengths do not\ndepend on the magnitude of the strain but only on its sign. ii) Although the\noscillator strengths strongly depend on the configuration, the conduction\nelectron spin polarization generated by optical transitions from both the heavy\nand light valence levels induced by sigma + light excitation is in all cases\nequal to -0.5 as predicted by the simple atomic model. iii) The spin\npolarization generated by light excitation from heavy and light valence levels\ndoes not depend on the deformation tensor and on the valence deformation\npotential, except for a strain along [-110].",

While convex\ncases, such as the LASSO, ridge regression, and logistic regression, have been\nextensively studied using a variety of techniques, the non-convex case remains\nfar less understood despite its significance. A non-rigorous statistical\nphysics framework has provided remarkable predictions for the behavior of\nhigh-dimensional optimization problems, but rigorously establishing their\nvalidity for non-convex problems has remained a fundamental challenge. In this\nwork, we address this challenge by developing a systematic framework that\nrigorously proves replica-symmetric formulas for non-convex GLMs and precisely\ndetermines the conditions under which these formulas are valid. Remarkably, the\nrigorous replica-symmetric predictions align exactly with the conjectures made\nby physicists, and the so-called replicon condition. The originality of our\napproach lies in connecting two powerful theoretical tools: the Gaussian\nMin-Max Theorem, which we use to provide precise lower bounds, and Approximate\nMessage Passing (AMP), which is shown to achieve these bounds algorithmically.\nWe demonstrate the utility of this framework through significant applications:\n(i) by proving the optimality of the Tukey loss over the more commonly used\nHuber loss under a $\\varepsilon$ contaminated data model, (ii) establishing the\noptimality of negative regularization in high-dimensional non-convex regression\nand (iii) characterizing the performance limits of linearized AMP algorithms.\nBy rigorously validating statistical physics predictions in non-convex\nsettings, we aim to open new pathways for analyzing increasingly complex\noptimization landscapes beyond the convex regime.",

Among these, frameworks\nutilizing CDFs with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings furnishing the\nequation of state (EoS) of compact star (CS) matter have been explored.\n[Purpose] The aforementioned inference framework has not yet incorporated\nastrophysical objects with potentially extreme high masses or ultra-small radii\namong its constraints, leaving its flexibility and predictive power under such\nextreme parameters still unknown. [Method] We apply the Bayesian inference\nframework based on CDFs with density dependent couplings. The astrophysical\ndata is expanded to include not only the latest multi-messenger constraints\nfrom NICER and gravitational wave events but also the highest measured mass to\ndate for the ``black widow\" pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-radius estimates\nfor the ultra-compact, low-mass object HESS J1731-347. [Results] Our systematic\nBayesian analysis indicates that our CDF models can support higher maximum\nmasses for CSs, reaching up to $2.4$-$2.5\\,M_{\\odot}$. However, achieving\nsufficient softening of the EoS in the low-density regime to accommodate the\nHESS J1731-347 data remains challenging. Nonetheless, we are able to impose\ntighter constraints on the parameter space of CDF models, ensuring consistency\nwith current nuclear experimental and astrophysical data. [Conclusions] CDF\nmodels with density-dependent meson-nucleon couplings encompass a wide range of\nnuclear and astrophysical phenomena, providing a robust theoretical framework\nfor interpreting compact objects. However, the predicted lower limit for the\nradii of low-mass stars is approximately 12 km, which stems from the restricted\ndegrees of freedom in the isovector sector.",

The\nmulticonfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and relativistic configuration\ninteraction methods, which are implemented in the general-purpose relativistic\natomic structure package GRASP2018, are used to compute energy levels of the\n$\\mathrm{5f6d}$, $\\mathrm{6d^2}$, $\\mathrm{7s^2}$, $5\\mathrm{f^2}$,\n$\\mathrm{6d7s}$, $\\mathrm{5f7p}$ and $\\mathrm{5f7s}$ configurations and\nelectric dipole transitions between states of these configurations. The\naccuracy of energy levels is evaluated by comparing it with experimental data\nand with various theoretical methods. Our calculated energy levels are\nconsistent with the experimental results with a root mean square (RMS)\ndeviation of 436 cm$^{-1}$. The accuracy of transition data is investigated\nusing the quantitative and qualitative evaluation method.By performing\nradiative transfer simulations for kilonova spectra with our transition data,\nwe show that kilonova including Th with a mass fraction of $(3-10) \\times\n10^{-5}$ can produce Th III absorption features around 18,000 A.",

In the case of\ntwo spatially separated qubits coupled to the Bose-Bose mixture reservoir, we\ndemonstrate that collective decoherence affects the system dynamics, leading to\nprolonged coherence survival in both branches of the mixture. The intricate\nevolution of the decoherence factors is reflected in the density spectral\nfunctions and their Ohmicity characteristics.

Conventional\nrating curves at Loskop Dam, the primary storage on South Africa's Olifants\nRiver, have become increasingly uncertain owing to sedimentation and episodic\ndrawdown. A 40 year Digital Earth Africa (DEA) surface area archive (1984-2024)\nfused with gauged water levels to develop data driven volume predictors that\noperate under a maximum 9.14%, a 90 day drawdown constraint. Four nested\nfeature sets were examined: (i) raw water area, (ii) +a power law \"calculated\nvolume\" proxy, (iii) +six river geometry metrics, and (iv) +full supply\nelevation. Five candidate algorithms, Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest\n(RF), Ridge (RI), Lasso (LA) and Elastic Net (EN), were tuned using a 20 draw\nrandom search and assessed with a five fold Timeseries Split to eliminate look\nahead bias. Prediction errors were decomposed into two regimes: Low (<250 x\n10^6 cubic meters) and High (>250 x 10^6 cubic meters) storage regimes. Ridge\nregression achieved the lowest cross validated RMSE (12.3 x 10^6 cubic meters),\noutperforming GB by 16% and RF by 7%. In regime terms, Ridge was superior in\nthe Low band (18.0 ver. 22.7 MCM for GB) and tied RF in the High band (~12\nMCM). In sample diagnostics showed GB's apparent dominance (6.8-5.4 MCM) to be\nan artefact of overfitting. A Ridge meta stacked ensemble combining GB, RF, and\nRidge reduced full series RMSE to ~ 11 MCM (~ 3% of live capacity). We\nrecommend (i) GB retrained daily for routine operations, (ii) Ridge for drought\nearly warning, and (iii) the stacked blend for all weather dashboards.\nQuarterly rolling retraining and regime specific metrics are advised to\nmaintain operational accuracy below the 5% threshold mandated by the Department\nof Water and Sanitation.",

The operations of a\ngiven agent affect the other agents by induced pressure buildup that may\njeopardize system integrity. In this work, such a situation is modeled as a\ncooperative game where the set of agents is partitioned into disjoint\ncoalitions that define the collaborations. The games are in partition function\nform with externalities, i.e., the value of a coalition depends on both the\ncoalition itself and on the actions of external agents.\n  We investigate the class of cooperative games where the coalition values are\nthe total injection volumes as given by Pareto optimal solutions to\nmulti-objective optimization problems subject to arbitrary physical\nconstraints. For this class of games, we prove that the Pareto set of any\ncoalition structure is a subset of any other coalition structure obtained by\nsplitting coalitions of the first coalition structure. Furthermore, the\nhierarchical structure of the Pareto sets is used to reduce the computational\ncost in an algorithm to hierarchically compute the entire Pareto fronts of all\npossible coalition structures.\n  We demonstrate the framework on a pumping wells groundwater example, and\nnonlinear and realistic CO$_2$ injection cases, displaying a wide range of\npossible outcomes.

The historical embeddings which come from the previous training\niteration are stale compared to the GAS estimated embeddings, resulting in\napproximation errors of the training algorithm.

In this paper, we systematically explore the potential and\nchallenges of incorporating textual gradient into Federated Learning (FL). Our\ncontributions are fourfold. Firstly, we introduce a novel FL paradigm,\nFederated Textual Gradient (FedTextGrad), that allows clients to upload locally\noptimized prompts derived from textual gradients, while the server aggregates\nthe received prompts. Unlike traditional FL frameworks, which are designed for\nnumerical aggregation, FedTextGrad is specifically tailored for handling\ntextual data, expanding the applicability of FL to a broader range of problems\nthat lack well-defined numerical loss functions. Secondly, building on this\ndesign, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the feasibility of\nFedTextGrad. Our findings highlight the importance of properly tuning key\nfactors (e.g., local steps) in FL training. Thirdly, we highlight a major\nchallenge in FedTextGrad aggregation: retaining essential information from\ndistributed prompt updates. Last but not least, in response to this issue, we\nimprove the vanilla variant of FedTextGrad by providing actionable guidance to\nthe LLM when summarizing client prompts by leveraging the Uniform Information\nDensity principle.

    "abstract": "Developing machine learning (ML) models for yield prediction of chemical\nreactions has emerged as an important use case scenario in very recent years.\nIn this space, reaction datasets present a range of challenges mostly stemming\nfrom imbalance and sparsity. Herein, we consider chemical language\nrepresentations for reactions to tap into the potential of natural language\nprocessing models such as the ULMFiT (Universal Language Model Fine Tuning) for\nyield prediction, which is customized to work across such distribution\nsettings. We contribute a new reaction dataset with more than 860 manually\ncurated reactions collected from literature spanning over a decade, belonging\nto a family of catalytic meta-C(sp2)-H bond activation reactions of high\ncontemporary importance. Taking cognizance of the dataset size, skewness toward\nthe higher yields, and the sparse distribution characteristics, we developed a\nnew (i) time- and resource-efficient pre-training strategy for downstream\ntransfer learning, and (ii) the CFR (classification followed by regression)\nmodel that offers state-of-the-art yield predictions, surpassing conventional\ndirect regression (DR) approaches. Instead of the prevailing pre-training\npractice of using a large number of unlabeled molecules (1.4 million) from the\nChEMBL dataset, we first created a pre-training dataset SSP1 (0.11 million), by\nusing a substructure-based mining from the PubChem database, which is found to\nbe equally effective and more time-efficient in offering enhanced performance.\nThe CFR model with the ULMFiT-SSP1 regressor achieved an impressive RMSE of\n8.40 for the CFR-major and 6.48 for the CFR-minor class in yield prediction on\nthe title reaction, with a class boundary of yield at 53 %. Furthermore, the\nCFR model is highly generalizable as evidenced by the significant improvement\nover the previous benchmark reaction datasets.",

    "abstract": "Classification can be performed using either a discriminative or a generative\nlearning approach. Discriminative learning consists of constructing the\nconditional probability of the outputs given the inputs, while generative\nlearning consists of constructing the joint probability density of the inputs\nand outputs. Although most classical and quantum methods are discriminative,\nthere are some advantages of the generative learning approach. For instance, it\ncan be applied to unsupervised learning, statistical inference, uncertainty\nestimation, and synthetic data generation. In this article, we present a\nquantum generative multiclass classification strategy, called quantum\ngenerative classification (QGC). This model uses a variational quantum\nalgorithm to estimate the joint probability density function of features and\nlabels of a data set by means of a mixed quantum state. We also introduce a\nquantum map called quantum-enhanced Fourier features (QEFF), which leverages\nquantum superposition to prepare high-dimensional data samples in quantum\nhardware using a small number of qubits. We show that the quantum generative\nclassification algorithm can be viewed as a Gaussian mixture that reproduces a\nkernel Hilbert space of the training data. In addition, we developed a hybrid\nquantum-classical neural network that shows that it is possible to perform\ngenerative classification on high-dimensional data sets. The method was tested\non various low- and high-dimensional data sets including the 10-class MNIST and\nFashion-MNIST data sets, illustrating that the generative classification\nstrategy is competitive against other previous quantum models.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve high performance in various real-world\napplications, such as drug discovery, traffic states prediction, and\nrecommendation systems. The fact that building powerful GNNs requires a large\namount of training data, powerful computing resources, and human expertise\nturns the models into lucrative targets for model stealing attacks. Prior work\nhas revealed that the threat vector of stealing attacks against GNNs is large\nand diverse, as an attacker can leverage various heterogeneous signals ranging\nfrom node labels to high-dimensional node embeddings to create a local copy of\nthe target GNN at a fraction of the original training costs. This diversity in\nthe threat vector renders the design of effective and general defenses\nchallenging and existing defenses usually focus on one particular stealing\nsetup. Additionally, they solely provide means to identify stolen model copies\nrather than preventing the attack. To close this gap, we propose the first and\ngeneral Active Defense Against GNN Extraction (ADAGE). ADAGE builds on the\nobservation that stealing a model's full functionality requires highly diverse\nqueries to leak its behavior across the input space. Our defense monitors this\nquery diversity and progressively perturbs outputs as the accumulated leakage\ngrows. In contrast to prior work, ADAGE can prevent stealing across all common\nattack setups. Our extensive experimental evaluation using six benchmark\ndatasets, four GNN models, and three types of adaptive attackers shows that\nADAGE penalizes attackers to the degree of rendering stealing impossible,\nwhilst preserving predictive performance on downstream tasks. ADAGE, thereby,\ncontributes towards securely sharing valuable GNNs in the future.",

    "abstract": "Radio antennas have become a standard tool for the detection of cosmic-ray\nair showers in the energy range above $10^{16}\\,$eV. The radio signal of these\nair showers is generated mostly due to the deflection of electrons and\npositrons in the geomagnetic field, and contains information about the energy\nand the depth of the maximum of the air showers. Unlike the traditional\nair-Cherenkov and air-fluorescence techniques for the electromagnetic shower\ncomponent, radio detection is not restricted to clear nights, and recent\nexperiments have demonstrated that the measurement accuracy can compete with\nthese traditional techniques. Numerous particle detector arrays for air showers\nhave thus been or will be complemented by radio antennas. In particular when\ncombined with muon detectors, the complementary information provided by the\nradio antennas can enhance the total accuracy for the arrival direction, energy\nand mass of the primary cosmic rays. Digitization and computational techniques\nhave been crucial for this recent progress, and radio detection will play an\nimportant role in next-generation experiments for ultra-high-energy cosmic\nrays. Moreover, stand-alone radio experiments are under development and will\nsearch for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos in addition to cosmic rays.\nThis article provides a brief introduction to the physics of the radio emission\nof air showers, an overview of air-shower observatories using radio antennas,\nand highlights some of their recent results.",

Existing methods primarily emphasize the\nsimilarity matching between the representations of objects across modalities,\npotentially neglecting the crucial relation consistency within modalities that\nare particularly important for distinguishing the true and false\ncorrespondences. Such an omission often runs the risk of misidentifying\nnegatives as positives, thus leading to unanticipated performance degradation.\nTo address this problem, we propose a general Relation Consistency learning\nframework, namely ReCon, to accurately discriminate the true correspondences\namong the multimodal data and thus effectively mitigate the adverse impact\ncaused by mismatches. Specifically, ReCon leverages a novel relation\nconsistency learning to ensure the dual-alignment, respectively of, the\ncross-modal relation consistency between different modalities and the\nintra-modal relation consistency within modalities. Thanks to such dual\nconstrains on relations, ReCon significantly enhances its effectiveness for\ntrue correspondence discrimination and therefore reliably filters out the\nmismatched pairs to mitigate the risks of wrong supervisions. Extensive\nexperiments on three widely-used benchmark datasets, including Flickr30K,\nMS-COCO, and Conceptual Captions, are conducted to demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of ReCon compared with other SOTAs.

Its refurbished Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) SPIFFIER leverages a\nnew AO module, enabling high-contrast imaging applications and giving access to\nthe orbital and atmospheric characterisation of super-Jovian exoplanets. We\ntest the detection limits of ERIS and demonstrate its scientific potential by\nexploring the atmospheric composition of the young super-Jovian AF Lep b and\nimproving its orbital solution by measuring its radial velocity relative to its\nhost star. We present new spectroscopic observations of AF Lep b in $K$-band at\n$R\\sim 11000$ obtained with ERIS/SPIFFIER at the VLT. We reduce the data using\nthe standard pipeline together with a custom wavelength calibration routine,\nand remove the stellar PSF using principal component analysis along the\nspectral axis. We compute molecular maps by cross-correlating the residuals\nwith molecular spectral templates and measure the radial velocity of the planet\nrelative to the star. Furthermore, we compute contrast grids for molecular\nmapping by injecting fake planets. We detect a strong signal from H$_{2}$O and\nCO but not from CH$_{4}$ or CO$_{2}$. This result corroborates the hypothesis\nof chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of AF Lep b. Our measurement of\nthe RV of the planet yields $\\Delta v_{\\mathrm{R,P\\star}} = 7.8 \\pm 1.7$ km\ns$^{-1}$. This enables us to disentangle the degeneracy of the orbital\nsolution, namely the correct longitude of the ascending node is\n$\\Omega=248^{+0.4}_{-0.7}$ deg and the argument of periapsis is\n$\\omega=109^{+13}_{-21}$ deg. Our results demonstrate the competitiveness of\nthe new ERIS/SPIFFIER instrument for the orbital and atmospheric\ncharacterisation of exoplanets at high contrast and small angular separation.",

    "abstract": "Money laundering is the process that intends to legalize the income derived\nfrom illicit activities, thus facilitating their entry into the monetary flow\nof the economy without jeopardizing their source. It is crucial to identify\nsuch activities accurately and reliably in order to enforce anti-money\nlaundering (AML). Despite considerable efforts to AML, a large number of such\nactivities still go undetected. Rule-based methods were first introduced and\nare still widely used in current detection systems. With the rise of machine\nlearning, graph-based learning methods have gained prominence in detecting\nillicit accounts through the analysis of money transfer graphs. Nevertheless,\nthese methods generally assume that the transaction graph is centralized,\nwhereas in practice, money laundering activities usually span multiple\nfinancial institutions. Due to regulatory, legal, commercial, and customer\nprivacy concerns, institutions tend not to share data, restricting their\nutility in practical usage. In this paper, we propose the first algorithm that\nsupports performing AML over multiple institutions while protecting the\nsecurity and privacy of local data. To evaluate, we construct Alipay-ECB, a\nreal-world dataset comprising digital transactions from Alipay, the world's\nlargest mobile payment platform, alongside transactions from E-Commerce Bank\n(ECB). The dataset includes over 200 million accounts and 300 million\ntransactions, covering both intra-institution transactions and those between\nAlipay and ECB. This makes it the largest real-world transaction graph\navailable for analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods\ncan effectively identify cross-institution money laundering subgroups.\nAdditionally, experiments on synthetic datasets also demonstrate that our\nmethod is efficient, requiring only a few minutes on datasets with millions of\ntransactions.",

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a widely used non-invasive physiological\nsensing technique, suitable for various clinical applications. Such clinical\napplications are increasingly supported by machine learning methods, raising\nthe question of the most appropriate input representation and model choice.\nComprehensive comparisons, in particular across different input\nrepresentations, are scarce. We address this gap in the research landscape by a\ncomprehensive benchmarking study covering three kinds of input representations,\ninterpretable features, image representations and raw waveforms, across\nprototypical regression and classification use cases: blood pressure and atrial\nfibrillation prediction. In both cases, the best results are achieved by deep\nneural networks operating on raw time series as input representations. Within\nthis model class, best results are achieved by modern convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). but depending on the task setup, shallow CNNs are often also\nvery competitive. We envision that these results will be insightful for\nresearchers to guide their choice on machine learning tasks for PPG data, even\nbeyond the use cases presented in this work.",

Due to the data scarcity, synthetic data generation has\nemerged as a promising solution. However, synthetic QE data often suffers from\ndistribution shift, which can manifest as discrepancies between pseudo and real\ntranslations, or in pseudo labels that do not align with human preferences. To\ntackle this issue, we introduce DCSQE, a novel framework for alleviating\ndistribution shift in synthetic QE data. To reduce the difference between\npseudo and real translations, we employ the constrained beam search algorithm\nand enhance translation diversity through the use of distinct generation\nmodels. DCSQE uses references, i.e., translation supervision signals, to guide\nboth the generation and annotation processes, enhancing the quality of\ntoken-level labels. DCSQE further identifies the shortest phrase covering\nconsecutive error tokens, mimicking human annotation behavior, to assign the\nfinal phrase-level labels. Specially, we underscore that the translation model\ncan not annotate translations of itself accurately. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that DCSQE outperforms SOTA baselines like CometKiwi in both\nsupervised and unsupervised settings. Further analysis offers insights into\nsynthetic data generation that could benefit reward models for other tasks. The\ncode is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/njuqe.",

This\ncan lower the detection threshold and increase the accuracy for the pulse time\nand amplitude. We have trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using\nCoREAS simulations and background recorded by a prototype station at the IceTop\nsurface array at the South Pole and have applied them to air-shower\nmeasurements by this station. The station consists of 3 SKALA antennas and 8\nscintillators, which are used to trigger the readout of the antennas upon a\nsixfold coincidence. Afterwards, the radio signal is filtered to the band of\n70-350 MHz. By applying neural networks to search for radio signals in about\nfour months of data, we find about five times more events than by a traditional\nmethod based on a signal-to-noise ratio cut after filtering for radio frequency\ninterferences. Despite the lower threshold, the purity of the selected events\nseems to improve, and the angular resolution of the radio measurements does not\ndeteriorate, which we have confirmed by a comparison of the reconstructed\nshower direction with IceTop. This analysis thus provides experimental\nconfirmation that neural networks can indeed be used to clean air-shower radio\nsignals from background and to lower the radio detection threshold of hybrid\narrays combining particle and radio detectors.",

While existing reasoning\nmodels with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) can enable LLMs to do step-wise analysis\nand reflection, they often face the issue of wasting computation on less\nproductive solutions and fail to make progress during inference time. In this\npaper, we propose Meta-Reasoner, a new framework to enable LLMs ``Think about\nhow to think'', i.e., optimize the inference compute by adjusting strategies on\nhow to reason during inference time. Inspired by dual-process theory, our\nmethod decouples the high-level strategy generation (e.g., backtracking,\nswitching approaches, or restarting) from stepwise CoT generation via a\nlightweight progress report. The strategy module only consider the summarized\nversion from the previous CoTs to propose new strategies accordingly. We employ\nthe contextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs) for this module to iteratively\nevaluate the previous reasoning states and dynamically adjust the strategy to\navoid reasoning get stuck in less productive paths during inference.\nEvaluations on math problems (e.g., Game-of-24, TheoremQA) and scientific\nproblems (e.g., SciBench) demonstrate that our method improves performance by\n9-12\\% over previous SOTA methods while reducing inference time by 28-35\\%.\nThis approach also generalizes to other domains like creative writing,\ndemonstrating its versatility for diverse reasoning-intensive problems using\nLLMs.",

This study investigates the influence of\ndifferent hydrogenated nanodiamond (H-ND) seeding layers on the growth and\nproperties of BDD films. Three types of seeding H-NDs were examined: detonation\n(H-DND) and top-down high-pressure high-temperature NDs (TD_HPHT H-ND), and\nboron-doped NDs (H-BND) newly synthesized at high-pressure high-temperature\nfrom an organic precursor. Purified and oxidized BND (O-BND) samples yielded\nclear, blue, and stable colloidal dispersions. Subsequent thermal hydrogenation\nreversed their zeta potential from - 32 mV to + 44 mV and promoted the seeding\nof negatively charged surfaces. All three H-ND types formed dense seeding\nlayers on SiO2 and Si/SiOx substrates, which enabled the growth of BDD films by\nchemical vapor deposition (CVD). Despite variations in initial surface coverage\namong the seeding layers (13-25%), all NDs facilitated the growth of fully\nclosed BDD films approximately 1 {\\mu}m thick. Significant differences in film\nmorphology and electrical properties were observed. H-BND nucleation yielded\nthe BDD films with the largest crystals (up to 1 000 nm) and lowest sheet\nresistance (400 ohm/sq). This superior performance is attributed to the uniform\nparticle shape and monocrystalline character of H-BND, as corroborated by FTIR,\nTEM, and SAXS measurements. These findings highlight the critical role of\nseeding layer properties in determining consequent diamond film evolution and\nestablish H-BNDs as promising seeding material for the growth of high-quality\nBDD films suitable for electronic and electrochemical applications.",

Consequently, their observed\noscillation spectra mirror these changes, constituting key tracers of stellar\nstructure and evolution. However, the complexity of their spectra makes their\nmodelling an arduous task, which few authors have undertaken. Gemma\n(KIC11026764) is a young subgiant with $45$ precise oscillation modes observed\nwith Kepler, making it the ideal benchmark for seismic modelling. Aims. This\nstudy is aimed at modelling the subgiant Gemma, taking advantage of most of the\nprecise seismic information available. This approach enables us to pave the way\nfor the seismic modelling of evolved solar-like stars and provide the relevant\ninsights into their structural evolution. Methods. Using our\nLevenberg-Marquardt stellar modelling tool, we built a family of models\nrepresentative of Gemma's measured seismic indicators obtained via our seismic\ntool, EGGMiMoSA. We studied the structural information these indicators hold by\ncarefully varying stellar parameters. We also complemented the characterisation\nwith information held by \\who indicators and non-seismic data. Results. From\nthe extensive set of models we built and using most of the seismic information\nat hand, including two $\\ell=1$ and one $\\ell=2$ mixed modes, we were able to\nprobe the chemical transition at the hydrogen-burning shell. Indeed, we have\ndemonstrated that among our models, only the ones with the sharpest chemical\ngradient are able to reproduce all the seismic information considered. One\npossibility to account for such a gradient is the inclusion of a significant\namount of overshooting, namely $\\alpha_{\\textrm{ov}}=0.17$, which is unexpected\nfor low-mass stars such as Gemma (expected mass of about $1.15~M_{\\odot}$).",

In contrast, local clustering heuristically groups data based\non detailed point relationships, but it tends to be less coherence and\nefficient. To bridge the gap between these two concepts and utilize the\nstrengths of both, we propose Graph Probability Aggregation Clustering (GPAC),\na graph-based fuzzy clustering algorithm. GPAC unifies the global clustering\nobjective function with a local clustering constraint. The entire GPAC\nframework is formulated as a multi-constrained optimization problem, which can\nbe solved using the Lagrangian method. Through the optimization process, the\nprobability of a sample belonging to a specific cluster is iteratively\ncalculated by aggregating information from neighboring samples within the\ngraph.

First, an end-to-end DRL formulation is\nestablished, which maps raw sensor data directly to control commands, thereby\nensuring compatibility with unstructured environments. Under this formulation,\na novel network, Transqer, is introduced. The Transqer enables online DRL\nlearning from temporal transitions, substantially enhancing decision-making in\ndynamic scenarios. To facilitate scalable training of Transqer with diverse\ndata, an efficient simulation platform E-Sparrow, along with a data\naugmentation technique leveraging symmetric invariance, are developed.\nComparative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, alongside assessments\nof generalizability, scalability, and real-time performance, were conducted to\nvalidate the effectiveness of ColorDynamic. Results indicate that our approach\nachieves a success rate exceeding 90% while exhibiting real-time capacity\n(1.2-1.3 ms per planning). Additionally, ablation studies were performed to\ncorroborate the contributions of individual components. Building on this, the\nOkayPlan-ColorDynamic (OPCD) navigation system is presented, with simulated and\nreal-world experiments demonstrating its superiority and applicability in\ncomplex scenarios. The codebase and experimental demonstrations have been\nopen-sourced on our website to facilitate reproducibility and further research.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies Frobenius subalgebra posets in abelian monoidal categories\nand shows that, under general conditions--satisfied in all semisimple tensor\ncategories over the complex field--they collapse to lattices through a rigidity\ninvariance perspective. Based on this, we extend Watatani's finiteness theorem\nfor intermediate subfactors by proving that, under a weak positivity\nassumption--met by all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--and\na compatibility condition--fulfilled by all pivotal ones--the lattices arising\nfrom connected Frobenius algebras are finite. We also derive a non-semisimple\nversion via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal\nangle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange\nrelation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories.\n  Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the\nIno-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras\nholds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without\nrequiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple\nHopf algebra H, we prove that H* is a Frobenius algebra object in Rep(H) and\nhas a finite number of rigid invariant Frobenius subalgebras. Finally, we\nexplore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex\noperator algebras, algebraic geometry and speculations on quantum arithmetic\ninvolving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma\nfunctions, and RH.",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations are a valuable research and layout tool for fluid flow\nproblems, yet repeated evaluations of parametrized problems, necessary to solve\noptimization problems, can be very costly. One option to speed up this process\nis to replace the costly CFD model with a cheaper one. These surrogate models\ncan be either data-driven or they can also rely on reduced basis (RB) methods\nto speed up the calculations. In contrast to data-driven surrogate models, the\nlatter are not based on regression techniques but are still aimed at explicitly\nsolving the conservation equations. Their speed-up comes from a strong\nreduction of the solution space, which results in much smaller algebraic\nsystems that need to be solved. Within this work, an RB model, suited for\nslightly compressible flow, is presented and tested on different flow\nconfigurations. The model is stabilized using a Petrov-Galerkin method with\ntrial and test function spaces of different dimensionality to generate stable\nresults for a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The presented model applies to\ngeometrically and physically parametrized flow problems. Finally, a data-driven\napproach was used to extend it to turbulent flows.",

In the Landau gauge, all two-point\nfield-strength correlations $g^2 \\langle\nG^a_{\\mu\\nu}(s)G^b_{\\alpha\\beta}(s')\\rangle$ are described by these two\nquantities, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries.\nCuriously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\\perp}(r)$ is\nfound to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same point of\n$r=0$. The parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\\parallel}(r)$ is\nalways positive. In the infrared region, $C_{\\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\\parallel}(r)$\nstrongly cancel each other, which leads to an approximate cancellation for the\nsum of the field-strength correlations as $\\sum_{\\mu, \\nu} \\langle\nG^a_{\\mu\\nu}(s)G^a_{\\mu\\nu}(s')\\rangle \\propto C_{\\perp}(|s-s'|)+\nC_{\\parallel}(|s-s'|) \\simeq 0$. Next, we decompose the perpendicular-type\ncolor-magnetic correlation $C_{\\perp}(r)$ into quadratic, cubic and quartic\nterms of the gluon field $A_\\mu$. The quadratic term is always negative, which\nis explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator $\\langle\nA^a_\\mu(s)A^a_\\mu(s')\\rangle \\propto e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\\equiv |s-s'|$ in the\nLandau gauge.

However, the existing\ntrajectory-based approaches are usually limited to only generating the motion\ntrajectory of the controlled object and ignoring the dynamic interactions\nbetween the controlled object and its surroundings. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a Chain-of-Thought-based motion controller for controllable video\ngeneration, named C-Drag. Instead of directly generating the motion of some\nobjects, our C-Drag first performs object perception and then reasons the\ndynamic interactions between different objects according to the given motion\ncontrol of the objects. Specifically, our method includes an object perception\nmodule and a Chain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module. The object\nperception module employs visual language models to capture the position and\ncategory information of various objects within the image. The\nChain-of-Thought-based motion reasoning module takes this information as input\nand conducts a stage-wise reasoning process to generate motion trajectories for\neach of the affected objects, which are subsequently fed to the diffusion model\nfor video synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce a new video object interaction\n(VOI) dataset to evaluate the generation quality of motion controlled video\ngeneration methods. Our VOI dataset contains three typical types of\ninteractions and provides the motion trajectories of objects that can be used\nfor accurate performance evaluation.

Additionally, a training\nmodule, LMHLDpart, is designed to accommodate landslide detection tasks at\nvarying scales and to alleviate the issue of catastrophic forgetting in\nmulti-task learning.

A folklore upper bound based on\nthe birthday-paradox states: For any collection $X$ of $s$-sparse vectors in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$, there exists a linear map to $\\mathbb{R}^{O(s^2)}$ which\n\\emph{exactly} preserves the norm of $99\\%$ of the vectors in $X$ in any\n$\\ell_p$ norm (as opposed to the usual setting where guarantees hold for all\nvectors). We give lower bounds showing that this is indeed optimal in many\nsettings: any oblivious linear map satisfying similar average-case guarantees\nmust map to $\\Omega(s^2)$ dimensions. The same lower bound also holds for a\nwide class of smooth maps, including `encoder-decoder schemes', where we\ncompare the norm of the original vector to that of a smooth function of the\nembedding. These lower bounds reveal a separation result, as an upper bound of\n$O(s \\log(d))$ is possible if we instead use arbitrary (possibly non-smooth)\nfunctions, e.g., via compressed sensing algorithms.\n  Given these lower bounds, we specialize to sparse \\emph{non-negative}\nvectors. For a dataset $X$ of non-negative $s$-sparse vectors and any $p \\ge\n1$, we can non-linearly embed $X$ to $O(s\\log(|X|s)/\\epsilon^2)$ dimensions\nwhile preserving all pairwise distances in $\\ell_p$ norm up to $1\\pm \\epsilon$,\nwith no dependence on $p$. Surprisingly, the non-negativity assumption enables\nmuch smaller embeddings than arbitrary sparse vectors, where the best known\nbounds suffer exponential dependence.

Interest rates in these protocols are set\nalgorithmically and fluctuate according to the supply and demand for liquidity.\nIn this study, we propose an agent-based model tailored to a decentralized\nlending protocol and determine the optimal interest rate model. When the\nresponses of the agents are linear with respect to the interest rate, the\noptimal solution is derived from a system of Riccati-type ODEs. For nonlinear\nbehaviors, we propose a Monte-Carlo estimator, coupled with deep learning\ntechniques, to approximate the optimal solution.

    "abstract": "Theoretical work on sequential choice and large-scale experiments in online\nranking and voting systems has demonstrated that social influence can have a\ndrastic impact on social and technological systems. Yet, the effect of social\ninfluence on online rating systems remains understudied and the few existing\ncontributions suggest that online ratings would self-correct given enough\nusers. Here, we propose a new framework for studying the effect of social\ninfluence on online ratings. We start from the assumption that people are\ninfluenced linearly by the observed average rating, but postulate that their\npropensity to be influenced varies. When the weight people assign to the\nobserved average depends only on their own latent rating, the resulting system\nis linear, but the long-term rating may substantially deviate from the true\nmean rating. When the weight people put on the observed average depends on both\ntheir own latent rating and the observed average rating, the resulting system\nis non-linear, and may support multiple equilibria, suggesting that ratings\nmight be path-dependent and deviations dramatic. Our results highlight\npotential limitations in crowdsourced information aggregation and can inform\nthe design of more robust online rating systems.",

To fill\nthis gap, we propose the MIND (Multi-agent INner Dialogue), a novel paradigm\nthat provides more immersive psychological healing environments. Considering\nthe strong generative and role-playing ability of LLM agents, we predefine an\ninteractive healing framework and assign LLM agents different roles within the\nframework to engage in interactive inner dialogues with users, thereby\nproviding an immersive healing experience. We conduct extensive human\nexperiments in various real-world healing dimensions, and find that MIND\nprovides a more user-friendly experience than traditional paradigms.

    "abstract": "Large Language Model (LLM) at mobile devices and its potential applications\nnever fail to fascinate. However, on-device LLM fine-tuning poses great\nchallenges due to extremely high memory requirements and slow training speeds.\nEven with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods that update only a\nsmall subset of parameters, resource-constrained mobile devices cannot afford\nthem. In this paper, we propose MobiLLM to enable memory-efficient transformer\nLLM fine-tuning on a mobile device via server-assisted side-tuning.\nParticularly, MobiLLM allows the resource-constrained mobile device to retain\nmerely a frozen backbone model, while offloading the memory and\ncomputation-intensive backpropagation of a trainable side-network to a\nhigh-performance server. Unlike existing fine-tuning methods that keep\ntrainable parameters inside the frozen backbone, MobiLLM separates a set of\nparallel adapters from the backbone to create a backpropagation bypass,\ninvolving only one-way activation transfers from the mobile device to the\nserver with low-width quantization during forward propagation. In this way, the\ndata never leaves the mobile device while the device can remove backpropagation\nthrough the local backbone model and its forward propagation can be paralyzed\nwith the server-side execution. Thus, MobiLLM preserves data privacy while\nsignificantly reducing the memory and computational burdens for LLM\nfine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MobiLLM can\nenable a resource-constrained mobile device, even a CPU-only one, to fine-tune\nLLMs and significantly reduce convergence time and memory usage.",

However, existing code generation\nbenchmarks fail to capture the diverse feedback encountered in multi-turn\ninteractions, limiting our ability to evaluate LLMs in these contexts. To\naddress this gap, we present a set of novel benchmarks that explicitly model\nthe quality of feedback provided to code generation LLMs. Our contributions are\nthreefold: First, we introduce CONVCODEWORLD, a novel and reproducible\nenvironment for benchmarking interactive code generation. CONVCODEWORLD\nsimulates 9 distinct interactive code generation scenarios while systematically\ncombining three types of feedback: (a) compilation feedback; (b) execution\nfeedback with varying test coverage; (c) verbal feedback generated by GPT-4o\nwith different levels of expertise. Second, we introduce CONVCODEBENCH, a fast,\nstatic version of benchmark that uses pre-generated feedback logs, eliminating\nthe need for costly dynamic verbal feedback generation while maintaining strong\nSpearman's rank correlations (0.82 to 0.99) with CONVCODEWORLD. Third,\nextensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs including\nR1-Distill on CONVCODEWORLD reveal key insights: (a) LLM performance varies\nsignificantly based on the feedback provided; (b) Weaker LLMs, with sufficient\nfeedback, can outperform single-turn results of state-of-the-art LLMs without\nfeedback; (c) Training on a specific feedback combination can limit an LLM's\nability to utilize unseen combinations; (d) LLMs solve problems in fewer turns\n(high MRR) may not solve as many problems overall (high Recall), and vice\nversa.

Anomaly detection methods also fall\ninto this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal\nsamples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However, our study found that the\ndiffusion model suffers from severe ``faithfulness hallucination'' and\n``catastrophic forgetting'', which can't meet the unpredictable pattern\nincrements. To mitigate the above problems, we propose a continual diffusion\nmodel that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning.\nGradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying\nthe gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a\ndouble-edged sword, it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov\nprocess. Hence, we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method\nbased on the transitive property of linear representation, which consumes tiny\nmemory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally, considering the risk of\n``over-fitting'' to normal images of the diffusion model, we propose an\nanomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion\nmodel. For continual anomaly detection, ours achieves first place in 17/18\nsettings on MVTec and VisA. Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/FuNz-0/One-for-More",

Their\nperformances largely depend on the prompt quality. While recent methods show\nthat visual descriptions generated by large language models (LLMs) enhance the\ngeneralization of VLMs, class-specific prompts may be inaccurate or lack\ndiscrimination due to the hallucination in LLMs. In this paper, we aim to find\nvisually discriminative prompts for fine-grained categories with minimal\nsupervision and no human-in-the-loop. An evolution-based algorithm is proposed\nto progressively optimize language prompts from task-specific templates to\nclass-specific descriptions. Unlike optimizing templates, the search space\nshows an explosion in class-specific candidate prompts. This increases prompt\ngeneration costs, iterative times, and the overfitting problem. To this end, we\nfirst introduce several simple yet effective edit-based and evolution-based\noperations to generate diverse candidate prompts by one-time query of LLMs.\nThen, two sampling strategies are proposed to find a better initial search\npoint and reduce traversed categories, saving iteration costs. Moreover, we\napply a novel fitness score with entropy constraints to mitigate overfitting.\nIn a challenging one-shot image classification setting, our method outperforms\nexisting textual prompt-based methods and improves LLM-generated description\nmethods across 13 datasets.

To address this, we present a training-free framework for\nmissing modality completion that leverages large multimodal models (LMMs). Our\napproach, termed the \"Knowledge Bridger\", is modality-agnostic and integrates\ngeneration and ranking of missing modalities. By defining domain-specific\npriors, our method automatically extracts structured information from available\nmodalities to construct knowledge graphs. These extracted graphs connect the\nmissing modality generation and ranking modules through the LMM, resulting in\nhigh-quality imputations of missing modalities. Experimental results across\nboth general and medical domains show that our approach consistently\noutperforms competing methods, including in OOD generalization. Additionally,\nour knowledge-driven generation and ranking techniques demonstrate superiority\nover variants that directly employ LMMs for generation and ranking, offering\ninsights that may be valuable for applications in other domains.",

Compared to typical car-like\nrobots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability.\nHowever, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex\nkinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To\nefficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic\nconstraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique\nfeatures, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth\ntrajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an\nefficiently solvable spatio-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal\nwith deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance,\nwe fully leverage the collision-free regions of the environment, directly\napplying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not\nrequires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex\napproximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization,\navoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the\noptimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search\nalgorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization.\nExtensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nseveral-fold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while\nalso ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration.

The inferred energy increment rate of the burst\nphoton gained from the corona is up to $\\sim$40\\%, even though the bursts have\ndifferent peak fluxes and locate at different accretion rates.

Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly through Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs), have significantly enhanced the accuracy of these\nforecasts by capturing complex spatio-temporal dynamics. However, the\nscalability of GNNs remains a challenge due to their exponential growth in\nmodel complexity with increasing nodes in the graph. Existing methods to\naddress this issue, including sparsification, decomposition, and kernel-based\napproaches, either do not fully resolve the complexity issue or risk\ncompromising predictive accuracy. This paper introduces GraphSparseNet (GSNet),\na novel framework designed to improve both the scalability and accuracy of\nGNN-based traffic forecasting models. GraphSparseNet is comprised of two core\nmodules: the Feature Extractor and the Relational Compressor. These modules\noperate with linear time and space complexity, thereby reducing the overall\ncomputational complexity of the model to a linear scale. Our extensive\nexperiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphSparseNet not\nonly significantly reduces training time by 3.51x compared to state-of-the-art\nlinear models but also maintains high predictive performance.",

We employ the quarterly Romanian GDP\ndataset from 1995 to 2023 and build a LSTM network to forecast to next 4 values\nin the series. Our findings suggest that machine learning models, consistently\noutperform traditional econometric models in terms of predictive accuracy and\nflexibility",

    "abstract": "Large-scale interconnected networks, composed of multiple low-dimensional\nsubsystems, serve as a crucial framework for modeling a wide range of\nreal-world applications. Despite offering computational scalability, the\ninherent interdependence among subsystems poses significant challenges to the\neffective control of such networks. This complexity is further exacerbated in\nthe presence of external perturbations and when the dynamics of individual\nsubsystems, and accordingly the overall network, are unknown-scenarios\nfrequently encountered in modern practical applications. In this paper, we\ndevelop a compositional data-driven approach to ensure the global asymptotic\nstability (GAS) of large-scale nonlinear networks with unknown mathematical\nmodels, subjected to external perturbations. To achieve this, we first gather\ntwo sets of data from each unknown nominal subsystem without perturbation,\nwhich we refer to as two input-state trajectories. The collected data from each\nsubsystem is then utilized to design an input-to-state stable (ISS) Lyapunov\nfunction and its corresponding controller for each nominal subsystem, rendering\nthem ISS. To cancel the effect of external perturbations on the dynamic of each\nsubsystem, and accordingly the whole network, we then design a local integral\nsliding mode (ISM) controller for each subsystem using the collected data.\nUnder a small-gain compositional condition, we employ data-driven ISS Lyapunov\nfunctions designed for subsystems and construct a control Lyapunov function for\nthe network, rendering the assurance of GAS property over the nominal network.\nWe then extend this compositional result to network perturbed models,\ndemonstrating that the synthesized ISM controllers ensure the GAS property even\nin the presence of perturbations.",

    "abstract": "In the post-AlphaGo era, there has been a renewed interest in search\ntechniques such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), particularly in their\napplication to Large Language Models (LLMs). This renewed attention is driven\nby the recognition that current next-token prediction models often lack the\nability for long-term planning. Is it possible to instill search-like abilities\nwithin the models to enhance their planning abilities without relying on\nexplicit search? We propose DiffuSearch , a model that does \\textit{implicit\nsearch} by looking into the future world via discrete diffusion modeling. We\ninstantiate DiffuSearch on a classical board game, Chess, where explicit search\nis known to be essential. Through extensive controlled experiments, we show\nDiffuSearch outperforms both the searchless and explicit search-enhanced\npolicies. Specifically, DiffuSearch outperforms the one-step policy by 19.2%\nand the MCTS-enhanced policy by 14% on action accuracy. Furthermore,\nDiffuSearch demonstrates a notable 30% enhancement in puzzle-solving abilities\ncompared to explicit search-based policies, along with a significant 540 Elo\nincrease in game-playing strength assessment. These results indicate that\nimplicit search via discrete diffusion is a viable alternative to explicit\nsearch over a one-step policy.

The accuracy of FR models has significantly improved in recent\nyears due to the availability of large-scale human face datasets. However,\ndirectly using these datasets can inevitably lead to privacy and legal\nproblems. Generating synthetic data to train FR models is a feasible solution\nto circumvent these issues. While existing synthetic-based face recognition\nmethods have made significant progress in generating identity-preserving\nimages, they are severely plagued by context overfitting, resulting in a lack\nof intra-class diversity of generated images and poor face recognition\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a framework to Unleash Inherent\ncapability of the model to enhance intra-class diversity for synthetic face\nrecognition, shortened as UIFace. Our framework first trains a diffusion model\nthat can perform sampling conditioned on either identity contexts or a\nlearnable empty context. The former generates identity-preserving images but\nlacks variations, while the latter exploits the model's intrinsic ability to\nsynthesize intra-class-diversified images but with random identities. Then we\nadopt a novel two-stage sampling strategy during inference to fully leverage\nthe strengths of both types of contexts, resulting in images that are diverse\nas well as identitypreserving. Moreover, an attention injection module is\nintroduced to further augment the intra-class variations by utilizing attention\nmaps from the empty context to guide the sampling process in ID-conditioned\ngeneration. Experiments show that our method significantly surpasses previous\napproaches with even less training data and half the size of synthetic dataset.\nThe proposed UIFace even achieves comparable performance with FR models trained\non real datasets when we further increase the number of synthetic identities.",

Existing point cloud attackers are tailored to specific\nmodels, iteratively optimizing perturbations based on gradients in either a\nwhite-box or black-box setting. Despite their promising attack performance,\nthey often struggle to produce transferable adversarial samples due to\noverfitting the specific parameters of surrogate models. To overcome this\nissue, we shift our focus to the data distribution itself and introduce a novel\napproach named NoPain, which employs optimal transport (OT) to identify the\ninherent singular boundaries of the data manifold for cross-network point cloud\nattacks. Specifically, we first calculate the OT mapping from noise to the\ntarget feature space, then identify singular boundaries by locating\nnon-differentiable positions.

Inspired by the success of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) in text generation, we propose ChatMol, a novel\napproach that leverages LLMs for molecule design across diverse constraint\nsettings. Initially, we crafted a molecule representation compatible with LLMs\nand validated its efficacy across multiple online LLMs. Afterwards, we\ndeveloped specific prompts geared towards diverse constrained molecule\ngeneration tasks to further fine-tune current LLMs while integrating feedback\nlearning derived from property prediction. Finally, to address the limitations\nof LLMs in numerical recognition, we referred to the position encoding method\nand incorporated additional encoding for numerical values within the prompt.\nExperimental results across single-property, substructure-property, and\nmulti-property constrained tasks demonstrate that ChatMol consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including VAE and RL-based methods.\nNotably, in multi-objective binding affinity maximization task, ChatMol\nachieves a significantly lower KD value of 0.25 for the protein target ESR1,\nwhile maintaining the highest overall performance, surpassing previous methods\nby 4.76%. Meanwhile, with numerical enhancement, the Pearson correlation\ncoefficient between the instructed property values and those of the generated\nmolecules increased by up to 0.49. These findings highlight the potential of\nLLMs as a versatile framework for molecule generation, offering a promising\nalternative to traditional latent space and RL-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "In many random phenomena, such as life-testing experiments and environmental\ndata (like rainfall data), there are often positive values and an excess of\nzeros, which create modeling challenges. In life testing, immediate failures\nresult in zero lifetimes, often due to defects or poor quality, especially in\nelectronics and clinical trials. These failures, called zero inliers, are\ndifficult to model using standard approaches. When studying extreme values in\nthe above scenarios, a key issue is selecting an appropriate threshold for\naccurate tail approximation of the population using asymptotic models. While\nsome extreme value mixture models address threshold estimation and tail\napproximation, conventional parametric and non-parametric bulk and generalised\nPareto distribution (GPD) approaches often neglect inliers, leading to\nsuboptimal results. This paper introduces a framework for modeling extreme\nevents and inliers using the GPD, addressing threshold uncertainty and\neffectively capturing inliers at zero. The model's parameters are estimated\nusing the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, ensuring optimal\nprecision. Through simulation studies and real-world applications, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the traditional\nmethods, which typically neglect inliers at the origin.",

    "abstract": "Machine unlearning allows data owners to erase the impact of their specified\ndata from trained models. Unfortunately, recent studies have shown that\nadversaries can recover the erased data, posing serious threats to user\nprivacy. An effective unlearning method removes the information of the\nspecified data from the trained model, resulting in different outputs for the\nsame input before and after unlearning. Adversaries can exploit these output\ndifferences to conduct privacy leakage attacks, such as reconstruction and\nmembership inference attacks. However, directly applying traditional defenses\nto unlearning leads to significant model utility degradation. In this paper, we\nintroduce a Compressive Representation Forgetting Unlearning scheme (CRFU),\ndesigned to safeguard against privacy leakage on unlearning. CRFU achieves data\nerasure by minimizing the mutual information between the trained compressive\nrepresentation (learned through information bottleneck theory) and the erased\ndata, thereby maximizing the distortion of data. This ensures that the model's\noutput contains less information that adversaries can exploit. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a remembering constraint and an unlearning rate to balance the\nforgetting of erased data with the preservation of previously learned\nknowledge, thereby reducing accuracy degradation. Theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates that CRFU can effectively defend against privacy leakage attacks.\nOur experimental results show that CRFU significantly increases the\nreconstruction mean square error (MSE), achieving a defense effect improvement\nof approximately $200\\%$ against privacy reconstruction attacks with only\n$1.5\\%$ accuracy degradation on MNIST.",

After bronchoscopic placement the valves reduce the flow of air into\ntargeted areas of the lung, causing collapse, and allowing the remainder of the\nlung to function more effectively.\n  Approach: X-ray Velocimetry is a novel method that uses X-ray images taken\nduring a breath to track lung motion, producing 3D maps of local ventilation.\nHealthy sheep received a CT scan and underwent X-ray Velocimetry imaging before\nand after endobronchial valves were placed in the lung. Sheep were imaged again\nwhen the endobronchial valves were removed after 14 days.\n  Main results: X-ray Velocimetry enabled visualisation and quantification of a\nreduction of airflow to the areas downstream of the endobronchial valves, both\nin areas where collapse was and was not visible in CT. Changes to ventilation\nwere also clearly visible in the remainder of the lungs.\n  Significance: This preclinical study has shown X-ray Velocimetry is capable\nof detecting changes to ventilation caused by endobronchial valve placement,\npaving the way towards use in patients.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (RALMs) have\ndemonstrated their efficacy in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing\nevaluation benchmarks often assume a single optimal approach to leveraging\nretrieved information, failing to account for varying user needs. This paper\nintroduces a novel evaluation framework that systematically assesses RALMs\nunder three user need cases-Context-Exclusive, Context-First, and\nMemory-First-across three distinct context settings: Context Matching,\nKnowledge Conflict, and Information Irrelevant. By varying both user\ninstructions and the nature of retrieved information, our approach captures the\ncomplexities of real-world applications where models must adapt to diverse user\nrequirements. Through extensive experiments on multiple QA datasets, including\nHotpotQA, DisentQA, and our newly constructed synthetic URAQ dataset, we find\nthat restricting memory usage improves robustness in adversarial retrieval\nconditions but decreases peak performance with ideal retrieval results and\nmodel family dominates behavioral differences. Our findings highlight the\nnecessity of user-centric evaluations in the development of retrieval-augmented\nsystems and provide insights into optimizing model performance across varied\nretrieval contexts. We will release our code and URAQ dataset upon acceptance\nof the paper.",

It\nexplores aspects such as students' usage behavior, motivational factors, and\nuncertainties regarding the impact of AI tools on academia in the future.\nFurthermore, the social climate in sports studies is being investigated to\nprovide a general overview of the current situation of the students in Germany.\nData collection took place between August and November 2023, addressing all\nsports departments at German universities, with a total of 262 students\nparticipating. Our Findings indicate that students have a strong interest in\nusing AI tools in their studies, expecting them to improve their overall\nacademic performance, understand the complexity of scientific approaches, and\nsave time. They express confidence that the proliferation of AI will not\ncompromise their critical thinking skills.

    "abstract": "In recent years, squeezed cat codes with resilience to specific types of loss\nhave been proposed as a step toward realizing fault-tolerant optical quantum\ncomputers. However, error correction for squeezed cat codes requires a strong\nnonlinearity, which makes its implementation challenging with current\ntechnology. We propose a novel hybrid code that combines the squeezed cat code\nand the polarization qubit. First, we propose a generation method and a\nuniversal gate set that can be implemented with a linear optical system. Then,\nwe show the superiority of the hybrid squeezed cat code over the hybrid cat\ncode and the squeezed cat code through numerical simulations. These results\ndemonstrate that the hybrid squeezed cat code is a promising candidate as a new\nresource for optical quantum information processing.",

    "abstract": "Prompt tuning has become a popular strategy for adapting Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs) to zero/few-shot visual recognition tasks. Some prompting\ntechniques introduce prior knowledge due to its richness, but when learnable\ntokens are randomly initialized and disconnected from prior knowledge, they\ntend to overfit on seen classes and struggle with domain shifts for unseen\nones. To address this issue, we propose the InPK model, which infuses\nclass-specific prior knowledge into the learnable tokens during initialization,\nthus enabling the model to explicitly focus on class-relevant information.\nFurthermore, to mitigate the weakening of class information by multi-layer\nencoders, we continuously reinforce the interaction between learnable tokens\nand prior knowledge across multiple feature levels. This progressive\ninteraction allows the learnable tokens to better capture the fine-grained\ndifferences and universal visual concepts within prior knowledge, enabling the\nmodel to extract more discriminative and generalized text features. Even for\nunseen classes, the learned interaction allows the model to capture their\ncommon representations and infer their appropriate positions within the\nexisting semantic structure. Moreover, we introduce a learnable text-to-vision\nprojection layer to accommodate the text adjustments, ensuring better alignment\nof visual-text semantics. Extensive experiments on 11 recognition datasets show\nthat InPK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple\nzero/few-shot image classification tasks.",

At PeV energies, the spectral shape is not\nyet well measured due to the low statistics of the data. This analysis probes\nthe gap between 1 PeV and 10 PeV by using high-energy downgoing muon neutrinos.\nTo reject the large atmospheric muon background, two complementary techniques\nare combined. The first technique selects events with high stochasticity to\nreject atmospheric muon bundles whose stochastic energy losses are smoothed due\nto high muon multiplicity. The second technique vetoes atmospheric muons with\nthe IceTop surface array. Using 9 years of data, we found two neutrino\ncandidate events in the signal region, consistent with expectation from\nbackground, each with relatively high signal probabilities. A joint maximum\nlikelihood estimation is performed using this sample and an independent\n9.5-year sample of tracks to measure the neutrino spectrum. A likelihood ratio\ntest is done to compare the single power-law (SPL) vs. SPL+cutoff hypothesis;\nthe SPL+cutoff model is not significantly better than the SPL. High-energy\nastrophysical objects from four source catalogs are also checked around the\ndirection of the two events. No significant coincidence was found.",

The effectiveness of text\nsummarization models has been significantly enhanced in a variety of technical\ndomains because of advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep\nLearning (DL). Despite this, the process of summarizing textual information\ncontinues to be significantly constrained by the intricate writing styles of a\nvariety of texts, which involve a range of technical complexities. Text\nsummarization techniques can be broadly categorized into two main types:\nabstractive summarization and extractive summarization. Extractive\nsummarization involves directly extracting sentences, phrases, or segments of\ntext from the content without making any changes. On the other hand,\nabstractive summarization is achieved by reconstructing the sentences, phrases,\nor segments from the original text using linguistic analysis. Through this\nstudy, a linguistically diverse categorizations of text summarization\napproaches have been addressed in a constructive manner. In this paper, the\nauthors explored existing hybrid techniques that have employed both extractive\nand abstractive methodologies.

Previous studies showed that defects\nin these materials generate shallow electronic states.

This work reveals that electronic states at surfaces\nof prototypical CsPbBr$_3$ are energetically distributed at room temperature\nakin to well-passivated inorganic semiconductors, even when covalent bonds\nremain cleaved and undercoordinated. Specifically, a striking tendency for\nshallow surface states is found with approximately 70% of surface-state\nenergies appearing within 0.2 eV or ${\\approx}8k_\\text{B}T$ from the\nvalence-band edge. While these findings do not rule out occurrence of deep\ntraps per se, they show that even when surface states appear deeper in the gap,\nthey are not energetically isolated and are less likely to act as traps. We\nachieve this result by accelerating first-principles calculations via machine\nlearning and show that the unique atomic dynamics in these materials render the\nformation of deep electronic states at their surfaces unlikely.

However, the auditing of machine\nunlearning processes remains significantly underexplored. Although some\nexisting methods offer unlearning auditing by leveraging backdoors, these\nbackdoor-based approaches are inefficient and impractical, as they necessitate\ninvolvement in the initial model training process to embed the backdoors. In\nthis paper, we propose a TAilored Posterior diffErence (TAPE) method to provide\nunlearning auditing independently of original model training. We observe that\nthe process of machine unlearning inherently introduces changes in the model,\nwhich contains information related to the erased data. TAPE leverages\nunlearning model differences to assess how much information has been removed\nthrough the unlearning operation. Firstly, TAPE mimics the unlearned posterior\ndifferences by quickly building unlearned shadow models based on first-order\ninfluence estimation. Secondly, we train a Reconstructor model to extract and\nevaluate the private information of the unlearned posterior differences to\naudit unlearning. Existing privacy reconstructing methods based on posterior\ndifferences are only feasible for model updates of a single sample. To enable\nthe reconstruction effective for multi-sample unlearning requests, we propose\ntwo strategies, unlearned data perturbation and unlearned influence-based\ndivision, to augment the posterior difference.

The emergence of\naugmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies has heightened the\ndemand for real-time performance in these applications. However, current\nstate-of-the-art models often exhibit promising results at the expense of\nsubstantial computational overhead. In this paper, we present a query-optimized\nreal-time Transformer (QORT-Former), the first Transformer-based real-time\nframework for 3D pose estimation of two hands and an object. We first limit the\nnumber of queries and decoders to meet the efficiency requirement. Given\nlimited number of queries and decoders, we propose to optimize queries which\nare taken as input to the Transformer decoder, to secure better accuracy: (1)\nwe propose to divide queries into three types (a left hand query, a right hand\nquery and an object query) and enhance query features (2) by using the contact\ninformation between hands and an object and (3) by using three-step update of\nenhanced image and query features with respect to one another. With proposed\nmethods, we achieved real-time pose estimation performance using just 108\nqueries and 1 decoder (53.5 FPS on an RTX 3090TI GPU).

Example attribution is another form of explanation that\nassigns weights to the training examples, such that their scalar product with\nthe labels equals the prediction. The latter may provide valuable complementary\ninformation to feature attribution, in particular in cases where the features\nare not easily interpretable. Current example-based explanation techniques have\ntargeted a few model types only, such as k-nearest neighbors and random\nforests. In this work, a technique for obtaining example-based explanations\nfrom deep neural networks (EBE-DNN) is proposed. The basic idea is to use the\ndeep neural network to obtain an embedding, which is employed by a k-nearest\nneighbor classifier to form a prediction; the example attribution can hence\nstraightforwardly be derived from the latter. Results from an empirical\ninvestigation show that EBE-DNN can provide highly concentrated example\nattributions, i.e., the predictions can be explained with few training\nexamples, without reducing accuracy compared to the original deep neural\nnetwork. Another important finding from the empirical investigation is that the\nchoice of layer to use for the embeddings may have a large impact on the\nresulting accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumor diagnosis is a challenging task for clinicians in the modern\nworld. Among the major reasons for cancer-related death is the brain tumor.\nGliomas, a category of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, encompass diverse\nsubregions. For accurate diagnosis of brain tumors, precise segmentation of\nbrain images and quantitative analysis are required. A fully automatic approach\nto glioma segmentation is required because the manual segmentation process is\nlaborious, prone to mistakes, as well as time-consuming. Modern techniques for\nsegmenting gliomas are based on fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs),\nwhich can either use two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D)\nconvolutions. Nevertheless, 3D convolutions suffer from computational costs and\nmemory demand, while 2D convolutions cannot fully utilize the spatial insights\nof volumetric clinical imaging data. To obtain an optimal solution, it is vital\nto balance the computational efficiency of 2D convolutions along with the\nspatial accuracy of 3D convolutions. This balance can potentially be realized\nby developing an advanced model to overcome these challenges. The 2D and 3D\nmodels implemented here are based on UNET architecture, Inception, and ResNet\nmodels. The research work has been implemented on the BraTS 2018, 2019, and\n2020 datasets. The best performer of all the models' evaluations metrics for\nproposed methodologies offer superior potential in terms of the effective\nsegmentation of gliomas. The ResNet model has resulted in 98.91% accuracy for\n3D segmentation and 99.77 for 2D segmentations. The dice scores for 2D and 3D\nsegmentations are 0.8312 and 0.9888, respectively. This model can be applied to\nvarious other medical applications with fine-tuning, thereby aiding clinicians\nin brain tumor analysis and improving the diagnosis process effectively.",

However, they are\ncomputationally expensive and time-consuming when applied to complex image\ndata. The reason is that they focus on fitting globally optimal paths in\nhigh-dimensional spaces, directly generating images as next step on the path\nusing complex networks through self-supervised training, which typically\nresults in a gap with the global optimum. Meanwhile, most diffusion models are\nin the same path subspace generated by weights $f_A(t)$ and $f_B(t)$, as they\nfollow the paradigm ($x_t = f_A(t)x_{Img} + f_B(t)\\epsilon$).

To address these problems, this paper proposes a\nlightweight contrastive distilled hashing (LCDH) for cross-modal retrieval, by\ninnovatively bridging the offline and online cross-modal hashing by similarity\nmatrix approximation in a knowledge distillation framework. Specifically, in\nthe teacher network, LCDH first extracts the cross-modal features by the\ncontrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), which are further fed into an\nattention module for representation enhancement after feature fusion. Then, the\noutput of the attention module is fed into a FC layer to obtain hash codes for\naligning the sizes of similarity matrices for online and offline training. In\nthe student network, LCDH extracts the visual and textual features by\nlightweight models, and then the features are fed into a FC layer to generate\nbinary codes. Finally, by approximating the similarity matrices, the\nperformance of online hashing in the lightweight student network can be\nenhanced by the supervision of coexistent semantic relevance that is distilled\nfrom the teacher network.

A central problem in the design of\napplications in this environment is to find a beneficial mapping of tasks to\nprocessing units. While there are various approaches to task mapping, few can\ndeal with high heterogeneity or applications with a high number of tasks and\nmany dependencies. In addition, streaming aspects of FPGAs are generally not\nconsidered. We present a new general task mapping principle based on graph\ndecompositions and model-based evaluation that can find beneficial mappings\nregardless of the complexity of the scenario. We apply this principle to create\na high-quality and reasonably efficient task mapping algorithm using\nseries-parallel decompositions. For this, we present a new algorithm to compute\na forest of series-parallel decomposition trees for general DAGs. We compare\nour decomposition-based mapping algorithm with three mixed-integer linear\nprograms, one genetic algorithm and two variations of the Heterogeneous\nEarliest Finish Time (HEFT) algorithm. We show that our approach can generate\nmappings that lead to substantially higher makespan improvements than the HEFT\nvariations in complex environments while being orders of magnitude faster than\na mapper based on genetic algorithms or integer linear programs.",

Therefore, the authenticity and\nuniversality of the hard X-ray {\\bf deficit} may be in question. To investigate\nthis suspicion, Insight-HXMT performed cadence observations during the low/hard\nstate of 4U~1608--52 in September 2022 and detected 10 thermonuclear X-ray\nbursts. Two of these bursts show a double-peaked structure in the soft X-ray\nband, which could be caused by the high temperature of the burst emission and a\nmarginal photospheric radius expansion (PRE) around the burst peak time. This\nis indicated by their peak fluxes being up to the Eddington limit and having a\nlarge color factor at the peak of the bursts. The hard X-ray deficit is\nsignificantly observed during bursts at $>$ 30 keV. Furthermore, the fraction\nof this deficit shows saturation at 50\\% for the first 8 bursts. This\nsaturation may indicate that the corona is layered and only a part of the\ncorona is cooled by the bursts. For example, the part close to the NS surface\nis cooled while the rest remains intact during bursts. This result provides a\nclue to the geometry of the corona, e.g., a possible scenario is that the\ncorona has two forms: a quasi-spheric corona between the NS and the disk, and a\ndisk-corona on both surfaces of the disk.",

This approach simultaneously estimates player skills and map\ndifficulties, exploiting each of them to improve the estimation of the other,\nexploitng the relation of multiple scores by different players on the same map,\nor on different maps by the same player. While we have been unable to prove or\ncharacterize theoretical convergence, the implementation exhibits convergent\nbehaviour to low estimation error in all instances, producing accurate results.\nAn informal qualitative evaluation involving experienced Beat Saber community\nmembers was carried out, comparing the difficulty estimations output by our\nalgorithm with their personal perspectives on the difficulties of different\nmaps. There was a significant alignment with player perceived perceptions of\ndifficulty and with other existing methods for estimating difficulty.

Most existing methods mainly rely on\nthe networked unconfoundedness assumption, which guarantees the identification\nof networked effects.

To address this issue, we leverage the\nrich interaction patterns between units in networks, which provide valuable\ninformation for recovering these latent confounders. Building on this insight,\nwe develop a confounder recovery framework that explicitly characterizes three\ncategories of latent confounders in networked settings: those affecting only\nthe unit, those affecting only the unit's neighbors, and those influencing\nboth. Based on this framework, we design a networked effect estimator using\nidentifiable representation learning techniques.

    "abstract": "Bulk two dimensional (2D) superconductivity has gained considerable attention\ndue to its intricate interplay between symmetry breaking, nontrivial topology,\n2D phase fluctuations, and unconventional superconductivity. However, certain\nintercalated layered superconductors, despite their short c-axis\nsuperconducting coherence length, have been misclassified as anisotropic\nthree-dimensional (3D) superconductors. Here, we investigate (Li,Fe)OHFeSe\nsuperconductors with varying degrees of interlayer misalignment, revealing\nsample-dependent superconducting dimensionality while consistently observing\nBerezinskii Kosterlitz Thouless (BKT) transitions. To resolve this discrepancy,\nwe develop an extended 2D Tinkham model that quantitatively captures the\nblurring effects induced by interlayer misalignment. We further demonstrate the\nvalidity of this model in both (Li,Fe)OHFeSe and cetyltrimethyl ammonium (CTA+)\nintercalated (CTA)0.5SnSe2 superconductors, highlighting its broad\napplicability. This work provides valuable insights into bulk 2D\nsuperconductivity and establishes an extended 2D Tinkham model for\nquantitatively extracting intrinsic superconducting properties in intercalated\nlayered superconductors, particularly those exhibiting significant interlayer\nmisalignments.",

However, current LLMs\nstruggle to consistently provide effective responses to client speeches,\nlargely due to the lack of supervision from high-quality real psycho-counseling\ndata, whose content is typically inaccessible due to client privacy concerns.\nFurthermore, the quality of therapists' responses in available sessions can\nvary significantly based on their professional training and experience.\nAssessing the quality of therapists' responses remains an open challenge. In\nthis work, we address these challenges by first proposing a set of professional\nand comprehensive principles to evaluate therapists' responses to client\nspeeches. Using these principles, we create a preference dataset,\nPsychoCounsel-Preference, which contains 36k high-quality preference comparison\npairs. This dataset aligns with the preferences of professional\npsychotherapists, providing a robust foundation for evaluating and improving\nLLMs in psycho-counseling. Experiments on reward modeling and preference\nlearning demonstrate that PsychoCounsel-Preference is an excellent resource for\nLLMs to acquire essential skills for responding to clients in a counseling\nsession. Our best-aligned model, PsychoCounsel-Llama3-8B, achieves an\nimpressive win rate of 87% against GPT-4o.

Here, we conducted a systematic\ninvestigation of P-N compounds using first-principles calculations, uncovering\na series of structurally similar stable phases, C2/m-PNx (x = 6, 8, 10, 12,\n14), in which N forms zig-zag N chains similar to those in Ch-N. In P-N\ncompounds, the longest zig-zag N chain that can theoretically remain stable\nunder ambient pressure is the N chain composed of 14 N atoms in C2/m-PN14. If\nthe N chain continues to grow, inter-chain vibrational imaginary frequencies\nwill arise in the system. Notably, N chains with an even number of atoms are\nmore likely to be energetically favorable. The five C2/m-PNx phases and one\nmetastable phase (R-PN6) exhibit both remarkable stability and excellent\ndetonability at ambient pressure, positioning them as promising candidates for\nhigh-energy-density materials.

In this\nwork, we propose two distinct methods for manipulating topological phase\ntransitions in magnetic materials. First, by varying the strength of electron\ncorrelation effects, we induce a series of topological state transitions within\nthe EuM$_2$X$_2$ (M = Zn, Cd; X = P, As, Sb) family of Zintl materials,\nincluding magnetic topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) and magnetic Dirac\nsemimetals. Our findings indicate that strong electron correlation effects tend\nto influence the emergence of topological phases. Second, by reducing the\nelectronegativity of the pnictogen X (from P to As and Sb), we observe a\nsimilar transition from trivial insulator to magnetic Dirac semimetal or\nmagnetic TCI. This suggests that weaker electronegativity favors the emergence\nof topological phases. Furthermore, we establish a Heisenberg model to describe\nthe magnetic interactions of the EuM$_2$X$_2$ system, based on which we perform\nMonte Carlo simulations of specific heat and magnetic susceptibility, yielding\nN\\'eel temperatures that perfectly match experimental data. This suggests that\nthe local magnetic moment framework provides an accurate description of the\nmagnetization behavior in this family of materials.

    "abstract": "Whether and how to regulate AI is now a central question of governance.\nAcross academic, policy, and international legal circles, the European Union is\nwidely treated as the normative leader in this space. Its regulatory framework,\nanchored in the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Services and\nMarkets Acts, and the AI Act, is often portrayed as a principled model grounded\nin fundamental rights. This Article challenges that assumption. We argue that\nthe rights-based narrative surrounding EU AI regulation mischaracterizes the\nlogic of its institutional design. While rights language pervades EU legal\ninstruments, its function is managerial, not foundational. These rights operate\nas tools of administrative ordering, used to mitigate technological disruption,\nmanage geopolitical risk, and preserve systemic balance, rather than as\nexpressions of moral autonomy or democratic consent. Drawing on comparative\ninstitutional analysis, we situate EU AI governance within a longer tradition\nof legal ordering shaped by the need to coordinate power across fragmented\njurisdictions. We contrast this approach with the American model, which\nreflects a different regulatory logic rooted in decentralized authority,\nsectoral pluralism, and a constitutional preference for innovation and\nindividual autonomy. Through case studies in five key domains -- data privacy,\ncybersecurity, healthcare, labor, and disinformation -- we show that EU\nregulation is not meaningfully rights-driven, as is often claimed. It is\ninstead structured around the containment of institutional risk. Our aim is not\nto endorse the American model but to reject the presumption that the EU\napproach reflects a normative ideal that other nations should uncritically\nadopt.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation effectively addresses the imbalanced-small sample data\n(ISSD) problem in hyperspectral image classification (HSIC). While most\nmethodologies extend features in the latent space, few leverage text-driven\ngeneration to create realistic and diverse samples. Recently, text-guided\ndiffusion models have gained significant attention due to their ability to\ngenerate highly diverse and high-quality images based on text prompts in\nnatural image synthesis. Motivated by this, this paper proposes\nTxt2HSI-LDM(VAE), a novel language-informed hyperspectral image synthesis\nmethod to address the ISSD in HSIC. The proposed approach uses a denoising\ndiffusion model, which iteratively removes Gaussian noise to generate\nhyperspectral samples conditioned on textual descriptions. First, to address\nthe high-dimensionality of hyperspectral data, a universal variational\nautoencoder (VAE) is designed to map the data into a low-dimensional latent\nspace, which provides stable features and reduces the inference complexity of\ndiffusion model. Second, a semi-supervised diffusion model is designed to fully\ntake advantage of unlabeled data. Random polygon spatial clipping (RPSC) and\nuncertainty estimation of latent feature (LF-UE) are used to simulate the\nvarying degrees of mixing. Third, the VAE decodes HSI from latent space\ngenerated by the diffusion model with the language conditions as input. In our\nexperiments, we fully evaluate synthetic samples' effectiveness from\nstatistical characteristics and data distribution in 2D-PCA space.\nAdditionally, visual-linguistic cross-attention is visualized on the pixel\nlevel to prove that our proposed model can capture the spatial layout and\ngeometry of the generated data.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose an accurate and fast mini-batch approach for large graph\ntransductive learning, namely topological compensation (TOP), which obtains the\noutputs of the whole message passing solely through MP-IB, without the costly\nMP-OB. The major pillar of TOP is a novel concept of message invariance, which\ndefines message-invariant transformations to convert costly MP-OB into fast\nMP-IB. This ensures that the modified MP-IB has the same output as the whole\nmessage passing. Experiments demonstrate that TOP is significantly faster than\nexisting mini-batch methods by order of magnitude on vast graphs (millions of\nnodes and billions of edges) with limited accuracy degradation.",

    "abstract": "Active learning (AL), which iteratively queries the most informative examples\nfrom a large pool of unlabeled candidates for model training, faces significant\nchallenges in the presence of open-set classes. Existing methods either\nprioritize query examples likely to belong to known classes, indicating low\nepistemic uncertainty (EU), or focus on querying those with highly uncertain\npredictions, reflecting high aleatoric uncertainty (AU). However, they both\nyield suboptimal performance, as low EU corresponds to limited useful\ninformation, and closed-set AU metrics for unknown class examples are less\nmeaningful. In this paper, we propose an Energy-based Active Open-set\nAnnotation (EAOA) framework, which effectively integrates EU and AU to achieve\nsuperior performance. EAOA features a $(C+1)$-class detector and a target\nclassifier, incorporating an energy-based EU measure and a margin-based energy\nloss designed for the detector, alongside an energy-based AU measure for the\ntarget classifier. Another crucial component is the target-driven adaptive\nsampling strategy. It first forms a smaller candidate set with low EU scores to\nensure closed-set properties, making AU metrics meaningful. Subsequently,\nexamples with high AU scores are queried to form the final query set, with the\ncandidate set size adjusted adaptively. Extensive experiments show that EAOA\nachieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high query precision\nand low training overhead.

This study aims to\nsystematically investigate potential security weaknesses in the codebases of\nprominent open-source ADS projects using CodeQL, a static code analysis tool.\nThe goal is to identify common vulnerabilities, their distribution and\npersistence across versions to enhance the security of ADS. We selected three\nrepresentative open-source ADS projects, Autoware, AirSim, and Apollo, based on\ntheir high GitHub star counts and Level 4 autonomous driving capabilities.\nUsing CodeQL, we analyzed multiple versions of these projects to identify\nvulnerabilities, focusing on CWE categories such as CWE-190 (Integer Overflow\nor Wraparound) and CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation). We also tracked the\nlifecycle of these vulnerabilities across software versions. This approach\nallows us to systematically analyze vulnerabilities in projects, which has not\nbeen extensively explored in previous ADS research. Our analysis revealed that\nspecific CWE categories, particularly CWE-190 (59.6%) and CWE-20 (16.1%), were\nprevalent across the selected ADS projects.

    "abstract": "Image deblurring aims to restore high-quality images by removing undesired\ndegradation. Although existing methods have yielded promising results, they\neither overlook the varying degrees of degradation across different regions of\nthe blurred image, or they approximate nonlinear function properties by\nstacking numerous nonlinear activation functions. In this paper, we propose a\ndifferential handling network (DHNet) to perform differential processing for\ndifferent blur regions. Specifically, we design a Volterra block (VBlock) to\nintegrate the nonlinear characteristics into the deblurring network, avoiding\nthe previous operation of stacking the number of nonlinear activation functions\nto map complex input-output relationships. To enable the model to adaptively\naddress varying degradation degrees in blurred regions, we devise the\ndegradation degree recognition expert module (DDRE). This module initially\nincorporates prior knowledge from a well-trained model to estimate spatially\nvariable blur information. Consequently, the router can map the learned\ndegradation representation and allocate weights to experts according to both\nthe degree of degradation and the size of the regions. Comprehensive\nexperimental results show that DHNet effectively surpasses state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Reliable multimodal learning in the presence of noisy data is a widely\nconcerned issue, especially in safety-critical applications. Many reliable\nmultimodal methods delve into addressing modality-specific or cross-modality\nnoise. However, they fail to handle the coexistence of both types of noise\nefficiently. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive consideration for noise at\nboth global and individual levels limits their reliability. To address these\nissues, a reliable multimodal classification method dubbed Multi-Level\nInter-Class Confusing Information Removal Network (MICINet) is proposed.\nMICINet achieves the reliable removal of both types of noise by unifying them\ninto the concept of Inter-class Confusing Information (\\textit{ICI}) and\neliminating it at both global and individual levels. Specifically, MICINet\nfirst reliably learns the global \\textit{ICI} distribution through the proposed\n\\textbf{\\textit{Global \\textbf{ICI} Learning Module}}. Then, it introduces the\n\\textbf{\\textit{Global-guided Sample ICI Learning module}} to efficiently\nremove global-level \\textit{ICI} from sample features utilizing the learned\nglobal \\textit{ICI} distribution.

Moreover, the lack of consistency creates opportunities for\nunethical practices in academia, such as counting total of citations\noriginating from the same article in different languages. This highlights the\nimportance of a more comprehensive approach to evaluating research beyond\ncitation and document counts. Collaboration among publishers, authors, and\nother stakeholders is essential to fostering greater understanding and\npreventing misconceptions in the academic landscape.",

Yet conventional methods remain hardware-agnostic, limited to bit-width\nconstraints, and do not account for intrinsic circuit characteristics such as\nthe timing behaviors and energy profiles of Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units.\nThis disconnect from circuit-level behavior limits the ability to exploit\navailable timing margins and energy-saving opportunities, reducing the overall\nefficiency of deployment on modern accelerators.\n  To address these limitations, we propose HALO, a versatile framework for\nHardware-Aware Post-Training Quantization (PTQ). Unlike traditional methods,\nHALO explicitly incorporates detailed hardware characteristics, including\ncritical-path timing and power consumption, into its quantization approach.\nHALO strategically selects weights with low critical-path-delays enabling\nhigher operational frequencies and dynamic frequency scaling without disrupting\nthe architecture's dataflow. Remarkably, HALO achieves these improvements with\nonly a few dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) adjustments, ensuring\nsimplicity and practicality in deployment. Additionally, by reducing switching\nactivity within the MAC units, HALO effectively lowers energy consumption.\nEvaluations on accelerators such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Graphics\nProcessing Units (GPUs) demonstrate that HALO significantly enhances inference\nefficiency, achieving average performance improvements of 270% and energy\nsavings of 51% over baseline quantization methods, all with minimal impact on\naccuracy.",

Unlike in SU(3), where charge $+2$\nvortices are simply elementary vortices with reversed orientations in\nspacetime, these possibilities are physically distinct in SU(4). Visualizations\nof the vortex structure in three-dimensional slices reveal the various ways in\nwhich doubly charged objects manifest, as the convergence and matching of\nelementary vortices or as isolated doubly charged loops. An algorithm is\ndescribed to classify every doubly charged chain as one of these three types. A\ncollection of vortex statistics is considered to quantify the vortex structure.\nMany of these pertain to the novel doubly charged objects, including their\nrelative proportions and chain lengths, which are analyzed to highlight the\ndifferences between each chain type. Three different lattice spacings are\nemployed to investigate the approach to the continuum limit. Vortex matching\nchains are found to be shorter on average but also more prevalent than vortex\nconvergences, ascribed to their interpretation as extended center monopoles. In\naddition, the lengths of both vortex convergences and vortex matchings are\nobserved to follow an exponential distribution, allowing the introduction of a\nconstant probability for a doubly charged chain to split into two elementary\nvortices as it propagates.

In\nthis study, we explore Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS) microscopy as a\nunique solution for mechanical sensing of single micro-objects. PARS uses probe\nbeam scattering/reflectivity measurements to capture non-radiative relaxation\nprocess following the absorption of a pulse of light by a micro-object. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that, when operating at GHz-range bandwidth, PARS\ncan trace the sub-nanosecond dynamics of non-radiative relaxation in individual\nmicro-objects, capturing both photoacoustic (PA) pressure propagation and\nthermal diffusion. This GHz-range measurement, in conjunction with a developed\ndescriptive model, enables the experimental extraction of a minimally distorted\nPA temporal profile. The PA temporal profile contain information on the ratio\nbetween the absorbing object's sound speed and its characteristic diameter,\noffering a new dimension in PARS microscopy. This enables the assessment of the\nobject's elastic properties, deduced from its speed of sound. Additionally, it\noffers the potential for sizing objects with known sound speeds.

Traditional VR-VQA methods trained on static\ndatasets with limited distortion diversity struggle to balance correlation and\nprecision. This becomes particularly critical when generalizing to diverse VR\ncontent and continually adapting to dynamic and evolving video distribution\nvariations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for\nassessing the perceptual quality of VR videos, Adaptive Score Alignment\nLearning (ASAL). ASAL integrates correlation loss with error loss to enhance\nalignment with human subjective ratings and precision in predicting perceptual\nquality. In particular, ASAL can naturally adapt to continually changing\ndistributions through a feature space smoothing process that enhances\ngeneralization to unseen content. To further improve continual adaptation to\ndynamic VR environments, we extend ASAL with adaptive memory replay as a novel\nContinul Learning (CL) framework. Unlike traditional CL models, ASAL utilizes\nkey frame extraction and feature adaptation to address the unique challenges of\nnon-stationary variations with both the computation and storage restrictions of\nVR devices. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for VR-VQA and its CL\ncounterpart, introducing new data splits and evaluation metrics. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ASAL outperforms recent strong baseline models,\nachieving overall correlation gains of up to 4.78\\% in the static joint\ntraining setting and 12.19\\% in the dynamic CL setting on various datasets.\nThis validates the effectiveness of ASAL in addressing the inherent challenges\nof VR-VQA.Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/ASAL_CVQA.",

Unlike\nmost existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability by adjusting\nthe position and/or orientation of array elements, the proposed ER-FAS enables\ndirect control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for\ndynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS\narchitecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and\ncorresponding wireless channel models are established. Based on this ER-FAS\nchannel model, a low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to\njointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array\nelement. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the\nbeamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and\n(ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. These results confirm that the\nproposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency in both near-field\nand far-field scenarios compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further\nvalidate this design, we fabricate prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and\narray, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and\nsoftware-controlled fluidic channels.

While MIM maximizes mutual information between inputs and latent\nvariables and encourages clustering of latent codes, its representations\nunderperform on discriminative tasks compared to state-of-the-art alternatives.\ncMIM addresses this limitation by enforcing global discriminative structure\nwhile retaining MIM's generative strengths. We present two main contributions:\n(1) we propose cMIM, a contrastive extension of MIM that eliminates the need\nfor positive data augmentation and is robust to batch size, unlike\nInfoNCE-based methods; (2) we introduce {informative embeddings}, a general\ntechnique for extracting enriched representations from encoder--decoder models\nthat substantially improve discriminative performance without additional\ntraining, and which apply broadly beyond MIM.

In-situ elemental abundances of\nthe slow solar wind suggest that it originates from initially closed field\nlines that become open. Coronal hole boundary regions are a potential source of\nslow solar wind as there open field lines interact with the closed loops\nthrough interchange reconnection. Our primary aim is to quantify the role of\ninterchange reconnection at the boundaries of coronal holes. To this end, we\nhave measured the relative abundances of different elements at these\nboundaries. Reconnection is expected to modulate the relative abundances\nthrough the first ionization potential (FIP) effect.

To account for the temperature structure of the observed region\nwe computed the differential emission measure (DEM). Using the DEM we were able\nto infer the ratio between coronal and photospheric abundances, known as the\nFIP bias.

The FIP bias variation in the boundary region around the coronal\nhole has an approximate width of 30-50 Mm, comparable to the size of\nsupergranules.

Here we develop a\nmethod of computational alchemy in which interatomic interactions are modified\nto continuously and systematically vary two key parameters defining SSS, atomic\nsize misfit and elastic stiffness misfit, over a maximally wide range of misfit\nvalues. The resulting model alloys are subjected to massive Molecular Dynamics\nsimulations reproducing full complexity of plastic strength response in\nconcentrated single-phase body-centered cubic solid solutions.

In\ncontrast to real CCAs in which every constituent element comes with its\nspecific combination of atomic size and elastic stiffness, our alchemical model\nalloys sample the space of misfit parameters continuously thus augmenting the\nmuch more constrained and inevitably spotty experimental exploration of the CCA\ndesign space. Taking advantage of unique to our approach ability to define\nalloy misfit parameters, our computational study demonstrates how useful\ninsights can be gained from intentionally unrealistic alchemical models.
