    "abstract": "We investigate new contributions to the $HZZ$ vertex from the Flavor Changing\nNeutral Current (FCNC) involving the Higgs and $Z$ bosons. Our calculations\nreveal that the form factors $h_2^V$ and $h_3^V$ ($V=H$, $Z$) can be induced\nthrough these couplings, and we present our results in terms of the\nPassarino-Veltman scalar functions. Using the current limits on\n$H\\overline{t}c$ and $Z\\overline{t}c$ couplings, we determine that the new\ncontributions to the $CP$-conserving form factor $h_2^V$ are small compared to\nthe Standard Model (SM) predictions. However, for the $CP$-violating form\nfactor $h_3^V$, the contributions can reach values as high as $10^{-6}$, five\norders of magnitude larger than in the SM. Furthermore, we examine how these\nresults influence the left-right asymmetries in the processes $H^\\ast\\to ZZ$\nand $Z^\\ast\\to ZH$. Our findings suggest that significant deviations from SM\npredictions may occur when considering FCNC contributions.",

Therefore, present a deceptive sequential decision-making\nframework that not only conceals sensitive information, but actively misleads\nadversaries about it. We model autonomous systems as Markov decision processes,\nwith adversaries using inverse reinforcement learning to recover reward\nfunctions. To counter them, we present three regularization strategies for\npolicy synthesis problems that actively deceive an adversary about a system's\nreward. ``Diversionary deception'' leads an adversary to draw any false\nconclusion about the system's reward function. ``Targeted deception'' leads an\nadversary to draw a specific false conclusion about the system's reward\nfunction. ``Equivocal deception'' leads an adversary to infer that the real\nreward and a false reward both explain the system's behavior. We show how each\nform of deception can be implemented in policy optimization problems and\nanalytically bound the loss in total accumulated reward induced by deception.\nNext, we evaluate these developments in a multi-agent setting.

    "abstract": "Rare diseases are challenging to diagnose due to limited patient data and\ngenetic diversity. Despite advances in variant prioritization, many cases\nremain undiagnosed. While large language models (LLMs) have performed well in\nmedical exams, their effectiveness in diagnosing rare genetic diseases has not\nbeen assessed. To identify causal genes, we benchmarked various LLMs for gene\nprioritization. Using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)\nclassification, we categorized patients based on phenotypes and solvability\nlevels. As gene set size increased, LLM performance deteriorated, so we used a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy to break the task into smaller subsets. At\nbaseline, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, achieving near 30% accuracy in ranking\ncausal genes correctly. The multi-agent and HPO approaches helped distinguish\nconfidently solved cases from challenging ones, highlighting the importance of\nknown gene-phenotype associations and phenotype specificity. We found that\ncases with specific phenotypes or clear associations were more accurately\nsolved. However, we observed biases toward well-studied genes and input order\nsensitivity, which hindered gene prioritization. Our divide-and-conquer\nstrategy improved accuracy by overcoming these biases. By utilizing HPO\nclassification, novel multi-agent techniques, and our LLM strategy, we improved\ncausal gene identification accuracy compared to our baseline evaluation. This\napproach streamlines rare disease diagnosis, facilitates reanalysis of unsolved\ncases, and accelerates gene discovery, supporting the development of targeted\ndiagnostics and therapies.",

Actually, it is very difficult to find in the\nliterature a systematic heuristic that solves the problem for any desired\napplication. In this paper we present a tuning parameters heuristic for the\nbiases of event cameras, for tasks that require small objects detection in\nstaring scenarios. The main purpose of the heuristic is to squeeze the camera's\npotential, optimize its performance, and expand its detection capabilities as\nmuch as possible.

    "abstract": "Research into the polychromy of Greek and Roman sculptures has surged to\nexplore the hypothesis that ancient sculptures were originally not pristine\nwhite but adorned with colors. Multispectral and multimodal imaging techniques\nhave been crucial in studying painted surfaces, revealing polychromies even in\ntraces. In fact, imaging techniques, such as reflectance and fluorescence, can\nidentify different materials and map inhomogeneities, guiding further\ninvestigations such as Raman, XRays Fluorescence, and Fourier Transform\nInfraRed Spectroscopy (FTIR) to investigate residual colors. However, this\napproach may underestimate the original polychromies' extent over the complex\narticulation of a sculptured surface. This study proposes a methodology to\nanalyze the original appearance of ancient sculptures using reality-based 3D\nmodels with textures not limited to those visible to the naked eye. We employ\nVisible Reflected Imaging (VIS) and Ultraviolet-induced Fluorescence Imaging\n(UVF). From the UVF and VIS datasets, the underlying 3D model is built by means\nof photogrammetry. Through raw data processing, images taken with different\nilluminating sources are successfully aligned and processed, creating a single\n3D model with multiple textures mapped onto the same bi-dimensional space. The\npixel-to-pixel correspondence of different textures allows for the\nimplementation of a classification algorithm that can directly map its outcome\nonto the 3D model surface. This enables conservators to deepen their\nunderstanding of artifact preservation, observe mate-rial distribution in\ndetail, and correlate this with 3D geometrical data. In this study, we\nexperiment with this approach on an ancient Roman sculpture of Artemis,\nconserved at the Archeological and Art Museum of Maremma (MAAM) in Grosseto,\nItaly.",

However, these approaches\nare typically restricted to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB\ndomain underexplored. To address this, we propose the Reversible Unfolding\nNetwork (RUN), which applies reversible strategies across both mask and RGB\ndomains through a theoretically grounded framework, enabling accurate\nsegmentation. RUN first formulates a novel COS model by incorporating an extra\nresidual sparsity constraint to minimize segmentation uncertainties. The\niterative optimization steps of the proposed model are then unfolded into a\nmultistage network, with each step corresponding to a stage. Each stage of RUN\nconsists of two reversible modules: the Segmentation-Oriented Foreground\nSeparation (SOFS) module and the Reconstruction-Oriented Background Extraction\n(ROBE) module. SOFS applies the reversible strategy at the mask level and\nintroduces Reversible State Space to capture non-local information. ROBE\nextends this to the RGB domain, employing a reconstruction network to address\nconflicting foreground and background regions identified as distortion-prone\nareas, which arise from their separate estimation by independent modules. As\nthe stages progress, RUN gradually facilitates reversible modeling of\nforeground and background in both the mask and RGB domains, directing the\nnetwork's attention to uncertain regions and mitigating false-positive and\nfalse-negative results. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior\nperformance of RUN and highlight the potential of unfolding-based frameworks\nfor COS and other high-level vision tasks.

These formulations consider\nprojection operations to extend solution variables from the sharp liquid--vapor\ninterface into the computational domain. Benchmark examples, including film\nboiling, confirm the accuracy and versatility of the model.

Notably, only NII and OIII emission is\nobserved in the optical spectra, suggesting H-poor material. Previous work\nsuggested the possibility that the properties of GCU7 could be explained by the\ntidal disruption of a horizontal branch star by an intermediate-mass black\nhole. We use new data to show that the lack of evolution in the X-ray or\noptical properties of the source over the last 20 years rules out this\nscenario. Instead, we use CLOUDY simulations to demonstrate that the optical\nemission lines are consistent with an outflow from an ultra-compact X-ray\nbinary where a compact object - likely a neutron star (NS) - is accreting above\nthe Eddington limit from a helium white dwarf (He WD). This binary would have\ndynamically formed from a direct collision between a NS and a red giant, or\nelse via an exchange interaction. The ULX is predicted to evolve to lower mass\ntransfer rates over time and eventually become a doppelganger to the\nwell-studied ultra-compact X-ray binaries in Galactic GCs such as 4U 1820-30.\nThese results show the utility of using extragalactic GCs to study short-lived\nphases in dynamical binary evolution that occur too rarely to be observed in\nGalactic clusters.",

Given a formal\nspecification of the safe behavior, models of target configurations are\nderived, which capture relevant effects of sensors, actuators and computing\nplatforms.

We used hardness-ratio diagrams\nto distinguish between different spectral states and conducted spectral\nanalysis of all the multi-epoch datasets, as well as the source in the observed\nspectral states. Our hardness analysis indicates that the source gradually\nevolved into a harder state (2013-2016) compared to the previous epochs\n(2000-2001). Our spectral modeling implies that the relativistically broadened\niron emission from the innermost accretion disk is associated with a\nnear-maximal SMBH spin ($a=0.98^{+0.02}_{-0.12}$) in all the datasets, even\nthough the hard state was present in 17% of them, and a consistent spin is also\nfound in different spectral states. In addition, the narrow, bright Fe\nK$\\alpha$ line from distant regions has an excess velocity of $620^{+80}_{-70}$\nkm s$^{-1}$ relative to the rest frame, implying that some distant layers of\nthe disk could be twisted. Our results suggest that, despite long-term changes\nin the X-ray brightness of NGC 3783, likely caused by eclipsing material, the\nrelativistic reflection can be constrained thanks to the substantial counts\nprovided by multi-epoch observations, while a warped disk structure may be\npresent.",

    "abstract": "Many modern wireless devices with accurate positioning needs also have access\nto vision sensors, such as a camera, radar, and Light Detection and Ranging\n(LiDAR). In scenarios where wireless-based positioning is either inaccurate or\nunavailable, using information from vision sensors becomes highly desirable for\ndetermining the precise location of the wireless device. Specifically, vision\ndata can be used to estimate distances between the target (where the sensors\nare mounted) and nearby landmarks. However, a significant challenge in\npositioning using these measurements is the inability to uniquely identify\nwhich specific landmark is visible in the data. For instance, when the target\nis located close to a lamppost, it becomes challenging to precisely identify\nthe specific lamppost (among several in the region) that is near the target.\nThis work proposes a new framework for target localization using range\nmeasurements to multiple proximate landmarks. The geometric constraints\nintroduced by these measurements are utilized to narrow down candidate landmark\ncombinations corresponding to the range measurements and, consequently, the\ntarget's location on a map. By modeling landmarks as a marked Poisson point\nprocess (PPP), we show that three noise-free range measurements are sufficient\nto uniquely determine the correct combination of landmarks in a two-dimensional\nplane. For noisy measurements, we provide a mathematical characterization of\nthe probability of correctly identifying the observed landmark combination\nbased on a novel joint distribution of key random variables.

Specifically, INT consists of two components: (1) instance-specific\nprompt generation, which progressively fliters out incorrect information in\nprompt generation; (2) semantic mask generation, which ensures each image\ninstance segmentation matches correctly the semantics of the instance-specific\nprompts. INT is validated on six datasets, including camouflaged objects and\nmedical images, demonstrating its effectiveness, robustness and scalability.",

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary discs, when externally irradiated by Far Ultraviolet (FUV)\nphotons from OBA-type stars, lose material through photoevaporative winds,\nreducing the amount of material available to form planets. Understanding the\nlink between environmental irradiation and observed disc properties requires\naccurately evaluating the FUV flux at star-hosting discs, which can be\nchallenging due stellar parallax uncertainties. In this paper, we address this\nissue proposing a novel approach: using the local density distribution of a\nstar-forming region (i.e. 2D pairwise star separations distribution) and\nassuming isotropy, we infer 3D separations between star-hosting discs and\nmassive stars. We test this approach on synthetic clusters, showing that it\nsignificantly improves the accuracy compared to previous methods. We compute\nFUV fluxes for a large sample of star-bearing discs in 7 regions within 200 pc,\n6 regions in Orion, and Serpens sub-regions, providing a publicly accessible\ncatalogue. We find that discs in regions hosting late-type B and early-type A\nstars can reach non-negligible irradiation levels for disc evolution (10-100\nG0). We investigate dust disc masses relative to FUV fluxes detecting hints of\na negative correlation when restricting to average region ages. However, we\nemphasize the need for more stellar and disc measurements at >10^2 G0 to probe\nthe dependence of disc properties on the environmental irradiation. Including\naverage interstellar dust extinction, median FUV fluxes are not significantly\nattenuated, though this result may change if high-resolution 3D dust extinction\nmaps were available. The method presented in this work is a powerful tool that\ncan be expanded to additional regions.",

Unlike DeepSeek GRPO, which eliminates the value function in favor of\npurely empirical reward estimation, Hybrid GRPO introduces a structured\nadvantage computation method that balances empirical action sampling with\nbootstrapped value estimation. This approach enhances sample efficiency,\nimproves learning stability, and mitigates variance amplification observed in\npurely empirical methods. A detailed mathematical comparison between PPO,\nDeepSeek GRPO, and Hybrid GRPO is presented, highlighting key differences in\nadvantage estimation and policy updates. Experimental validation in a\ncontrolled reinforcement learning environment demonstrates that Hybrid GRPO\nachieves superior convergence speed, more stable policy updates, and improved\nsample efficiency compared to existing methods. Several extensions to Hybrid\nGRPO are explored, including entropy-regularized sampling, hierarchical\nmulti-step sub-sampling, adaptive reward normalization, and value-based action\nselection. Beyond reinforcement learning in simulated environments, Hybrid GRPO\nprovides a scalable framework for bridging the gap between large language\nmodels (LLMs) and real-world agent-based decision-making.

Communication switches have previously been\naugmented to process collectives, e.g., IBM BlueGene and Mellanox SHArP, but\nthe support has been limited to a small set of predefined scalar operations and\ndatatypes.

However, most existing graph\nneural networks (GNNs) rely on message passing, which aggregates local\nneighborhood information iteratively and struggles to explicitly capture such\nfundamental motifs, like triangles, k-cliques, and rings. This limitation\nhinders both expressiveness and long-range dependency modeling. In this paper,\nwe introduce the Neural Graph Pattern Machine (GPM), a novel framework that\nbypasses message passing by learning directly from graph substructures. GPM\nefficiently extracts, encodes, and prioritizes task-relevant graph patterns,\noffering greater expressivity and improved ability to capture long-range\ndependencies. Empirical evaluations across four standard tasks -- node\nclassification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression --\ndemonstrate that GPM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis\nreveals that GPM exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization, desirable\nscalability, and enhanced interpretability.

However, how reliable and robust are these models at\nprocessing language with different levels of complexity? In the context of\nlearning where students may have different language backgrounds with various\nlevels of writing skills, it is critical to examine the robustness of such\nmodels to ensure that these models work equally well for text with varying\nlevels of language complexity. Coincidentally, a few (but limited) research\nstudies show that the use of language can indeed impact the performance of\nLLMs. As such, in the current study, we examined the robustness of several\nLLM-based student models that detect student self-regulated learning (SRL) in\nmath problem-solving.

    "abstract": "While cloud environments and auto-scaling solutions have been widely applied\nto traditional monolithic applications, they face significant limitations when\nit comes to microservices-based architectures. Microservices introduce\nadditional challenges due to their dynamic and spatiotemporal characteristics,\nwhich require more efficient and specialized auto-scaling strategies.\nCentralized auto-scaling for the entire microservice application is\ninsufficient, as each service within a chain has distinct specifications and\nperformance requirements. Therefore, each service requires its own dedicated\nauto-scaler to address its unique scaling needs effectively, while also\nconsidering the dependencies with other services in the chain and the overall\napplication. This paper presents a combination of control theory, machine\nlearning, and heuristics to address these challenges. We propose an adaptive\nauto-scaling framework, STaleX, for microservices that integrates\nspatiotemporal features, enabling real-time resource adjustments to minimize\nSLO violations. STaleX employs a set of weighted\nProportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers for each service, where\nweights are dynamically adjusted based on a supervisory unit that integrates\nspatiotemporal features. This supervisory unit continuously monitors and\nadjusts both the weights and the resources allocated to each service. Our\nframework accounts for spatial features, including service specifications and\ndependencies among services, as well as temporal variations in workload,\nensuring that resource allocation is continuously optimized. Through\nexperiments on a microservice-based demo application deployed on a Kubernetes\ncluster, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving\nperformance and reducing costs compared to traditional scaling methods like\nKubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with a 26.9% reduction in resource\nusage.",

In this work, we\nintroduce LMM-3DP, a framework that can integrate LMM planners and 3D skill\nPolicies. Our approach consists of three key perspectives: high-level planning,\nlow-level control, and effective integration. For high-level planning, LMM-3DP\nsupports dynamic scene understanding for environment disturbances, a critic\nagent with self-feedback, history policy memorization, and reattempts after\nfailures.

These curves are optimized based on a bilevel optimization problem,\nanticipating per-scenario responses of deterministic market-clearing problems\nand ultimately minimizing the expected cost across day-ahead and real-time\nmarkets. Although the general bilevel model is challenging to solve, we\ntheoretically prove that a single-segment bidding curve with a zero bidding\nprice is sufficient to achieve system optimality if the marginal cost of\nvariable renewable energy is zero, thus addressing the computational challenge.\nIn practice, variable renewable energy producers can be allowed to bid\nmulti-segment curves with non-zero prices. We test the bilevel framework for\nboth single- and multiple-segment bidding curves under the assumption of fixed\nbidding prices. We leverage duality theory and McCormick envelopes to derive\nthe linear programming approximation of the bilevel problem, which scales to\npractical systems such as a 1576-bus NYISO system. We benchmark the proposed\ncoordination and find absolute dominance over the baseline solution, which\nassumes that renewables agnostically bid their expected forecasts.

To the best of our knowledge, it presents the first\nsuccess at manipulating attributes of human motion data.

Therefore, we design a novel continuous, rotation-based\npose representation that enables the disentanglement of the human skeleton and\nthe motion trajectory, while still allowing an accurate reconstruction of the\noriginal anatomy. The core idea of the manipulation approach is to use a\ntransformer encoder for discovering high-level semantics, and a diffusion\nprobabilistic model for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. We show\nthat the embedding space obtained from the transformer encoder is semantically\nmeaningful and linear. This enables the manipulation of high-level attributes,\nby discovering their linear direction of change in the semantic embedding space\nand moving the embedding along said direction.

    "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of speech-enabled technologies, including virtual\nassistants, video conferencing platforms, and wearable devices, has raised\nsignificant privacy concerns, particularly regarding the inference of sensitive\nemotional information from audio data. Existing privacy-preserving methods\noften compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical\nscenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages\nfamiliar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation,\nto protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing\npopular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified\nthese features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated\ntheir effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks\nfrom diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language\nModels (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on\nthree distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation\neffectively obfuscates emotional data. Additionally, we explore the design\nprinciples for lightweight, on-device implementation to ensure broad\napplicability across various devices and platforms.",

    "abstract": "Human motion generation is a significant pursuit in generative computer\nvision with widespread applications in film-making, video games, AR/VR, and\nhuman-robot interaction. Current methods mainly utilize either diffusion-based\ngenerative models or autoregressive models for text-to-motion generation.\nHowever, they face two significant challenges: (1) The generation process is\ntime-consuming, posing a major obstacle for real-time applications such as\ngaming, robot manipulation, and other online settings. (2) These methods\ntypically learn a relative motion representation guided by text, making it\ndifficult to generate motion sequences with precise joint-level control. These\nchallenges significantly hinder progress and limit the real-world application\nof human motion generation techniques. To address this gap, we propose a simple\nyet effective architecture consisting of two key components. Firstly, we aim to\nimprove hardware efficiency and computational complexity in transformer-based\ndiffusion models for human motion generation. By customizing flash linear\nattention, we can optimize these models specifically for generating human\nmotion efficiently. Furthermore, we will customize the consistency model in the\nmotion latent space to further accelerate motion generation. Secondly, we\nintroduce Motion ControlNet, which enables more precise joint-level control of\nhuman motion compared to previous text-to-motion generation methods. These\ncontributions represent a significant advancement for text-to-motion\ngeneration, bringing it closer to real-world applications.",

Construction of polytopes with specific\nextremal structure is very difficult and time-consuming. Having an automated\ntool for the generation of such extremal examples is therefore of great value.\nWe present an Artificial Intelligence system capable of generating novel\npolytopes with very high complexity, whose abilities we demonstrate in three\ndifferent and challenging scenarios: the Hirsch Conjecture, the k-neighbourly\nproblem and the longest monotone paths problem. For each of these three\nproblems the system was able to generate novel examples, which match or surpass\nthe best previously known bounds. Our main focus was the Hirsch Conjecture,\nwhich had remained an open problem for over 50 years. The highly parallel A.I.\nsystem presented in this paper was able to generate millions of examples, with\nmany of them surpassing best known previous results and possessing properties\nnot present in the earlier human-constructed examples. For comparison, it took\nleading human experts over 50 years to handcraft the first example of a\npolytope exceeding the bound conjectured by Hirsch, and in the decade since\nhumans were able to construct only a scarce few families of such counterexample\npolytopes. With the adoption of computer-aided methods, the creation of new\nexamples of mathematical objects stops being a domain reserved only for human\nexpertise. Advances in A.I. provide mathematicians with yet another powerful\ntool in advancing mathematical knowledge.

In this paper, we consider the problem of\noptimal task offloading in MEC systems with due consideration of the timeliness\nand scalability issues under two scenarios of equitable and priority access to\nthe edge server (ES). In the first scenario, we consider a MEC system\nconsisting of $N$ devices assisted by one ES, where the devices can split task\nexecution between a local processor and the ES, with equitable access to the\nES. In the second scenario, we consider a MEC system consisting of one primary\nuser, $N$ secondary users and one ES. The primary user has priority access to\nthe ES while the secondary users have equitable access to the ES amongst\nthemselves. In both scenarios, due to the power consumption associated with\nutilizing the local resource and task offloading, the devices must optimize\ntheir actions. Additionally, since the ES is a shared resource, other users'\noffloading activity serves to increase latency incurred by each user. We thus\nmodel both scenarios using a non-cooperative game framework. However, the\npresence of a large number of users makes it nearly impossible to compute the\nequilibrium offloading policies for each user, which would require a\nsignificant information exchange overhead between users. Thus, to alleviate\nsuch scalability issues, we invoke the paradigm of mean-field games to compute\napproximate Nash equilibrium policies for each user using their local\ninformation, and further study the trade-offs between increasing information\nfreshness and reducing power consumption for each user. Using numerical\nevaluations, we show that our approach can recover the offloading trends\ndisplayed under centralized solutions, and provide additional insights into the\nresults obtained.",

We collected 98 MRIs with\nvolumetric segmentation labels for a diverse set of human subjects including\nnormal, as well as abnormal anatomy in clinical cases of stroke and disorders\nof consciousness. Approach: Training labels were generated by manually\ncorrecting initial automated segmentations for skin/scalp, skull, CSF, gray\nmatter, white matter, air cavity and extracephalic air. We developed a\nMultiAxial network consisting of three 2D U-Net that operate independently in\nsagittal, axial and coronal planes and are then combined to produce a single 3D\nsegmentation. Results: The MultiAxial network achieved a test-set Dice scores\nof 0.88+-0.04 (median +- interquartile range) on whole head segmentation\nincluding gray and white matter. This compared to 0.86 +- 0.04 for Multipriors\nand 0.79 +- 0.10 for SPM12, two standard tools currently available for this\ntask. The MultiAxial network gains in robustness by avoiding the need for\ncoregistration with an atlas. It performed well in regions with abnormal\nanatomy and on images that have been de-identified. It enables more accurate\nand robust current flow modeling when incorporated into ROAST, a widely-used\nmodeling toolbox for transcranial electric stimulation.Conclusions: We are\nreleasing a new state-of-the-art tool for whole-head MRI segmentation in\nabnormal anatomy, along with the largest volume of labeled clinical head MRIs\nincluding labels for non-brain structures.

    "abstract": "In cardiac cells, structural organization is an important indicator of cell\nmaturity and healthy function. Healthy cardiomyocytes exhibit well-aligned\nmorphology with densely packed and organized sarcomeres. Immature or diseased\ncardiomyocytes typically lack this organized structure. Critically, human\ninduced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) offer a\nvaluable model for studying human cardiac cells in a controlled environment.\nHowever, these cells often exhibit a disorganized structure. In this work, we\nextend the SarcGraph computational framework -- designed to assess the\nstructural and functional behavior of hiPSC-CMs -- to better accommodate the\nstructural features of immature cells. There are two key enhancements: (1)\nincorporating a deep learning-based z-disc classifier, and (2) introducing a\nnovel ensemble graph-scoring approach. These modification significantly reduced\nfalse positive sarcomere detections in immature cells, and resulted in the\ndetection of longer myofibrils in mature samples. With this enhanced framework,\nwe analyze an open-source dataset published by the Allen Institute for Cell\nScience, where, for the first time, we are able to extract key structural\nfeatures from these data using information from each individually detected\nsarcomere. Not only are we able to use these structural features to predict\nexpert scores, but we are also able to use these structural features to\nidentify bias in expert scoring and offer an alternative unsupervised learning\napproach based on explainable clustering. These results demonstrate the\nefficacy of our modified SarcGraph in extracting biologically meaningful\nfeatures, enabling a deeper understanding of hiPSC-CM structural integrity. By\nmaking our code and tools open-source, we aim to empower the broader cardiac\nresearch community and foster further development of computational tools for\ncardiac tissue analysis.",

However, the driving mechanism and\nevolution of both bubbles are still under debate. Aims: We investigate whether\nhydrodynamic energy injections at the Galactic center, such as e.g. tidal\ndisruption events (TDEs), could have inflated both bubbles. The supermassive\nblack hole Sagittarius A* is expected to tidally disrupt a star every 10-100\nkyr, potentially leading to an outflow from the central region that drives a\nshock propagating into the Galactic halo due to its vertically declining\ndensity distribution, ultimately forming a superbubble that extends out of the\ndisk similar to the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles. Methods: We model TDEs in the\nGalaxy using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, considering\ndifferent Milky Way mass models and TDE rates. We then generate synthetic X-ray\nmaps and compare them with observations. Results: Our simulation results of a\n$\\beta$-model Milky Way halo show that superbubbles, blown for 16 Myr by\nregular energy injections at the Galactic center that occur every 100 kyr, can\nhave a shape, shell stability, size, and evolution time similar to estimates\nfor the eROSITA bubbles, and an overall structure reminiscent of the Fermi\nbubbles. The $\\gamma$-rays in our model would stem from cosmic ray interactions\nat the contact discontinuity, where they were previously accelerated by\nfirst-order Fermi acceleration at in situ shocks. Conclusions: Regular TDEs in\nthe past 10-20 Myr near the Galactic center could have driven an outflow\nresulting in both, the X-ray emission of the eROSITA bubbles and the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission of the Fermi bubbles.",

Physics-based models rely on the\nphysical understanding of the problem, subsequent mathematical formulation, and\nnumerical approximation. Data-driven models instead aim to extract relations\nbetween input and output data without arguing any causality principle\nunderlining the available data distribution. In recent years, data-driven\nmodels have been rapidly developed and popularized. Such a diffusion has been\ntriggered by a huge availability of data, increasingly cheap computing power,\nand the development of powerful ML algorithms. SciML leverages the physical\nawareness of physics-based models and the efficiency of data-driven algorithms.\nWith SciML, we can inject physics and mathematical knowledge into ML\nalgorithms.

Dynamical interactions between LP 791-18 d and c\nproduce transit timing variations (TTVs) that can be used to constrain the\nplanet masses and eccentricities. These interactions can also force a non-zero\neccentricity for LP 791-18 d, which raises its internal temperature through\ntidal heating and could drive volcanic outgassing. We present three new transit\nobservations of LP 791-18 c with Palomar/WIRC, including the most precise TTV\nmeasurements ($<$ 6 seconds) of this planet to date. We fit these times with a\nTTV model to obtain updated constraints on the mass, eccentricity, and tidal\nheat flux of LP 791-18 d. We reduce the mass uncertainty by more than a factor\nof two ($M_d$ = 0.91 $\\pm$ 0.19 $M_{\\oplus}$). We perform an updated fit\nassuming tidally damped free eccentricities and find $e_d =\n0.0011^{+0.0010}_{-0.0008}$ and $e_c = 0.0001 \\pm 0.0001$, consistent with\ncircular orbits.

The\nobserved keV halo luminosities and brightness profiles agree well with those\nexpected for CRs observed in the local interstellar medium (LISM) escaping the\ngalaxy, with energetics consistent with known CRs from SNe and/or AGN, around\ngalaxies with stellar masses $M_{\\ast}\\lesssim2\\times 10^{11}\\,M_{\\odot}$. At\nhigher masses observed X-ray luminosities are larger than predicted from IC and\nshould be dominated by hot gas.

These scales are\nwhere the physics driving galaxy evolution (feedback, chemical enrichment,\netc.) take place. Quantifying the spatially-resolved properties of galaxies,\nboth observationally and theoretically, is therefore critical to our\nunderstanding of galaxy evolution. To this end, we investigate\nspatially-resolved scaling relations within galaxies of $M_\\star>10^{9.0}$ at\n$z=0$ in IllustrisTNG. We examine both the resolved star-forming main sequence\n(rSFMS) and the resolved mass-metallicity relation (rMZR) using $1~{\\rm\nkpc}\\times1~{\\rm kpc}$ maps. We find that the rSFMS in IllustrisTNG is\nwell-described by a power-law, but is significantly shallower than the observed\nrSFMS. However, the disagreement between the rSFMS of IllustrisTNG and\nobservations is likely driven by an overestimation of AGN feedback in\nIllustrisTNG for the higher mass hosts. Conversely, the rMZR for IllustrisTNG\nhas very good agreement with observations. Furthermore, we argue that the rSFMS\nis an indirect result of the Schmidt-Kennicutt (SK) law and local gas relation,\nwhich are both independent of host galaxy properties. Finally, we expand upon a\nlocalized leaky-box model to study the evolution of idealized spaxels and find\nthat it provides a good description of these resolved relations. The degree of\nagreement, however, between idealized spaxels and simulated spaxels depends on\nthe `net' outflow rate for the spaxel, and the IllustrisTNG scaling relations\nindicate a preference for a low net outflow rate.",

Observations\nshow a substantial cold gas reservoir in the CGM, but the mechanisms driving\nits formation and evolution remain unclear. Cosmic rays (CRs), as a source of\nnon-thermal pressure, are increasingly recognized as key regulators of cold gas\ndynamics. This study explores how CRs affect cold clouds that condense from the\nhot CGM via thermal instability (TI). Using 3D CR-magnetohydrodynamic (CRMHD)\nsimulations with AREPO, we assess the impact of various CR transport models on\ncold gas evolution. Under purely advective CR transport, CR pressure\nsignificantly suppresses the collapse of thermally unstable regions, altering\nthe CGM's structure. In contrast, realistic CR transport models reveal that CRs\nescape collapsing regions via streaming and diffusion along magnetic fields,\ndiminishing their influence on the thermal and dynamic structure of the cold\nCGM. The ratio of the CR escape time to the cloud collapse time emerges as a\ncritical factor in determining the impact of CRs on TI. CRs remain confined\nwithin cold clouds when effective CR diffusion is slow which maximizes their\npressure support and inhibits collapse. Fast effective CR diffusion, as\nrealized in our 2-moment CRMHD model, facilitates rapid CR escape, reducing\ntheir stabilizing effect. This realistic CR transport model shows a wide\ndynamic range of the effective CR diffusion coefficient, ranging from $10^{29}$\nto $10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$ for thermally- to CR-dominated\natmospheres, respectively. In addition to these CR transport-related effects,\nwe demonstrate that high numerical resolution is crucial to avoid spuriously\nlarge clouds formed in low-resolution simulations, which would result in overly\nlong CR escape times and artificially amplified CR pressure support.",

High-energy activity from M-dwarfs can\ndestroy the atmospheres of these planets, which could explain the lack of\natmosphere detections to date. Volcanic outgassing has been proposed as a\nmechanism to replenish the atmospheres of tidally-heated rocky planets. L 98-59\nb, a sub-Earth transiting a nearby M dwarf, was recently identified as the most\npromising exoplanet to detect a volcanic atmosphere. We present the\ntransmission spectrum of L 98-59 b from four transits observed with JWST\nNIRSpec G395H. Although the airless model provides an adequate fit to the data\nbased on its $\\chi^2$, an SO$_2$ atmosphere is preferred by 3.6$\\sigma$ over a\nflat line in terms of the Bayesian evidence. Such an atmosphere would likely be\nin a steady state where volcanism balances escape. If so, L 98-59 b must\nexperience at least eight times as much volcanism and tidal heating per unit\nmass as Io. If volcanism is driven by runaway melting of the mantle, we predict\nthe existence of a subsurface magma ocean in L 98-59 b extending up to $R_p\\sim\n60-90\\%$. An SO$_2$-rich volcanic atmosphere on L 98-59 b would be indicative\nof an oxidized mantle with an oxygen fugacity of $f\\rm{O}_2>IW+2.7$, and it\nwould imply that L 98-59 b must have retained some of its volatile endowment\ndespite its proximity to its star.

We introduce novel jet-shape observables that allow us to\nvisualize the angular shape of the soft hadrons originating from the wakes that\nwide jets with two skinny subjets excite in a droplet of QGP, as a function of\nthe angular separation between the subjets.

    "abstract": "The 3D point cloud representation plays a crucial role in preserving the\ngeometric fidelity of the physical world, enabling more accurate complex 3D\nenvironments. While humans naturally comprehend the intricate relationships\nbetween objects and variations through a multisensory system, artificial\nintelligence (AI) systems have yet to fully replicate this capacity. To bridge\nthis gap, it becomes essential to incorporate multiple modalities. Models that\ncan seamlessly integrate and reason across these modalities are known as\nfoundation models (FMs). The development of FMs for 2D modalities, such as\nimages and text, has seen significant progress, driven by the abundant\navailability of large-scale datasets. However, the 3D domain has lagged due to\nthe scarcity of labelled data and high computational overheads. In response,\nrecent research has begun to explore the potential of applying FMs to 3D tasks,\novercoming these challenges by leveraging existing 2D knowledge. Additionally,\nlanguage, with its capacity for abstract reasoning and description of the\nenvironment, offers a promising avenue for enhancing 3D understanding through\nlarge pre-trained language models (LLMs). Despite the rapid development and\nadoption of FMs for 3D vision tasks in recent years, there remains a gap in\ncomprehensive and in-depth literature reviews. This article aims to address\nthis gap by presenting a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art methods\nthat utilize FMs for 3D visual understanding. We start by reviewing various\nstrategies employed in the building of various 3D FMs. Then we categorize and\nsummarize use of different FMs for tasks such as perception tasks. Finally, the\narticle offers insights into future directions for research and development in\nthis field.

    "abstract": "Tokenizing images into compact visual representations is a key step in\nlearning efficient and high-quality image generative models. We present a\nsimple diffusion tokenizer (DiTo) that learns compact visual representations\nfor image generation models. Our key insight is that a single learning\nobjective, diffusion L2 loss, can be used for training scalable image\ntokenizers. Since diffusion is already widely used for image generation, our\ninsight greatly simplifies training such tokenizers. In contrast, current\nstate-of-the-art tokenizers rely on an empirically found combination of\nheuristics and losses, thus requiring a complex training recipe that relies on\nnon-trivially balancing different losses and pretrained supervised models. We\nshow design decisions, along with theoretical grounding, that enable us to\nscale DiTo for learning competitive image representations. Our results show\nthat DiTo is a simpler, scalable, and self-supervised alternative to the\ncurrent state-of-the-art image tokenizer which is supervised. DiTo achieves\ncompetitive or better quality than state-of-the-art in image reconstruction and\ndownstream image generation tasks.",

Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal\ndistributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even\nmore challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities.\nSignificant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging\nfrom action recognition to semantic segmentation.

    "abstract": "Depending on the lattice geometry, the nearest-neighbor (NN) tight-binding\nmodel for free fermions gives rise to particle-hole symmetric emergent Dirac\nliquid, Fermi liquid, and flat bands near the half-filling or zero-energy on\nbipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices, respectively embedded on the flat\nand negatively curved spaces. Such noninteracting electronic fluids are\ncharacterized by a vanishing, a finite, and a diverging density of states near\nhalf-filling, respectively. A non-Hermitian generalization of this scenario\nresulting from an imbalance of the hopping amplitudes in the opposite\ndirections between any pair of NN sites continues to accommodate a real\neigenvalue spectrum over an extended non-Hermitian parameter regime. Most\nimportantly, it reduces the band width without altering the characteristic\nscaling of the density of states close to the zero-energy. Here, we show that\non two-dimensional bipartite Euclidean and hyperbolic lattices such a\nnon-Hermiticity catalyzes the formation of both charge-density-wave and\nspin-density-wave orders at weaker (in comparison to the counterparts in\nconventional or Hermitian systems) NN Coulomb and on-site Hubbard repulsions,\nrespectively. These two ordered states correspond to staggered patterns of\naverage electronic density and spin between the NN sites, respectively, and\nboth cause insulation in half-filled systems. We arrive at these conclusions by\ncombining biorthogonal quantum mechanics and lattice-based self-consistent\nnumerical mean-field analysis in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling of\nthe associated mass gaps near the zero-energy with the non-Hermitian parameter,\nand also address the finite size scaling of the order parameters specifically\non hyperbolic lattices with open boundary conditions. A robust general\nmathematical criterion for the proposed non-Hermitian catalysis mechanism for\nordered phases is showcased.",

Leveraging powerful video diffusion model priors, the inverse\nrendering model accurately estimates G-buffers from real-world videos,\nproviding an interface for image editing tasks, and training data for the\nrendering model.

The theoretical framework\nadopted is a model that invokes the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism with an Abelian\nflavor symmetry, which includes a Higgs doublet and a complex singlet. We\nconfront the free parameters of the model against theoretical and experimental\nconstraints to find the allowed parameter space, which is then used to evaluate\nthe production cross section of the flavon and the branching ratio of its decay\ninto two photons. We find promising results based on specific benchmark points,\nachieving signal significances at the level of 5$\\sigma$ for flavon masses in\nthe interval $200\\lesssim M_{H_F}\\lesssim 450$ and integrated luminosities in\nthe range $5-12$ ab$^{-1}$ at the future High-Energy LHC.

    "abstract": "Bias-variance decompositions are widely used to understand the generalization\nperformance of machine learning models. While the squared error loss permits a\nstraightforward decomposition, other loss functions - such as zero-one loss or\n$L_1$ loss - either fail to sum bias and variance to the expected loss or rely\non definitions that lack the essential properties of meaningful bias and\nvariance. Recent research has shown that clean decompositions can be achieved\nfor the broader class of Bregman divergences, with the cross-entropy loss as a\nspecial case. However, the necessary and sufficient conditions for these\ndecompositions remain an open question.\n  In this paper, we address this question by studying continuous, nonnegative\nloss functions that satisfy the identity of indiscernibles under mild\nregularity conditions. We prove that so-called $g$-Bregman divergences are the\nonly such loss functions that have a clean bias-variance decomposition. A\n$g$-Bregman divergence can be transformed into a standard Bregman divergence\nthrough an invertible change of variables. This makes the squared Mahalanobis\ndistance, up to such a variable transformation, the only symmetric loss\nfunction with a clean bias-variance decomposition. We also examine the impact\nof relaxing the restrictions on the loss functions and how this affects our\nresults.",

Existing methods typically utilize generative\nmodels to perform text-guided editing on 3D representations, such as 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, these methods are often limited to texture\nmodifications and fail when addressing geometric changes, such as editing a\ncharacter's head to turn around. Moreover, such methods lack accurate control\nover the spatial position of editing results, as language struggles to\nprecisely describe the extent of edits. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce DYG, an effective 3D drag-based editing method for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. It enables users to conveniently specify the desired editing region\nand the desired dragging direction through the input of 3D masks and pairs of\ncontrol points, thereby enabling precise control over the extent of editing.\nDYG integrates the strengths of the implicit triplane representation to\nestablish the geometric scaffold of the editing results, effectively overcoming\nsuboptimal editing outcomes caused by the sparsity of 3DGS in the desired\nediting regions. Additionally, we incorporate a drag-based Latent Diffusion\nModel into our method through the proposed Drag-SDS loss function, enabling\nflexible, multi-view consistent, and fine-grained editing. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that DYG conducts effective drag-based editing guided\nby control point prompts, surpassing other baselines in terms of editing effect\nand quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

A simple and robust strategy for variational orbital\noptimization of excited states is presented. The approach involves two steps:\n(1) a constrained energy minimization, where a subset of orbitals changed by\nthe excitation are frozen, followed by (2) a fully unconstrained saddle point\noptimization. The constrained minimization step makes it possible to identify\nthe electronic degrees of freedom along which the energy needs to be maximized,\npreventing variational collapse. Both steps of this freeze-and-release strategy\nare carried out using direct optimization algorithms with a computational\nscaling comparable to ground state calculations. Numerical tests using a\nsemilocal functional are performed on intramolecular charge transfer states of\norganic molecules and intermolecular charge transfer states of molecular\ndimers. It is shown that the freeze-and-release direct optimization (FR-DO)\napproach can successfully converge challenging charge transfer states,\novercoming limitations of conventional algorithms based on the maximum overlap\nmethod, which either collapse to lower energy, charge-delocalized solutions or\nfail to converge. While FR-DO requires more iterations on average, the overall\nincrease in computational cost is small. For the NH3-F2 dimer, it is found that\nunlike TDDFT, orbital-optimized calculations reproduce the correct long-range\ndependency of the energy with respect to the donor-acceptor separation without\nthe need to include exact exchange in the long range.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven modeling of dynamical systems is a crucial area of machine\nlearning. In many scenarios, a thorough understanding of the model's behavior\nbecomes essential for practical applications. For instance, understanding the\nbehavior of a pharmacokinetic model, constructed as part of drug development,\nmay allow us to both verify its biological plausibility (e.g., the drug\nconcentration curve is non-negative and decays to zero) and to design dosing\nguidelines. Discovery of closed-form ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can\nbe employed to obtain such insights by finding a compact mathematical equation\nand then analyzing it (a two-step approach). However, its widespread use is\ncurrently hindered because the analysis process may be time-consuming,\nrequiring substantial mathematical expertise, or even impossible if the\nequation is too complex. Moreover, if the found equation's behavior does not\nsatisfy the requirements, editing it or influencing the discovery algorithms to\nrectify it is challenging as the link between the symbolic form of an ODE and\nits behavior can be elusive. This paper proposes a conceptual shift to modeling\nlow-dimensional dynamical systems by departing from the traditional two-step\nmodeling process. Instead of first discovering a closed-form equation and then\nanalyzing it, our approach, direct semantic modeling, predicts the semantic\nrepresentation of the dynamical system (i.e., description of its behavior)\ndirectly from data, bypassing the need for complex post-hoc analysis. This\ndirect approach also allows the incorporation of intuitive inductive biases\ninto the optimization algorithm and editing the model's behavior directly,\nensuring that the model meets the desired specifications. Our approach not only\nsimplifies the modeling pipeline but also enhances the transparency and\nflexibility of the resulting models compared to traditional closed-form ODEs.",

The bursty-sn model, driven by intense and episodic SN\nexplosions, produces the highest fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR).\nConversely, the smooth-sn model, characterized by gentler SN feedback, results\nin minimal SFR variability. The hyper-sn model, featuring a more realistic\nprescription that incorporates hypernova (HN) explosions, exhibits intermediate\nvariability, closely aligning with the smooth-sn trend at lower redshifts.\nThese fluctuations in SFR significantly affect the $\\rm{M_{UV} - M_{halo}}$\nrelation, a proxy for UVLF variability. Among the models, bursty-sn produces\nthe highest UVLF variability, with a maximum value of 2.5. In contrast, the\nsmooth-sn and hyper-sn models show substantially lower variability, with\nmaximum values of 1.3 and 1.5, respectively. However, in all cases, UVLF\nvariability strongly correlates with host halo mass, with lower-mass halos\nshowing greater variability due to more effective SN feedback in their\nshallower gravitational wells. The bursty-sn model, though, results in higher\namplitudes. Variability decreases in lower mass haloes with decreasing redshift\nfor all feedback models. This study underscores the critical role of SN\nfeedback in shaping the UVLF, and highlights the mass and redshift dependence\nof its variability, suggesting that UVLF variability may alleviate the bright\ngalaxy tension observed by JWST at high redshifts.",

    "abstract": "Storing user-specific configuration files in a \"dotfiles\" repository is a\ncommon practice among software developers, with hundreds of thousands choosing\nto publicly host their repositories on GitHub. This practice not only provides\ndevelopers with a simple backup mechanism for their essential configuration\nfiles, but also facilitates sharing ideas and learning from others on how best\nto configure applications that are key to their daily workflows. However, our\ncurrent understanding of these repository sharing practices is limited and\nmostly anecdotal. To address this gap, we conducted a study to delve deeper\ninto this phenomenon. Beginning with collecting and analyzing publicly-hosted\ndotfiles repositories on GitHub, we discovered that maintaining dotfiles is\nwidespread among developers. Notably, we found that 25.8% of the top 500\nmost-starred GitHub users maintain some form of publicly accessible dotfiles\nrepository. Among these, configurations for text editors like Vim and shells\nsuch as bash and zsh are the most commonly tracked. Our analysis reveals that\nupdating dotfiles is primarily driven by the need to adjust configurations\n(63.3%) and project meta-management (25.4%). Surprisingly, we found no\nsignificant difference in the types of dotfiles observed across code churn\nhistory patterns, suggesting that the frequency of dotfile modifications\ndepends more on the developer than the properties of the specific dotfile and\nits associated application. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with\nmanaging dotfiles, including the necessity for a reliable and effective\ndeployment mechanism, and how the insights gleaned from dotfiles can inform\ntool designers by offering real-world usage information.",

In particular, models based on\nstrongly-correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum\nchemistry and materials problems, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of\nmatter. However, due to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are\nchallenging to simulate with qubit devices. Here we realize a digital quantum\nsimulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on\nreconfigurable atom arrays. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on\nKitaev's model on a honeycomb lattice, in which fermionic statistics are\nencoded using long-range entangled states. We prepare these states efficiently\nusing measurement and feedforward, realize subsequent fermionic evolution\nthrough Floquet engineering with tunable entangling gates interspersed with\natom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection.\nLeveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently\nprepare topological states across its complex phase diagram and verify the\nnon-Abelian spin liquid phase by evaluating an odd Chern number. We further\nexplore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and\ndirectly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong\ninteractions and study dynamics of the Fermi-Hubbard model on a square lattice.\nThese results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic\nsystems for materials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.",

Despite their paramount importance, uncertainties in the\nequation of state (EoS) have shrouded their internal structure. For rotating\nneutron stars, the shape of their surface is contingent upon the EoS and the\nrotational dynamics. This work proposes new universal relations regarding the\nstar's surface, employing machine-learning techniques for regression. More\nspecifically, we developed highly accurate universal relations for a neutron\nstar's eccentricity, the star's ratio of the polar to the equatorial radius,\nand the effective gravitational acceleration at both the pole and the equator.\nFurthermore, we propose an accurate theoretical formula for $(d\\log\nR(\\mu)/d\\theta)_{\\max}$. This research addresses key astronomical aspects by\nutilizing these global parameters as features for the training phase of a\nneural network. Along the way, we introduce new effective parameterizations for\neach star's global surface characteristics. Our regression methodology enables\naccurate estimations of the star's surface $R(\\mu)$, its corresponding\nlogarithmic derivative $d\\log R(\\mu)/d\\theta$, and its effective acceleration\ndue to gravity $g(\\mu)$ with accuracy better than $1 \\%$. The analysis is\nperformed for an extended sample of rotating configurations constructed using a\nlarge ensemble of 70 tabulated hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models that\nobey the current multimessenger constraints and cover a wide range of\nstiffnesses. Above all, the suggested relations could provide an accurate\nframework for the star's surface estimation using data acquired from the NICER\nX-ray telescope or future missions, and constrain the EoS of nuclear matter\nwhen measurements of the relevant observables become available.",

This document\nreports a collaborative effort performed by ten teams of students, each guided\nby a senior researcher as their mentor, attending ISWS 2023. Each team provided\na different perspective to the topic of creative AI, substantiated by a set of\nresearch questions as the main subject of their investigation. The 2023 edition\nof ISWS focuses on the intersection of Semantic Web technologies and Creative\nAI. ISWS 2023 explored various intersections between Semantic Web technologies\nand creative AI. A key area of focus was the potential of LLMs as support tools\nfor knowledge engineering. Participants also delved into the multifaceted\napplications of LLMs, including legal aspects of creative content production,\nhumans in the loop, decentralised approaches to multimodal generative AI\nmodels, nanopublications and AI for personal scientific knowledge graphs,\ncommonsense knowledge in automatic story and narrative completion, generative\nAI for art critique, prompt engineering, automatic music composition,\ncommonsense prototyping and conceptual blending, and elicitation of tacit\nknowledge. As Large Language Models and semantic technologies continue to\nevolve, new exciting prospects are emerging: a future where the boundaries\nbetween creative expression and factual knowledge become increasingly permeable\nand porous, leading to a world of knowledge that is both informative and\ninspiring.",

LLMs\nhave demonstrated impressive performance in decomposing complex tasks into\nsimpler steps, and previous work has used it for better retrieval in support of\ncomplex questions. However, LLM's decomposition of questions is unaware of what\ndata is available and how data is organized, often leading to a sub-optimal\nretrieval performance. Recent effort in agentic RAG proposes to perform\nretrieval in an iterative fashion, where a followup query is derived as an\naction based on previous rounds of retrieval. While this provides one way of\ninteracting with the data collection, agentic RAG's exploration of data is\ninefficient because successive queries depend on previous results rather than\nbeing guided by the organization of available data in the collection. To\naddress this problem, we propose an LLM-based retrieval method -- ARM, that\naims to better align the question with the organization of the data collection\nby exploring relationships among data objects beyond matching the utterance of\nthe query, thus leading to a retrieve-all-at-once solution for complex queries.\nWe evaluated ARM on two datasets, Bird and OTT-QA. On Bird, it outperforms\nstandard RAG with query decomposition by up to 5.2 pt in execution accuracy and\nagentic RAG (ReAct) by up to 15.9 pt. On OTT-QA, it achieves up to 5.5 pt and\n19.3 pt higher F1 match scores compared to these approaches.",

This scenario\nexemplifies a simple yet potent vulnerability in neural Information Retrieval\n(IR) pipelines: content injection attacks. We find that embedding models for\nretrieval, rerankers, and large language model (LLM) relevance judges are\nvulnerable to these attacks, in which adversaries insert misleading text into\npassages to manipulate model judgements. We identify two primary threats: (1)\ninserting unrelated or harmful content within passages that still appear\ndeceptively \"relevant\", and (2) inserting entire queries or key query terms\ninto passages to boost their perceived relevance. While the second tactic has\nbeen explored in prior research, we present, to our knowledge, the first\nempirical analysis of the first threat, demonstrating how state-of-the-art\nmodels can be easily misled.

Consequently, obtaining spectroscopic\ninformation about an arbitrary sample via conventional methods rapidly becomes\nan unrealistic endeavor. To address this problem, we introduce an experimental\nscheme that reduces the amount of data needed to identify and classify unknown\nsamples via their electronic structure. Our proposed method makes use of\nmachine learning (ML) to extract information about the number of intermediate\nlevels that participate in the two-photon excitation of the absorbing medium.\nThis is achieved by training artificial neural networks (ANNs) with various\neTPA signals where the delay between the absorbed photons is externally\ncontrolled. Inspired by multiple experimental studies of eTPA, we consider\nmodel systems comprising one to four intermediate levels, whose energies are\nrandomly chosen from four different intermediate-level band gaps, namely:\n$\\Delta\\lambda = 10$, $20$, $30$, and $40$ nm. Within these band gaps, and with\nthe goal of testing the efficiency of our artificial intelligence algorithms,\nwe make use of three different wavelength spacing $1$, $0.5$ and $0.1$ nm.

Activation editing modifies LLM representations by preserving\ninformation from positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) and minimising\ninformation from negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinations).

    "abstract": "We present the first experimental measurements of the toroidal mode number of\nshear Alfv\\'en waves in the TJ-II stellarator. A series of experiments were\ncarried out in three different magnetic configurations to investigate\ncounter-NBI driven modes. Co- and counter- electron-cyclotron current drive was\nused to modify the rotational transform ($\\iota/2\\pi$) profile leading to the\ndestabilization of a varied set of Alfv\\'en eigenmodes with different\nfrequencies and mode numbers. To characterize the spatial structure of the\nmodes we have used two Mirnov probe arrays, one dedicated to the measurement of\nthe poloidal mode number and the other, a recently commissioned helical\ntri-axial array, dedicated to the measurement of the toroidal mode number. A\nheavy ion beam probe, operated in radial sweep mode, was employed to\ncharacterize the radial location of the modes. We show that the induced changes\nin $\\iota/2\\pi$, that are fundamental when it comes to validation studies,\ncannot be measured experimentally with motional Stark effect so, instead, the\nshielding current diffusion equation is solved in cylindrical geometry to\nestimate these changes. We calculate the incompressible shear Alfv\\'en\ncontinuum for selected cases using \\texttt{STELLGAP} and find reasonable\nconsistency with observations. A database with the observed modes has been\ncreated, so that it can be used in future work for theory validation purposes.",

The nondimensional prefactor for acoustic\nturbulence is larger than the standard Kolmogorov constant due to the\ninefficient dissipation of kinetic energy. We also find that the Lorentz force\ncan drive vortical motions even when the initial field is uniform, by\nconverting a fraction of the acoustic energy into vortical energy. This\nconversion is shown to be quadratic in the magnetic field strength and linear\nin the acoustic flow speed. By contrast, the direct production of vortical\nmotions by a non-force-free magnetic field is linear in the field strength. Our\nresults suggest that magnetic fields play a crucial role in vorticity\nproduction in cosmological flows, particularly in scenarios where significant\nacoustic turbulence is prevalent.

However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur,\ndecrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous\nresearch on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain\nand rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to\nconsider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example,\ndegradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information\n(e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares\nmay require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this\npaper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out\nintrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It\nefficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the\ncollective contribution of all points in the image) information. The\narchitecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to\ncapture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a\nFrequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration\nBlock (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise\nand blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as\nflare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction.

    "abstract": "Precise quantum expectation values are crucial for quantum algorithm\ndevelopment, but noise in real-world systems can degrade these estimations.\nWhile quantum error correction is resource-intensive, error mitigation\nstrategies offer a practical alternative. This paper presents a framework that\ncombines Virtual Channel Purification (VCP) technique with Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization to improve expectation value estimations in\nnoisy quantum circuits. Our contributions are twofold: first, we derive\nconditions to compare CVaR values from different probability distributions,\noffering insights into the reliability of quantum estimations under noise.\nSecond, we apply this framework to VCP, providing analytical bounds that\nestablish its effectiveness in improving expectation values, both when the\noverhead VCP circuit is ideal (error-free) and when it adds additional noise.\nBy introducing CVaR into the analysis of VCP, we offer a general\nnoise-characterization method that guarantees improved expectation values for\nany quantum observable. We demonstrate the practical utility of our approach\nwith numerical examples, highlighting how our bounds guide VCP implementation\nin noisy quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "Training of large language models (LLMs) is typically distributed across a\nlarge number of accelerators to reduce training time. Since internal states and\nparameter gradients need to be exchanged at each and every single gradient\nstep, all devices need to be co-located using low-latency high-bandwidth\ncommunication links to support the required high volume of exchanged bits.\nRecently, distributed algorithms like DiLoCo have relaxed such co-location\nconstraint: accelerators can be grouped into ``workers'', where\nsynchronizations between workers only occur infrequently. This in turn means\nthat workers can afford being connected by lower bandwidth communication links\nwithout affecting learning quality. However, in these methods, communication\nacross workers still requires the same peak bandwidth as before, as the\nsynchronizations require all parameters to be exchanged across all workers. In\nthis paper, we improve DiLoCo in three ways. First, we synchronize only subsets\nof parameters in sequence, rather than all at once, which greatly reduces peak\nbandwidth. Second, we allow workers to continue training while synchronizing,\nwhich decreases wall clock time. Third, we quantize the data exchanged by\nworkers, which further reduces bandwidth across workers. By properly combining\nthese modifications, we show experimentally that we can distribute training of\nbillion-scale parameters and reach similar quality as before, but reducing\nrequired bandwidth by two orders of magnitude.",

To address this, we propose to\ndecompose the task of detecting dense ambiguous actions into detecting dense,\nunambiguous sub-concepts that form the action classes (i.e., action entities\nand action motions), and assigning these sub-tasks to distinct sub-networks. By\nisolating these unambiguous concepts, the sub-networks can focus exclusively on\nresolving a single challenge, dense temporal overlaps. Furthermore,\nsimultaneous actions in a video often exhibit interrelationships, and\nexploiting these relationships can improve the method performance.

A task-space path may have a valid IK solution for each\npoint along the path, but a continuous joint-space path may depend on the\nchoice of the IK solution or even be infeasible. This paper presents new\nanalysis, path planning, and optimization methods to enhance the utility of\ncuspidal robots. We first demonstrate an efficient method to identify cuspidal\nrobots and show, for the first time, that the ABB GoFa and certain robots with\nthree parallel joint axes are cuspidal. We then propose a new path planning\nmethod for cuspidal robots by finding all IK solutions for each point along a\ntask-space path and constructing a graph to connect each vertex corresponding\nto an IK solution. Graph edges have a weight based on the optimization metric,\nsuch as minimizing joint velocity. The optimal feasible path is the shortest\npath in the graph. This method can find non-singular paths as well as smooth\npaths which pass through singularities. Finally, we incorporate this path\nplanning method into a path optimization algorithm.

Spectral energy distribution\nfitting of the 12 S-PLUS bands reveals that $\\sim$ 90\\% of the candidates are\nbest fit by models with very low stellar metallicities. We obtained long-slit\nobservations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph to follow-up a pilot\nsample and confirm whether these galaxies have low metallicities. We find\noxygen abundances in the range $7.35<$ 12 + log(O/H) $< 7.93$ (5\\% to 17\\% of\nthe solar value), confirming their metal-poor nature. Most targets are outliers\nin the mass-metallicity relation, i.e. they display a low metal content\nrelative to their observed stellar masses. In some cases, perturbed optical\nmorphologies might give evidence of dwarf-dwarf interactions or mergers. These\nresults suggest that the low oxygen abundances may be associated with an\nexternal event causing the accretion of metal-poor gas, which dilutes the\noxygen abundance in these systems.",

The cross sectional\nspectra feature rich resonance structures with narrow natural widths (typically\nless than 100 meV) due to 2p to nd excitations below and up to the 2p\nthresholds.

One usually has a prediction of how long it takes to traverse\nthrough a particular road, but due to road conditions or imprecise maps the\nagent might realize that a road will take slightly longer than expected when\narriving on it. To deal with those deviations, it is natural to assume that the\nagent is able to adapt to the situation: When realizing that taking a\nparticular road is more expensive than expected, recalculating the tour and\ntaking another road instead is possible.\n  We analyze the competitive ratio of this problem based on the perturbation\nfactor $\\alpha$ of the edge weights. For general graphs we show that for\nrealistic factors smaller than $2$ there is no strategy that achieves a\ncompetitive ratio better than $\\alpha$, which can be matched by a simple\nalgorithm.\n  In addition, we prove an algorithm which has a competitive ratio of\n$\\frac{1+\\alpha}{2}$ for restricted graph classes like complete graphs with\nuniform announced edge weights.

Precise detection and labeling of these markings are\ncritical for tasks such as navigation, landing assistance, and ground control\nautomation. Existing labeling algorithms, like the Automated Line\nIdentification and Notation Algorithm (ALINA), have demonstrated success in\nidentifying taxiway markings but encounter significant challenges when applied\nto runway markings. This limitation arises due to notable differences in line\ncharacteristics, environmental context, and interference from elements such as\nshadows, tire marks, and varying surface conditions. To address these\nchallenges, we modified ALINA by adjusting color thresholds and refining region\nof interest (ROI) selection to better suit runway-specific contexts. While\nthese modifications yielded limited improvements, the algorithm still struggled\nwith consistent runway identification, often mislabeling elements such as the\nhorizon or non-relevant background features. This highlighted the need for a\nmore robust solution capable of adapting to diverse visual interferences. In\nthis paper, we propose integrating a classification step using a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) named AssistNet. By incorporating this classification\nstep, the detection pipeline becomes more resilient to environmental variations\nand misclassifications.

The learning objective is to achieve\ndesired positions from random initial conditions while adhering to both\ntransient and steady-state performance specifications. This objective is\nchallenging for conventional one-stage end-to-end reinforcement learning, due\nto the strong coupling between position and orientation dynamics, the\ncomplexity in designing and tuning the reward function, and poor sample\nefficiency, which necessitates substantial computational resources and leads to\nextended convergence times. To address these challenges, this work decomposes\nthe learning objective into a three-stage curriculum that incrementally\nincreases task complexity. The curriculum begins with learning to achieve\nstable hovering from a fixed initial condition, followed by progressively\nintroducing randomization in initial positions, orientations and velocities. A\nnovel additive reward function is proposed, to incorporate transient and\nsteady-state performance specifications. The results demonstrate that the\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based curriculum learning approach, coupled\nwith the proposed reward structure, achieves superior performance compared to a\nsingle-stage PPO-trained policy with the same reward function, while\nsignificantly reducing computational resource requirements and convergence\ntime.

The analysis of\nequilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild\nnonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving\nand/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a\npotential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent\nfriction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to\nestimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a\nlow-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's\ntransport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different\ncoarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations\nfor generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D\nresponsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a\n3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem.

This paper\npresents Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP), a novel and flexible\nsemantic approach that uses a generative transformer model as search operator.\nThe transformer is trained on synthetic test problems and learns semantic\nsimilarities between solutions. Once the model is trained, it can be used to\ncreate offspring solutions with high semantic similarity also for unseen and\nunknown problems. Experiments on several symbolic regression problems show that\nTSGP generates solutions with comparable or even significantly better\nprediction quality than stdGP, SLIM_GSGP, DSR, and DAE-GP. Like SLIM_GSGP, TSGP\nis able to create new solutions that are semantically similar without creating\nsolutions of large size.

    "abstract": "Neural networks have become ubiquitous in audio effects modelling, especially\nfor guitar amplifiers and distortion pedals. One limitation of such models is\nthat the sample rate of the training data is implicitly encoded in the model\nweights and therefore not readily adjustable at inference. Recent work explored\nmodifications to recurrent neural network architecture to approximate a sample\nrate independent system, enabling audio processing at a rate that differs from\nthe original training rate. This method works well for integer oversampling and\ncan reduce aliasing caused by nonlinear activation functions. For small\nfractional changes in sample rate, fractional delay filters can be used to\napproximate sample rate independence, but in some cases this method fails\nentirely. Here, we explore the use of real-time signal resampling at the input\nand output of the neural network as an alternative solution. We investigate\nseveral resampling filter designs and show that a two-stage design consisting\nof a half-band IIR filter cascaded with a Kaiser window FIR filter can give\nsimilar or better results to the previously proposed model adjustment method\nwith many fewer filtering operations per sample and less than one millisecond\nof latency at typical audio rates. Furthermore, we investigate interpolation\nand decimation filters for the task of integer oversampling and show that\ncascaded half-band IIR and FIR designs can be used in conjunction with the\nmodel adjustment method to reduce aliasing in a range of distortion effect\nmodels.",

Our primary goal is to create a\nminimally interfering framework that harnesses the agentic abilities of LLMs\nwhile addressing their limitations in maintaining consistency, selectively\nignoring/including information, and enforcing strict world rules. Simulation\nStreams achieves this through a state-based approach where variables are\nmodified in sequential steps by \"operators,\" producing output on a recurring\nformat and adhering to consistent rules for state variables. This approach\nfocus the LLMs on defined tasks, while aiming to have the context stream remain\n\"in-distribution\". The approach incorporates an Entity-Component-System (ECS)\narchitecture to write programs in a more intuitive manner, facilitating reuse\nof workflows across different components and entities. This ECS approach\nenhances the modularity of the output stream, allowing for complex,\nmulti-entity simulations while maintaining format consistency, information\ncontrol, and rule enforcement. It is supported by a custom editor that aids in\ncreating, running, and analyzing simulations. We demonstrate the versatility of\nsimulation streams through an illustrative example of an ongoing market economy\nsimulation, a social simulation of three characters playing a game of catch in\na park and a suite of classical reinforcement learning benchmark tasks. These\nexamples showcase Simulation Streams' ability to handle complex, evolving\nscenarios over 100s-1000s of iterations, facilitate comparisons between\ndifferent agent workflows and models, and maintain consistency and continued\ninteresting developments in LLM-driven simulations.",

Models like OpenAI's Codex and\nGPT-4, alongside DeepSeek, leverage vast code and natural language datasets.\nHowever, ensuring code quality, correctness, and managing complex tasks remains\nchallenging, necessitating thorough evaluation. Methodology: This research\ncompares ChatGPT (version o1) and DeepSeek (version R1) for Python code\ngeneration using online judge coding challenges. It evaluates correctness\n(online judge verdicts, up to three attempts), code quality (Pylint/Flake8),\nand efficiency (execution time/memory usage). Results: DeepSeek demonstrated\nhigher correctness, particularly on algorithmic tasks, often achieving\n'Accepted' on the first attempt. ChatGPT sometimes requires multiple attempts\nor failures. ChatGPT encountered fewer issues, used comparable or slightly less\nmemory, consumed less execution times and wrote fewer lines of code.\nConclusion: DeepSeek exhibited superior correctness in Python code generation,\noften requiring fewer attempts, suggesting an advantage in algorithmic\nproblem-solving. Both models showed almost similar efficiency in execution time\nand memory use. Finally, this research provides insights for developers\nchoosing AI coding assistants and informs future AI-driven software development\nresearch.",

This paper introduces the\n\\emph{conversation game}, a multi-stage, extensive-form game based on\nlinguistic strategic interaction. We focus on a subset of the games, called\nverdict games. In a verdict game, two players alternate to contribute to a\nconversation, which is evaluated at each stage by a non-strategic judge who may\nrender a conclusive binary verdict, or a decision to continue the dialogue. The\ngame ends once a limit is reached or a verdict is given. We show many familiar\nprocesses, such as interrogation or a court process fall under this category.\nWe also, show that the Turing test is an instance of verdict game, and discuss\nthe significance of a strategic view of the Turing test in the age of advanced\nAI deception.

Molecular graphs have\nbecome a focus for representation learning, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nwidely used. However, GNNs often struggle with capturing long-range\ndependencies. To address this, we propose MolGraph-xLSTM, a novel graph-based\nxLSTM model that enhances feature extraction and effectively models molecule\nlong-range interactions.\n  Our approach processes molecular graphs at two scales: atom-level and\nmotif-level. For atom-level graphs, a GNN-based xLSTM framework with jumping\nknowledge extracts local features and aggregates multilayer information to\ncapture both local and global patterns effectively. Motif-level graphs provide\ncomplementary structural information for a broader molecular view. Embeddings\nfrom both scales are refined via a multi-head mixture of experts (MHMoE),\nfurther enhancing expressiveness and performance.\n  We validate MolGraph-xLSTM on 10 molecular property prediction datasets,\ncovering both classification and regression tasks. Our model demonstrates\nconsistent performance across all datasets, with improvements of up to 7.03% on\nthe BBBP dataset for classification and 7.54% on the ESOL dataset for\nregression compared to baselines. On average, MolGraph-xLSTM achieves an AUROC\nimprovement of 3.18\\% for classification tasks and an RMSE reduction of 3.83\\%\nacross regression datasets compared to the baseline methods.

    "abstract": "In the thermodynamic analysis of thermoelectric devices, typical\nirreversibilities are for the processes of finite-rate heat transfer, heat leak\nand Joule heating. Approximate analyses often focus on either internal or\nexternal irreversibility, obtaining well-known expressions for the efficiency\nat maximum power (EMP), such as the Curzon-Ahlborn value for endoreversible\nmodel and the Schmiedl-Seifert form for exoreversible model. Within the\nConstant Properties model, we simultaneously incorporate internal as well as\nexternal irreversibilities. We employ the approximation of a symmetric and\nsmall external irreversibility (SEI), allowing a tractable expression for EMP\nthat depends on three parameters i) the ratio of internal to external thermal\nconductance ii) the figure of merit of the thermoelectric material and iii) the\nratio of hot and cold reservoir temperatures. We study limiting forms of this\nEMP and compare our framework with the exact model as well as with other\nirreversible models in finite-time thermodynamics, such as the minimally\nnonlinear model. In particular, we argue that the TEG in endoreversible\napproximation can be mapped to the mesoscopic model of Feynman's ratchet in the\nhigh temperatures regime, thus providing an alternative to the viewpoint in\nliterature where the TEG in linear regime is mapped to an exoreversible case.\nFinally, extending our study to the thermoelectric refrigerator under similar\nassumptions as for the generator, we analyze the efficiency at the maximum\ncooling power.",

Traditional methods for structuring EHR free-text data,\nsuch as rule-based systems and multi-stage pipelines, are often limited by\ntheir time-consuming configurations and inability to adapt across clinical\nnotes from diverse healthcare settings. Few systems provide a comprehensive\nattribute extraction for terminologies.

This study aims to investigate and compare the dosimetry between proton\nand photon therapy for VT, focusing on target coverage and OAR sparing.\nMethods: We performed a retrospective study on a cohort of 34 VT patients who\nreceived photon STAR. Proton STAR plans were generated using robust\noptimization in RayStation to deliver the same prescription dose of 25 Gy in a\nsingle fraction while minimizing dose to OARs. Dosimetric metrics, including\nD99, D95, Dmean, and D0.03cc, were extracted for critical OARs and VAS.\nShapiro-Wilk tests were used to assess normality, followed by paired t-tests or\nWilcoxon signed-rank tests for statistical comparisons between modalities, with\nBonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons. Results: Proton and\nphoton plans achieved comparable target coverage, with VAS D95 of 24.1 +/- 1.2\nGy vs. 24.7 +/- 1.0 Gy (p=0.294). Proton therapy significantly reduced OAR\ndoses, including heart Dmean (3.6 +/- 1.5 Gy vs. 5.5 +/- 2.0 Gy, p<0.001),\nlungs Dmean (1.6 +/- 1.5 Gy vs. 2.1 +/- 1.4 Gy, p<0.001), and esophagus Dmean\n(0.3 +/- 0.6 Gy vs. 1.6 +/- 1.3 Gy, p<0.001), while maintaining optimal target\ncoverage.

In particular, we recover two of the three known regimes (namely the\nsmall and critical branching processes) of convergence in known cases, and\nextend them to a wider family of processes. To prove our central limit\ntheorems, we use the Stein's method, which in addition allows us to newly\nprovide a rate of convergence to this type of convergence.",

    "abstract": "Context: How planets form in protoplanetary disks and what drives the\nformation of their seeds is still a major unknown. It is an accepted theory\nthat multiple processes can trap dusty material in radially narrow rings or\nvortex-like structures, preventing the dust from drifting inwards. However, the\nrelevant process for clumping this dusty material until it collapses under\ngravity still needs to be identified. One promising candidate is the streaming\ninstability arising from the aerodynamic interaction between dust and gas once\nthey reach similar densities. Aims: We investigate with a global disk model\nbased on recent observational constraints if streaming instability can form\ndust clumps, which might gravitationally collapse. Further, our goal is to\nverify the observability of the produced structures using ALMA or ngVLA.\nMethods. For the first time, we present global 2D (R, z) hydrodynamic\nsimulations using FARGO3D in which the dust is treated as a pressureless fluid.\nThe disk model assumes stratification, realistic boundary conditions, and\nmeaningful resolution to resolve the fast-growing modes. We choose two values\nfor the total dust-to-gas mass ratio Z = 0.01 and Z = 0.02, compare the maximum\nclump density to the local Hill density, and compute the optical depth of the\ndust disk. Results: With a dust-to-gas mass ratio of Z = 0.01, we confirm\nprevious streaming instability simulations, not showing the ability to form\nstrong concentrations of dust clumps. With Z = 0.02, dense clumps form within\n20 orbits, however reaching only 30% of the Hill density even following disk\nparameters from the massive protoplanetary disks GM Aur, HD163296, IM Lup, MWC\n480, and TW Hya, which all share astonishingly similar surface density\nprofiles.",

However, their high\nsensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure\nthese signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called 'glitches',\nthat can mimic genuine astrophysical signals or mask their true\ncharacteristics. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning\nframework that is designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power\nexceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design\nDeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW detectors,\nfollowing conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary\nover short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise\ncomponent of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction of signal or\nglitch. We focus on applications related to glitches and validate\nDeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing\nsimulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing its\nperformance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing\nreal data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch\nsubtraction from LIGO strain data. We further demonstrate its potential by\nreconstructing three real GW events from LIGO's third observing run, without\nbeing trained on GW waveforms. Our proposed model achieves a median mismatch of\nonly 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning\nbaselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery,\noffering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample\nin approximately 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time\nof approximately one hour per glitch.",

To perform image denoising, penalized least-squares (PLS) problems can\nbe designed and solved, in which the penalty term encodes prior knowledge of\nthe object being imaged. Sparsity-promoting penalties, such as total variation\n(TV), have been a popular choice for regularizing image denoising problems.\nHowever, such hand-crafted penalties may not be able to preserve task-relevant\ninformation in measured image data and can lead to oversmoothed image\nappearances and patchy artifacts that degrade signal detectability. Supervised\nlearning methods that employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged\nas a popular approach to denoising medical images. However, studies have shown\nthat CNNs trained with loss functions based on traditional image quality\nmeasures can lead to a loss of task-relevant information in images. Some\nprevious works have investigated task-based loss functions that employ model\nobservers for training the CNN denoising models. However, such training\nprocesses typically require a large number of noisy and ground-truth\n(noise-free or low-noise) image data pairs. In this work, we propose a\ntask-based regularization strategy for use with PLS in medical image denoising.\nThe proposed task-based regularization is associated with the likelihood of\nlinear test statistics of noisy images for Gaussian noise models. The proposed\nmethod does not require ground-truth image data and solves an individual\noptimization problem for denoising each image. Computer-simulation studies are\nconducted that consider a multivariate-normally distributed (MVN) lumpy\nbackground and a binary texture background.

Attribute reduction algorithms and\nclassifiers based on fuzzy rough set theory exhibit promising performance in\nthe analysis of high-dimensional multivariate complex data. However, most\nexisting models operate at the finest granularity, rendering them inefficient\nand sensitive to noise, especially for high-dimensional big data. Thus,\nenhancing the robustness of fuzzy rough set models is crucial for effective\nfeature selection. Muiti-garanularty granular-ball computing, a recent\ndevelopment, uses granular-balls of different sizes to adaptively represent and\ncover the sample space, performing learning based on these granular-balls. This\npaper proposes integrating multi-granularity granular-ball computing into fuzzy\nrough set theory, using granular-balls to replace sample points. The\ncoarse-grained characteristics of granular-balls make the model more robust.\nAdditionally, we propose a new method for generating granular-balls, scalable\nto the entire supervised method based on granular-ball computing.

The turbulent wall-bounded flow with or without mild flow\nseparation, a crucial flow pattern in engineering applications, yet rarely\nexplored in the SPH community, is simulated. The inconsistency between the\nLagrangian characteristic and RANS model, mainly due to the intense particle\nshear and near-wall discontinuity, is firstly revealed and addressed by the\nmainstream and nearwall improvements, respectively. The mainstream\nimprovements, including Adaptive Riemann-eddy Dissipation (ARD) and Limited\nTransport Velocity Formulation (LTVF), address dissipation incompatibility and\nturbulent kinetic energy over-prediction issues. The nearwall improvements,\nsuch as the particle-based wall model realization, weighted near-wall\ncompensation scheme, and constant $y_p$ strategy, improve the accuracy and\nstability of the adopted wall model, where the wall dummy particles are still\nused for future coupling of solid dynamics.

    "abstract": "Quantum-key distribution (QKD) schemes employing quantum communication links\nare typically based on the transmission of weak optical pulses over optical\nfibers to setup a secret key between the transmitting and receiving nodes.\nAlice transmits optically a random bit stream to the receiver (Bob) through the\nphoton polarizations or the quadrature components of the lightwaves associated\nwith the photons, with a secret key remaining implicitly embedded therein.\nHowever, during the above transmission, some eavesdropper (Eve) might attempt\nto tap the passing-by photons from the optical fiber links to extract the key.\nIn one of the popular QKD schemes, along with signal pulses, some additional\ndecoy pulses are transmitted by Alice, while Eve might use photon-number\nsplitting (PNS) for eavesdropping. In a typical PNS scheme, (i) the optical\npulses with single photon are blocked by Eve, (ii) from the optical pulses with\ntwo photons, one photon is retained by Eve to carry out eavesdropping operation\nand the other is retransmitted to Bob, and (iii) all other pulses with more\nthan two photons are retransmitted by Eve to Bob without retaining any photon\nfrom them.

This study proposes\na novel Gaussian Process Regression framework that leverages the order\ninvariance of time difference of arrival (TDOA) inputs to achieve probabilistic\nimpact localisation under such uncertainties. A composite kernel function,\ncombining radial basis function and cosine similarity kernels, is designed\nbased on wave propagation dynamics to enhance adaptability to diverse\nconditions. Additionally, a task covariance kernel is introduced to enable\nmultitask learning, facilitating the joint prediction of spatial coordinates\nwhile capturing interdependencies between outputs. To further improve\nrobustness and accuracy, Bayesian model averaging is employed to dynamically\nfuse kernel predictions, assigning adaptive weights that account for varying\nconditions. Extensive experimental validation on a composite plate, including\nscenarios with large-mass drop tower impacts and small-mass guided drop mass\nimpacts, demonstrates the proposed method's robustness and generalisability.\nNotably, the framework achieves accurate localisation without requiring\ncompensation strategies for variations in temperature or impact mass,\nhighlighting its suitability for real-world applications. The study also\nhighlights the critical role of sample standardisation for preprocessing TDOA\ninputs, demonstrating its superiority over feature standardisation by\npreserving TDOA order invariance and enhancing model compatibility.

This leads to the surprising observation that MHE problems naturally\nexhibit a leaving arc, which may have a strong negative impact on the\nestimation accuracy. To address this, we propose a delayed MHE scheme, and we\nshow that the resulting performance (both averaged and non-averaged) is\napproximately optimal and achieves bounded dynamic regret with respect to the\ninfinite-horizon solution, with error terms that can be made arbitrarily small\nby an appropriate choice of the delay. In various simulation examples, we\nobserve that already a very small delay in the MHE scheme is sufficient to\nsignificantly improve the overall estimation error by 20-25 % compared to\nstandard MHE (without delay).

Our results show that\nRAQ-MIMO allows the average transmit power of users to be $> 25$ dBm lower than\nthat of the conventional massive MIMO.

    "abstract": "Recent observations by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) such as NANOGrav, EPTA,\nPPTA, and CPTA suggest the presence of nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground (GWB). While such signals could be explained by gravitational waves\nfrom a network of metastable cosmic strings (CSs), standard scenarios involving\nthe Kibble-Zurek mechanism triggered by a thermal potential face significant\nchallenges. Specifically, these scenarios predict a GWB spectrum inconsistent\nwith the non-detection at higher frequencies by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) for CSs\nwith relatively large string tension. It is also difficult to prevent the\nmonopole forming phase transition just before the CS forming symmetry breaking,\nwhich spoils the CS network formation. In contrast, a delayed scaling scenario,\nwhere the CSs start to emit GWs at a later time due to the dilution during\ninflation, alleviates these issues. This scenario allows for a larger string\ntension while monopoles are sufficiently diluted such that the CS network\nsafely forms. In this study, we clarify the spectrum of stochastic GWB from\nmetastable CSs in the delayed scaling scenario, consistent with the PTA\nobservations while satisfying the LVK constraints. Furthermore, we explore its\npotential signatures at frequencies accessible to other detectors such as LVK\nas well as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin or DECIGO and BBO.

Leveraging this\narchitectural innovation, we develop two efficient algorithms for DOA\nestimation: a reduced-dimension MUSIC (RD-MUSIC) algorithm that enables fast\nprocessing by correcting large-scale array estimation bias, and an improved\nversion that further accelerates estimation by exploiting THz channel sparsity\nto obtain initial closed-form solutions through specialized two-RF-chain\nconfiguration. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework through\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound analysis, providing fundamental insights for\ndifferent HDS configurations.

Cracks are thin and rough and being air filled do yield a very weak\ncontrast in 3D images obtained by computed tomography. Enhancing and segmenting\ndark lower-dimensional structures is already demanding. The heterogeneous\nconcrete matrix and the size of the images further increase the complexity. ML\nmethods have proven to solve difficult segmentation problems when trained on\nenough and well annotated data. However, so far, there is not much 3D image\ndata of cracks available at all, let alone annotated. Interactive annotation is\nerror-prone as humans can easily tell cats from dogs or roads without from\nroads with cars but have a hard time deciding whether a thin and dark structure\nseen in a 2D slice continues in the next one. Training networks by synthetic,\nsimulated images is an elegant way out, bears however its own challenges. In\nthis contribution, we describe how to generate semi-synthetic image data to\ntrain CNN like the well known 3D U-Net or random forests for segmenting cracks\nin 3D images of concrete. The thickness of real cracks varies widely, both,\nwithin one crack as well as from crack to crack in the same sample.

Ultrasound\ncontrast imaging uses microbubbles to enhance the scattering of the blood pool,\nallowing for real-time visualization of blood flow. Recent developments in\nvector flow imaging further expand the imaging capabilities of ultrasound by\ntemporally resolving fast arterial flow. The next obstacle to overcome is the\nlack of spatial resolution. Super-resolved ultrasound images can be obtained by\ndeconvolving radiofrequency (RF) signals before beamforming, breaking the link\nbetween resolution and pulse duration. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can\nbe trained to locally estimate the deconvolution kernel and consequently\nsuper-localize the microbubbles directly within the RF signal. However,\nmicrobubble contrast is highly nonlinear, and the potential of CNNs in\nmicrobubble localization has not yet been fully exploited. Assessing deep\nlearning-based deconvolution performance for non-trivial imaging pulses is\ntherefore essential for successful translation to a practical setting, where\nthe signal-to-noise ratio is limited, and transmission schemes should comply\nwith safety guidelines. In this study, we train CNNs to deconvolve RF signals\nand localize the microbubbles driven by harmonic pulses, chirps, or\ndelay-encoded pulse trains. Furthermore, we discuss potential hurdles for\nin-vitro and in-vivo super-resolution by presenting preliminary experimental\nresults. We find that, whereas the CNNs can accurately localize microbubbles\nfor all pulses, a short imaging pulse offers the best performance in noise-free\nconditions. However, chirps offer a comparable performance without noise, but\nare more robust to noise and outperform all other pulses in low-signal-to-noise\nratio conditions.",

These applications often\nrequire different statistical measures, including expectation, variance and\nquantiles. In this paper, we provide a universal admissible algorithm framework\nfor dealing with all kinds of contextual online decision-making problems that\ndirectly learns the whole underlying unknown distribution instead of focusing\non individual statistics. This is much more difficult because the dimension of\nthe regression is uncountably infinite, and any existing linear contextual\nbandits algorithm will result in infinite regret. To overcome this issue, we\npropose an efficient infinite-dimensional functional regression oracle for\ncontextual cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), where each data point is\nmodeled as a combination of context-dependent CDF basis functions. Our analysis\nreveals that the decay rate of the eigenvalue sequence of the design integral\noperator governs the regression error rate and, consequently, the utility\nregret rate. Specifically, when the eigenvalue sequence exhibits a polynomial\ndecay of order $\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\ge 1$, the utility regret is bounded by\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\Big(T^{\\frac{3\\gamma+2}{2(\\gamma+2)}}\\Big)$.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Comprehensive\nGraph Representation Learning (ComGRL). ComGRL integrates local information\ninto global information to derive powerful representations. It achieves this by\nimplicitly smoothing local information through flexible graph contrastive\nlearning, ensuring reliable representations for subsequent global exploration.\nThen ComGRL transfers the locally derived representations to a multi-head\nself-attention module, enhancing their discriminative ability by uncovering\ndiverse and rich global correlations. To further optimize local information\ndynamically under the self-supervision of pseudo-labels, ComGRL employs a\ntriple sampling strategy to construct mixed node pairs and applies reliable\nMixup augmentation across attributes and structure for local contrastive\nlearning. This approach broadens the receptive field and facilitates\ncoordination between local and global representation learning, enabling them to\nreinforce each other.

    "abstract": "Path planning with strong environmental adaptability plays a crucial role in\nrobotic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments, especially in the case\nof low-quality location and map information. The path planning ability of a\nrobot depends on the identification of the traversability of global and local\nground areas. In real-world scenarios, the complexity of outdoor open\nenvironments makes it difficult for robots to identify the traversability of\nground areas that lack a clearly defined structure. Moreover, most existing\nmethods have rarely analyzed the integration of local and global traversability\nidentifications in unstructured outdoor scenarios. To address this problem, we\npropose a novel method, Dual-BEV Nav, first introducing Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nrepresentations into local planning to generate high-quality traversable paths.\nThen, these paths are projected onto the global traversability map generated by\nthe global BEV planning model to obtain the optimal waypoints. By integrating\nthe traversability from both local and global BEV, we establish a dual-layer\nBEV heuristic planning paradigm, enabling long-distance navigation in\nunstructured outdoor environments. We test our approach through both public\ndataset evaluations and real-world robot deployments, yielding promising\nresults. Compared to baselines, the Dual-BEV Nav improved temporal distance\nprediction accuracy by up to $18.7\\%$. In the real-world deployment, under\nconditions significantly different from the training set and with notable\nocclusions in the global BEV, the Dual-BEV Nav successfully achieved a\n65-meter-long outdoor navigation. Further analysis demonstrates that the local\nBEV representation significantly enhances the rationality of the planning,\nwhile the global BEV probability map ensures the robustness of the overall\nplanning.",

To this end, this paper jointly\ninvestigates power control and spectrum reuse problems for energy-efficient D2D\nSemCom cellular networks. Concretely, we first model the user preference-aware\nsemantic triplet transmission and leverage a novel metric of semantic value to\nidentify the semantic information importance conveyed in SemCom. Then, we\ndefine the additional power consumption from semantic encoding in conjunction\nwith basic power amplifier dissipation to derive the overall system energy\nefficiency (semantic-value/Joule). Next, we formulate an energy efficiency\nmaximization problem for joint power and spectrum allocation subject to several\nSemCom-related and practical constraints. Afterward, we propose an optimal\nresource management solution by employing the fractional-to-subtractive problem\ntransformation and decomposition while developing a three-stage method with\ntheoretical analysis of its optimality guarantee and computational complexity.\nNumerical results demonstrate the adequate performance superiority of our\nproposed solution compared with different benchmarks.",

Current measurements at RHIC and the LHC observe a\nsignificant suppression in the per-trigger yield at forward rapidities compared\nto that in proton-proton collisions, nominally consistent with the \"mono-jet\"\nproduction expected in a saturation scenario. However, the width of the\nazimuthal correlation remains unmodified, in contradiction to the qualitative\nexpectations from this physics picture. I investigate whether the construction\nof these observables leaves them sensitive to effects from simple nuclear\nshadowing as captured by, for example, universal nuclear parton distribution\nfunction (nPDF) analyses. I find that modern nPDF sets, informed by recent\nprecision measurements sensitive to the shadowing of low-$x_\\mathrm{A}$ gluon\ndensities in LHC and other data, can describe all or the majority of the\ndi-hadron/jet suppression effects in $p$+A data at both RHIC and the LHC, while\ngiving a natural explanation for why the azimuthal correlation width is\nunmodified. Notably, this is achieved via a $(x_\\mathrm{A},Q^2)$-differential\nsuppression of overall cross-sections only, without requiring additional\nphysics dynamics which alter the inter-event correlations.",

For the different elements, our results for\nthe DR rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I,\nIII to II, and IV to III vary between 2x10^{-12} - 5x10^{-11} cm^3/s, 10^{-13}\n- 5x10^{-11} cm^3/s and 2x10^{-15} - 10^{-11} cm^3/s, respectively, at a\ntemperature of T = 10,000 K. Using this new atomic data (DR), we study the\nimpact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days after\nthe merger using the spectral synthesis code SUMO. Compared to models using the\nprevious treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show\nsignificant changes in ionization and temperature, and correspondingly, in\nemergent spectra.

The susceptibility of LoRa to jamming is\nassessed through a theoretical study of how the frame success rate is impacted\nby only a few jamming symbols. Different jamming approaches are studied, among\nwhich repeated-symbol jamming appears to be the most disruptive, with\nsufficient jamming power. A key contribution of this work is the proposal of a\nsoftware-defined radio (SDR)-based jamming approach implemented on GNU Radio\nthat generates a controlled number of random symbols, independent of the\nstandard LoRa frame structure. This approach enables precise control over\njammer exposure time and provides flexibility in studying the effect of jamming\nsymbols on network performance. The theoretical analysis is validated through\nexperimental results, where the implemented jammer is used to assess the impact\nof jamming under various configurations. Our findings demonstrate that\nLoRa-based networks can be disrupted with a minimal number of symbols,\nemphasizing the need for future research on stealthy communication techniques\nto counter such jamming attacks.",

The disks span two orders\nof magnitude in fractional infrared brightness and more than double the number\nof white dwarf dust spectra available for mineralogical study. Among the\nhighlights are: i) the two most subtle infrared excesses yet detected, ii) the\nstrongest silicate emission features known for any debris disk orbiting any\nmain-sequence or white dwarf star, iii) one disk with a thermal continuum but\nno silicate emission, and iv) three sources with likely spectral signatures of\nsilica glass. The near ubiquity of solid-state emission requires small dust\ngrains that are optically thin, and thus must be replenished on year-to-decade\ntimescales by ongoing collisions. The disk exhibiting a featureless continuum\ncan only be fit by dust temperatures in excess of 2000K, implying highly\nrefractory material comprised of large particles, or non-silicate mineral\nspecies. If confirmed, the glassy silica orbiting three stars could be\nindicative of high-temperature processes and subsequent rapid cooling, such as\noccur in high-velocity impacts or vulcanism. These detections have been enabled\nby the unprecedented sensitivity of MIRI LRS spectroscopy and highlight the\ncapability and potential for further observations in future cycles.",

This places severe\nlimitations on the operational wavelengths of plasmonic materials and devices.\nHowever, when the volume of a metal film is massively decreased, highly\nconfined quasi-two-dimensional surface plasmon modes can be supported out to\nwavelengths well beyond the plasma wavelength. While this has, thus far, been\nachieved using ultra-thin (nm-scale) metals, such films are quite difficult to\nrealize, and suffer from even higher losses than bulk plasmonic films. To\nextend the plasmonic response to the infrared, here we introduce the concept of\nmetaplasmonics, representing a novel plasmonic modality with a host of\nappealing properties. By fabricating and characterizing a series of\nmetaplasmonic nanoribbons, we demonstrate large confinement, high quality\nfactors, and large near-field enhancements across a broad wavelength range,\nextending well beyond the limited bandwidth of traditional plasmonic materials.\nWe demonstrate $35\\times$ plasmon wavelength reduction, and our numerical\nsimulations suggest that further wavelength reduction, up to a factor of 150,\nis achievable using our approach. The demonstration of the metaplasmonics\nparadigm offers a promising path to fill the near- and mid-infrared\ntechnological gap for high quality plasmonic materials, and provides a new\nmaterial system to study the effects of extreme plasmonic confinement for\napplications in nonlinear and quantum plasmonics.",

Any\ntarget modality can then be reconstructed with high fidelity by combining the\ncorresponding code with shared features extracted from any available modality.\nIn the second stage, a projection encoder is trained to predict full-modality\ncompact codes from any incomplete MRI samples, effectively simulating various\nimputation scenarios. We evaluate our CodeBrain on two public brain MRI\ndatasets (i.e., IXI and BraTS 2023).

Unlike existing datasets, VDAct\nincludes longer and more complex video sequences that depict a variety of\nevent-driven activities that require advanced contextual understanding for\naccurate response generation. The dataset comprises 3,000 dialogues with over\n30,000 question-and-answer pairs, derived from 1,000 videos with diverse\nactivity scenarios. VDAct displays a notably challenging characteristic due to\nits broad spectrum of activity scenarios and wide range of question types.\nEmpirical studies on state-of-the-art vision foundation models highlight their\nlimitations in addressing certain question types on our dataset. Furthermore,\nVDEval, which integrates dialogue session history and video content summaries\nextracted from our supplementary Knowledge Graphs to evaluate individual\nresponses, demonstrates a significantly higher correlation with human\nassessments on the VDAct dataset than existing evaluation metrics that rely\nsolely on the context of single dialogue turns.",

However, the iterative\napplication of attention across layers induces complex dynamics that remain to\nbe fully understood. To analyze these dynamics, we identify each input sequence\nwith a probability measure and model its evolution as a Vlasov equation called\nTransformer PDE, whose velocity field is non-linear in the probability measure.\nOur first set of contributions focuses on compactly supported initial data. We\nshow the Transformer PDE is well-posed and is the mean-field limit of an\ninteracting particle system, thus generalizing and extending previous analysis\nto several variants of self-attention: multi-head attention, L2 attention,\nSinkhorn attention, Sigmoid attention, and masked attention--leveraging a\nconditional Wasserstein framework. In a second set of contributions, we are the\nfirst to study non-compactly supported initial conditions, by focusing on\nGaussian initial data. Again for different types of attention, we show that the\nTransformer PDE preserves the space of Gaussian measures, which allows us to\nanalyze the Gaussian case theoretically and numerically to identify typical\nbehaviors.

This\nhigh fidelity cannot be achieved through a simple combination of single- and\ntwo-qubit gate sequences from processors with similar performance levels. Our\nexperiments also verify that multilayer direct implementation of the CCZ gate\nexhibits lower leakage compared to decomposed gate approaches. As a showcase,\nwe utilize the CCZ gate as an oracle to implement the Grover search algorithm\non three qubits, demonstrating high performance with the target probability\namplitude significantly enhanced after two iterations.

For\nthe crescent-shaped proteins, such as Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs superfamily proteins,\nanisotropic protein bending energy and orientation-dependent excluded volume\nsignificantly contribute to curvature sensing and generation. Moreover,\nsimulation studies of membrane deformations caused by protein binding are\nreviewed, including domain formation, budding, and tubulation.",

    "abstract": "The synergy between deep learning models and traditional automation tools,\nsuch as built-in tactics of the proof assistant and off-the-shelf automated\ntheorem provers, plays a crucial role in developing robust and efficient neural\ntheorem provers(NTPs). However, for proof synthesis with LLMs, previous work\napplies automation tools either only when explicitly invoked by the model or at\na single granularity level, failing to fully exploit their power. To solve this\nissue, we propose ProofAug, a procedure that equips LLMs with automation\nmethods at various granularities through fine-grained structure analysis of\nmodel-generated proof proposals. ProofAug also serves as a versatile\nplug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with any tree-search algorithm,\nenabling our construction of an efficient recursive proving (ERP) module to\nfurther enhance performance. The superiority of our method is validated on the\nminiF2F benchmark using the open-source deepseek-math-7b-base model and the\nIsabelle proof assistant. Notably, by additionally employing a mixed prompting\nstrategy, we achieve a cumulative pass rate of 66.0% after curation of the\ndataset (61.9% for the original version) with 2100 queries to the model per\nproblem (In contrast, the previous SOTA in Isabelle, Subgoal-XL, only achieves\n56.1% using 16384 queries per problem). We also implement a Lean 4 version of\nProofAug that can improve the pass@1 performance of\nKimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-1.5B from 44.3% to 50.4% on miniF2F-test.

A particular challenging feature of the\nsystem is that the acoustic medium parameters may depend on the temperature.\nThe core of our new arguments in the \\emph{a prior} error analysis lies in\ndevising energy estimates for the coupled semi-discrete system that can\naccommodate the nonlinearities present in the model.

The coarse space in this preconditioner is\nconstructed by specific eigenfunctions solving a series of generalized\neigenvalue problems in the local discrete Maxwell-harmonic spaces according to\na user-defined tolerance $\\rho$. We establish a stability result for the\nconsidered discrete variational problem. Using this discrete stability, we\nprove that the two-level hybrid Schwarz preconditioner is robust in the sense\nthat the convergence rate of GMRES is independent of the mesh size, the\nsubdomain size and the wave-number when $\\rho$ is chosen appropriately.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a major issue in worldwide public health, requiring early\ndiagnosis using stable techniques. This work begins a thorough investigation of\nthe use of machine learning (ML) methods for precise classification of lung\ncancer stages. A cautious analysis is performed to overcome overfitting issues\nin model performance, taking into account minimum child weight and learning\nrate. A set of machine learning (ML) models including XGBoost (XGB), LGBM,\nAdaboost, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF),\nCatBoost, and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) are run methodically and contrasted.\nFurthermore, the correlation between features and targets is examined using the\ndeep neural network (DNN) model and thus their capability in detecting complex\npatternsis established. It is argued that several ML models can be capable of\nclassifying lung cancer stages with great accuracy. In spite of the complexity\nof DNN architectures, traditional ML models like XGBoost, LGBM, and Logistic\nRegression excel with superior performance. The models perform better than the\nothers in lung cancer prediction on the complete set of comparative metrics\nlike accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score",

Secondly, we find examples of neoclassically optimised stellarators in\nthe QUASR database which divert the magnetic field via unpaired X-points. We\npresent and discuss three examples, each containing novel phenomena which might\nbe desirable for stellarator divertors. These findings broaden the horizons of\nhow magnetic fields can be diverted in realistic stellarators, and may be\nattractive for future experiments and stellarator reactor design.",

    "abstract": "In the context of blockchain systems, the importance of decentralization is\nundermined by the lack of a widely accepted methodology to measure it. To\naddress this gap, we set out a systematization effort targeting the\ndecentralization measurement workflow. To facilitate our systematization, we\nput forth a framework that categorizes all measurement techniques used in\nprevious work based on the resource they target, the methods they use to\nextract resource allocation, and the functions they apply to produce the final\nmeasurements. We complement this framework with an empirical analysis designed\nto evaluate whether the various pre-processing steps and metrics used in prior\nwork capture the same underlying concept of decentralization. Our analysis\nbrings about a number of novel insights and observations. First, the seemingly\ninnocuous choices performed during data extraction, such as the size of\nestimation windows or the application of thresholds that affect the resource\ndistribution, have important repercussions when calculating the level of\ndecentralization. Second, exploratory factor analysis suggests that in\nProof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains, participation on the consensus layer is not\ncorrelated with decentralization, but rather captures a distinct signal, unlike\nin Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems, where the different metrics align under a\nsingle factor. These findings challenge the long-held assumption within the\nblockchain community that higher participation drives higher decentralization.\nFinally, we combine the results of our empirical analysis with first-principles\nreasoning to derive practical recommendations for researchers that set out to\nmeasure blockchain decentralization, and we further systematize the existing\nliterature in line with these recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Ranking samples by fine-grained estimates of spuriosity (the degree to which\nspurious cues are present) has recently been shown to significantly benefit\nbias mitigation, over the traditional binary biased-\\textit{vs}-unbiased\npartitioning of train sets. However, this spuriosity ranking comes with the\nrequirement of human supervision. In this paper, we propose a debiasing\nframework based on our novel \\ul{Se}lf-Guided \\ul{B}ias \\ul{Ra}nking\n(\\emph{Sebra}), that mitigates biases (spurious correlations) via an automatic\nranking of data points by spuriosity within their respective classes. Sebra\nleverages a key local symmetry in Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) training --\nthe ease of learning a sample via ERM inversely correlates with its\nspuriousity; the fewer spurious correlations a sample exhibits, the harder it\nis to learn, and vice versa. However, globally across iterations, ERM tends to\ndeviate from this symmetry. Sebra dynamically steers ERM to correct this\ndeviation, facilitating the sequential learning of attributes in increasing\norder of difficulty, \\ie, decreasing order of spuriosity. As a result, the\nsequence in which Sebra learns samples naturally provides spuriousity rankings.\nWe use the resulting fine-grained bias characterization in a contrastive\nlearning framework to mitigate biases from multiple sources. Extensive\nexperiments show that Sebra consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nunsupervised debiasing techniques across multiple standard benchmarks,\nincluding UrbanCars, BAR, CelebA, and ImageNet-1K.

Their positions form\na celestial reference frame that plays an important role in both astronomy and\ngeodesy. This study investigates the accuracy and stability of the positions of\nthe AGNs that are measured by simultaneous VLBI observations at 3.3, 5.5, 6.6,\nand 10.5 GHz. Based on position time series from dedicated geodetic solutions,\nwe characterize the observed source position variations and identify the\npossible factors causing such variations. We find that the primary contributor\nis source structure for sources above 20-degree declination while the\nsensitivity of the observations to the declination coordinate predominates for\nsources below 20-degree declination. The position time series are further\nexplored to derive more realistic uncertainties for the quad-band positions.\nSignificant position offsets with respect to the positions at 2.2/8.6 GHz are\nfound for 15% of the sources. For 6% of the sources, the offsets are larger\nthan 0.8 milli-arcseconds. Source structure may be divided into two parts: the\ninvisible structure (within the beam size) and the visible structure (on larger\nscales). The latter causes closure delays enlarging post-fit delay residuals in\ngeodetic solutions whereas the former causes source position changes. Such\nposition changes will contribute significantly to the offsets between radio and\noptical positions. Overall, this work highlights the necessity to have a\nspecific quad-band catalog for processing operational quad-band observations.",

To address this problem, this\npaper proposes a novel paradigm to select and reuse VLM for downstream tasks,\ncalled Model Label Learning (MLL). The proposal contains three key modules:\n\\emph{model labeling}, which assigns labels to each VLM to describe their\nspecialty and utility; \\emph{model selection}, which matches the requirements\nof the target task with model labels; and \\emph{model reuse}, which applies\nselected VLMs to the target task in an ensemble manner. The proposal is highly\ncomputationally efficient and growable since the model labeling process is\ncompleted target task independent and the ability could grow with the number of\ncandidate VLMs. We also introduce a new benchmark for evaluating VLM selection\nmethods, including 49 VLMs and 17 target task datasets.

    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of enabling sensing through the cellular network is to\nobtain coordinated sensing of an unprecedented scale, through distributed\nintegrated sensing and communication (D-ISAC). This, however, introduces\nchallenges related to synchronization and demands new transmission\nmethodologies. In this paper, we propose a transmit signal design framework for\nD-ISAC systems, where multiple ISAC nodes cooperatively perform sensing and\ncommunication without requiring phase-level synchronization. The proposed\nframework employing orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) jointly\ndesigns downlink coordinated multi-point (CoMP) communication signals and\nmulti-input multi-output (MIMO) radar signals, leveraging both collocated and\ndistributed MIMO radars to estimate angle-of-arrival (AOA) and time-of-flight\n(TOF) from all possible multi-static measurements for target localization. To\ndesign the optimal D-ISAC transmit signal, we use the target localization\nCram\\'er-Rao bound (CRB) as the sensing performance metric and the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as the communication performance\nmetric. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to minimize the\nlocalization CRB while maintaining a minimum SINR requirement for each\ncommunication user. Moreover, we present three distinct transmit signal design\napproaches, including optimal, orthogonal, and beamforming designs, which\nreveal trade-offs between ISAC performance and computational complexity. Unlike\nsingle-node ISAC systems, the proposed D-ISAC designs involve per-subcarrier\nsensing signal optimization to enable accurate TOF estimation, which\ncontributes to the target localization performance. Numerical simulations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed designs in achieving flexible\nISAC trade-offs and efficient D-ISAC signal transmission.",

In particular, our theoretical upper bound applies to models where DM\ncouples to the electron density as well as the spin, paramagnetic and Rashba\ncurrents in materials, and arises from the Kramers-Kronig relations that\nconstrain the analytic properties of the scattering rate. We evaluate our\nmaximum rate formula numerically for Ar, Xe, Ge, and Si targets and find that\nGe and Si detectors are closer to saturate this theoretical upper bound, but\nstill far from saturation when DM couples to densities or currents which are\ndifferent from the electron density.

    "abstract": "Many physics-informed machine learning methods for PDE-based problems rely on\nGaussian processes (GPs) or neural networks (NNs). However, both face\nlimitations when data are scarce and the dimensionality is high. Although GPs\nare known for their robust uncertainty quantification in low-dimensional\nsettings, their computational complexity becomes prohibitive as the\ndimensionality increases. In contrast, while conventional NNs can accommodate\nhigh-dimensional input, they often require extensive training data and do not\noffer uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a\nPDE-constrained Deep Kernel Learning (PDE-DKL) framework that combines DL and\nGPs under explicit PDE constraints. Specifically, NNs learn a low-dimensional\nlatent representation of the high-dimensional PDE problem, reducing the\ncomplexity of the problem. GPs then perform kernel regression subject to the\ngoverning PDEs, ensuring accurate solutions and principled uncertainty\nquantification, even when available data are limited. This synergy unifies the\nstrengths of both NNs and GPs, yielding high accuracy, robust uncertainty\nestimates, and computational efficiency for high-dimensional PDEs. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that PDE-DKL achieves high accuracy with reduced data\nrequirements.

These devices must be\nenergy efficient to minimize battery size, improve comfort, and reduce\nrecharging intervals. This paper investigates the use of specialized\nlow-precision arithmetic formats to enhance the energy efficiency of biomedical\nwearables. Specifically, we explore posit arithmetic, a floating-point-like\nrepresentation, in two key applications: cough detection for chronic cough\nmonitoring and R peak detection in ECG analysis. Simulations reveal that 16-bit\nposits can replace 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point numbers with minimal accuracy\nloss in cough detection. For R peak detection, posit arithmetic achieves\nsatisfactory accuracy with as few as 10 or 8 bits, compared to the 16-bit\nrequirement for floating-point formats. To further this exploration, we\nintroduce PHEE, a modular and extensible architecture that integrates the\nCoprosit posit coprocessor within a RISC-V-based system. Using the X-HEEP\nframework, PHEE seamlessly incorporates posit arithmetic, demonstrating reduced\nhardware area and power consumption compared to a floating-point counterpart\nsystem.

However, these methods often suffer\nfrom performance degradation when the data distribution shifts, primarily due\nto limited generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose\nan online model fine-tuning approach for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems.\nWe consider full-model fine-tuning, where both the encoder and decoder are\njointly updated using recent CSI samples. A key challenge in this setup is the\ntransmission of updated decoder parameters, which introduces additional\nfeedback overhead. To mitigate this bottleneck, we incorporate the bit-rate of\nmodel updates into the fine-tuning objective and entropy code the updates\njointly with the compressed CSI. To reduce the bit-rate, we design an efficient\nprior distribution that encourages the network to update only the most\nsignificant weights, thereby minimizing the overall model update cost.

    "abstract": "The physical factors that influence the development of molecular cloud's\ndensity contrast are connected to those that affect star formation in the\ngalaxy. For NGC 628 (M74), the proportion of high- and low-density contrast\nclouds initially increases with the distance to the galactic center ($R_{G}$)\nand then keeps relatively stable. Spiral arms, bubbles and magnetic fields are\nnot responsible for the variations in density contrast observed among molecular\nclouds. The effects of shear and tides calculated from the galactic rotation\ncurve consistently decrease as $R_{G}$ increases, and the shear effect can be\nneglected. We further studied the tidal effects of the neighboring material on\neach cloud using the tidal tensor analysis and the pixel-by-pixel computation,\nafter combining molecular gas, atomic gas and stellar mass surface density\nmaps. When $R_{\\rm G} <$ 4 kpc, the tidal strengths derived from the\npixel-by-pixel computation decrease as $R_{\\rm G}$ increases, and then remains\nrelatively constant when $R_{\\rm G} >$ 4 kpc. This aligns well with the\ndependence of the proportion of high- and low-density contrast clouds on\n$R_{\\rm G}$. Therefore, the tidal effects of neighboring material have a\nsignificant impact on the development of molecular cloud's density contrast. A\nkey factor contributing to the low star formation rate in the galactic center\nis the excessive tidal influences from neighboring material on molecular\nclouds, which hinder the gravitational collapse within these clouds, resulting\nin low density contrasts. The tidal effects from neighboring material may also\nbe a significant contributing factor to the slowing down of a pure free-fall\ngravitational collapse for gas structures on galaxy-cloud scales revealed in\nour previous works by velocity gradient measurements.",

In dense outdoor point\nclouds, the receptive field of a machine learning model may be too small to\naccurately determine the surroundings and context of a point. By computing\nDigital Terrain Models (DTMs) from the point clouds, we extract the relative\nelevation feature, which is the vertical distance from the terrain to a point.\nRandLA-Net is employed for efficient semantic segmentation of large-scale point\nclouds. We assess its performance across three diverse outdoor datasets\ncaptured with varying sensor technologies and sensor locations. Integration of\nrelative elevation data leads to consistent performance improvements across all\nthree datasets, most notably in the Hessigheim dataset, with an increase of 3.7\npercentage points in average F1 score from 72.35% to 76.01%, by establishing\nlong-range dependencies between ground and objects. We also explore additional\nlocal features such as planarity, normal vectors, and 2D features, but their\nefficacy varied based on the characteristics of the point cloud. Ultimately,\nthis study underscores the important role of the non-local relative elevation\nfeature for semantic segmentation of point clouds in remote sensing\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement is a key quantum feature that enables quantum sensors to improve\ntheir sensitivity up to the Heisenberg limit. In the NV center platform, the\nHeisenberg limit can only be achieved when the axes of the NV centers are\nparallel. Nevertheless, parallel NV centers are spectrally indistinguishable\nand no mechanisms to directly prepare Heisenberg--limit--grade entanglement in\nsuch configurations are known to date. In this work we propose for the first\ntime a viable mechanism to prepare entangled states in the double quantum\ntransition of two dipolarly coupled NV centers whose axes are parallel without\npopulating intermediate states, so as to reach the Heisenberg limit in sensing.\nOur approach is based on the NV effective Raman coupling (NV-ERC) protocol and\nmakes use of global addressing of both NV centers with a single monochromatic\nmicrowave pulse. Supported by an adiabatic elimination analysis, several\nmechanisms for the preparation of different entangled states are identified,\nall of which avoid the involvement of intermediate states. This not only\nminimizes the impact of additional noise sources, but also enables the state\ngeneration process itself to serve as effective sensing time--an advantage over\nconventional approaches where such preparation typically constitutes a\nseparate, non--contributory stage. We consider the generation of different\nentangled states belonging to the double quantum transition, sensitive to\neither transverse electric fields or longitudinal magnetic fields, all with a\nfourfold improved sensitivity compared to conventional single NV settings.",

Through analyzing this network, we can\ncharacterize both the gravitational interactions and the physical properties of\nthe clouds using geometry-based network metrics. A strong correlation is\nobserved between the geometric and physical properties of the nodes (clouds).\nHigh-mass clouds tend to exhibit less clustering and greater average\nseparations, suggesting that they generally have fewer neighbors. During their\nformation and evolution, high-mass clouds may deplete nearby gas via accretion\nor merging, leading to more isolated characteristics within the network. This\naligns with observations showing a decrease in the virial ratio of molecular\nclouds as their mass increases. For clouds at different evolutionary stages,\nless evolved clouds with lower mass are typically found in tighter\ngravitational subnetworks, with closer proximity to neighboring clouds.

    "abstract": "Rapid progress in text-to-motion generation has been largely driven by\ndiffusion models. However, existing methods focus solely on temporal modeling,\nthereby overlooking frequency-domain analysis. We identify two key phases in\nmotion denoising: the **semantic planning stage** and the **fine-grained\nimproving stage**. To address these phases effectively, we propose\n**Fre**quency **e**nhanced **t**ext-**to**-**m**otion diffusion model\n(**Free-T2M**), incorporating stage-specific consistency losses that enhance\nthe robustness of static features and improve fine-grained accuracy. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, on\nStableMoFusion, our method reduces the FID from **0.189** to **0.051**,\nestablishing a new SOTA performance within the diffusion architecture. These\nfindings highlight the importance of incorporating frequency-domain insights\ninto text-to-motion generation for more precise and robust results.",

    "abstract": "Improving agility and maintainability are common drivers for companies to\nadopt a microservice architecture for their existing software systems. However,\nthe existing software often relies heavily on the fact that it is executed\nwithin a single process space. Therefore, decomposing existing software into\nout-of-process components like microservices can have a severe impact on\nnon-functional properties, such as overall performance due to invocation\noverhead or data consistency.\n  To minimize this impact, it is important to consider non-functional\nproperties already as part of the design process of the service boundaries. A\nuseful method for such considerations are what-if analyses, which allow to\nexplore different scenarios and to develop the service boundaries in an\niterative and incremental way. Experience from an industrial case study\nsuggests that for these analyses, ease of use and speed tend to be more\nimportant than precision.\n  In this paper, we present emerging results for an approach for what-if\nanalyses based on trace rewriting that is (i) specifically designed for\nanalyzing the impact on non-functional properties due to decomposition into\nout-of-process components and (ii) deliberately prefers ease of use and\nanalysis speed over precision of the results.",

As capture devices,\nwearable arrays with only a few microphones with irregular arrangement face\nchallenges in achieving a reproduction quality comparable to that of arrays\nwith a large number of microphones. Binaural signal matching (BSM) has recently\nbeen presented as a signal-independent approach for generating high-quality\nbinaural signal using only a few microphones, which is further improved using\nmagnitude-least squares (MagLS) optimization at high frequencies. This paper\nextends BSM with MagLS by introducing interaural level difference (ILD) into\nthe MagLS, integrated into BSM (BSM-iMagLS). Using a deep neural network\n(DNN)-based solver, BSM-iMagLS achieves joint optimization of magnitude, ILD,\nand magnitude derivatives, improving spatial fidelity. Performance is validated\nthrough theoretical analysis, numerical simulations with diverse HRTFs and\nhead-mounted array geometries, and listening experiments, demonstrating a\nsubstantial reduction in ILD errors while maintaining comparable magnitude\naccuracy to state-of-the-art solutions.

Low-order rendering is of interest, when working with microphone\narrays containing only a few sensors, or for reducing the bandwidth for signal\ntransmission.

Building upon this idea, we suggest Masked\nMagnitude Least Squares, which optimized the Ambisonics coefficients with a\nneural network and employs a spatio-spectral weighting mask to control the\naccuracy of the magnitude reconstruction. In the tested case, the weighting\nmask helped to maintain high-frequency notches in the low-order HRTFs and\nimproved the modeled median plane localization performance in comparison to\nMagLS, while only marginally affecting the overall accuracy of the magnitude\nreconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Plants respond to biotic and abiotic stresses through complex and dynamic\nmechanisms that integrate physical, chemical, and biological cues. Here, we\npresent a multi-physics platform designed to systematically investigate these\nresponses across scales. The platform combines a six-axis micromanipulator with\ninterchangeable probes to deliver precise mechanical, electrostatic, optical,\nand chemical stimuli. Using this system, we explore calcium signaling in\nArabidopsis thaliana, thigmonastic motion in Mimosa pudica, and chemical\nexchange via microinjection in Rosmarinus officinalis L. and Ocimum basilicum.\nOur findings highlight stimulus-specific and spatially dependent responses:\nmechanical and electrostatic stimuli elicit distinct calcium signaling\npatterns, while repeated electrostatic stimulation exhibited evidence of\nresponse fatigue. Thigmonastic responses in Mimosa pudica depend on the\nlocation of perturbation, highlighting the intricate bi-directional calcium\nsignaling. Microinjection experiments successfully demonstrate targeted\nchemical perturbations in glandular trichomes, opening avenues for biochemical\nstudies. This open-source platform provides a versatile tool for dissecting\nplant stress responses, bridging the gap between fundamental research and\napplied technologies in agriculture and bioengineering.

While traditional FL approaches preserve privacy, they often\nstruggle with high computational and communication overhead. To address these\nissues, model pruning is introduced as a strategy to streamline computations.\nHowever, existing pruning methods, when applied solely based on local data,\noften produce sub-models that inadequately reflect clients' specific tasks due\nto data insufficiency. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces SAFL\n(Structure-Aware Federated Learning), a novel framework that enhances\npersonalized federated learning through client-specific clustering and Similar\nClient Structure Information (SCSI)-guided model pruning. SAFL employs a\ntwo-stage process: initially, it groups clients based on data similarities and\nuses aggregated pruning criteria to guide the pruning process, facilitating the\nidentification of optimal sub-models. Subsequently, clients train these pruned\nmodels and engage in server-based aggregation, ensuring tailored and efficient\nmodels for each client. This method significantly reduces computational\noverhead while improving inference accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SAFL markedly diminishes model size and improves performance, making it\nhighly effective in federated environments characterized by heterogeneous data.",

If the\nmass of the dark exchanged gauge boson is less than the mass of dark matter\nparticles multiplied by the dark fine-structure constant, the wave function of\nthe incoming particles of dark matter annihilation would be distorted away from\nthe free plane-wave approximation, yielding the significant enhancements to\nannihilation cross sections, known as Sommerfeld enhancement. Sommerfeld\nenhancement results the asymmetric dark matter relic density under abundant,\nwhile the enhanced cosmic expansion rate increases the relic density of\nasymmetric dark matter by letting the decoupling from the thermal equilibrium\noccurs earlier. However, the mixed effect of modified cosmic expansion and the\nSommerfeld enhancement on asymmetric dark matter density evolution becomes\nquite complicated, due to their opposing affects on relic density and contrary\nstrength developments as the temperature fell. We investigated the mixed\neffects on asymmetric dark matter freeze-out process and current relic\nabundance, which is significantly different from the standard situation.\nFurther, we calculate the constraint relations of the asymmetric dark matter\npertubative annihilation cross section and dark coupling constant with the mass\nof asymmetric dark matter, the asymmetry factor with the dark coupling\nconstant, when the relic density of asymmetric dark matter falled in the\nobserved region.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to four fundamental problems in the\nfield of cosmological perturbation theory. Firstly, the issue of gauge\ndependence has been addressed by demonstrating the existence of unique and\ngauge-invariant quantities corresponding to the actual perturbations. Secondly,\nthe formation of primordial structures after decoupling of matter and radiation\nis dependent on the existence of local fluid flows resulting from local\npressure gradients. To take pressure gradients into account, it is necessary to\nconsider both the energy density and the particle number density. Thirdly, the\nnovel relativistic perturbation theory applies to an open, flat, and closed\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. The derivation of the novel\nperturbation theory definitively reveals the inherent limitations of Newtonian\ngravitation as a framework for investigating cosmological density\nperturbations. Finally, the application of the perturbation theory to a flat\nuniverse demonstrates that, prior to decoupling, perturbations in both Cold\nDark Matter and ordinary matter are coupled to perturbations in radiation.\nTherefore, the universe's earliest structures formed only after decoupling, at\nwhich point local nonadiabatic random pressure fluctuations became a\nsignificant factor. Negative nonadiabatic pressure fluctuations resulted in a\nbrief, rapid growth of density fluctuations until the total pressure\nfluctuations became positive. In contrast, positive nonadiabatic pressure\nfluctuations led to the formation of voids. Perturbations with masses about\n$2.2\\times10^{4}\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$ became nonlinear already $60$ million years\nafter the Big Bang, and perturbations with masses between\n$6.7\\times10^2\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$ and $1.2\\times10^6\\,\\text{M}_\\odot$ became\nnonlinear within about $600$ million years.",

The multichannel optical 1x1 convolution operation is\nexperimentally validated by using the deep residual U-Net, demonstrating\nprecise segmentation of pneumonia lesion region in lung CT images. In addition,\nthe capability of the 2x2 optical convolution operation is also experimentally\nvalidated by constructing an optical convolution layer and integrating an\nelectrical fully connected layer, achieving ten-class classification of\nhandwritten digit images.

    "abstract": "Tax evasion, usually the largest component of an informal economy, is a\npersistent challenge over history with significant socio-economic implications.\nMany socio-economic studies investigate its dynamics, including influencing\nfactors, the role and influence of taxation policies, and the prediction of the\ntax evasion volume over time. These studies assumed such behavior is given, as\nobserved in the real world, neglecting the \"big bang\" of such activity in a\npopulation. To this end, computational economy studies adopted developments in\ncomputer simulations, in general, and recent innovations in artificial\nintelligence (AI), in particular, to simulate and study informal economy\nappearance in various socio-economic settings. This study presents a novel\ncomputational framework to examine the dynamics of tax evasion and the\nemergence of informal economic activity. Employing an agent-based simulation\npowered by Large Language Models and Deep Reinforcement Learning, the framework\nis uniquely designed to allow informal economic behaviors to emerge\norganically, without presupposing their existence or explicitly signaling\nagents about the possibility of evasion. This provides a rigorous approach for\nexploring the socio-economic determinants of compliance behavior. The\nexperimental design, comprising model validation and exploratory phases,\ndemonstrates the framework's robustness in replicating theoretical economic\nbehaviors. Findings indicate that individual personality traits, external\nnarratives, enforcement probabilities, and the perceived efficiency of public\ngoods provision significantly influence both the timing and extent of informal\neconomic activity. The results underscore that efficient public goods provision\nand robust enforcement mechanisms are complementary; neither alone is\nsufficient to curtail informal activity effectively.",

First, they struggle to incorporate\nnewly arrived data with varying distributions into training, such as patient\nrecords from different hospitals, thus rendering sub-optimal generalizability\nand limited utility in real-world applications. Second, most multimodal\nintegration methods rely on simplistic concatenation or task-specific\npipelines, which fail to capture the complex interdependencies across\nmodalities. To address these, we propose a continually evolving multi-modal\nfoundation model. Extensive experiments on the TCGA dataset demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance cancer\nprognosis by enabling robust and adaptive multimodal integration.",

In retrospect, the qualitative or\nsemi-qualitative construction of one-flavor baryons on the $\\eta'$ domain wall\nreveals that these baryons can be described as quantum Hall droplets,\nresembling topological solitons akin to skyrmions. Using an effective theory on\nthe $\\eta'$ domain wall, which is conjectured to be the Chern--Simons--Higgs\ntheory, it is discussed that its vortex solution with unit baryon numbers\nnaturally has a spin of $N_c/2$, and thus can be interpreted as a baryon or\nmulti-baryon structure. The particle--vortex duality suggests that quarks carry\na fractional topological charge of $1/N_c$ and obey fractional statistics. In\nterms of chiral bag models, confinement can be attributed to the monopoles\nconfined within the bag, and the vector meson fields on the bag surface are\nessential for ensuring the correct baryon number in the chiral bag framework,\nthereby providing deeper insights into baryons as non-trivial topological\nstructures of the meson field.

Together, they significantly\nreduce token requirements, transforming the analysis of multiple moderately\nlarge-scale transaction graphs with LLMs from nearly impossible to feasible\nunder strict token limits. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs have\noutstanding performance on foundational metrics and characteristic overview,\nwhere the accuracy of recognizing most basic information at the node level\nexceeds 98.50% and the proportion of obtaining meaningful characteristics\nreaches 95.00%. Regarding contextual interpretation, LLMs also demonstrate\nstrong performance in classification tasks, even with very limited labeled\ndata, where top-3 accuracy reaches 72.43% with explanations.

    "abstract": "Building reliable speech systems often requires combining multiple\nmodalities, like audio and visual cues. While such multimodal solutions\nfrequently lead to improvements in performance and may even be critical in\ncertain cases, they come with several constraints such as increased sensory\nrequirements, computational cost, and modality synchronization, to mention a\nfew. These challenges constrain the direct uses of these multimodal solutions\nin real-world applications. In this work, we develop approaches where the\nlearning happens with all available modalities but the deployment or inference\nis done with just one or reduced modalities. To do so, we propose a Multimodal\nTraining and Unimodal Deployment (MUTUD) framework which includes a Temporally\nAligned Modality feature Estimation (TAME) module that can estimate information\nfrom missing modality using modalities present during inference. This\ninnovative approach facilitates the integration of information across different\nmodalities, enhancing the overall inference process by leveraging the strengths\nof each modality to compensate for the absence of certain modalities during\ninference. We apply MUTUD to various audiovisual speech tasks and show that it\ncan reduce the performance gap between the multimodal and corresponding\nunimodal models to a considerable extent. MUTUD can achieve this while reducing\nthe model size and compute compared to multimodal models, in some cases by\nalmost 80%.",

The expected dose (average) and the standard deviation of the 4D\ndoses were obtained. The relative difference between the expected GTV\nminimal/mean (GTVMin/GTVMean) dose and the planned ITVMin/ITVMean dose (denoted\nby %E/P), and between the GTVMin and the prescription dose (DRx) were computed.\n  Results: The %E/P for GTVMean was significantly lower for IMRT than VMAT\n(0.5% +/- 7.7% v.s. 3.5% +/- 5.0%, p=0.04). The expected GTVMin was lower than\nDRx in 9.4% of all IMRT plans versus 3.1% in VMAT. The worst-case scenario, 4D\nGTVMin was 14.1% lower than the ITVMin. Choices of PTV margin or dose\nheterogeneity to be achieved in PTV can result in significant difference\n(p<0.05) in motion interplay depending on delivery techniques.\n  Conclusion: Motion interplay may cause the expected GTVMin to be less than\nthe planned ITV minimal dose and DRx for both IMRT and VMAT plans.

Unlike the\nHawking temperature, this empirical temperature appears universal, and its\nproximity to the Planck temperature suggests a possible quantum gravity origin.\nWe also establish the connection between these temperatures. Furthermore,\nextending the conventional fractional parameter $q$, constrained between 0 and\n1, we establish that any positive real number can bound $q$ under the concavity\ncondition, provided the log of micro-state dimensionality exceeds $q-1$.\nSpecifically, for black holes, $q = 2$, necessitating micro-state\ndimensionality greater than $e$, thereby excluding the construction of black\nhole horizon states with two level bits or qubits. We also identify the\nconnection between the validity of the second law and information fluctuation\ncomplexity. The second law requires that the variance of information content\nremain smaller than the area of the black hole horizon.

While most of the testing techniques proposed in the past rely\non the API specification to generate the test cases, a major limitation of such\nan approach is that in the case of an incomplete or inconsistent specification,\nthe test cases may not be realistic in nature and would result in a lot of 4xx\nresponse due to invalid input.

To address this limitation, this\npaper proposes a dynamic test refinement approach that leverages the response\nmessage. The response is used to infer the point in the API testing flow where\na test scenario fix is required. Using an intelligent agent, the approach adds\nconstraints to the API specification that are further used to generate a test\nscenario accounting for the learned constraint from the response. Following a\ngreedy approach, the iterative learning and refinement of test scenarios are\nobtained from the API testing system. The proposed approach led to a decrease\nin the number of 4xx responses, taking a step closer to generating more\nrealistic test cases with high coverage that would aid in functional testing.

In\nparticular, overestimation becomes worse in multi-agent settings due to the\npresence of multiple actions, resulting in the BC regularization-based approach\neasily suffering from either over-regularization or critic divergence. To\naddress this, we propose a simple yet effective method, Behavior Cloning\nregularization with Critic Clipping (B3C), which clips the target critic value\nin policy evaluation based on the maximum return in the dataset and pushes the\nlimit of the weight on the RL objective over BC regularization, thereby\nimproving performance.

Researchers are often\nleft with no option but to use more affordable methods that may lack the\naccuracy required to model critical processes in photochemistry such as\nphotolysis, photocatalysis, and non-adiabatic relaxation. A great deal of work\nhas been dedicated to refining single-reference descriptions of static\ncorrelation in the ground state via ``addition-by-subtraction'' coupled cluster\nmethods such as pair coupled cluster with double substitutions (pCCD),\nsinglet-paired CCD (CCD0), triplet-paired CCD (CCD1), and CCD with frozen\nsinglet- or triplet-paired amplitudes (CCDf0/CCDf1). By combining wave\nfunctions derived from these methods with the intermediate state representation\n(ISR), we gain insights into the extensibility of single-reference coupled\ncluster theory's coverage of static correlation to the excited state problem.\nOur CCDf1-ISR(2) approach is robust in the face of static correlation and\nprovides enough dynamical correlation to accurately predict excitation energies\nto within about 0.2~eV in small organic molecules. We also highlight distinct\nadvantages of the Hermitian ISR construction, such as the avoidance of\npathological failures of equation-of-motion methods for excited state potential\nenergy surface topology.

The Entropy-Synchronized Neural Hashing (ESNH)\nframework introduces a novel approach that leverages entropy-driven hash\nrepresentations to classify software binaries based on their underlying entropy\ncharacteristics. Through the synchronization of entropy profiles with neural\nnetwork architectures, the model generates robust and unique hash values that\nmaintain stability even when faced with polymorphic and metamorphic\ntransformations. Comparative analysis against traditional detection approaches\nrevealed superior performance in identifying novel threats, reducing\nfalse-positive rates, and achieving consistent classification across diverse\nransomware families. The incorporation of a self-regulating hash convergence\nmechanism further ensured that entropy-synchronized hashes remained invariant\nacross executions, minimizing classification inconsistencies that often arise\ndue to dynamic modifications in ransomware payloads. Experimental results\ndemonstrated high detection rates across contemporary ransomware strains, with\nthe model exhibiting resilience against encryption-based evasion mechanisms,\ncode injection strategies, and reflective loading techniques. Unlike\nconventional detection mechanisms that rely on static signatures and heuristic\nanalysis, the proposed entropy-aware classification framework adapts to\nemerging threats through an inherent ability to capture entropy anomalies\nwithin executable structures.

Although general\nauto-tuning systems and solutions - both from established production practices\nand open-source solutions - can address this problem, they typically require\nweeks or even months to identify a feasible solution. Such prolonged tuning\nprocesses are unacceptable in production environments for recommendation\nsystems, as suboptimal value models can severely degrade user experience. An\neffective auto-tuning solution is required to identify a viable model within\n2-3 days, rather than the extended timelines typically associated with existing\napproaches. In this paper, we introduce a practical auto-tuning system named\nHyperZero that addresses these time constraints while effectively solving the\nunique challenges inherent in modern recommendation systems. Moreover, this\nframework has the potential to be expanded to broader tuning tasks within\nrecommendation systems.",

These different propagation speeds imply that polarizations\ngenerated by the same source will not arrive simultaneously at the detector.\nCurrent constraints on the speed of propagation of transverse-traceless\npolarizations, however, indicate that any additional polarizations must arrive\nwith or before the transverse-traceless ones. We propose a new technique to\ntest for the existence of superluminal, non-transverse-traceless polarizations\nthat arrive in the data before a gravitational-wave observation of\ntransverse-traceless modes. We discuss the circumstances in which these\nnon-transverse-traceless polarizations would be detectable and what constraints\ncould be placed if they are not detected. To determine whether this new test of\ngeneral relativity with gravitational wave observations is practical, we\noutline and address many of the challenges it might face.

Due to more correlation\ninformation in the channel dimension of the concatenated image, a novel feature\nextractor is designed based on an attention mechanism to integrate\nmulti-dimensional information from the concatenation of two continuous frames.\nTo extract more complete feature representation from the fused features, a\nnovel pose decoder is proposed to predict the pose transformation from the\nconcatenated feature map at the end of the framework. At last, the absolute\npose of endoscope is calculated based on relative poses. The experiment is\nconducted on three datasets of various endoscopic scenes and the results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\nBesides, the inference speed of the proposed method is over 30 frames per\nsecond, which meets the real-time requirement.

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the decoherence of a quantum spatial superposition of\na massive body created by an observer, Alice, that is subject to a short burst\nof gravitational radiation. We consider gravitational wave bursts with a simple\noscillatory waveform and step-function memory waveform. Using a local\ndescription of the decoherence, we obtain an analytic estimate of the number of\nsoft gravitons radiated by Alice's state. Moreover, we decompose her\ndecoherence into contributions from the oscillatory and memory waveforms.\n  We show that Alice's state decoheres proportional to the memory of the\ngravitational radiation she emits. To leading order, our calculation using a\nlocal description of the decoherence agrees with the decoherence caused by her\nradiating quadrupole. In general, the oscillatory contributions are strongly\ndependent on the phase of the burst when it is switched off. This work serves\nas a step towards understanding the interplay between quantum mechanical\nsystems and gravity by demonstrating the role gravitational waves and the\nmemory effect have in the loss of coherence of quantum superpositions. We also\nbriefly investigate the electromagnetic analogue of this gedankenexperiment, in\nwhich Alice is subject to a burst of electromagnetic radiation, and discuss its\ncorrespondence to the gravitational case.",

Our proposed framework comprises of dynamic point\nremoval, multi-session map alignment, map change detection and map version\ncontrol. First, our sensor-setup agnostic dynamic point removal algorithm works\nseamlessly with both hand-held and robot-mounted setups to produce clean static\n3D maps. Second, the multi-session map alignment aligns these clean static maps\nautomatically, without manual parameter fine-tuning, into a single reference\nframe, using a two stage approach based on feature descriptor matching and fine\nregistration. Third, our novel map change detection identifies positive and\nnegative changes between two aligned maps. Finally, the map version control\nmaintains a single base map that represents the current state of the\nenvironment, and stores the detected positive and negative changes, and\nboundary information. Our unique map version control system can reconstruct any\nof the previous clean session maps and allows users to query changes between\nany two random mapping sessions, all without storing any input raw session\nmaps, making it very unique. Extensive experiments are performed using\nhand-held commercial LiDAR mapping devices and open-source robot-mounted LiDAR\nSLAM algorithms to evaluate each module and the whole 3D lifelong mapping\nframework.",

Methods: We have analyzed data from 794 patients diagnosed\nwith prostate cancer (PCa), using ten prominent 2D/3D I2I networks to convert\nultrasound (US) images into MRI scans. We also introduced a new analysis of\nRadiomic features (RF) via the Spearman correlation coefficient to explore\nwhether networks with high performance (SSIM>85%) could detect subtle RFs. Our\nstudy further examined synthetic images by 7 invited physicians. As a final\nevaluation study, we have investigated the improvement that are achieved using\nthe synthetic MRI data on two traditional machine learning and one deep\nlearning method. Results: In quantitative assessment, 2D-Pix2Pix network\nsubstantially outperformed the other 7 networks, with an average SSIM~0.855.\nThe RF analysis revealed that 76 out of 186 RFs were identified using the\n2D-Pix2Pix algorithm alone, although half of the RFs were lost during the\ntranslation process. A detailed qualitative review by 7 medical doctors noted a\ndeficiency in low-level feature recognition in I2I tasks. Furthermore, the\nstudy found that synthesized image-based classification outperformed US\nimage-based classification with an average accuracy and AUC~0.93. Conclusion:\nThis study showed that while 2D-Pix2Pix outperformed cutting-edge networks in\nlow-level feature discovery and overall error and similarity metrics, it still\nrequires improvement in low-level feature performance, as highlighted by Group\n3. Further, the study found using synthetic image-based classification\noutperformed original US image-based methods.",

In this work, we first show that model architecture affects inference\nlatency, where models of the same size can have up to 3.5x difference in\nlatency. To tackle this challenge, we modify the Chinchilla scaling laws to\nco-optimize the model parameter count, the number of training tokens, and the\nmodel architecture. Due to the reason that models of similar training loss\nexhibit gaps in downstream evaluation, we also propose a novel method to train\ninference-efficient models based on the revised scaling laws. We perform\nextensive empirical studies to fit and evaluate our inference-aware scaling\nlaws. We vary model parameters from 80M to 1B, training tokens from 1.6B to\n30B, and model shapes, training 63 models. Guided by our inference-efficient\nscaling law and model selection method, we release the Morph-1B model, which\nimproves inference latency by 1.8x while maintaining accuracy on downstream\ntasks compared to open-source models, pushing the Pareto frontier of\naccuracy-latency tradeoff.

    "abstract": "Bayesian inference for statistical models with a hierarchical structure is\noften characterized by specification of priors for parameters at different\nlevels of the hierarchy. When higher level parameters are functions of the\nlower level parameters, specifying a prior on the lower level parameters leads\nto induced priors on the higher level parameters. However, what are deemed\nuninformative priors for lower level parameters can induce strikingly non-vague\npriors for higher level parameters. Depending on the sample size and specific\nmodel parameterization, these priors can then have unintended effects on the\nposterior distribution of the higher level parameters.\n  Here we focus on Bayesian inference for the Bernoulli distribution parameter\n$\\theta$ which is modeled as a function of covariates via a logistic\nregression, where the coefficients are the lower level parameters for which\npriors are specified. A specific area of interest and application is the\nmodeling of survival probabilities in capture-recapture data and occupancy and\ndetection probabilities in presence-absence data. In particular we propose\nalternative priors for the coefficients that yield specific induced priors for\n$\\theta$. We address three induced prior cases. The simplest is when the\ninduced prior for $\\theta$ is Uniform(0,1). The second case is when the induced\nprior for $\\theta$ is an arbitrary Beta($\\alpha$, $\\beta$) distribution. The\nthird case is one where the intercept in the logistic model is to be treated\ndistinct from the partial slope coefficients; e.g., $E[\\theta]$ equals a\nspecified value on (0,1) when all covariates equal 0. Simulation studies were\ncarried out to evaluate performance of these priors and the methods were\napplied to a real presence/absence data set and occupancy modelling.",

In a self-training loop, EvalPlanner\niteratively optimizes over synthetically constructed evaluation plans and\nexecutions, leading to better final verdicts. Our method achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art performance for generative reward models on RewardBench (with\na score of 93.9), despite being trained on fewer amount of, and synthetically\ngenerated, preference pairs. Additional experiments on other benchmarks like\nRM-Bench, JudgeBench, and FollowBenchEval further highlight the utility of both\nplanning and reasoning for building robust LLM-as-a-Judge reasoning models.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art machine learning systems are vulnerable to small\nperturbations to their input, where ``small'' is defined according to a threat\nmodel that assigns a positive threat to each perturbation. Most prior works\ndefine a task-agnostic, isotropic, and global threat, like the $\\ell_p$ norm,\nwhere the magnitude of the perturbation fully determines the degree of the\nthreat and neither the direction of the attack nor its position in space\nmatter. However, common corruptions in computer vision, such as blur,\ncompression, or occlusions, are not well captured by such threat models. This\npaper proposes a novel threat model called \\texttt{Projected Displacement} (PD)\nto study robustness beyond existing isotropic and global threat models. The\nproposed threat model measures the threat of a perturbation via its alignment\nwith \\textit{unsafe directions}, defined as directions in the input space along\nwhich a perturbation of sufficient magnitude changes the ground truth class\nlabel. Unsafe directions are identified locally for each input based on\nobserved training data. In this way, the PD threat model exhibits anisotropy\nand locality. Experiments on Imagenet-1k data indicate that, for any input, the\nset of perturbations with small PD threat includes \\textit{safe} perturbations\nof large $\\ell_p$ norm that preserve the true label, such as noise, blur and\ncompression, while simultaneously excluding \\textit{unsafe} perturbations that\nalter the true label. Unlike perceptual threat models based on embeddings of\nlarge-vision models, the PD threat model can be readily computed for arbitrary\nclassification tasks without pre-training or finetuning. Further additional\ntask annotation such as sensitivity to image regions or concept hierarchies can\nbe easily integrated into the assessment of threat and thus the PD threat model\npresents practitioners with a flexible, task-driven threat specification.",

    "abstract": "Large language models based Multi Agent Systems (MAS) have demonstrated\npromising performance for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of code\ngeneration tasks. However,most existing methods follow a conventional sequence\nof planning, coding, and debugging,which contradicts the growth-driven nature\nof human learning process. Additionally,the frequent information interaction\nbetween multiple agents inevitably involves high computational costs. In this\npaper,we propose Cogito,a neurobiologically inspired multi-agent framework to\nenhance the problem-solving capabilities in code generation tasks with lower\ncost. Specifically,Cogito adopts a reverse sequence: it first undergoes\ndebugging, then coding,and finally planning. This approach mimics human\nlearning and development,where knowledge is acquired progressively.\nAccordingly,a hippocampus-like memory module with different functions is\ndesigned to work with the pipeline to provide quick retrieval in similar tasks.\nThrough this growth-based learning model,Cogito accumulates knowledge and\ncognitive skills at each stage,ultimately forming a Super Role an all capable\nagent to perform the code generation task. Extensive experiments against\nrepresentative baselines demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of\nCogito.

    "abstract": "The ability to control absorption by modifying the polarization of light\npresents an exciting opportunity to experimentally determine the orbital\nalignment of absorption features. Here, attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV)\ntransient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the polarization\ndependence of core exciton dynamics in LiF thin films at the Li+ K edge. XUV\npulses excite electrons from the Li 1s core level into the conduction band,\nallowing for the formation of a p-orbital-like core exciton, aligned along the\nXUV light polarization axis. A sub-5 fs near-infrared (NIR) probe pulse then\narrives at variable time delays, perturbing the XUV-excited states and allowing\nthe coherence decay of the core exciton to be mapped. The coherence lifetimes\nare found to be ~2.4 +- 0.4 fs, which is attributed to a phonon-mediated\ndephasing mechanism as in previous core exciton studies. The differential\nabsorption features are also shown to be sensitive to the relative polarization\nof the XUV and NIR fields. The parallel NIR probe induces couplings between the\ninitial XUV-excited p-like bright exciton and s-like dark excitons. When\ncrossed pump and probe polarizations are used, the coupling between the bright\nand dark states is no longer dipole-allowed, and the transient absorption\nsignal associated with the coupling is suppressed by approximately 90%. This\ninterpretation is supported by simulations of a few-level model system, as well\nas analysis of the calculated band structure. The results indicate that laser\npolarization can serve as a powerful experimental tool for exploring the\norbital alignment of core excitonic states in solid-state materials.",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) has spurred extensive\nresearch into their encoded moral norms and decision-making processes. Much of\nthis research relies on prompting LLMs with survey-style questions to assess\nhow well models are aligned with certain demographic groups, moral beliefs, or\npolitical ideologies. While informative, the adherence of these approaches to\nrelatively superficial constructs tends to oversimplify the complexity and\nnuance underlying everyday moral dilemmas. We argue that auditing LLMs along\nmore detailed axes of human interaction is of paramount importance to better\nassess the degree to which they may impact human beliefs and actions. To this\nend, we evaluate LLMs on complex, everyday moral dilemmas sourced from the \"Am\nI the Asshole\" (AITA) community on Reddit, where users seek moral judgments on\neveryday conflicts from other community members. We prompted seven LLMs to\nassign blame and provide explanations for over 10,000 AITA moral dilemmas. We\nthen compared the LLMs' judgments and explanations to those of Redditors and to\neach other, aiming to uncover patterns in their moral reasoning. Our results\ndemonstrate that large language models exhibit distinct patterns of moral\njudgment, varying substantially from human evaluations on the AITA subreddit.\nLLMs demonstrate moderate to high self-consistency but low inter-model\nagreement. Further analysis of model explanations reveals distinct patterns in\nhow models invoke various moral principles. These findings highlight the\ncomplexity of implementing consistent moral reasoning in artificial systems and\nthe need for careful evaluation of how different models approach ethical\njudgment. As LLMs continue to be used in roles requiring ethical\ndecision-making such as therapists and companions, careful evaluation is\ncrucial to mitigate potential biases and limitations.",

This\nground-to-flight mapping introduces uncertainties which need to be accounted\nfor while designing any thermal protection system. Thus, precise computational\nmodels along with uncertainty quantification in the models are required to\ndesign the TPS. The focus of this study is to estimate the thermal material\nparameters of TPS based on the target reliability requirements using\nstatistical methods. To perform uncertainty quantification (UQ) of a system, a\nsimulated model of the system needs to be solved many times on statistical\nsamples, increasing the computational time and cost of the overall process. A\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN) model is used in the analysis instead of\ntraditional physics based numerical solutions. The accuracy of PINN is\ncomparable to that of the numerical solution. To find the parameter\ndistribution, sampling of the parameter space is performed using Sequential\nMonte- Carlo (SMC) method. The sampling method is efficient as it generates\nsamples based on the target distribution in parallel and it also generates\ndiverse samples for proper UQ. Combining the use of both PINN predictive model\nand SMC sampling, the framework can approximate the parameter distributions\nthat satisfy the TPS design reliability constraints. The framework achieved\nremarkable increases in the speed of performing the reliability analysis of the\nTPS.

    "abstract": "We propose a new method in indefinite-horizon settings for estimating optimal\ndynamic treatment regimes for time-to-event outcomes. This method allows\npatients to have different numbers of treatment stages and is constructed using\ngeneralized survival random forests to maximize mean survival time. We use\nsummarized history and data pooling, preventing data from growing in dimension\nas a patient's decision points increase. The algorithm operates through model\nre-fitting, resulting in a single model optimized for all patients and all\nstages. We derive theoretical properties of the estimator such as consistency\nof the estimator and value function and characterize the number of refitting\niterations needed. We also conduct a simulation study of patients with a\nflexible number of treatment stages to examine finite-sample performance of the\nestimator. Finally, we illustrate use of the algorithm using administrative\ninsurance claims data for pediatric Crohn's disease patients.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for the frustrated quantum spin systems\noccasionally suffer from the negative sign problem, which makes simulations\nexponentially harder for larger systems at lower temperatures and severely\nlimits QMC's application across a wide range of spin systems. This problem is\nknown to depend on the choice of representation basis. We propose a systematic\napproach for mitigating the sign problem independent of the given Hamiltonian\nor lattice structure. We first introduce the concept of negativity to\ncharacterize the severity of the negative sign problem. We then demonstrate the\nexistence of a locally defined quantity, the L1 adaptive loss function, which\neffectively approximates negativity, especially in frustration-free systems.\nUsing the proposed loss function, we demonstrate that optimizing the\nrepresentation basis can mitigate the negative sign. This is evidenced by\nseveral frustration-free models and other important quantum spin systems.\nFurthermore, we compare the effectiveness of unitary transformations against\nthe standard orthogonal transformation and reveal that unitary transformations\ncan effectively mitigate the sign problem in certain cases.",

    "abstract": "We study light-front physics and conformal symmetry, and their interplay both\non and off the light cone. The full symmetry of the light cone is conformal\nsymmetry not just Lorentz symmetry. Spontaneously breaking conformal symmetry\ngives masses to particles and takes them off the light cone. Canonical\nquantization specifies equal-time commutators on the light cone. Equal\ninstant-time and equal light-front-time commutators look very different, but\ncan be shown to be equivalent by looking at unequal-time commutators. We\ndiscuss the connection of the light-front approach to the infinite momentum\nframe approach, and show that vacuum graphs are outside this framework. We show\nthat there is a light-front structure to both AdS/CFT and the eikonal\napproximation.

    "abstract": "Although high-order Maxwell integral equation solvers provide significant\nadvantages in terms of speed and accuracy over corresponding low-order integral\nmethods, their performance significantly degrades in presence of non-smooth\ngeometries--owing to field enhancement and singularities that arise at sharp\nedges and corners which, if left untreated, give rise to significant accuracy\nlosses. The problem is particularly challenging in cases in which the \"density\"\n(i.e., the solution of the integral equation) tends to infinity at corners and\nedges--a difficulty that can be bypassed for 2D configurations, but which is\nunavoidable in 3D Maxwell integral formulations, wherein the component\ntangential to an edge of the electrical-current integral density vector tends\nto infinity at the edge. In order to tackle the problem this paper restricts\nattention to the simplest context in which the unbounded-density difficulty\narises, namely, integral formulations in 2D space whose integral density blows\nup at corners; the strategies proposed, however, generalize directly to the 3D\ncontext. The novel methodologies presented in this paper yield high-order\nconvergence for such challenging equations and achieve highly accurate\nsolutions (even near edges and corners) without requiring a priori analysis of\nthe geometry or use of singular bases.",

Furthermore, capturing the spatial heterogeneity of microstructures\nat the different scales is necessary within such framework to accurately\npredict their properties.

We demonstrate this approach on a wrought and\nadditively manufactured alloy, showing that it effectively encodes\nmicrostructural information and enables direct identification of\nmicrostructural heterogeneity not directly possible by physics-based models.\nThis data-reduced microstructure representation opens the application of\nmachine learning models in accelerating metallic material design and accurately\npredicting their properties.",

Cable bacteria are filamentous\nmulticellular microorganisms that have garnered much interest due to their\nability to serve as electrical conduits, transferring electrons over several\nmillimeters. Our results indicate that cable bacteria can also function as\nprotonic conduits because they contain proton wires that transport protons at\ndistances greater than 100 um. We find that protonic conductivity ({\\sigma}P)\nalong cable bacteria varies between samples and is measured as high as 114 +/-\n28 uS cm^-1 at 25-degrees C and 70-percent relative humidity (RH). For cable\nbacteria, the protonic conductance (GP) and {\\sigma}P are dependent upon the\nRH, increasing by as much as 26-fold between 60-percent and 80-percent RH. This\nobservation implies that proton transport occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism\nalong water associated with cable bacteria, forming proton wires. In order to\ndetermine {\\sigma}P and GP along cable bacteria, we implemented a protocol\nusing a modified transfer-printing technique to deposit either palladium\ninterdigitated protodes (IDP), palladium transfer length method (TLM) protodes,\nor gold interdigitated electrodes(IDE) on top of cable bacteria. Due to the\nrelatively mild nature of the transfer-printing technique, this method should\nbe applicable to a broad array of biological samples and curved materials. The\nobservation of protonic conductivity in cable bacteria presents possibilities\nfor investigating the importance of long-distance proton transport in microbial\necosystems and to potentially build biotic or biomimetic scaffolds to interface\nwith materials via proton-mediated gateways or channels.",
