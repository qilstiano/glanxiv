However, there is limited conceptual consensus on what\nexactly quantifies natural language prompts. We attempt to address this\nquestion by conducting a meta-analysis surveying more than 150\nprompting-related papers from leading NLP and AI conferences from 2022 to 2025\nand blogs. We propose a property- and human-centric framework for evaluating\nprompt quality, encompassing 21 properties categorized into six dimensions. We\nthen examine how existing studies assess their impact on LLMs, revealing their\nimbalanced support across models and tasks, and substantial research gaps.\nFurther, we analyze correlations among properties in high-quality natural\nlanguage prompts, deriving prompting recommendations. We then empirically\nexplore multi-property prompt enhancements in reasoning tasks, observing that\nsingle-property enhancements often have the greatest impact. Finally, we\ndiscover that instruction-tuning on property-enhanced prompts can result in\nbetter reasoning models. Our findings establish a foundation for\nproperty-centric prompt evaluation and optimization, bridging the gaps between\nhuman--AI communication and opening new prompting research directions.",

    "abstract": "Traditional decision-based black-box adversarial attacks on image classifiers\naim to generate adversarial examples by slightly modifying input images while\nkeeping the number of queries low, where each query involves sending an input\nto the model and observing its output. Most existing methods assume that all\nqueries have equal cost. However, in practice, queries may incur asymmetric\ncosts; for example, in content moderation systems, certain output classes may\ntrigger additional review, enforcement, or penalties, making them more costly\nthan others. While prior work has considered such asymmetric cost settings,\neffective algorithms for this scenario remain underdeveloped. In this paper, we\npropose a general framework for decision-based attacks under asymmetric query\ncosts, which we refer to as asymmetric black-box attacks. We modify two core\ncomponents of existing attacks: the search strategy and the gradient estimation\nprocess. Specifically, we propose Asymmetric Search (AS), a more conservative\nvariant of binary search that reduces reliance on high-cost queries, and\nAsymmetric Gradient Estimation (AGREST), which shifts the sampling distribution\nto favor low-cost queries. We design efficient algorithms that minimize total\nattack cost by balancing different query types, in contrast to earlier methods\nsuch as stealthy attacks that focus only on limiting expensive (high-cost)\nqueries. Our method can be integrated into a range of existing black-box\nattacks with minimal changes. We perform both theoretical analysis and\nempirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks. Across\nvarious cost regimes, our method consistently achieves lower total query cost\nand smaller perturbations than existing approaches, with improvements of up to\n40% in some settings.",

However, in practice, the decay rate\nis often unavailable, making it non-trivial to use model-free CBFs, as it\nrequires manual tuning for alpha. To address this, a Neural Network is used to\nlearn the Lyapunov function from data, and the maximum decay rate of the\nsystems built-in velocity controller is subsequently estimated. Furthermore, to\nintegrate the estimated decay rate with model-free CBFs, we derive a\nprobabilistic safety condition that incorporates a confidence bound on the\nviolation rate of the exponential stability condition, using Chernoff bound.\nThis enhances robustness against uncertainties in stability violations.

In this paper, we present findings\nindicating that Video LLMs are more capable of temporal reasoning after\nimage-only training than one would assume, and that improvements from\nvideo-specific training are surprisingly small. Specifically, we show that\nimage-trained versions of two LLMs trained with the recent LongVU algorithm\nperform significantly above chance level on TVBench, a temporal reasoning\nbenchmark. Additionally, we introduce a simple finetuning scheme involving\nsequences of annotated images and questions targeting temporal capabilities.\nThis baseline results in temporal reasoning performance close to, and\noccasionally higher than, what is achieved by video-trained LLMs. This suggests\nsuboptimal utilization of rich temporal features found in real video by current\nmodels.

    "abstract": "A simplified method to calculate the critical mass of a fissile material\nsphere is presented. This is a purely pedagogical study, in part to elucidate\nthe historical evolution of criticality calculations. This method employs only\nelementary calculus and straightforward statistical arguments by formulating\nthe problem in terms of the threshold condition that the number of neutrons in\nthe sphere does not change with time; the average neutron path length in the\nmaterial must be long enough to produce enough fission neutrons to balance\nlosses by absorption due to nuclear reactions and leakage through the surface.\nThis separates the nuclear reaction part of the problem from the geometry and\nmechanics of neutron transport, the only connection being the total path length\nwhich together with the distance between scatterings determines the sphere\nradius. This leads to an expression for the critical radius without the need to\nsolve the diffusion equation. Comparison with known critical masses shows\nagreement at the few-percent level. The analysis can also be applied to impure\nmaterials, isotopically or otherwise, and can be extended to general neutronics\nestimations as a design guide or for order-of-magnitude checking of Monte Carlo\nN-Particle (MCNP) simulations. A comparison is made with the Oppenheimer-Bethe\ncriticality formula, with the results of other calculations, and with the\ndiffusion equation approach via a new treatment of the boundary conditions.",

One of the\napproaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs\nself-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However,\nexisting self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone\npost-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to\nelicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous\nself-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a\nspontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved\nsolutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation\ndynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively\nscaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by\nassigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We\nadopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for\nfine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification\nand multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and\nverification accuracy through online reinforcement learning.

Since this background has an\nastronomically large correlation time, of the order of the Hubble time\n$H_0^{-1}$, we show that it leads to a non-Markovian dynamics of the EM field,\nwhich causes memory effects. As a result of the Gaussianity of PGW, it turns\nout that the EM phasor goes through a stochastic process, which is a\nmanifestation of the fluctuation-dissipation in EM-GW system. The variance of\nthe EM phase smears out as $\\Delta^2\\varphi(t)= \\Delta^2\\varphi_0+\n4(t/\\tau_c)^4$, where the characteristic time scale $\\tau_c$ is associated with\nthe diffusion rate caused by PGWs.

Tensor autoregression\nnaturally arises as a special case within this framework.

This study introduces a\nnovel approach that leverages ImageBind, a multimodal embedding deep learning\nmodel, to integrate PSM data with dual-channel EOG signals for sleep stage\nclassification. Our method is the first reported approach that fuses PSM and\nEOG data for sleep stage classification with ImageBind.

Notably, the model also achieved strong performance without fine-tuning,\nhighlighting its adaptability to specific tasks with limited labeled data,\nmaking it particularly advantageous for medical applications. We evaluated our\nmethod using 85 nights of patient recordings from a sleep clinic.

    "abstract": "In this short note we prove an optimal version of a classical result. Given a\nmajorant determining a growth restriction on functions in the unit disk\n$\\mathbb{D}$, we say that a set $E$ on the unit circle $\\mathbb{T}$ is a\nuniqueness set, or has the Khinchin-Ostrowski property, with respect to the\nmajorant, if any sequence of analytic polynomials satisfying the growth\nrestriction which converges in an appropriate sense to $0$ on $E$, in fact is\nforced to converge to $0$ in $\\mathbb{D}$ also. Theorems proved by Kegejan and\nKhrushchev state that if $E$ has positive Lebesgue measure and satisfies a\ngeneralized Beurling-Carleson condition, then for an appropriate majorant the\nKhinchin-Ostrowski property is satisfied. A technical point in Khrushchev's\nproof is the estimation of the harmonic measure in a Privalov-type domain which\nrequires logarithmic integrability of the majorant. This forbids the\napplication of his result to certain types of generalized Beurling-Carleson\nconditions. Here, we dispose of the integrability assumption on the majorant.\nTo do so, we use a Joukowski-Privalov domain which is obtained by removing from\nthe unit disk the areas enclosed by hyperbolic geodesics between the endpoints\nof intervals complementary to $E$. For this type of domain the method of\nKhrushchev applies, but the harmonic measure may be estimated more accurately\nby simple explicit formulas for conformal mappings. As a consequence, we find\nthe critical majorant at which Beurling-Carleson type conditions stop\ndetermining the Khinchin-Ostrowski property of a set, and above which the\ncontainment of intervals is the only relevant characteristic. We discuss also\nweighted versions of the Khinchin-Ostrowski property, and apply our result to\nestablish the remarkable precision of a one-sided spectral decay condition\nwhich detects the local logarithmic integrability of a function.",

The experts engage in multiple rounds of\ndiscussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate\nthe utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications,\nand also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a\ncausal chain of events in the explanation.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial\nattacks-such as point dropping, shifting, and adding-poses a critical challenge\nto the reliability of 3D vision systems. These attacks can compromise the\nsemantic and structural integrity of point clouds, rendering many existing\ndefense mechanisms ineffective. To address this issue, a defense strategy named\nKNN-Defense is proposed, grounded in the manifold assumption and\nnearest-neighbor search in feature space. Instead of reconstructing surface\ngeometry or enforcing uniform point distributions, the method restores\nperturbed inputs by leveraging the semantic similarity of neighboring samples\nfrom the training set. KNN-Defense is lightweight and computationally\nefficient, enabling fast inference and making it suitable for real-time and\npractical applications. Empirical results on the ModelNet40 dataset\ndemonstrated that KNN-Defense significantly improves robustness across various\nattack types. In particular, under point-dropping attacks-where many existing\nmethods underperform due to the targeted removal of critical points-the\nproposed method achieves accuracy gains of 20.1%, 3.6%, 3.44%, and 7.74% on\nPointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and PCT, respectively.

    "abstract": "Understanding how the brain learns may be informed by studying biologically\nplausible learning rules. These rules, often approximating gradient descent\nlearning to respect biological constraints such as locality, must meet two\ncritical criteria to be considered an appropriate brain model: (1) good\nneuroscience task performance and (2) alignment with neural recordings. While\nextensive research has assessed the first criterion, the second remains\nunderexamined. Employing methods such as Procrustes analysis on well-known\nneuroscience datasets, this study demonstrates the existence of a biologically\nplausible learning rule -- namely e-prop, which is based on gradient truncation\nand has demonstrated versatility across a wide range of tasks -- that can\nachieve neural data similarity comparable to Backpropagation Through Time\n(BPTT) when matched for task accuracy. Our findings also reveal that model\narchitecture and initial conditions can play a more significant role in\ndetermining neural similarity than the specific learning rule. Furthermore, we\nobserve that BPTT-trained models and their biologically plausible counterparts\nexhibit similar dynamical properties at comparable accuracies. These results\nunderscore the substantial progress made in developing biologically plausible\nlearning rules, highlighting their potential to achieve both competitive task\nperformance and neural data similarity.",

Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD) and leveraging merged\nadministrative data, we do not find an overall effect of the HDG on the target\npopulation. Nevertheless, we present evidence that individuals who were\neligible for the programme and lived in rural areas (where previous works have\nfound the largest effects in terms of on short-term impact) during their\nchildhood, approximately 12 years before the pandemic, exhibited greater\neconomic resilience to the pandemic. In particular, eligibility increased the\nlikelihood of remaining employed in the formal sector during some of the most\nchallenging phases of the COVID-19 crisis.

In this work, we investigate the\npotential use of the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) power spectrum in\ncontrolling systematics, leveraging its capability of disentangling angular and\nradial scales. We first clarify how the discrete SFB basis describes radial\nscales via the index $n$ and demonstrate that the SFB power spectrum reduces to\nthe clustering wedge $P(k,\\mu)$ in the plane-parallel limit, enabling it to\ninherit results from past literature based on the clustering wedge. While the\nparallel and perpendicular Fourier mode $(k_{||}, k_\\perp)$ decomposition\nunderlying the wedge is only valid for surveys of small angular coverage with a\nwell-defined global line-of-sight, the SFB basis provides a natural\ngeneralization that can be applied to the full sky. Crucially, the separation\nof angular and radial scales allows systematics to be localized in SFB space.\nIn particular, systematics with broad and smooth radial distributions primarily\nconcentrate in the $n=0$ modes corresponding to the largest radial scales. This\nlocalization behavior enables one to selectively remove only particular angular\nand radial modes contaminated by systematics. This is in contrast to standard\n3D clustering analyses of wide-field surveys based on power spectrum\nmultipoles, where systematic effects necessitate the removal of all modes below\na given $k_{\\rm min}$. Our findings advocate for adopting the SFB basis in 3D\nclustering analyses where systematics have become a limiting factor.",

While often appreciated for quantum communication between distant\nlocations, teleportation can also operate between different frequencies. In\nterms of bosonic modes, quantum teleportation relies on two-mode squeezing --\nsqueezed on the balanced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) quadratures -- for\nentanglement and a balanced beamsplitter plus homodyne detection for Bell\nmeasurement. Since cross-frequency band entanglement is challenging to\ngenerate, we propose to enable transduction with teleportation, while only\nrelying on a conventional transduction device and narrow-band entanglement. Our\ninsight is that a transduction device performs a cross-frequency-band\nbeamsplitter, almost what is needed in a Bell measurement, except that it is\noften not balanced. We resolve the issue by proposing a generalized\nteleportation protocol with arbitrarily unbalanced EPR quadratures and matched\nunbalanced beamsplitters. The protocol can enhance quantum transduction, using\nonly off-the-shelf components -- intraband beamsplitters, offline squeezing,\nhomodyne detection and displacements. The proposed protocol achieves perfect\ntransduction when applying to a transduction device with an arbitrarily low\nefficiency, at infinite squeezing.

    "abstract": "The sparse polynomial approximation of continuous functions has emerged as a\nprominent area of interest in function approximation theory in recent years. A\nkey challenge within this domain is the accurate estimation of approximation\nerrors. This paper focuses on continuous functions, characterizing their\nsampled values as a combination of the values of their best approximation\npolynomials within a finite-dimensional polynomial space and the associated\nremainder terms. Consequently, the sampled values of a function can be\ninterpreted as noisy samples of the values of its best approximation\npolynomial, with the noise equivalent to the remainder term's values at those\npoints. By selecting a uniformly bounded orthonormal polynomial system as the\nbasis for this finite-dimensional space, it becomes feasible to formulate noise\nconstraint inequalities and l1-minimization problems or their weighted\nl1-minimization variants. This paper provides estimations for the approximation\nerror of the sparse polynomial derived from the l1-minimization method,\ncharacterizing the error in terms of the quasi-norm of the sampled function or\nits best uniform approximation polynomial, the sparsity, and the best\napproximation error. The analysis reveals that if the sampled function is a\nsparse polynomial from a finite-dimensional space, it can be reconstructed\nexactly. Moreover, it is observed that the smoother the sampled function, the\nfewer degrees of the sparse polynomial are required to attain a given\napproximation accuracy. The paper also extends this analysis to estimate the\nL2-norm approximation error for the sparse polynomial obtained via the weighted\nl1-minimization method, noting that in this context, the orthonormal polynomial\nsystem does not need to be uniformly bounded for the conclusions to hold.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even\naddictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals\nmay become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic\nbehavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this\nas a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and\nwarrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed\nand validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred\nto as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with\nitems developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in\nthe UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate\nhalves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a\ntwo-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship\nDependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which\nindividuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and\ncognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs\nas socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor\nstructure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant\nvalidity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the\ndistinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and\nstructure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view\nthat dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still\nreflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.",

However, because of observational and analytical\nchallenges, quite a gap exists in measuring dust properties in the envelopes\nthat feed newborn protostars and their disks. To fill this gap, we use\nsensitive dust continuum emission data at 1.2 and 3.1 mm from the ALMA FAUST\nLarge Program and constrain the dust opacity millimetre spectral index around a\nsample of protostars. Our high-resolution data, along with a more refined\nmethodology with respect to past efforts, allow us to disentangle disk and\nenvelope contributions in the uv-plane, and thus measure spectral indices for\nthe envelopes uncontaminated by the optically thick emission of the inner\nregions. First, we find that the young disks are small and optically thick.\nSecondly, we measure the dust opacity spectral index at envelope scales for\nn=11 sources: the beta of n=9 sources had never been constrained in the\nliterature. We effectively double the number of sources for which the dust\nopacity spectral index beta has been measured at these scales. Third, combining\nthe available literature measurements with our own (total n=18), we show how\nenvelope spectral indices distribute between ISM-like and disk-like values,\nbridging the gap in the inferred dust evolution. Finally, we statistically\nconfirm a significant correlation between beta and the mass of protostellar\nenvelopes, previously suggested in the literature.

However, previous approaches remain disconnected from environment\nmapping, lack the spatial precision of geometric maps, or neglect additional\nmodality information beyond vision. To address this, we propose multimodal\nspatial language maps as a spatial map representation that fuses pretrained\nmultimodal features with a 3D reconstruction of the environment. We build these\nmaps autonomously using standard exploration. We present two instances of our\nmaps, which are visual-language maps (VLMaps) and their extension to\naudio-visual-language maps (AVLMaps) obtained by adding audio information. When\ncombined with large language models (LLMs), VLMaps can (i) translate natural\nlanguage commands into open-vocabulary spatial goals (e.g., \"in between the\nsofa and TV\") directly localized in the map, and (ii) be shared across\ndifferent robot embodiments to generate tailored obstacle maps on demand.\nBuilding upon the capabilities above, AVLMaps extend VLMaps by introducing a\nunified 3D spatial representation integrating audio, visual, and language cues\nthrough the fusion of features from pretrained multimodal foundation models.\nThis enables robots to ground multimodal goal queries (e.g., text, images, or\naudio snippets) to spatial locations for navigation. Additionally, the\nincorporation of diverse sensory inputs significantly enhances goal\ndisambiguation in ambiguous environments. Experiments in simulation and\nreal-world settings demonstrate that our multimodal spatial language maps\nenable zero-shot spatial and multimodal goal navigation and improve recall by\n50% in ambiguous scenarios.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, advancements in semiconductor devices have been driven by\nlattice-matched heterojunctions with tailored band alignments through\nheteroepitaxy techniques. However, there is significant interest in expanding\nthe capabilities of heterojunction devices, in particular utilizing extreme\nlattice mismatches. We demonstrate the manipulation of device behaviors and\nperformance enhancement achievable through a lattice-mismatched,\nsingle-crystalline GaAs/GeSn-multi-quantum well (MQW)/Ge n-i-p heterojunction\nby employing advanced semiconductor grafting technology. With engineered band\nalignment and optical field distribution, the grafted GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge n-i-p\nphotodiode achieved outstanding performance: a record-low dark current density\nof 1.22E10^-7 A/cm^2, an extended spectral response from ~0.5 to 2 um, and\nimproved photoresponsivity of RVIS of 0.85 A/W and RNIR of 0.40 A/W at 520 and\n1570 nm, respectively. The dark current density is at least 5 orders of\nmagnitude lower than state-of-the-art GeSn photodiodes. The photoresponsivity\ndemonstrates an approximately sevenfold enhancement in the VIS range and a\nthreefold improvement in the NIR range compared to the reference epitaxial\nphotodiode. This work presents a unique strategy for constructing\nlattice-mismatched semiconductor heterojunction devices. More importantly, the\nimplications transcend the current GaAs/GeSn-MQW/Ge example, offering potential\napplications in other material systems and freeing device design from the\nstringent lattice-matching constraints of conventional heteroepitaxy.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D GS stylization\nsolution termed Multi-StyleGS to tackle these challenges. In particular, we\nemploy a bipartite matching mechanism to au tomatically identify\ncorrespondences between the style images and the local regions of the rendered\nimages. To facilitate local style transfer, we introduce a novel semantic style\nloss function that employs a segmentation network to apply distinct styles to\nvarious objects of the scene and propose a local-global feature matching to\nenhance the multi-view consistency. Furthermore, this technique can achieve\nmemory efficient training, more texture details and better color match. To\nbetter assign a robust semantic label to each Gaussian, we propose several\ntechniques to regularize the segmentation network.

However, once updated, PEFT modules fine-tuned on previous\nversions often suffer substantial performance degradation on newer versions.\nRe-tuning these numerous modules to restore performance would incur significant\ncomputational costs. Through a comprehensive analysis of the changes that occur\nduring base model updates, we uncover an interesting phenomenon: continual\ntraining primarily affects task-specific knowledge stored in Feed-Forward\nNetworks (FFN), while having less impact on the task-specific pattern in the\nAttention mechanism. Based on these findings, we introduce Trans-PEFT, a novel\napproach that enhances the PEFT module by focusing on the task-specific pattern\nwhile reducing its dependence on certain knowledge in the base model.

By\nconsidering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know\nsuch a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to\nformulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms\nof summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality\nsearch, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be\nformulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent)\nGames. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve\ncross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as\nsimple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large\nenough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible\nfrom basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game\nspace can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the\nconstruction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be\nused as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a\ncovering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the\nchallenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of\nXent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary\ndynamics.",

However, the complexity of surgical scenes,\ncharacterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and\nconfused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges\nfor surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often\nstruggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in\neach downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task\nlearning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance\noverall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel\nmulti-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery\nactivity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2\nfoundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate\nefficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank\nAdapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we\nintroduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature\nrepresentation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global\ninformation. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we\npresent three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored\nfor endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity\nrecognition and semantic segmentation tasks.

    "abstract": "A novel fine spectral structure in solar radio bursts has been discovered\nusing the Chashan broadband solar radio spectrometer at meter wavelengths\n(CBSm), an instrument of the Chinese Meridian Project-Phase II (CMP-II). The\nstructure features periodic narrow-band stripes with a typical recurrence time\n$< 1 $ s (occasionally reaches 8 s), often drifting from high to low\nfrequencies and accompanied by absorptions, with trailing stripes appearing at\nthe end of preceding ones. Some stripes exhibit periodic beaded enhancements\nwith a periodicity of $\\sim$0.1 s. The beaded stripes are reported for the\nfirst time ever. Data from the DAocheng Radio Telescope (DART) indicate a radio\nemission brightness temperature exceeding $10^{9}$ K, originating above\nbrightening loops in active region AR 13664. We proposed a novel generation\nmechanism of the periodic stripes on the basis of the double plasma resonance\n(DPR) instability, and explained the beaded substructure in terms of modulation\nby low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. The study highlights the\nCBSm's capability to detect high-resolution fine spectral structures and offers\nnovel insights into the emission mechanism and source characteristics of solar\nradio bursts.",

In contrast, task-generic promptable segmentation aims\nto reduce the need for such detailed prompts by employing only a task-generic\nprompt to guide segmentation across all test samples. However, when applied to\nCamouflaged Object Segmentation (COS), current methods still face two critical\nissues: 1) \\textit{\\textbf{semantic ambiguity in getting instance-specific text\nprompts}}, which arises from insufficient discriminative cues in holistic\ncaptions, leading to foreground-background confusion; 2)\n\\textit{\\textbf{semantic discrepancy combined with spatial separation in\ngetting instance-specific visual prompts}}, which results from global\nbackground sampling far from object boundaries with low feature correlation,\ncausing SAM to segment irrelevant regions. To address the issues above, we\npropose \\textbf{RDVP-MSD}, a novel training-free test-time adaptation framework\nthat synergizes \\textbf{R}egion-constrained \\textbf{D}ual-stream\n\\textbf{V}isual \\textbf{P}rompting (RDVP) via \\textbf{M}ultimodal\n\\textbf{S}tepwise \\textbf{D}ecomposition Chain of Thought (MSD-CoT).

However,\nexisting obstacle avoidance algorithms, such as Artificial Potential Field\n(APF) are unable to generalize across environments with different obstacle\nconfigurations. Furthermore, the precise location of the final target may not\nbe available in applications such as search and rescue, in which case\napproaches such as RF source seeking can be used to align towards the target\nlocation. This paper proposes a real-time trajectory planning method, which\ninvolves real-time adaptation of APF through a sampling-based approach. The\nproposed approach utilizes only the bearing angle of the target without its\nprecise location, and adjusts the potential field parameters according to the\nenvironment with new obstacle configurations in real time. The main\ncontributions of the article are i) an RF source seeking algorithm to provide a\nbearing angle estimate using RF signal calculations based on antenna placement,\nand ii) a modified APF for adaptable collision avoidance in changing\nenvironments, which are evaluated separately in the simulation software Gazebo,\nusing ROS2 for communication. Simulation results show that the RF\nsource-seeking algorithm achieves high accuracy, with an average angular error\nof just 1.48 degrees, and with this estimate, the proposed navigation algorithm\nimproves the success rate of reaching the target by 46% and reduces the\ntrajectory length by 1.2% compared to standard potential fields.",

    "abstract": "Indoor scene understanding remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, with\ndirect implications for downstream tasks such as navigation and manipulation.\nTraditional approaches often rely on closed-set recognition or loop closure,\nlimiting their adaptability in open-world environments. With the advent of\nvisual foundation models (VFMs), open-vocabulary recognition and natural\nlanguage querying have become feasible, unlocking new possibilities for 3D\nscene graph construction.\n  In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient framework for instance-level\n3D scene graph construction via LiDAR-camera fusion. Leveraging LiDAR's wide\nfield of view (FOV) and long-range sensing capabilities, we rapidly acquire\nroom-level geometric priors. Multi-level VFMs are employed to improve the\naccuracy and consistency of semantic extraction. During instance fusion,\nroom-based segmentation enables parallel processing, while the integration of\ngeometric and semantic cues significantly enhances fusion accuracy and\nrobustness. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves up to\nan order-of-magnitude improvement in construction speed while maintaining high\nsemantic precision.\n  Extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments validate\nthe effectiveness of our approach. We further demonstrate its practical value\nthrough a language-guided semantic navigation task, highlighting its potential\nfor real-world robotic applications.",

Despite coordinated\nefforts of many organizations' emergency assistance, shelter shortages left\nmany evacuees without safety or accessible refuge. This research aims to\nmeasure shelter accessibility during the fires' peak, evaluate whether existing\nshelter capacity met the demand, and identify spatial disparities in access.\nResults reveal severe shelter shortages and pronounced inequities in access to\nshelters, particularly in geographically isolated regions and mountainous\nareas. Our simulations of shelter placement strategies using a capacity-based\nalgorithm and a proximity-based approach demonstrate potential improvements in\nboth shelter accessibility and equitable access to shelters.

    "abstract": "An extended polymer collapses to form a globule when subjected to a quench\nbelow the collapse transition temperature. The process begins with the\nformation of clusters of monomers or ``pearls''. The nascent clusters merge,\nresulting in growth of the average cluster size $C_s$, eventually leading to a\nsingle globule. The aggregation of the clusters are known to be analogous to\ndroplet coalescence. This suggests a striking resemblance between such an\naggregation and cluster-cluster aggregation in colloidal self-assembly, which\nis characterized by a universal dynamic scaling behavior. Motivated by that,\nhere, we verify the presence of such dynamic scaling during the collapse of a\npolymer with varying bending stiffness $\\kappa$, using molecular dynamic\nsimulations. We probe the dynamics via time evolution of the size distribution\nof clusters $N_s(t)$ and growth of $C_s(t)$. Irrespective of $\\kappa$, we\nobserve the power-law scalings $C_s(t)\\sim t^z$ and $N_s(t)\\sim t^{-w}\ns^{-\\tau}$, of which only the cluster growth is universal with $z\\approx 1.65$.\nImportantly, our results indeed show that $N_s(t)$ exhibits a dynamic scaling\nof the form $N_s(t)\\sim s^{-2}f(s/t^z)$, indicative of a scale-free cluster\ngrowth. Interestingly, for flexible and weakly stiff polymers the dynamic\nexponents obey the relation $w=2z$, as also found in diffusion-controlled\ncluster-cluster aggregation of particles. For $\\kappa \\ge 5$, the exponents\nshow deviation from this relation, which grows continuously with $\\kappa$. We\nidentify the differences in local structures of the clusters formed, leading to\nvariations in cluster-size dependence of the effective diffusion constant to be\nthe origin of the above deviation.

In this paper, we first evaluate four commonly adopted LLMs\nby tasking them to alternately act as persuaders and listeners in adversarial\ndialogues. Empirical results show that persuader LLMs predominantly employ\nrepetitive strategies, leading to low success rates. Then we introduce eleven\ncomprehensive psychological persuasion strategies, finding that explicitly\ninstructing LLMs to adopt specific strategies such as Fluency Effect and\nRepetition Effect significantly improves persuasion success rates.

    "abstract": "Driven by advances in electronic technology, modern digital phasemeters have\nsignificantly improved in integration and functionality, enabling real-time\nmeasurement and analysis of dynamic signals. High-precision phase measurement\nis closely associated with the quantization process. This paper specifically\nanalyzes the white and non-white noise characteristics associated with the\nquantization errors of phase truncation in digital phasemeters. The error can\nbe considered white noise under specific conditions, which power correlates\nwith the resolution of quantizer and is uniformly distributed within the\nNyquist frequency. However, when the signal frequency and sampling frequency\nare close to an integer multiple, the non-white noise caused by truncation can\nresult in low-frequency phase noise. Additionally, artifacts may induce\nnonlinear phase errors. Introducing Gaussian dither synthesized by LFSRs can\nsmooth the truncation process, thereby mitigating its impacts on phase\nmeasurement. The results indicate that for a 10 MHz signal under test, the\nnoise floor of the phasemeter exceeds the requirement from 2 mHz to 0.1 Hz due\nto the integer multiple. After adding dither, the phase noise was optimized by\n9.5 dB at 10 mHz, achieving the requirement of 1.3 $\\rm{\\upmu rad/Hz^{1/2}}\n\\cdot \\rm{NSF}$ from 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz in space gravitational wave detection.\nThis demonstrates that adding dither can effectively suppress the low-frequency\nphase noise caused by truncation.",

    "abstract": "As integrated circuit scale grows and design complexity rises, effective\ncircuit representation helps support logic synthesis, formal verification, and\nother automated processes in electronic design automation. And-Inverter Graphs\n(AIGs), as a compact and canonical structure, are widely adopted for\nrepresenting Boolean logic in these workflows. However, the increasing\ncomplexity and integration density of modern circuits introduce structural\nheterogeneity and global logic information loss in AIGs, posing significant\nchallenges to accurate circuit modeling. To address these issues, we propose\nFuncGNN, which integrates hybrid feature aggregation to extract\nmulti-granularity topological patterns, thereby mitigating structural\nheterogeneity and enhancing logic circuit representations. FuncGNN further\nintroduces gate-aware normalization that adapts to circuit-specific gate\ndistributions, improving robustness to structural heterogeneity. Finally,\nFuncGNN employs multi-layer integration to merge intermediate features across\nlayers, effectively synthesizing local and global semantic information for\ncomprehensive logic representations. Experimental results on two logic-level\nanalysis tasks (i.e., signal probability prediction and truth-table distance\nprediction) demonstrate that FuncGNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, achieving improvements of 2.06% and 18.71%, respectively, while\nreducing training time by approximately 50.6% and GPU memory usage by about\n32.8%.",

Beginning with\nasymptotically flat spacetimes and the geometry of null geodesic congruences,\nthe derivation of the shear tensor--encoding gravitational radiation--is\nrevisited. The covariant phase space formulation of General Relativity is then\nemployed to derive a non-conservation law associated with the symmetry group at\nnull infinity, generalizing prior constructions of radiative phase space and\nyielding consistent results. These flux laws are used to derive constraint\nequations that enable the evaluation and comparison of state-of-the-art\nnumerical waveform models, leading to new insights and a robust algorithm for\nbenchmarking future improvements. These flux laws are further applied to\ncompute quantum corrections to gravitational waveforms arising from the\ngravitational wave echo effect. Two leading phenomenological scenarios\ninvolving echoes from binary black hole mergers are analyzed. The structure of\nboth the primary echo signal and its induced corrections to nonlinear features\nof the waveform are studied for observability by the upcoming LISA mission. The\nresults indicate that LISA could detect such signals, potentially probing black\nhole area quantization. Finally, motivated by recent hints of a stochastic\ngravitational wave background from Pulsar Timing Array data, this work reviews\nits theoretical basis and studies several astrophysical and cosmological source\nscenarios. A forecast for detection prospects with LISA is presented using a\nmodern data analysis pipeline.

Existing\ntest-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test\ndistributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across\ndifferent domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means\nand variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global\nnormalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data\ncharacteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance\nNeighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise\nFeature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and\nSelective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar\ndistributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN\noptimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific\nstatistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which\nlayers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby\nenhancing inference efficiency.

We evaluate five leading\nself-supervised models (Whisper-small/medium, XLS-R, AST, mHuBERT), finding\nnotable performance differences by language, with Whisper-small performing best\noverall. Cross-dataset generalization remains a challenge. By releasing SynHate\nand baseline code, we aim to advance robust, culturally sensitive, and\nmultilingual solutions against synthetic hate speech. The dataset is available\nat https://www.iab-rubric.org/resources.",

A set of objective functions were defined to perform the\nmaximisation of morphological properties (e.g., volume fraction, specific\nsurface area) and transport properties (relative diffusivity). We demonstrate\nthe ability to perform simultaneous maximisation of correlated properties\n(specific surface area and relative diffusivity), as well as constrained\noptimisation of these properties.

Two detections of NGC 5189 have been made during the survey, of better\nresolution than previous radio surveys. Both measurements of the integrated\nflux density are consistent with each other, at $S_{\\rm 943\\,MHz} =\n0.33\\pm0.03$ Jy, and the spectral luminosity is $L_{\\rm{943\\,MHz}}$ = 8.89\n$\\times$ 10$^{13}$ W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$.

We measure an apparent size of 3.4${'}$ $\\times$ 2.2${'}$ corresponding to\nphysical diameters of 1.48 pc $\\times$ 0.96 pc, and combine available radio\nobservations of NGC 5189 to estimate a spectral index of $\\alpha$ = 0.12 $\\pm$\n0.05.

Additional measurements of the optical depth\n($\\tau = 0.00246$) and electron density ($N_{e} = 138~cm^{-3}$) support our\nfindings that NGC 5189 is optically thin at 943 MHz. Furthermore, the radio\ncontours from the ASKAP-EMU image have been overlaid onto a Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 image, demonstrating that the radio\nmorphology closely traces the optical.

    "abstract": "Image Representation learning via input reconstruction is a common technique\nin machine learning for generating representations that can be effectively\nutilized by arbitrary downstream tasks. A well-established approach is using\nautoencoders to extract latent representations at the network's compression\npoint. These representations are valuable because they retain essential\ninformation necessary for reconstructing the original input from the compressed\nlatent space. In this paper, we propose an alternative learning objective.\nInstead of using the raw input as the reconstruction target, we employ the\nDiscrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of the input. The DFT provides meaningful\nglobal information at each frequency level, making individual frequency\ncomponents useful as separate learning targets. When dealing with\nmultidimensional input data, the DFT offers remarkable flexibility by enabling\nselective transformation across specific dimensions while preserving others in\nthe computation. Moreover, certain types of input exhibit distinct patterns in\ntheir frequency distributions, where specific frequency components consistently\ncontain most of the magnitude, allowing us to focus on a subset of frequencies\nrather than the entire spectrum. These characteristics position the DFT as a\nviable learning objective for representation learning and we validate our\napproach by achieving 52.8% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 and\noutperforming the traditional autoencoder by 12.8 points under identical\narchitectural configurations. Additionally, we demonstrate that training on\nonly the lower-frequency components - those with the highest magnitudes yields\nresults comparable to using the full frequency spectrum, with only minimal\nreductions in accuracy.",

    "abstract": "To translate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image into interpretable forms\nfor human understanding is the ultimate goal of SAR advanced information\nretrieval. Existing methods mainly focus on 3D surface reconstruction or local\ngeometric feature extraction of targets, neglecting the role of structural\nmodeling in capturing semantic information. This paper proposes a novel task:\nSAR target structure recovery, which aims to infer the components of a target\nand the structural relationships between its components, specifically symmetry\nand adjacency, from a single-view SAR image. Through learning the structural\nconsistency and geometric diversity across the same type of targets as observed\nin different SAR images, it aims to derive the semantic representation of\ntarget directly from its 2D SAR image. To solve this challenging task, a\ntwo-step algorithmic framework based on structural descriptors is developed.\nSpecifically, in the training phase, it first detects 2D keypoints from real\nSAR images, and then learns the mapping from these keypoints to 3D hierarchical\nstructures using simulated data. During the testing phase, these two steps are\nintegrated to infer the 3D structure from real SAR images. Experimental results\nvalidated the effectiveness of each step and demonstrated, for the first time,\nthat 3D semantic structural representation of aircraft targets can be directly\nderived from a single-view SAR image.",

To test homogeneity,\nwe compare transition kernels estimated for different time periods and, for\nthose periods exhibiting evidence of homogeneity, we test the first-order\nassumption using an implication of such a process's Chapman-Kolmogorov\nequations. Both tests require measurement of the distance between probability\ndistributions which we do with several different metrics, employing bootstrap\nmethods to assess the statistical significance of the observed distances. We\nfind that the process was time-homogeneous and first-order in the 1970-1995\nperiod during which the distribution dynamics imply a bimodal long-run\ndistribution, consistent with convergence clubs. Following the apparent break\nin the process in the late 1990s, the 2000-2010 distribution dynamics imply a\nunimodal long-run distribution suggestive of a single convergence club,\nconsistent with recent claims of short-term beta-convergence from the late\n1990s and beyond made by Patel et al.

In this work, we present a unified theoretical\nframework that identifies entropy per carrier, not specific heat, as the\nuniversal driver of thermopower across both closed and open systems. Using\nthermodynamic identities and the Onsager-Kelvin relation, we show that\nthermopower is universally proportional to entropy per carrier, while its\napparent proportionality to specific heat arises only in systems where the\nspecific heat follows a continuous power-law temperature dependence. To extend\nthis framework to magnetic systems, we derive a general expression for\nmagnon-drag thermopower that holds in both Newtonian (massive, parabolic) and\nrelativistic (massless, linear) magnon regimes. In particular, we reformulate\nthe momentum balance using a relativistic energy-momentum tensor, resolving\nconceptual inconsistencies in prior models that relied on ill-defined magnon\nmasses in antiferromagnets. Our framework is further illustrated through three\nrepresentative systems: (i) magnetic materials, where magnon and paramagnon\nentropy sustain thermopower across TC and TN; (ii) superconducting Nb, where\nanomalous thermopower emerges from entropy carried by Bogoliubov quasiparticles\nnear TC; and (iii) a single-molecule junction, where entropy from\noccupation-number fluctuations governs thermopower in an open quantum system.\nWe validate our unifying principle by comparing it with experimental data:\nthermopower measurements of superconducting niobium reveal the role of\nquasiparticle entropy near the critical temperature, and literature-reported\nspecific heat data from a wide range of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\nmaterials demonstrate consistent entropy-based scaling across magnetic\ntransitions.",

    "abstract": "Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for\ncollaborative model training across distributed feature spaces, which enables\nprivacy-preserving learning without sharing raw data. However, recent studies\nhave confirmed the feasibility of label inference attacks by internal\nadversaries. By strategically exploiting gradient vectors and semantic\nembeddings, attackers-through passive, active, or direct attacks-can accurately\nreconstruct private labels, leading to catastrophic data leakage. Existing\ndefenses, which typically address isolated leakage vectors or are designed for\nspecific types of attacks, remain vulnerable to emerging hybrid attacks that\nexploit multiple pathways simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we propose\nLabel-Anonymized Defense with Substitution Gradient (LADSG), a unified and\nlightweight defense framework for VFL. LADSG first anonymizes true labels via\nsoft distillation to reduce semantic exposure, then generates\nsemantically-aligned substitute gradients to disrupt gradient-based leakage,\nand finally filters anomalous updates through gradient norm detection. It is\nscalable and compatible with standard VFL pipelines. Extensive experiments on\nsix real-world datasets show that LADSG reduces the success rates of all three\ntypes of label inference attacks by 30-60% with minimal computational overhead,\ndemonstrating its practical effectiveness.",

A first\npart is devoted to the cases where this confinement is due to the long-range\ngeometry of the defect-free structure. We have thus studied periodic\napproximant structures of quasiperiodic Penrose and octagonal tilings, and\ntwisted bilayers of graphene or transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) whose\nrotation angle between the two layers assumes a special value, called \"magic\nangle\". In these materials, the flat bands correspond to electronic states\ndistributed over a very large number of atoms (several hundreds or even\nthousands of atoms) and are very sensitive to small structural distortions such\nas \"heterostrain\". Their electronic transport properties cannot be described by\nusual Bloch-Boltzmann theories, because the interband terms of the velocity\noperator dominate the intraband terms as far as quantum diffusion is concerned.\nIn twisted bilayer graphene, flat bands can induce a magnetic state and other\nelectron-electron correlation effects. The second part focuses on 2D\nnanomaterials in the presence of local point defects that cause resonant\nelectronic states (vacancies, adsorbed atoms or molecules). We present studies\non monolayer graphene, twisted or Bernal bilayer graphene, carbon nanotubes,\nmonolayer and multilayer black phosphorene, and monolayer TMDs. A recent result\nis the discovery that the selective functionalization of a Bernal bilayer\ngraphene sublattice leads to a metallic or insulating behavior depending on the\nfunctionalized sublattice type.

Because #P $\\not\\subseteq$ gapP, #P is strictly contained\nbetween one and two #2DNF oracle calls.\n  Surprisingly, the propositional formulas needed in both calls are linear-time\ncomputable, and the reduction preserves interesting structural as well as\nsymmetry properties, leading to algorithmic applications. We show that a single\nsubtraction suffices to compensate for the absence of negation while still\ncapturing gapP, i.e., our results carry over to the monotone fragments of #2SAT\nand #2DNF. Since our reduction is linear-time, it preserves sparsity and, as a\nconsequence we obtain a sparsification lemma for both #2SAT and #2DNF.

    "abstract": "Pareto Set Learning (PSL) is popular as an efficient approach to obtaining\nthe complete optimal solution in Multi-objective Learning (MOL). A set of\noptimal solutions approximates the Pareto set, and its mapping is a set of\ndense points in the Pareto front in objective space. However, some current\nmethods face a challenge: how to make the Pareto solution is diverse while\nmaximizing the hypervolume value. In this paper, we propose a novel method to\naddress this challenge, which employs Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)\nto approximate the entire Pareto set. SVGD pushes a set of particles towards\nthe Pareto set by applying a form of functional gradient descent, which helps\nto converge and diversify optimal solutions. Additionally, we employ diverse\ngradient direction strategies to thoroughly investigate a unified framework for\nSVGD in multi-objective optimization and adapt this framework with an annealing\nschedule to promote stability. We introduce our method, SVH-MOL, and validate\nits effectiveness through extensive experiments on multi-objective problems and\nmulti-task learning, demonstrating its superior performance.",

Extending this setup to cosmological inflation, we\nexamine the scalar dual of the 3-form in both large-field and small-field\nregimes.

Finally, a lightweight\nyet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization\nwith two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization\nterm, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning\nthat the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing\nPKT solutions.

Two temperature ranges are considered: a\nsubcritical case, where the fluid remains entirely in the liquid-like regime,\nand a transcritical case, where the pseudo-critical (Widom) line is crossed and\npseudo-boiling occurs. Fully compressible direct numerical simulations are used\nto study (i) the linear and nonlinear instabilities, (ii) the breakdown to\nturbulence, and (iii) the fully developed turbulent boundary layer. In the\ntranscritical regime, two-dimensional forcing generates not only a train of\nbillow-like structures around the Widom line, resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability, but also near-wall travelling regions of flow reversal. These\nspanwise-oriented billows dominate the early nonlinear stage. When high\nsubharmonic three-dimensional forcing is applied, staggered $\\Lambda$-vortices\nemerge more abruptly than in the subcritical case. However, unlike the classic\nH-type breakdown under zero pressure gradient observed in ideal-gas and\nsubcritical regimes, the H-type breakdown is triggered by strong shear layers\ncaused by flow reversals -- similar to that observed in\nadverse-pressure-gradient boundary layers. Without oblique wave forcing,\ntransition is only slightly delayed and follows a naturally selected\nfundamental breakdown (K-type) scenario. Hence, in the transcritical regime, it\nis possible to trigger nonlinearities and achieve transition to turbulence\nrelatively early using only a single two-dimensional wave that strongly\namplifies background noise. In the fully turbulent region, we demonstrate that\nvariable-property scaling accurately predicts turbulent skin-friction and\nheat-transfer coefficients.",

Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely\nSequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein\nfunction predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial\nIntelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently\ninterpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming\nthe difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein\nTransformers.

Besides, our Sequence Score\ntechnique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful\npatterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these\npatterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community.\nWe have officially released our Protein-FN dataset on Hugging Face Datasets\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/Protein-FN/Protein-FN.

In practical\nscenarios, speech enhancement models are often required to perform on noisy\nspeech at run-time that is substantially longer than the training utterances.\nIt remains a challenge how a Transformer-based speech enhancement model can\ngeneralize to long speech utterances. In this paper, extensive empirical\nstudies are conducted to explore the model's length generalization ability. In\nparticular, we conduct speech enhancement experiments on four training\nobjectives and evaluate with five metrics. Our studies establish that\npositional encoding is an effective instrument to dampen the effect of\nutterance length on speech enhancement. We first explore several existing\npositional encoding methods, and the results show that relative positional\nencoding methods exhibit a better length generalization property than absolute\npositional encoding methods. Additionally, we also explore a simpler and more\neffective positional encoding scheme, i.e. LearnLin, that uses only one\ntrainable parameter for each attention head to scale the real relative position\nbetween time frames, which learns the different preferences on short- or\nlong-term dependencies of these heads.

The\nenergy resolution at 6 keV worsens as the count rate in electrically\nneighboring pixels increases, but can be restored by applying a\nnearest-neighbor coincidence cut (``cross-talk cut'').

This task presents two fundamental\nchallenges: it requires a high-precision vision system capable of accurately\npredicting ball trajectories, and it necessitates intelligent strategic\nplanning to ensure precise ball placement to target regions. The dynamic nature\nof table tennis, coupled with its real-time response requirements, makes it\nparticularly well-suited for advancing robotic control capabilities in\nfast-paced, precision-critical domains. In this paper, we present\nSpikePingpong, a novel system that integrates spike-based vision with imitation\nlearning for high-precision robotic table tennis. Our approach introduces two\nkey attempts that directly address the aforementioned challenges: SONIC, a\nspike camera-based module that achieves millimeter-level precision in\nball-racket contact prediction by compensating for real-world uncertainties\nsuch as air resistance and friction; and IMPACT, a strategic planning module\nthat enables accurate ball placement to targeted table regions. The system\nharnesses a 20 kHz spike camera for high-temporal resolution ball tracking,\ncombined with efficient neural network models for real-time trajectory\ncorrection and stroke planning. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSpikePingpong achieves a remarkable 91% success rate for 30 cm accuracy target\narea and 71% in the more challenging 20 cm accuracy task, surpassing previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches by 38% and 37% respectively. These significant\nperformance improvements enable the robust implementation of sophisticated\ntactical gameplay strategies, providing a new research perspective for robotic\ncontrol in high-speed dynamic tasks.",

    "abstract": "With electric power infrastructure posing an increasing risk of igniting\nwildfires under continuing climate change, utilities are frequently\nde-energizing power lines to mitigate wildfire ignition risk, which can cause\nload shedding. Recent research advocates for installing battery energy storage\nsystems as well as undergrounding risky overhead lines to reduce the load\nshedding during such de-energizations. Since wildfire ignition risk can exhibit\nsubstantial geographic and temporal variations, it is important to plan battery\ninstallation and line undergrounding investments while considering multiple\npossible scenarios. This paper presents a scenario-based framework for\noptimizing battery installation and line undergrounding investments while\nconsidering many scenarios, each consisting of a day-long time series of\nuncertain parameters for the load demand, renewable generation, and wildfire\nignition risks. This problem is difficult to solve due to a large number of\nscenarios and binary variables associated with the battery placements as well\nas the lines to be undergrounded. To address the computational challenges, we\ndecompose the problem in a two-stage scheme via a Benders decomposition\napproach. The first stage is a master problem formulated as a mixed integer\nlinear programming (MILP) model that makes decisions on the locations and sizes\nof batteries as well as the lines to be undergrounded. The second stage\nconsists of a linear programming model that assesses these battery and line\nundergrounding decisions as modeled by a DC OPF formulation. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed scheme on a large-scale transmission network with\nreal world data on wildfire ignition risks, load, and renewable generation.",

Hybrid frameworks for homogeneous\ngraphs have been proposed, but face challenges in designing shared encoders to\nmeet the semantic requirements of both tasks. In semantically sparse scenarios,\nCL struggles with view construction, and gradient imbalance between positive\nand negative samples persists.

In small\nnon-quantizing magnetic fields that result in less than a flux quantum\nthreading the system, and small sublattice symmetry breaking potentials, SCO\nexhibits perturbative singular magnetic field dependence, $\\sim |B|$,\noriginating from hopping between neighboring sites of the same sublattice.

However, efficiently\ncomputing CRASs remains an open problem, especially for discrete-time systems.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework for computing CRASs which takes\nadvantage of a probabilistic perspective. This framework transforms the\nfundamentally nonlinear problem of computing CRASs into a computationally\ntractable convex optimization problem.

Thus,\nwe can employ the convex optimization method of computing 0-reach-avoid sets to\nestimate CRASs.

    "abstract": "Whispered speech is produced when the vocal folds are not used, either\nintentionally, or due to a temporary or permanent voice condition. The\nessential difference between natural speech and whispered speech is that\nperiodic signal components that exist in certain regions of the former, called\nvoiced regions, as a consequence of the vibration of the vocal folds, are\nmissing in the latter. The restoration of natural speech from whispered speech\nrequires delicate signal processing procedures that are especially useful if\nthey can be implemented on low-resourced portable devices, in real-time, and\non-the-fly, taking advantage of the established source-filter paradigm of voice\nproduction and related models. This paper addresses two challenges that are\nintertwined and are key in informing and making viable this envisioned\ntechnological realization. The first challenge involves characterizing and\nmodeling the evolution of the harmonic phase/magnitude structure of a sequence\nof individual pitch periods in a voiced region of natural speech comprising\nsustained or co-articulated vowels. This paper proposes a novel algorithm\nsegmenting individual pitch pulses, which is then used to obtain illustrative\nresults highlighting important differences between sustained and co-articulated\nvowels, and suggesting practical synthetic voicing approaches. The second\nchallenge involves model-based synthetic voicing. Three implementation\nalternatives are described that differ in their signal reconstruction\napproaches: frequency-domain, combined frequency and time-domain, and\nphysiologically-inspired separate filtering of glottal excitation pulses\nindividually generated. The three alternatives are compared objectively using\nillustrative examples, and subjectively using the results of listening tests\ninvolving synthetic voicing of sustained and co-articulated vowels in word\ncontext.",

    "abstract": "Accurate treatment of energetic fusion byproducts in laboratory plasmas often\nrequires a kinetic description, owing to their large birth kinetic energy and\nlong mean-free-paths compared with the characteristic system scale lengths. For\nexample, alpha particles produced by deuterium--tritium fusion reactions are\nborn at high energies (\\SI{3.5}{MeV}) and predominantly slow down through\ninteractions with electrons traveling at comparable speeds. As an alpha\nparticle slows, its distribution collapses near the background ion-thermal\nspeed, forming a sharp structure in velocity space. Such sharp features pose\nnumerical challenges in grid-based Eulerian methods: capturing the full\nalpha-particle energies demands a large velocity domain, while resolving the\nnear-thermal region requires a sufficiently fine mesh. Inspired by the work of\nPeigney et al.[J. Comput. Phys. 278 (2014)], we present a two-grid approach\nthat splits the alpha-particle distribution into energetic (suprathermal) and\nash (thermal) components. A Gaussian-based sink term transfers particles from\nthe energetic population to the ash population as they slow to the thermal\nregime, and a conservative projection scheme ensures that mass, momentum, and\nenergy of the alpha and ash interactions are preserved. Unlike the formulation\nof Peigney, our method does not require a strict asymptotic separation of\nvelocity scales, which can, in principle, be arbitrary. We demonstrate the\nrobustness of this approach on challenging multiscale problems, including a\nsurrogate for an igniting inertial confinement fusion capsule.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we derive a variance-driven Local-Effect-Model ($\\sigma$-LEM)\nto predict radiosensitization due to gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Assuming that\nthe number of Au photo-ionisations scales strictly with particle volume\n$V_{\\mathrm{NP}}\\propto R^{3}$, a linear relation between dose-enhancement\nratio and concentration is achieved ($DER = 1 + K_c,c$), in which $K_c$ is a\nbeam-quality and nucleus-size-specific term, and $c$ is the concentration in\nmM. Furthermore, assuming that the cascade energy deposition is log-normally\ndistributed, the enhanced dose in each target voxel can be written as\n$D_{\\text{enh}} = D_{0}\\exp(\\sigma Z)$ with $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and width\n$\\sigma = \\sqrt{2\\ln(1+Kc)}$.\n  Assuming a linear-quadratic (LQ) dose response, a relation between cell\nsurvival and dose can be derived. Despite no closed form for the log-normal\ndistribution, averaging over the entire domain using first- and second-order\nmoments leads to three possible closed forms: variance-only, mixed-term, and\nsecond-order. These three variants adapt well to low-concentration,\nmid-concentration, and high-concentration regimes.\n  The model was tested for Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) results taken\nfrom a Local Effect Model (LEM) and experimental values.

    "abstract": "The discovery of the lazy neuron phenomenon in trained Transformers, where\nthe vast majority of neurons in their feed-forward networks (FFN) are inactive\nfor each token, has spurred tremendous interests in activation sparsity for\nenhancing large model efficiency. While notable progress has been made in\ntranslating such sparsity to wall-time benefits, modern Transformers have moved\naway from the ReLU activation function crucial to this phenomenon. Existing\nefforts on re-introducing activation sparsity often degrade model quality,\nincrease parameter count, complicate or slow down training. Sparse attention,\nthe application of sparse activation to the attention mechanism, often faces\nsimilar challenges.\n  This paper introduces the Spark Transformer, a novel architecture that\nachieves a high level of activation sparsity in both FFN and the attention\nmechanism while maintaining model quality, parameter count, and standard\ntraining procedures. Our method realizes sparsity via top-k masking for\nexplicit control over sparsity level. Crucially, we introduce statistical\ntop-k, a hardware-accelerator-friendly, linear-time approximate algorithm that\navoids costly sorting and mitigates significant training slowdown from standard\ntop-$k$ operators. Furthermore, Spark Transformer reallocates existing FFN\nparameters and attention key embeddings to form a low-cost predictor for\nidentifying activated entries. This design not only mitigates quality loss from\nenforced sparsity, but also enhances wall-time benefit. Pretrained with the\nGemma-2 recipe, Spark Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on\nstandard benchmarks while exhibiting significant sparsity: only 8% of FFN\nneurons are activated, and each token attends to a maximum of 256 tokens. This\nsparsity translates to a 2.5x reduction in FLOPs, leading to decoding wall-time\nspeedups of up to 1.79x on CPU and 1.40x on GPU.",

Through sentiment analysis, we assess the\nemotional characteristics of responses from both LLMs and humans. The results\nreveal two key mechanisms through which LLMs moderate discourse: first, LLMs\nconsistently display emotional neutrality, showing far less polarized sentiment\nthan human users. Second, LLMs maintain lower emotional intensity across\ncontexts, creating a stabilizing effect in conversations. These findings\nsuggest that LLMs possess inherent moderating capacities that could improve the\nquality of public discourse on controversial topics.

Entropy minimization has emerged as a\npractical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however,\nit can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in\nincorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time\nactive learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via\nepisodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns\nto increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones,\nimproving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy\noptimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and\npseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the\nagent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence\nand action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy\nthat enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident\npredictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all\niterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive\nevaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate\nthat ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time,\noutperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.",

    "abstract": "In settings where interference is present, direct effects are commonly\ndefined as the average effect of a unit's treatment on their own outcome while\nfixing the treatment status or probability among interfering units, and\nspillover effects measure the average effect of a change in the latter while\nthe individual's treatment status is kept fixed. Here, we define the average\ncausal effect of a unit's treatment status on the outcome of their network\nneighbors, while fixing the treatment probability in the remaining interference\nset. We propose two different weighting schemes defining two causal effects: i)\nthe outward spillover effect, which represents the average effect of a unit's\ntreatment on their neighbors' potential outcomes, and ii) the inward spillover\neffect, which represents the impact of each neighbor's treatment on an\nindividual's own potential outcome. We prove that outward and inward spillover\neffects generally differ, even in an undirected network. However, under\nspecific conditions these two causal estimands become equivalent. We provide\nnumerous examples illustrating the conditions for equivalence or discrepancy of\nthe two spillover effects. We then compare their Horvitz-Thompson estimators,\nexamining their relative variance under various graph structures and structural\nassumptions on potential outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The Stretched-FrOnt-Leg (SFOL) pulse is an advanced distance measuring\nequipment (DME) pulse that offers superior ranging accuracy compared to\nconventional Gaussian pulses. Successful SFOL pulse transmission has been\nrecently demonstrated from a commercial Gaussian pulse-based DME in low-power\nmode utilizing digital predistortion (DPD) techniques for power amplifiers.\nThese adjustments were achieved through software modifications, enabling SFOL\nintegration without replacing existing DME infrastructure. However, the SFOL\npulse is designed to optimize ranging capabilities by leveraging the effective\nradiated power (ERP) and pulse shape parameters permitted within DME\nspecifications. Consequently, it operates with narrow margins against these\nspecifications, potentially leading to non-compliance when transmitted in\nhigh-power mode. This paper introduces strategies to enable a Gaussian\npulse-based DME to transmit the SFOL pulse while adhering to DME specifications\nin high-power mode. The proposed strategies involve use of a variant of the\nSFOL pulse and DPD techniques utilizing truncated singular value decomposition,\ntailored for high-power DME operations. Test results, conducted on a testbed\nutilizing a commercial Gaussian pulse-based DME, demonstrate the effectiveness\nof these strategies, ensuring compliance with DME specifications in high-power\nmode with minimal performance loss. This study enables cost-effective\nintegration of high-accuracy SFOL pulses into existing high-power DME systems,\nenhancing aircraft positioning precision while ensuring compliance with\nindustry standards.",

    "abstract": "Learning distribution families over $\\mathbb{R}^d$ is a fundamental problem\nin unsupervised learning and statistics. A central question in this setting is\nwhether a given family of distributions possesses sufficient structure to be\n(at least) information-theoretically learnable and, if so, to characterize its\nsample complexity. In 2018, Ashtiani et al. reframed \\emph{sample\ncompressibility}, originally due to Littlestone and Warmuth (1986), as a\nstructural property of distribution classes, proving that it guarantees\nPAC-learnability. This discovery subsequently enabled a series of recent\nadvancements in deriving nearly tight sample complexity bounds for various\nhigh-dimensional open problems. It has been further conjectured that the\nconverse also holds: every learnable class admits a tight sample compression\nscheme.\n  In this work, we establish that sample compressible families remain learnable\neven from perturbed samples, subject to a set of necessary and sufficient\nconditions. We analyze two models of data perturbation: (i) an additive\nindependent noise model, and (ii) an adversarial corruption model, where an\nadversary manipulates a limited subset of the samples unknown to the learner.\nOur results are general and rely on as minimal assumptions as possible. We\ndevelop a perturbation-quantization framework that interfaces naturally with\nthe compression scheme and leads to sample complexity bounds that scale\ngracefully with the noise level and corruption budget. As concrete\napplications, we establish new sample complexity bounds for learning finite\nmixtures of high-dimensional uniform distributions under both noise and\nadversarial perturbations, as well as for learning Gaussian mixture models from\nadversarially corrupted samples, resolving two open problems in the literature.",

To address these challenges, we propose a\nReasoning-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework, \\textbf{RARL}, that enhances\nthe reasoning capabilities of medical VLMs while remaining efficient and\nadaptable to low-resource environments. Our approach fine-tunes a lightweight\nbase model, Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, using Low-Rank Adaptation and custom reward\nfunctions that jointly consider diagnostic accuracy and reasoning quality.\nTraining is performed on a single NVIDIA A100-PCIE-40GB GPU, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of deploying such models in constrained environments. We evaluate\nthe model using an LLM-as-judge framework that scores both correctness and\nexplanation quality. Experimental results show that RARL significantly improves\nVLM performance in medical image analysis and clinical reasoning, outperforming\nsupervised fine-tuning on reasoning-focused tasks by approximately 7.78%, while\nrequiring fewer computational resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the\ngeneralization capabilities of our approach on unseen datasets, achieving\naround 27% improved performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and about 4%\nover traditional RL fine-tuning. Our experiments also illustrate that diversity\nprompting during training and reasoning prompting during inference are crucial\nfor enhancing VLM performance. Our findings highlight the potential of\nreasoning-guided learning and reasoning prompting to steer medical VLMs toward\nmore transparent, accurate, and resource-efficient clinical decision-making.\nCode and data are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising uncertainty quantification framework\nwhich works as a wrapper around a black-box classifier to construct prediction\nsets (i.e., subset of candidate classes) with provable guarantees. However,\nstandard calibration methods for CP tend to produce large prediction sets which\nmakes them less useful in practice. This paper considers the problem of\nintegrating conformal principles into the training process of deep classifiers\nto directly minimize the size of prediction sets. We formulate conformal\ntraining as a bilevel optimization problem and propose the {\\em Direct\nPrediction Set Minimization (DPSM)} algorithm to solve it. The key insight\nbehind DPSM is to minimize a measure of the prediction set size (upper level)\nthat is conditioned on the learned quantile of conformity scores (lower level).\nWe analyze that DPSM has a learning bound of $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ (with $n$ training\nsamples), while prior conformal training methods based on stochastic\napproximation for the quantile has a bound of $\\Omega(1/s)$ (with batch size\n$s$ and typically $s \\ll \\sqrt{n}$). Experiments on various benchmark datasets\nand deep models show that DPSM significantly outperforms the best prior\nconformal training baseline with $20.46\\%\\downarrow$ in the prediction set size\nand validates our theory.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in ferroelectrics highlight the role of three-dimensional\n(3D) polar entities in forming topological polar textures and generating giant\nelectromechanical responses, during polarization rotation. However, current\nelectron microscopy methods lack the depth resolution to resolve the\npolarization component along the electron beam direction, which restricts full\ncharacterization. Here, we present a deep learning framework combined with\nfour-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy to reconstruct 3D\npolarization maps in Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 thin-film capacitors with picometer-level\naccuracy under applied electric fields. Our approach enables observation of\npolar nanodomains consistent with the polar slush model and shows that\nswitching occurs through coordinated vector rotation toward <111> energy\nminima, rather than magnitude changes. Furthermore, regions with higher\ntopological density exhibit smaller polarization variation when the electric\nfield changes, indicating topological protection. Our work reveals the value of\n3D polarization mapping in elucidating complex nanoscale polar phenomena, with\nbroad implications for emergent ferroelectrics.",

    "abstract": "Event cameras are novel bio-inspired sensors that capture motion dynamics\nwith much higher temporal resolution than traditional cameras, since pixels\nreact asynchronously to brightness changes. They are therefore better suited\nfor tasks involving motion such as motion segmentation. However, training\nevent-based networks still represents a difficult challenge, as obtaining\nground truth is very expensive, error-prone and limited in frequency. In this\narticle, we introduce EV-LayerSegNet, a self-supervised CNN for event-based\nmotion segmentation. Inspired by a layered representation of the scene\ndynamics, we show that it is possible to learn affine optical flow and\nsegmentation masks separately, and use them to deblur the input events. The\ndeblurring quality is then measured and used as self-supervised learning loss.\nWe train and test the network on a simulated dataset with only affine motion,\nachieving IoU and detection rate up to 71% and 87% respectively.",

    "abstract": "Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum\nmany-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial\ntool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the\ngeometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the\nentanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the\narea of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This\nimplies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of\nentangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of\nresearch, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects\ntowards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this\ndirection is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic\nspacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity\ntheories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next,\nwe should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those\nspacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections\nbetween quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question\nof how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and\ntime-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.",
