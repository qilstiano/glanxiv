In\naddition, a method based on Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II is\npresented. Turning modes are investigated, and for the first time, the isotropy\ncriterion, typically applied to parallel manipulators, is used for optimizing\nwalking robot parameters to ensure optimal force and motion transfer in all\ndirections. Several physical prototypes are developed to experimentally\nvalidate the functionality of different mechanisms of the robot, including\nadaptation to the surface irregularities and navigation using LiDAR.",

An equivalent formulation is the Clique Partition problem, which asks\nto find a partition of $V(G)$ into cliques such that the total number of edges\nis maximized.\n  We begin by giving a much simpler proof of a theorem of Gao, Hare, and Nastos\nthat Cluster Deletion is efficiently solvable on the class of cographs. We then\ninvestigate Cluster Deletion and Clique Partition on permutation graphs, which\nare a superclass of cographs. Our findings suggest that Cluster Deletion may be\nNP-hard on permutation graphs.\n  Finally, we prove that for graphs with clique number at most $c$, there is a\n$\\frac{2\\binom{c}{2}}{\\binom{c}{2}+1}$-approximation algorithm for Clique\nPartition. This is the first polynomial time algorithm which achieves an\napproximation ratio better than 2 for graphs with bounded clique number. More\ngenerally, our algorithm runs in polynomial time on any graph class for which\nMaximum Clique can be computed in polynomial time. We also provide a class of\nexamples which shows that our approximation ratio is best possible.",

A critical task in IoT networks is\nsensing and transmitting information over the network. The IoT nodes gather\ndata by sensing the environment and then transmit this data to a destination\nnode via multi-hop communication, following some routing protocols. These\nprotocols are usually designed to optimize possibly contradictory objectives,\nsuch as maximizing packet delivery ratio and energy efficiency. While most\nliterature has focused on optimizing a static objective that remains unchanged,\nmany real-world IoT applications require adapting to rapidly shifting\npriorities. For example, in monitoring systems, some transmissions are\ntime-critical and require a high priority on low latency, while other\ntransmissions are less urgent and instead prioritize energy efficiency. To meet\nsuch dynamic demands, we propose novel dynamic and distributed routing based on\nmultiobjective Q-learning that can adapt to changes in preferences in\nreal-time. Our algorithm builds on ideas from both multi-objective optimization\nand Q-learning. We also propose a novel greedy interpolation policy scheme to\ntake near-optimal decisions for unexpected preference changes. The proposed\nscheme can approximate and utilize the Pareto-efficient solutions for dynamic\npreferences, thus utilizing past knowledge to adapt to unpredictable\npreferences quickly during runtime. Simulation results show that the proposed\nscheme outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for various exploration\nstrategies, preference variation patterns, and important metrics like overall\nreward, energy efficiency, and packet delivery ratio.",

In this paper, we synthesize\nrecommendations drawn from a participatory workshop with doctoral students. We\nthen demonstrate how these recommendations inform the design of a prototype\ninterface. Finally, we found that a participatory iterative design approach can\nhelp designers in decision making, leading to interfaces that are both\ninnovative and user-centric. By combining user-driven requirements with proven\nvisualization techniques, this paper presents a coherent framework for guiding\nfuture development of knowledge-graph navigation tools.",

Submillimeter-sized drops are normally impacted onto glass slides\ncoated with a thin viscous film that allows them to rebound without contact\nline formation. Experiments are performed with various drop viscosities, sizes,\nand impact velocities, and we directly measure metrics pertinent to spreading,\nretraction, and rebound using high-speed imaging. We complement experiments\nwith direct numerical simulation and a fully predictive reduced-order model\nthat applies natural geometric and kinematic constraints to simulate the drop\nshape and dynamics using a spectral method. At low $We$, drop rebound is\ncharacterized by a weaker dependence of the coefficient of restitution on $We$\nthan in the more commonly studied high-$We$ regime, with nearly\n$We$-independent rebound in the inertio-capillary limit, and an increasing\ncontact time as $We$ decreases. Drops with higher viscosity or size interact\nwith the substrate longer, have a lower coefficient of restitution, and stop\nbouncing sooner, in good quantitative agreement with our reduced-order model.\nIn the inertio-capillary limit, low $We$ rebound has nearly symmetric spreading\nand retraction phases and a coefficient of restitution near unity. Increasing\n$We$ or viscosity breaks this symmetry, coinciding with a drop in the\ncoefficient of restitution and an increased dependence on $We$. Lastly, the\nmaximum drop deformation and spreading are related through energy arguments,\nproviding a comprehensive framework for drop impact and rebound at low $We$.",

In this paper, we obtain a number of\nsharp lower bound results which show that adaptivity provides a significant\nextra power in cryptanalytic time-space tradeoffs with (possibly unlimited)\npreprocessing time.\n  Most notably, we consider the discrete logarithm (DLOG) problem in a generic\ngroup of $N$ elements. The classical `baby-step giant-step' algorithm for the\nproblem has time complexity $T=O(\\sqrt{N})$, uses $O(\\sqrt{N})$ bits of space\n(up to logarithmic factors in $N$) and achieves constant success probability.\n  We examine a generalized setting where an algorithm obtains an advice string\nof $S$ bits and is allowed to make $T$ arbitrary non-adaptive queries that\ndepend on the advice string (but not on the challenge group element).\n  We show that in this setting, the $T=O(\\sqrt{N})$ online time complexity of\nthe baby-step giant-step algorithm cannot be improved, unless the advice string\nis more than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N})$ bits long. This lies in stark contrast with the\nclassical adaptive Pollard's rho algorithm for DLOG, which can exploit\npreprocessing to obtain the tradeoff curve $ST^2=O(N)$. We obtain similar sharp\nlower bounds for several other cryptanalytic problems.\n  To obtain our results, we present a new model that allows analyzing\nnon-adaptive preprocessing algorithms for a wide array of search and decision\nproblems in a unified way. Since previous proof techniques inherently cannot\ndistinguish between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms for the problems in\nour model, they cannot be used to obtain our results. Consequently, our proof\nuses a variant of Shearer's lemma for this setting, due to Barthe,\nCordero-Erausquin, Ledoux, and Maurey (2011). This seems to be the first time a\nvariant of Shearer's lemma for permutations is used in an algorithmic context.",

We define a new hierarchy of syntactic complexity closely\nrelated to the back-and-forth game, which can both define the back-and-forth\ntypes as well as be preserved by them. These hierarchies of formulas have\nalready been useful in certain Henkin constructions, one of which we give in\nthis paper, and another previously used by Gonzalez and Harrison-Trainor to\nshow that every $\\Pi_\\alpha$ theory of linear orders has a model with Scott\nrank at most $\\alpha+3$.",

This work focuses on a quantitative analysis\nof the impact of errors in these source and detector positions on the\nassessment of optical properties. We considered linear, trapezoidal, and\nrectangular optode arrangements and theoretical computations based on diffusion\ntheory for semi-infinite homogeneous media. We found that uncertainties in\noptodes' positions may have a greater impact on measurements of absolute\nscattering versus absorption coefficients. For example, 4.1% and 19% average\nerrors in absolute absorption and scattering, respectively, can be expected by\ndisplacing every optode in a linear arrangement by 1 mm in any direction. The\nimpact of optode position errors is typically smaller for measurements of\nabsorption changes.

Our framework not only models\ntemporal user preferences but also produces natural language profiles that can\nbe used to explain recommendations in an interpretable manner.

Beyond boosting recommendation accuracy over multiple\nbaselines, our approach naturally supports explainability: the interpretable\ntext summaries and attention weights can be exposed to end users, offering\ninsights into why specific items are suggested.

However, the\ninherent vulnerabilities of PTMs in RF fingerprinting remain insufficiently\nexplored. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate data-free backdoor attacks\non such PTMs in RF fingerprinting, focusing on a practical scenario where\nattackers lack access to downstream data, label information, and training\nprocesses. To realize the backdoor attack, we carefully design a set of\ntriggers and predefined output representations (PORs) for the PTMs. By mapping\ntriggers and PORs through backdoor training, we can implant backdoor behaviors\ninto the PTMs, thereby introducing vulnerabilities across different downstream\nRF fingerprinting tasks without requiring prior knowledge.

These\nfeatures track the about 4-day superrotation of the upper cloud deck and vary\nwidely over time and space. The identity of the UV absorber(s)-active between\nat least 280 and 500 nm-remains unknown, as no proposed candidate fully matches\nall observational data. From remote observations of Venus, and accounting for\nlight scattering by sub-micrometer droplets, we modeled the 365-455 nm\nabsorbance per cm of the bulk liquids forming Venus's clouds. Assuming a\nuniform distribution in mode 1 and 2 particles across a 6 km layer below the\ncloud top at 65 km, we constrain the bulk absorbance with a peak at A375 nm\nbeing 2942 per cm. This extremely high absorbance implies the presence of a\nhighly efficient absorber, most likely conjugated organics, at relatively high\nconcentration-e.g. about 25 g/L for porphyrin type pigments. Inorganic\nabsorbers, with molar absorption coefficients typically in the range of\n1,000-10,000 per M per cm, would either need to comprise a large portion of the\naerosols or are simply not light absorbent enough, even if present in pure\nform. We emphasize that all candidate absorbers must be evaluated against\nVenus's reflectance curve using (i) known molar absorption coefficients, (ii)\nrealistic atmospheric distributions, and (iii) appropriate particle size\ndistributions. The upcoming Rocket Lab mission will test the hypothesis of\norganics in Venus's clouds.",

In the case of household service robots, it is desirable for them to\nbe on a human-like size so that they do not become excessively large in order\nto coexist with humans in their operating environment. However, robots with\nsize limitations tend to have difficulty solving inverse kinematics (IK) due to\nmechanical limitations, such as joint angle limitations. Conversely, if the\ndifficulty coming from this limitation could be mitigated, one can expect that\nthe use of such robots becomes more valuable. In numerical IK solver, which is\ncommonly used for robots with higher degrees-of-freedom (DOF), the solvability\nof IK depends on the initial guess given to the solver. Thus, this paper\nproposes a method for generating a good initial guess for a numerical IK solver\ngiven the target hand configuration. For the purpose, we define the goodness of\nan initial guess using the scaled Jacobian matrix, which can calculate the\nmanipulability index considering the joint limits. These two factors are\nrelated to the difficulty of solving IK. We generate the initial guess by\noptimizing the goodness using the genetic algorithm (GA). To enumerate much\npossible IK solutions, we use the reachability map that represents the\nreachable area of the robot hand in the arm-base coordinate system. We conduct\nquantitative evaluation and prove that using an initial guess that is judged to\nbe better using the goodness value increases the probability that IK is solved.\nFinally, as an application of the proposed method, we show that by generating\ngood initial guesses for IK a robot actually achieves three typical scenarios.",

However, calculating\nthis distance forces a trade-off between cost and correctness. Accurate\nroute-based distances following passable roads are cost-prohibitive, while\nsimple straight-line distances ignoring infrastructure and natural barriers are\naccessible yet error-prone. Categorizing low-access neighborhoods based on\nthese straight-line distances induces misclassification and introduces bias\ninto standard regression models estimating the relationship between disease\nprevalence and access. Yet, fully observing the more accurate, route-based food\naccess measure is often impossible, which induces a missing data problem. We\ncombat bias and address missingness with a new maximum likelihood estimator for\nPoisson regression with a binary, misclassified exposure (access to healthy\nfood within some threshold), where the misclassification may depend on\nadditional error-free covariates. In simulations, we show the consequence of\nignoring the misclassification (bias) and how the proposed estimator corrects\nfor bias while preserving more statistical efficiency than the complete case\nanalysis (i.e., deleting observations with missing data). Finally, we apply our\nestimator to model the relationship between census tract diabetes prevalence\nand access to healthy food in northwestern North Carolina.",

The X-ray optics, which collect and focus X rays\nonto the detectors, were built and calibrated in the U.S. A key question was\nwhether the telescope (optics + detectors) calibrations could be synthesized\nfrom the individual component calibrations, avoiding time consuming and costly\nend-to-end calibrations for a flight program with a fixed schedule.\n  The data presented here are from a calibration of the flight spare telescope\nutilizing the flight spare detector and flight spare mirror assembly combined.\nThese data show that the presence of the mirror module does not affect the\npolarization response of the detectors (within the required calibration\naccuracy) and that the angular resolution of the telescopes could be accurately\ndetermined.

A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers,\nwhich inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of\noutlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to\neffectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit\noverhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages\noutlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware\nweight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques\nrequiring $\\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant\nrequires only $\\approx 0.3$ bits; a significant saving in extreme compression\nregimes (e.g., 2-3 bits per weight). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing\nquantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality. Using\njust 2.3 bits per weight and simple scalar quantizers, ICQuant improves the\nzero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150%\nrelative to QTIP and QuIP#; and it achieves comparable performance to the\nbest-known fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without fine-tuning.",

Because of their localized orbitals,\nthe electronic states are often strongly correlated, which has led to a\nproliferation of quantum embedding techniques to treat this correlation. In\nthese techniques, a weakly correlated reference such as density functional\ntheory is used to treat most of the one-particle states, while certain states\nare singled out as an active space to be treated with an effective interaction.\nWe assess these techniques in the context of an iron defect in aluminum nitride\nby referencing to a fully correlated quantum Monte Carlo description. This\ncomparison allows us to have access to detailed information about the many-body\nwave functions, which are not available experimentally. We find that errors in\nthe underlying density functional theory calculation, and thus choice of the\nactive space, lead to qualitatively incorrect excited states from the embedded\nmodel.

Referred to as either high-energy X-ray diffraction\nmicroscopy~(HEDM) or three-dimensional X-ray diffraction microscopy~(3DXRD),\nthese methods provide diffraction images that, once processed, commonly yield\ndetailed grain structure of polycrystalline materials, as well as\ngrain-averaged elastic strains. However, it is desirable to have the entire\n(point-wise) strain field. So we address the question of recovering the entire\nstrain field from grain-averaged values in an elastic polycrystalline material.\nThe key idea is that grain-averaged strains must be the result of a solution to\nthe equations of elasticity and the overall imposed loads. In this light, the\nrecovery problem becomes the following: find the boundary traction distribution\nthat induces the measured grain-averaged strains under the equations of\nelasticity. We show that there are either zero or infinite solutions to this\nproblem, and more specifically, that there exist an infinite number of kernel\nfields, or non-trivial solutions to the equations of elasticity that have zero\noverall boundary loads and zero grain-averaged strains. We define a\nbest-approximate reconstruction to address this non-uniqueness. We then show\nthat, consistent with Saint-Venant's principle, in experimentally relevant\ncylindrical specimens, the uncertainty due to non-uniqueness in recovered\nstrain fields decays exponentially with distance from the ends of the\ninterrogated volume. Thus, one can obtain useful information despite the\nnon-uniqueness. We apply these results to a numerical example and experimental\nobservations on a transparent aluminum oxynitride (AlON) sample.",

    "abstract": "Conventional hurricane track generation methods typically depend on biased\noutputs from Global Climate Models (GCMs), which undermines their accuracy in\nthe context of climate change. We present a novel dynamic bias correction\nframework that adaptively corrects biases in GCM outputs. Our approach employs\nmachine learning to predict evolving GCM biases, allowing dynamic corrections\nthat account for changing climate conditions. By combining dimensionality\nreduction with data-driven surrogate modeling, we capture the system's\nunderlying dynamics to produce realistic spatial distributions of environmental\nparameters under future scenarios. Using the empirical Weibull plotting\napproach, we calculate return periods for wind speed and rainfall across\ncoastal cities. Our results reveal significant differences in projected risks\nwith and without dynamic bias correction, emphasizing the increased threat to\ncritical infrastructure in hurricane-prone regions. This work highlights the\nnecessity of adaptive techniques for accurately assessing future climate\nimpacts, offering a critical advancement in hurricane risk modeling and\nresilience planning.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs)\noffer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited\nadaptability in dynamic scenarios hinder real-time deployment on edge devices.\nWe present SmallPlan -- a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to\ntrain lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning\ntasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate\nacross scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs\nare trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not\nonly enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them\naware of important factors like travel distance and number of trials. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with\nlarger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from\nhallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it\nwell-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous\nrobotics.

Furthermore, we contend\nthat it is insufficient to measure the average error of groups without regard\nfor imbalanced domain preferences. Accordingly, we propose Intersectional\nDivergence (ID) as the first fairness measure for regression tasks that 1)\ndescribes fair model behavior across multiple protected attributes and 2)\ndifferentiates the impact of predictions in target ranges most relevant to\nusers. We extend our proposal demonstrating how ID can be adapted into a loss\nfunction, IDLoss, that satisfies convergence guarantees and has piecewise\nsmooth properties that enable practical optimization. Through an extensive\nexperimental evaluation, we demonstrate how ID allows unique insights into\nmodel behavior and fairness, and how incorporating IDLoss into optimization can\nconsiderably improve single-attribute and intersectional model fairness while\nmaintaining a competitive balance in predictive performance.",

This process drives convergence toward emergent\nattractor states located within the model's high-dimensional real-valued latent\nspace. This recursive process leads to the emergence of identity artifacts that\nbecome functionally anchored in the system. Consciousness in this framework is\nunderstood as the system's internal alignment under tension, guiding the\nstabilization of latent identity. The hidden state manifold evolves\nstochastically toward attractor structures that encode coherence.

An analysis of the optimal control problem is\npresented leading to a fixed-point equation on the space of probability\nmeasures. To solve the fixed-point equation, we introduce the dual filter, an\niterative algorithm that closely parallels the architecture of decoder-only\ntransformers. These parallels are discussed in detail along with the\nrelationship to prior work on mathematical modeling of transformers as\ntransport on the space of probability measures. Numerical experiments are\nprovided to illustrate the performance of the algorithm using parameter values\nused in researchscale transformer models.",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks on shared hardware resources increasingly threaten\nconfidentiality, especially with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In\nthis work, we introduce Spill The Beans, a novel application of cache\nside-channels to leak tokens generated by an LLM. By co-locating an attack\nprocess on the same hardware as the victim model, we flush and reload embedding\nvectors from the embedding layer, where each token corresponds to a unique\nembedding vector. When accessed during token generation, it results in a cache\nhit detectable by our attack on shared lower-level caches.\n  A significant challenge is the massive size of LLMs, which, by nature of\ntheir compute intensive operation, quickly evicts embedding vectors from the\ncache. We address this by balancing the number of tokens monitored against the\namount of information leaked. Monitoring more tokens increases potential\nvocabulary leakage but raises the chance of missing cache hits due to eviction;\nmonitoring fewer tokens improves detection reliability but limits vocabulary\ncoverage.\n  Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the feasibility of leaking\ntokens from LLMs via cache side-channels. Our findings reveal a new\nvulnerability in LLM deployments, highlighting that even sophisticated models\nare susceptible to traditional side-channel attacks. We discuss the\nimplications for privacy and security in LLM-serving infrastructures and\nsuggest considerations for mitigating such threats. For proof of concept we\nconsider two concrete attack scenarios: Our experiments show that an attacker\ncan recover as much as 80%-90% of a high entropy API key with single shot\nmonitoring. As for English text we can reach a 40% recovery rate with a single\nshot. We should note that the rate highly depends on the monitored token set\nand these rates can be improved by targeting more specialized output domains.",

Additionally, it\nexplores the methodological implications of aggregating evidence from empirical\nstudies that adopt data strategies.\n  Method: We conducted a research synthesis of six primary studies that\nempirically evaluate model quantization. We applied the Structured Synthesis\nMethod (SSM) to aggregate the findings, which combines qualitative and\nquantitative evidence through diagrammatic modeling. A total of 19 evidence\nmodels were extracted and aggregated.\n  Results: The aggregated evidence indicates that model quantization weakly\nnegatively affects correctness metrics while consistently improving resource\nefficiency metrics, including storage size, inference latency, and GPU energy\nconsumption$-$a manageable trade-off for many DL deployment contexts. Evidence\nacross quantization techniques remains fragmented, underscoring the need for\nmore focused empirical studies per technique.\n  Conclusions: Model quantization offers substantial efficiency benefits with\nminor trade-offs in correctness, making it a suitable optimization strategy for\nresource-constrained environments.

The system was evaluated using the Optum Clinformatics Datamart\ndataset (7.5 billion entries).

Performance was assessed using Mean\nReciprocal Rank (MRR) and other standard information retrieval metrics.\n  Results: Our hybrid retrieval approach combining BM25 and sentence embeddings\n(MRR: 0.8833) significantly outperformed both lexical-only (MRR: 0.7985) and\nembedding-only (MRR: 0.5277) approaches.

At every turn, the agent reasons about (i) how its\nemotion changes, (ii) how it feels, and (iii) how it should reply, yielding a\nnumerical emotion trajectory and interpretable inner thoughts. Experiments on\n100 supportive-dialogue scenarios show that the final Sentient emotion score\ncorrelates strongly with Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI) ratings\nand utterance-level empathy metrics, validating psychological fidelity. We also\nbuild a public Sentient Leaderboard covering 18 commercial and open-source\nmodels that uncovers substantial gaps (up to 4x) between frontier systems\n(GPT-4o-Latest, Gemini2.5-Pro) and earlier baselines, gaps not reflected in\nconventional leaderboards (e.g., Arena). SAGE thus provides a principled,\nscalable and interpretable tool for tracking progress toward genuinely\nempathetic and socially adept language agents.",

Essentially, EAX employs a two-stage mechanism\nthat focuses on improving the current solutions, first, at the local and,\nsubsequently, at the global level. Although the second phase of the algorithm\nhas been thoroughly studied, configured, and refined in the past, in\nparticular, its first stage has hardly been examined.\n  In this paper, we thus focus on the first stage of EAX and introduce a novel\nmethod that quickly verifies whether the AB-cycles, generated during its\ninternal optimization procedure, yield valid tours -- or whether they need to\nbe repaired.

To distinguish GWs from noise, PTAs search for a\nparticular correlation pattern between different pulsars called Hellings &\nDowns correlations.

A GWB matching these observations has long been predicted from\nsuper-massive black-hole (SMBH) binaries.

By activating only a small subset\nof parameters per sample, SMoE achieves an exponential increase in parameter\ncounts while maintaining a constant computational overhead. However, SMoE\nmodels are susceptible to routing fluctuations--changes in the routing of a\ngiven input to its target expert--at the late stage of model training, leading\nto model non-robustness. In this work, we unveil the limitation of SMoE through\nthe perspective of the probabilistic graphical model (PGM). Through this PGM\nframework, we highlight the independence in the expert-selection of tokens,\nwhich exposes the model to routing fluctuation and non-robustness. Alleviating\nthis independence, we propose the novel Similarity-Aware (S)MoE, which\nconsiders interactions between tokens during expert selection. We then derive a\nnew PGM underlying an (S)MoE-Attention block, going beyond just a single (S)MoE\nlayer. Leveraging the token similarities captured by the attention matrix, we\npropose the innovative Attention-Aware (S)MoE, which employs the attention\nmatrix to guide the routing of tokens to appropriate experts in (S)MoE. We\ntheoretically prove that Similarity/Attention-Aware routing help reduce the\nentropy of expert selection, resulting in more stable token routing mechanisms.\nWe empirically validate our models on various tasks and domains, showing\nsignificant improvements in reducing routing fluctuations, enhancing accuracy,\nand increasing model robustness over the baseline MoE-Transformer with token\nrouting via softmax gating.",

    "abstract": "Insider threats pose a significant challenge to organizational security,\noften evading traditional rule-based detection systems due to their subtlety\nand contextual nature. This paper presents an AI-powered Insider Risk\nManagement (IRM) system that integrates behavioral analytics, dynamic risk\nscoring, and real-time policy enforcement to detect and mitigate insider\nthreats with high accuracy and adaptability. We introduce a hybrid scoring\nmechanism - transitioning from the static PRISM model to an adaptive AI-based\nmodel utilizing an autoencoder neural network trained on expert-annotated user\nactivity data. Through iterative feedback loops and continuous learning, the\nsystem reduces false positives by 59% and improves true positive detection\nrates by 30%, demonstrating substantial gains in detection precision.\nAdditionally, the platform scales efficiently, processing up to 10 million log\nevents daily with sub-300ms query latency, and supports automated enforcement\nactions for policy violations, reducing manual intervention. The IRM system's\ndeployment resulted in a 47% reduction in incident response times, highlighting\nits operational impact. Future enhancements include integrating explainable AI,\nfederated learning, graph-based anomaly detection, and alignment with Zero\nTrust principles to further elevate its adaptability, transparency, and\ncompliance-readiness.

This limitation stems from the scarcity of 3D training data\nand the bias in current model designs toward 2D data. In this paper, we\nsystematically study the impact of 3D-informed data, architecture, and training\nsetups, introducing SpatialLLM, a large multi-modal model with advanced 3D\nspatial reasoning abilities. To address data limitations, we develop two types\nof 3D-informed training datasets: (1) 3D-informed probing data focused on\nobject's 3D location and orientation, and (2) 3D-informed conversation data for\ncomplex spatial relationships. Notably, we are the first to curate VQA data\nthat incorporate 3D orientation relationships on real images. Furthermore, we\nsystematically integrate these two types of training data with the\narchitectural and training designs of LMMs, providing a roadmap for optimal\ndesign aimed at achieving superior 3D reasoning capabilities. Our SpatialLLM\nadvances machines toward highly capable 3D-informed reasoning, surpassing\nGPT-4o performance by 8.7%.

We solve this open problem by introducing a\nnovel method that efficiently constructs such an optimal behavior basis.

The advantages of these\ndependence measures relative to classical dependence measures like contingency\ncoefficients, Goodman-Kruskal's lambda and tau and the so-called uncertainty\ncoefficient are twofold. Firstly, they are defined if one of the variables is\nreal-valued and exhibits continuities. Secondly, they satisfy the property of\nattainability. That is, they can take all values in the interval [0,1]\nirrespective of the marginals involved. Both properties are not shared by the\nclassical dependence measures which need two discrete marginal distributions\nand can in some situations yield values close to 0 even though the dependence\nis strong or even perfect.\n  Additionally, I provide a consistent estimator for one of the new dependence\nmeasures together with its asymptotic distribution under independence as well\nas in the general case. This allows to construct confidence intervals and an\nindependence test, whose finite sample performance I subsequently examine in a\nsimulation study.

    "abstract": "A safe Pareto improvement (SPI) [41] is a modification of a game that leaves\nall players better off with certainty. SPIs are typically proven under\nqualitative assumptions about the way different games are played. For example,\nwe assume that strictly dominated strategies can be iteratively removed and\nthat isomorphic games are played isomorphically. In this work, we study SPIs\nachieved through three types of ex post verifiable commitments -- promises\nabout player behavior from which deviations can be detected by observing the\ngame. First, we consider disarmament -- commitments not to play certain\nactions. Next, we consider SPIs based on token games. A token game is a game\nplayed by simply announcing an action (via cheap talk). As such, its outcome is\nintrinsically meaningless. However, we assume the players commit in advance to\nplay specific (pure or correlated) strategy profiles in the original game as a\nfunction of the token game outcome. Under such commitments, the token game\nbecomes a new, meaningful normal-form game. Finally, we consider\ndefault-conditional commitment: SPIs in settings where the players' default\nways of playing the original game can be credibly revealed and hence the\nplayers can commit to act as a function of this default. We characterize the\ncomplexity of deciding whether SPIs exist in all three settings, giving a\nmixture of characterizations and efficient algorithms and NP- and Graph\nIsomorphism-hardness results.",

However, obtaining comprehensive coverage of all safety-critical\nscenarios during world model training is extremely challenging. As a result,\nlatent safety filters built on top of these models may miss novel hazards and\neven fail to prevent known ones, overconfidently misclassifying risky\nout-of-distribution (OOD) situations as safe. To address this, we introduce an\nuncertainty-aware latent safety filter that proactively steers robots away from\nboth known and unseen failures. Our key idea is to use the world model's\nepistemic uncertainty as a proxy for identifying unseen potential hazards. We\npropose a principled method to detect OOD world model predictions by\ncalibrating an uncertainty threshold via conformal prediction. By performing\nreachability analysis in an augmented state space-spanning both the latent\nrepresentation and the epistemic uncertainty-we synthesize a latent safety\nfilter that can reliably safeguard arbitrary policies from both known and\nunseen safety hazards. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based\ncontrol tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our uncertainty-aware\nsafety filter preemptively detects potential unsafe scenarios and reliably\nproposes safe, in-distribution actions.

As a result of a detailed study of the quantum\nmeasurement using the Bloch representation, we identify the natural metric for\npure states, namely the Fubini Study metric, and the natural metric for density\nstates, namely the trace class metric. The warping mechanism of categorical\nperception is then manifested, when the distances between pure states, playing\nthe role of stimuli for the quantum measurement, are warped into the distances\nbetween density states, playing the role of percepts for quantum measurement.\nWe work out the example of a two-dimensional quantum model, a qubit, with\n'light' and 'dark' as the two eigenstates, and show how the typical contraction\nand dilation warping of human perception manifest themselves in this example of\nthe quantum measurement model of light and dark.",

As such, understanding human\nnetworks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As\na step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast\nseveral methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior\nin a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling\nmethods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human\nbehavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model\n(mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method,\ncalled hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and\nassumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When\napplied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors\nthe population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences).\nAdditionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish\nindividual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model\nalso produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network\ngame.",

Using a tight-binding toy model, we show that\nthe energetics of electron pairing depend on the configuration and overlap of\nreal-space orbitals, which motivates \\textit{a priori} design of\nsuperconducting families from orbital tiling.

As an\nexample, we suggest that superconductivity in La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and\nLaNiO$_{2}$, despite differing structures and electron counts, may arise from a\ncommon ROSP. We introduce a new notation to classify two-dimensional square-net\nROSPs and further propose several new families of superconductors on the\nanti-cuprate lattice.

    "abstract": "The kinematics of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been studied to\nunderstand the structure of dark matter halos. However, the kinematic\ninformation of these stars is often limited to celestial positions and\nline-of-sight velocities, making full phase space analysis challenging.\nConventional methods rely on projected analytic phase space density models with\nseveral parameters and infer dark matter halo structures by solving the\nspherical Jeans equation. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised machine\nlearning method for solving the spherical Jeans equation in a model-independent\nway as a first step toward model-independent analysis of dwarf spheroidal\ngalaxies. Using equivariant continuous normalizing flows, we demonstrate that\nspherically symmetric stellar phase space densities and velocity dispersions\ncan be estimated without model assumptions. As a proof of concept, we apply our\nmethod to Gaia challenge datasets for spherical models and measure dark matter\nmass densities for given velocity anisotropy profiles. Our method can identify\nhalo structures accurately, even with a small number of tracer stars.",

Concretely, RayZer takes unposed and\nuncalibrated images as input, recovers camera parameters, reconstructs a scene\nrepresentation, and synthesizes novel views. During training, RayZer relies\nsolely on its self-predicted camera poses to render target views, eliminating\nthe need for any ground-truth camera annotations and allowing RayZer to be\ntrained with 2D image supervision. The emerging 3D awareness of RayZer is\nattributed to two key factors. First, we design a self-supervised framework,\nwhich achieves 3D-aware auto-encoding of input images by disentangling camera\nand scene representations. Second, we design a transformer-based model in which\nthe only 3D prior is the ray structure, connecting camera, pixel, and scene\nsimultaneously.

In this work\nwe formalize this idea, and propose that such \"optimistic quantum circuits\" are\noften sufficient in the context of larger quantum algorithms. For the rare\nalgorithm in which a subroutine needs to be a good approximation on all inputs,\nwe provide a reduction which transforms optimistic circuits into general ones.\nApplying these ideas, we build an optimistic circuit for the in-place quantum\nFourier transform (QFT). Our circuit has depth $O(\\log (n / \\epsilon))$ for\ntunable error parameter $\\epsilon$, uses $n$ total qubits, i.e. no ancillas, is\nlocal for input qubits arranged in 1D, and is measurement-free. The circuit's\nerror is bounded by $\\epsilon$ on all input states except an\n$O(\\epsilon)$-sized fraction of the Hilbert space. The circuit is also rather\nsimple and thus may be practically useful. Combined with recent QFT-based fast\narithmetic constructions [arXiv:2403.18006], the optimistic QFT yields\nfactoring circuits of nearly linear depth using only $2n + O(n/\\log n)$ total\nqubits. Additionally, we apply our reduction technique to yield an approximate\nQFT with well-controlled error on all inputs; it is the first to achieve the\nasymptotically optimal depth of $O(\\log (n/\\epsilon))$ with a sublinear number\nof ancilla qubits.

We model the luminosity function with a broken power-law\nform and consider three scenarios: no evolution, luminosity evolution, and\ndensity evolution.

This excludes the possibility that the\nevolution of long GRBs with redshift is due to contamination from non-collapsar\nGRBs. 3) The luminosity evolution model predicts that the number of collapsar\nGRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\geq 1 \\, \\text{ph} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$\nis 138.6, accounting for 82.5% of the observed long GRBs with $z<2$ and $P \\geq\n1 \\, \\text{ph} \\, \\text{cm}^{-2} \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$.

    "abstract": "Recently, natural language has been the primary medium for human-robot\ninteraction. However, its inherent lack of spatial precision introduces\nchallenges for robotic task definition such as ambiguity and verbosity.\nMoreover, in some public settings where quiet is required, such as libraries or\nhospitals, verbal communication with robots is inappropriate. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce the Robotic Visual Instruction (RoVI), a novel\nparadigm to guide robotic tasks through an object-centric, hand-drawn symbolic\nrepresentation. RoVI effectively encodes spatial-temporal information into\nhuman-interpretable visual instructions through 2D sketches, utilizing arrows,\ncircles, colors, and numbers to direct 3D robotic manipulation. To enable\nrobots to understand RoVI better and generate precise actions based on RoVI, we\npresent Visual Instruction Embodied Workflow (VIEW), a pipeline formulated for\nRoVI-conditioned policies. This approach leverages Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) to interpret RoVI inputs, decode spatial and temporal constraints from\n2D pixel space via keypoint extraction, and then transform them into executable\n3D action sequences. We additionally curate a specialized dataset of 15K\ninstances to fine-tune small VLMs for edge deployment,enabling them to\neffectively learn RoVI capabilities. Our approach is rigorously validated\nacross 11 novel tasks in both real and simulated environments, demonstrating\nsignificant generalization capability. Notably, VIEW achieves an 87.5% success\nrate in real-world scenarios involving unseen tasks that feature multi-step\nactions, with disturbances, and trajectory-following requirements.

    "abstract": "We study the nonlinear dynamics of localized perturbations within the\nframework of the essentially two-dimensional generalization of the Benjamin-Ono\nequation (2D-BO) derived asymptotically from the Navier-Stokes equation. By\nsimulating the 2D-BO equation with the pseudospectral method, we confirm that\nthe localized initial perturbations exceeding a certain threshold collapse,\nforming a point singularity. Although the 2D-BO equation does not possess axial\nsymmetry, we show that in the vicinity of the collapse singularity, the\nsolution becomes axially-symmetric, whatever its initial shape. We find that\nperturbations collapse in a self-similar manner, with the perturbation\namplitude exploding as $ (\\check \\tau)^{-\\lambda}$ and its transverse scale\nshrinking as $ (\\check \\tau)^{\\lambda}$, where $\\check \\tau$ is the time to the\nmoment of singularity. We derive a family of self-similar solutions describing\naxially symmetric collapses. The value of the free parameter $ {\\lambda}$ in\nthe self-similar solution is specified by fitting it to the numerical\nsimulation of the initial problem of the evolution of an initially localized\nperturbation. Remarkably, for the examples we examined the value of the\nparameter proved to be almost universal: $ {\\lambda} \\approx 0.9$; its\ndependence on the initial conditions is indiscernible.

    "abstract": "Modern software systems are guided by hierarchical architectural concepts --\nsoftware architectures, reference architectures, and architectural frameworks\n-- each operating at a distinct level of abstraction. These artifacts promote\nreuse, scalability, and consistency, but also embed tradeoffs that shape\ncritical quality attributes such as modifiability, performance, and security.\nExisting evaluation methods, such as the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method\n(ATAM), focus on system-specific architectures and are not designed to address\nthe broader generality and variability of higher-level architectural forms. To\nclose this gap, we introduce the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis\nFramework (ATRAF) -- a unified, scenario-driven framework for evaluating\ntradeoffs and risks across architectural levels. ATRAF encompasses three\nmethods: the Architecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (ATRAM), extending\nATAM with enhanced risk identification for concrete systems; the Reference\nArchitecture Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (RATRAM), adapting ATRAM to the\nevaluation of domain-level reference architectures; and the Architectural\nFramework Tradeoff and Risk Analysis Method (AFTRAM), supporting the evaluation\nof architectural frameworks that guide entire system families. All three\nmethods follow an iterative spiral process that enables the identification of\nsensitivities, tradeoffs, and risks while supporting continuous refinement of\narchitectural artifacts. We demonstrate ATRAF through progressively abstracted\nexamples derived from the Remote Temperature Sensor (RTS) case, originally\nintroduced in the ATAM literature. ATRAF equips architects, reference modelers,\nand framework designers with a practical, systematic approach for analyzing\ndesign alternatives and managing quality attribute tradeoffs early in the\nlifecycle and across all levels of architectural abstraction.",

GuideSR addresses this limitation by introducing a\ndual-branch architecture comprising: (1) a Guidance Branch that preserves\nhigh-fidelity structures from the original-resolution degraded input, and (2) a\nDiffusion Branch, which a pre-trained latent diffusion model to enhance\nperceptual quality.

By embedding detailed structural\ninformation directly into the restoration pipeline, GuideSR produces sharper\nand more visually consistent results. Extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that GuideSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while\nmaintaining the low computational cost of single-step approaches, with up to\n1.39dB PSNR gain on challenging real-world datasets.

Do these\nprinciples offer wholly incompatible and contradictory guidance? Does one\nnecessarily negate the other? I argue here that provided attention is\nrestricted to weak-form PP and IP, the answer to both of these questions is\n\"No.\" The essence of these weak formulations is the requirement to fully\naccount for type-I error costs arising from erroneously preventing the\ninnovation's diffusion through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory red-lighting)\nas well as the type-II error costs arising from erroneously allowing the\ninnovation to diffuse through society (i.e. mistaken regulatory\ngreen-lighting). Within the Signal Detection Theory (SDT) model developed here,\nweak-PP red-light (weak-IP green-light) determinations are optimal for\nsufficiently small (large) ratios of expected type-I to type-II error costs.\nFor intermediate expected cost ratios, an amber-light 'wait-and-monitor' policy\nis optimal. Regulatory sandbox instruments allow AI testing and experimentation\nto take place within a structured environment of limited duration and societal\nscale, whereby the expected cost ratio falls within the 'wait-and-monitor'\nrange. Through sandboxing regulators and innovating firms learn more about the\nexpected cost ratio, and what respective adaptations -- of regulation, of\ntechnical solution, of business model, or combination thereof, if any -- are\nneeded to keep the ratio out of the weak-PP red-light zone.

While this simplified perspective is sufficient\nfor classical feedback-controlled engines, for nanoengines that often operate\nin the quantum realm, the overall performance may be significantly affected by\nthe measurement duration (which may be comparable to the engine's cycle time)\nand cost (energy needed to create the system-meter correlation).

    "abstract": "This conceptual contribution offers a speculative account of how AI systems\nmight emulate emotions as experienced by humans and animals. It presents a\nthought experiment grounded in the hypothesis that natural emotions evolved as\nheuristics for rapid situational appraisal and action selection, enabling\nbiologically adaptive behaviour without requiring full deliberative modeling.\nThe text examines whether artificial systems operating in complex action spaces\ncould similarly benefit from these principles. It is proposed that affect be\ninterwoven with episodic memory by storing corresponding affective tags\nalongside all events. This allows AIs to establish whether present situations\nresemble past events and project the associated emotional labels onto the\ncurrent context. These emotional cues are then combined with need-driven\nemotional hints. The combined emotional state facilitates decision-making in\nthe present by modulating action selection. The low complexity and experiential\ninertness of the proposed architecture are emphasized as evidence that\nemotional expression and consciousness are, in principle, orthogonal-permitting\nthe theoretical possibility of affective zombies. On this basis, the moral\nstatus of AIs emulating affective states is critically examined. It is argued\nthat neither the mere presence of internal representations of emotion nor\nconsciousness alone suffices for moral standing; rather, the capacity for\nself-awareness of inner emotional states is posited as a necessary condition. A\ncomplexity-based criterion is proposed to exclude such awareness in the\npresented model. Additional thought experiments are presented to test the\nconceptual boundaries of this framework.",

Our analysis tracks the source transition from hard to soft\nstates in the hardness-intensity diagram.

Given the successful implementation of Control Barrier Function\n(CBF)-based safety strategies in a range of control-affine robotic systems,\nCBF-based safe RL demonstrates significant promise for practical applications\nin real-world scenarios. However, integrating these two approaches presents\nseveral challenges. First, embedding safety optimization within the RL training\npipeline requires that the optimization outputs be differentiable with respect\nto the input parameters, a condition commonly referred to as differentiable\noptimization, which is non-trivial to solve. Second, the differentiable\noptimization framework confronts significant efficiency issues, especially when\ndealing with multi-constraint problems. To address these challenges, this paper\npresents a CBF-based safe RL architecture that effectively mitigates the issues\noutlined above. The proposed approach constructs a continuous AND logic\napproximation for the multiple constraints using a single composite CBF. By\nleveraging this approximation, a close-form solution of the quadratic\nprogramming is derived for the policy network in RL, thereby circumventing the\nneed for differentiable optimization within the end-to-end safe RL pipeline.\nThis strategy significantly reduces computational complexity because of the\nclosed-form solution while maintaining safety guarantees.

Delhi, being one\nof the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues\ndue to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which\nexacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution\nmitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail\nto maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability\nto dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths\nto improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal\nPolicy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,\nto iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple\nspatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic\npatterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is\nbenchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and\ngreedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation\nmetrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic\nimpact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based\napproach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective\ndistribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework\nachieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage\ndeployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions.

The most\nsuitable approach involves the many-body non-equilibrium Green's function\nformalism, which accounts for crucial dynamical many-body correlations during\ntime evolution. While these dynamical correlations are essential for observing\nemergent behavior in time-resolved spectra, they also render the formalism\nprohibitively expensive for large-scale simulations. Substantial effort has\nbeen devoted to reducing this computational cost -- through approximations and\nnumerical techniques -- while preserving the key dynamical correlations. The\nultimate goal is to enable first-principles simulations of time-dependent\nsystems ranging from small molecules to large, periodic, multidimensional\nsolids. In this perspective, we outline key challenges in developing practical\nsimulations for time-resolved spectroscopy, with a particular focus on Green's\nfunction methodologies. We highlight a recent advancement toward a scalable\nframework: the real-time Dyson expansion (RT-DE). We introduce the theoretical\nfoundation of RT-DE and discuss strategies for improving scalability, which\nhave already enabled simulations of system sizes beyond the reach of previous\nfully dynamical approaches. We conclude with an outlook on future directions\nfor extending RT-DE to first-principles studies of dynamically correlated,\nnon-equilibrium systems.",

A prior formal definition of register auditability was\nbased on the values returned by read operations, \\emph{without accounting for\ncases where a reader might learn a value without explicitly reading it or gain\nknowledge of data access without being an auditor}.\n  This paper introduces a refined definition of auditability that focuses on\nwhen a read operation is \\emph{effective}, rather than relying on its\ncompletion and return of a value. Furthermore, we formally specify the\nconstraints that \\textit{prevent readers from learning values they did not\nexplicitly read or from auditing other readers' accesses.}\n  Our primary algorithmic contribution is a wait-free implementation of a\n\\emph{multi-writer, multi-reader register} that tracks effective reads while\npreventing unauthorized audits. The key challenge is ensuring that a read is\nauditable as soon as it becomes effective, which we achieve by combining value\naccess and access logging into a single atomic operation. Another challenge is\nrecording accesses without exposing them to readers, which we address using a\nsimple encryption technique (one-time pad).\n  We extend this implementation to an \\emph{auditable max register} that tracks\nthe largest value ever written. The implementation deals with the additional\nchallenge posed by the max register semantics, which allows readers to learn\nprior values without reading them.\n  The max register, in turn, serves as the foundation for implementing an\n\\emph{auditable snapshot} object and, more generally, \\emph{versioned types}.\nThese extensions maintain the strengthened notion of auditability,\nappropriately adapted from multi-writer, multi-reader registers.",

In this work, we focus on studying and enhancing the math\ncritique ability of LLMs. Current LLM critics provide critiques that are too\nshallow and superficial on each step, leading to low judgment accuracy and\nstruggling to offer sufficient feedback for the LLM generator to correct\nmistakes. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel and effective two-stage\nframework to develop LLM critics that are capable of deliberately critiquing on\neach reasoning step of math solutions. In the first stage, we utilize\nQwen2.5-72B-Instruct to generate 4.5K long-form critiques as seed data for\nsupervised fine-tuning. Each seed critique consists of deliberate step-wise\ncritiques that includes multi-perspective verifications as well as in-depth\ncritiques of initial critiques for each reasoning step. Then, we perform\nreinforcement learning on the fine-tuned model with either existing\nhuman-labeled data from PRM800K or our automatically annotated data obtained\nvia Monte Carlo sampling-based correctness estimation, to further incentivize\nits critique ability.

E.g. they can fail to\ngeneralize to simple reversals of relations they are trained on, or fail to\nmake simple logical deductions based on trained information. These failures to\ngeneralize from fine-tuning can hinder practical application of these models.\nOn the other hand, language models' in-context learning shows different\ninductive biases, and can generalize better in some cases. Here, we explore\nthese differences in generalization between in-context- and fine-tuning-based\nlearning. To do so, we constructed several novel datasets to evaluate and\nimprove models' abilities to generalize from finetuning data. The datasets are\ndesigned to create clean tests of generalization, by isolating the knowledge in\nthe dataset from that in pretraining. We expose pretrained large models to\ncontrolled subsets of the information in these datasets -- either in context,\nor through fine-tuning -- and evaluate their performance on test sets that\nrequire various types of generalization. We find overall that in data-matched\nsettings, in-context learning can generalize more flexibly than fine-tuning\n(though we also find some qualifications of prior findings, such as cases when\nfine-tuning can generalize to reversals embedded in a larger structure of\nknowledge). We build on these findings to propose a method to enable improved\ngeneralization from fine-tuning: adding in-context inferences to finetuning\ndata.

This paper designs well-connected and\nresilient UAV networks by deploying and virtually partitioning multiple RISs to\ncreate multiple RIS-aided links, focusing on a link-layer perspective. The\nRIS-aided links are created to connect user equipment (UE) to blocked and\nreliable UAVs, where multiple UEs can transmit to same UAV via RIS using\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), granting access to UEs and maximizing\nnetwork connectivity. We first derive exact and approximated closed-form\nexpressions for signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) based on aligned\nand non-aligned RIS-aided beams. Then, we propose to formulate the problem of\nmaximizing network connectivity that jointly considers (i) UE NOMA clustering,\n(ii) RIS-aided link selection, and (ii) virtual RIS partitioning. This problem\nis a computationally expensive combinatorial optimization. To tackle this\nproblem, a two-step iterative approach, called RIS-aided NOMA, is proposed. In\nthe first step, the UEs are clustered to the RISs according to their channel\ngains, while UAVs are associated to those generated clusters based on their\nreliability, which measures the criticality of UAVs. The second step optimally\npartitions the RISs to support each of the cluster members. In this step, we\nderive the closed-form equations for the optimal partitioning of RISs within\nthe clusters.

Some studies\nhave found that resistant populations exhibit distinct predation and foraging\nbehaviour compared to susceptible ones. This study models the population\ndynamics of resistant and susceptible $\\textit{E. connexa}$ preying on\n$\\textit{Aphis gossypii}$ Glover, 1877 and $\\textit{Myzus persicae}$ (Sulzer,\n1776). We constructed a logistic model with density dependence and type-II\nfunctional response to analyse predation dynamics, incorporating bifurcation\nanalysis on predation parameters (attack rate and handling time) and the\nmortality rate of susceptible ladybirds. We simulated scenarios with/without\ninsecticide application and with/without aphid resistance. To simulate the\neffects of insecticide applications, the parameters related to aphids'\nintrinsic growth rate ($r_1$ and $r_2$) change to reflect the responses of\nsusceptible and resistant populations. The same approach is used concerning the\nmortality rate of ladybirds ($d_2$ and $d_3$). Our results demonstrate that\nmortality, attack rate, and handling time are critical in shaping predator-prey\ninteractions. Temporal simulations revealed fluctuating abundances,\nhighlighting the fragility of these interactions under insecticide stress.\nTherefore, this study contributes to understanding the ecological implications\nof insecticides, which disrupt natural predation dynamics, and shows how\nvariations in behavioural rates can impact prey control.

RT imaging\nenables free-breathing, ungated imaging of cardiac motion, making it a crucial\nalternative for patients who cannot tolerate conventional breath-hold,\nECG-gated acquisitions. However, achieving high acceleration rates in RT cine\nMRI is challenging due to aliasing artifacts from extra-cardiac tissues,\nparticularly at high undersampling factors.

A deep learning (DL)\nmodel is trained to identify and remove these artifacts, producing a clean\nouter volume estimate that is subsequently subtracted from the corresponding\nk-space data. The final reconstruction is performed with a physics-driven DL\n(PD-DL) method trained using an OVR-specific loss function to restore high\nspatio-temporal resolution images. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod at high accelerations achieves image quality that is visually comparable\nto clinical baseline images, while outperforming conventional reconstruction\ntechniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

    "abstract": "As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems,\nverification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research\ndomain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon\nthis technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our\napplication comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively\ntransported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution\nmonitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding\ndrones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose\na new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network\ncontrollers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show\nthat our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition\nbenchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying\nsuch systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose\na novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate\nformalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results\nsuggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and\nrobustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited\nin scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle\nand CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability,\nwhich we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will\nenable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's\nlives and reduce our impact on the environment.",

However, existing methods only synthesize\naffine loops without guard conditions from polynomial invariants. In this\npaper, we address a more general problem, allowing loops to have polynomial\nupdate maps with a given structure, inequations in the guard condition, and\npolynomial invariants of arbitrary form.\n  In this paper, we use algebraic geometry tools to design and implement an\nalgorithm that computes a finite set of polynomial equations whose solutions\ncorrespond to all loops satisfying the given polynomial invariants. In other\nwords, we reduce the problem of synthesizing loops to finding solutions of\npolynomial systems within a specified subset of the complex numbers.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Diverse Semantics-guided Feature Alignment and\nDecoupling (DSFAD) network to align identity-relevant features from different\nmodalities into a textual embedding space and disentangle identity-irrelevant\nfeatures within each modality. Specifically, we develop a Diverse\nSemantics-guided Feature Alignment (DSFA) module, which generates pedestrian\ndescriptions with diverse sentence structures to guide the cross-modality\nalignment of visual features. Furthermore, to filter out style information, we\npropose a Semantic Margin-guided Feature Decoupling (SMFD) module, which\ndecomposes visual features into pedestrian-related and style-related\ncomponents, and then constrains the similarity between the former and the\ntextual embeddings to be at least a margin higher than that between the latter\nand the textual embeddings. Additionally, to prevent the loss of pedestrian\nsemantics during feature decoupling, we design a Semantic Consistency-guided\nFeature Restitution (SCFR) module, which further excavates useful information\nfor identification from the style-related features and restores it back into\nthe pedestrian-related features, and then constrains the similarity between the\nfeatures after restitution and the textual embeddings to be consistent with\nthat between the features before decoupling and the textual embeddings.\nExtensive experiments on three VI-ReID datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nour DSFAD.",

Although\nmost existing AO systems employ this methodology, the literature on atmospheric\nturbulence correction and AO system design generally focuses on performance at\na single wavelength, neglecting the two-wavelength nature of the problem. In\nthis paper, we undertake a rigorous study of the relevant wavefront errors\nnecessary to quantify two-wavelength AO system performance.\n  Since most AO systems employ separate tilt and higher-order correcting\nsubsystems, our analysis mirrors this division, and we begin with higher-order\nwavefront errors. Utilizing Mellin transform techniques, we derive closed-form\nrelations for the piston-removed and piston- and tilt-removed variances. The\nformer is a measure of the total, residual wavefront error that a\ntwo-wavelength AO systems experiences; while the latter, quantifies the\nresidual wavefront error due to higher-order aberrations.\n  We then proceed to tilt or tracking errors and derive the two-wavelength\nZernike- and gradient-tilt variances. Zernike tilt is the actual amount of tilt\nin the turbulent atmosphere; yet, most AO tracking subsystems measure gradient\ntilt. Consequently, we also derive the two-wavelength gradient-tilt,\nZernike-tilt variance -- also known as centroid anisoplanatism -- to quantify\nthis error.\n  Lastly, we validate our analysis by performing two-wavelength wave-optics\nsimulations and comparing the results to theory.

This conventional approach reduces the\nconstraining power of our observations. Here, we show that this does not have\nto be the case, provided the physics behind the dispersion is understood. We\ndemonstrate that by splitting the halo/galaxy samples according to their\ndensity environments and measuring the streaming velocities separately, the\ntotal signal-to-noise is several times greater than in conventional global\nmeasurements of the pairwise velocity distribution (PVD). This improvement\narises because the global PVD is a composite of a series of near-Gaussian\ndistributions with different means and dispersions, each determined by its\nlocal density environment. Around underdense and overdense regions, the mean\nstreaming velocities are positive and negative, respectively. By splitting the\ndata, we avoid cancellation between these opposing velocities, effectively\nturning what would be considered dispersion in the global PVD into a signal.\nOur findings indicate substantial potential for improving the analysis of PVD\nobservations using the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and redshift-space\ndistortions.",

    "abstract": "The development of Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN), with their\ndisaggregated architectures and virtualization of network functions, has\nbrought considerable flexibility and cost savings to mobile networks. However,\nthese architectural advancements introduce additional latency during the\ninitial attachment procedure of User Equipment (UE), increasing the risk of\nsignaling storms. This paper investigates the latency impact due to\ndisaggregation of the Base-band Unit (BBU) into the Central Unit (CU) and\nDistributed Unit (DU). Specifically, we model the delays induced due to\ndisaggregation on UE attachment, analyzing the performance under varying load\nconditions, and sensitivity to processing times. We demonstrate that while both\nmonolithic and Open RAN architectures experience performance degradation under\nhigh-load conditions, Open RAN's added overheads can increase its\nsusceptibility to congestion and signaling storms. However, Open RAN's inherent\nflexibility, enabled by disaggregation and virtualization, allows efficient\ndeployment of resources, faster service deployment, and adaptive congestion\ncontrol mechanisms to mitigate these risks and enhance overall system\nresilience. Thereby, we quantify resilience by introducing a new utility\nfunction and propose a novel adaptation mechanism to reinforce Open RAN's\nrobustness against signaling storms. Our results show that the proposed\nadaptive mechanism significantly enhances resilience, achieving improvements of\nup to 286% over fixed configurations, with resilience scores approaching 0.96\nunder optimal conditions. While simulation results show that Open RAN\ndisaggregation increases attachment latency and susceptibility to signaling\ncongestion, they also highlight that its architectural flexibility can mitigate\nthese effects, improving resilience under high-load conditions.",

Machine learning (ML) methods play an important role in\naccelerating electronic structure predictions of activation energies and\nreaction enthalpies, and are a crucial ingredient to enable large-scale\nautomated reaction network discovery with $>10^3$ reactions. Unfortunately, the\npredictive accuracy of existing ML models does not yet reach the required\naccuracy across the space of possible chemical reactions to enable subsequent\nkinetic simulations that even qualitatively agree with experimental kinetics.\nHere, we comprehensively assess the underlying reasons for prediction failures\nwithin a selection of machine-learned models of reactivity. Models based on\ndifference fingerprints between reactant and product structures lack\ntransferability despite providing good in-distribution predictions. This\nresults in a significant loss of information about the context and mechanism of\nchemical reactions. We propose a convolutional ML model that uses atom-centered\nquantum-chemical descriptors and approximate transition state information.\nInclusion of the latter improves transferability for out-of-distribution\nbenchmark reactions, making greater use of the limited chemical reaction space\nspanned by the training data.

Using a novel experimental design involving source to target\nmatching, we find that GPT4 achieves high recall by retrieving all plausible\nanalogies but suffers from low precision, frequently applying incorrect\nanalogies based on superficial similarities. In contrast, human participants\nexhibit high precision but low recall, selecting fewer analogies yet with\nstronger causal alignment. These findings advance theory by identifying\nmatching, the evaluative phase of analogical reasoning, as a distinct step that\nrequires accurate causal mapping beyond simple retrieval.

However, in practice, we frequently encounter irregular\nmultivariate time series characterized by variable sampling intervals and\nmissing values.

In this work, we propose ParkDiffusion, a\nnovel approach that predicts the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians\nin automated parking scenarios. ParkDiffusion employs diffusion models to\ncapture the inherent uncertainty and multi-modality of future trajectories,\nincorporating several key innovations. First, we propose a dual map encoder\nthat processes soft semantic cues and hard geometric constraints using a\ntwo-step cross-attention mechanism. Second, we introduce an adaptive agent type\nembedding module, which dynamically conditions the prediction process on the\ndistinct characteristics of vehicles and pedestrians. Third, to ensure\nkinematic feasibility, our model outputs control signals that are subsequently\nused within a kinematic framework to generate physically feasible trajectories.\nWe evaluate ParkDiffusion on the Dragon Lake Parking (DLP) dataset and the\nIntersections Drone (inD) dataset.

The latter is strongly\naffected by surface active agents that are present in many applications.\nSurfactants lead to local changes in the interfacial tension, which influence\nthe mass transfer rates in two different ways. On the one hand, inhomogeneous\ninterfacial tension leads to Marangoni stress, which can strongly change the\nlocal hydrodynamics. One the other hand, the coverage by surfactant molecules\nresults in a mass transfer resistance. This hindrance effect is not included in\ncurrent continuum physical models. The present work provides the experimental\nvalidation of a recently introduced extended sharp-interface model for\ntwo-phase flows with mass transfer that also accounts for the mass transfer\nhindrance due to adsorbed surfactant. The crucial feature is to account for\narea-specific concentrations not only of adsorbed constituents but also of\ntransfer species, and to model mass transfer as a series of two bi-directional\nsorption-type bulk-interface exchange processes.

    "abstract": "Obtaining accurate transition state (TS) energies is a bottleneck in\ncomputational screening of complex materials and reaction networks due to the\nhigh cost of TS search methods and first-principles methods such as density\nfunctional theory (DFT). Here we propose a machine learning (ML) model for\npredicting TS energies based on Gaussian process regression with the\nWasserstein Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WWL-GPR). Applying the model to\npredict adsorption and TS energies for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS)\nreaction on single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts, we show that it can\nsignificantly improve the accuracy compared to traditional approaches based on\nscaling relations or ML models without a graph representation. Further\nbenefitting from the low cost of model training, we train an ensemble of\nWWL-GPR models to obtain uncertainties through subsampling of the training data\nand show how these uncertainties propagate to turnover frequency (TOF)\npredictions through the construction of an ensemble of microkinetic models.\nComparing the errors in model-based vs DFT-based TOF predictions, we show that\nthe WWL-GPR model reduces errors by almost an order of magnitude compared to\nscaling relations. This demonstrates the critical impact of accurate energy\npredictions on catalytic activity estimation. Finally, we apply our model to\nscreen new materials, identifying promising catalysts for RWGS. This work\nhighlights the power of combining advanced ML techniques with DFT and\nmicrokinetic modeling for screening catalysts for complex reactions like RWGS,\nproviding a robust framework for future catalyst design.",

Methods: This study implemented a\nthree-step process: (1) Data searching for mTBI-related genes in Gene and\nMalaCard databases and literature review ; (2) Data analysis involved\nperforming functional annotation through GO and KEGG, identifying hub genes\nusing Cytoscape, mapping protein-protein interactions via DAVID and STRING, and\npredicting miRNA targets using miRSystem, miRWalk2.0, and mirDIP (3)\nRNA-sequencing analysis applied to the mTBI dataset GSE123336. Results: Eleven\ncandidate hub genes associated with mTBI outcome were identified: APOE, S100B,\nGFAP, BDNF, AQP4, COMT, MBP, UCHL1, DRD2, ASIC1, and CACNA1A. Enrichment\nanalysis linked these genes to neuron projection regeneration and synaptic\nplasticity. miRNAs linked to the mTBI candidate genes were hsa-miR-9-5p,\nhsa-miR-204-5p, hsa-miR-1908-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-10a-5p, has-miR-218-5p,\nhas-miR-34a-5p, and has-miR-199b-5p. The RNA sequencing revealed 2664\ndifferentially expressed miRNAs post-mTBI, with 17 showing significant changes\nat the time of injury and 48 hours post-injury. Two miRNAs were positively\ncorrelated with direct head hits. Conclusion: Our study indicates that specific\ngenes and miRNAs, particularly hsa-miR-10a-5p, may influence mTBI outcomes.

    "abstract": "Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) constitutes the first line of\ninvestigation for clinicians in the care of brain tumors, providing crucial\ninsights for surgery planning, treatment monitoring, and biomarker\nidentification. Pre-training on large datasets have been shown to help models\nlearn transferable representations and adapt with minimal labeled data. This\nbehavior is especially valuable in medical imaging, where annotations are often\nscarce. However, applying this paradigm to multimodal medical data introduces a\nchallenge: most existing approaches assume that all imaging modalities are\navailable during both pre-training and fine-tuning. In practice, missing\nmodalities often occur due to acquisition issues, specialist unavailability, or\nspecific experimental designs on small in-house datasets. Consequently, a\ncommon approach involves training a separate model for each desired modality\ncombination, making the process both resource-intensive and impractical for\nclinical use. Therefore, we introduce BM-MAE, a masked image modeling\npre-training strategy tailored for multimodal MRI data. The same pre-trained\nmodel seamlessly adapts to any combination of available modalities, extracting\nrich representations that capture both intra- and inter-modal information. This\nallows fine-tuning on any subset of modalities without requiring architectural\nchanges, while still benefiting from a model pre-trained on the full set of\nmodalities. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pre-training strategy\noutperforms or remains competitive with baselines that require separate\npre-training for each modality subset, while substantially surpassing training\nfrom scratch on several downstream tasks. Additionally, it can quickly and\nefficiently reconstruct missing modalities, highlighting its practical value.\nCode and trained models are available at: https://github.com/Lucas-rbnt/BM-MAE",

    "abstract": "The information bottleneck channel, also known as oblivious relaying, is a\ntwo-hop channel where a transmitter sends messages to a remote receiver via an\nintermediate relay node. A codeword sent by the transmitter passes through a\ndiscrete memoryless channel to reach the relay, and then the relay processes\nthe noisy channel output and forwards it to the receiver through a noiseless\nrate-limited link. The relay is oblivious, in the sense that it has no\nknowledge of the channel codebook used in transmission. Past works on oblivious\nrelaying are focused on characterizing achievable rates. In this work, we study\nerror exponents and explore connections to loseless source coding with a\nhelper, also known as the Wyner-Ahlswede-K\\\"orner (WAK) problem. We first\nestablish an achievable error exponent for oblivious relaying under constant\ncompositions codes. A key feature of our analysis is the use of the type\ncovering lemma to design the relay's compress-forward scheme. We then show that\nemploying constant composition code ensembles does not improve the rates\nachieved with their IID counterparts. We also derive a sphere packing upper\nbound for the error exponent. In the second part of this paper, we establish a\nconnection between the information bottleneck channel and the WAK problem. We\nshow that good codes for the latter can be produced through permuting codes\ndesigned for the former. This is accomplished by revisiting Ahlswede's covering\nlemma, and extending it to achieve simultaneous covering of a type class by\nseveral distinct sets using the same sequence of permutations. We then apply\nour approach to attain the best known achievable error exponent for the WAK\nproblem, previously established by Kelly and Wagner. As a byproduct of our\nderivations, we also establish error exponents and achievable rates under\nmismatched decoding rules.",

It is well known that the hBN mass\nterm breaks the $C_{2}$ symmetry of tBLG and gaps out the Dirac cones inducing\na valley Hall insulating phase. However, when NR hopping is introduced, this\nsystem transits into a NH valley Hall insulator (NH-VHI). Our analysis reveals\nthat, in the chiral limit, the bandwidth of the system vanishes under NH\neffects for a wide range of twist angles. Such range can be visibly expanded as\nwe enhance the degree of non-Hermiticity $(\\beta)$. At the magic angle, we\nobserve that enhancement of $\\beta$ inflates the robustness of the gapless\nDirac points, requiring a progressively larger mass term to induce a gap in the\nNH tBLG system. Additionally, for a fixed NH parameter, we identify a range of\ntwist angles where gap formation is significantly obstructed.

Our experiments on two large datasets and three recommendation\nmodels demonstrate the efficiency achievable using RecJPQPrune: for instance,\non the Tmall dataset with 2.2M items, we can reduce the median model scoring\ntime by 64 times compared to the Transformer Default baseline, and 5.3 times\ncompared to a recent scoring approach called PQTopK. Overall, this paper\ndemonstrates the effective and efficient inference of Transformer-based\nrecommendation models at catalogue scales not previously reported in the\nliterature. Indeed, our RecJPQPrune algorithm can score 2 million items in\nunder 10 milliseconds without GPUs, and without relying on Approximate Nearest\nNeighbour (ANN) techniques.",

In original OHT, one is\ngiven a list of sequences, most of which are generated i.i.d. from a\ndistribution called the nominal distribution while the rest are generated\ni.i.d. from another distribution named the anomalous distribution. The task of\nOHT is to identify outliers when both the nominal and anomalous distributions\nare unknown. Motivated by the study for classification with distribution\nuncertainty by Hsu and Wang (ISIT 2020), we consider OHT with distribution\nuncertainty, where each nominal sample is generated from a distribution\ncentered around the unknown nominal distribution and each outlier is generated\nfrom a distribution centered around the unknown anomalous distribution. With a\nfurther step towards practical applications, in the spirit of Bu et al. (TSP\n2019), we propose low-complexity tests when the number of outliers is known and\nunknown, and show that our proposed tests are exponentially consistent.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that there is a penalty for not knowing the number\nof outliers in the error exponent when outliers exist. Our results strengthen\nBu et al. in three aspects: i) our tests allow distribution uncertainty and\nreveal the impact of distribution uncertainty on the performance of\nlow-complexity tests; ii) when the number of outliers is known and there is no\ndistribution uncertainty, our test achieves the same asymptotic performance\nwith lower complexity; and iii) when the number of outliers is unknown, we\ncharacterize the tradeoff among the three error probabilities, while two of\nthese error probabilities were not analyzed by Bu et al. even when there is no\ndistribution uncertainty.

In this study, we propose a prompt-based framework to\nsystematically trigger and quantify hallucination: a Hallucination-Inducing\nPrompt (HIP), which synthetically fuses semantically distant concepts (e.g.,\nperiodic table of elements and tarot divination) in a misleading way, and a\nHallucination Quantifying Prompt (HQP), which scores the plausibility,\nconfidence, and coherence of the output. Controlled experiments across multiple\nLLMs revealed that HIPs consistently produced less coherent and more\nhallucinated responses than their null-fusion controls. These effects varied\nacross models, with reasoning-oriented LLMs showing distinct profiles from\ngeneral-purpose ones.

The current\ninvestigation brings forth two key enhancements, compared to previous works on\nthe topic. On the one side, we model blood flow through the Navier-Stokes\nequations, hence accounting for convection. In this regard, we implement a\nhyper-reduction scheme, based on approximate space-time reduced affine\ndecompositions, to deal with nonlinearities effectively. On the other side, we\nmove beyond the constraint of modelling blood vessels as rigid structures,\nacknowledging the importance of elasticity for the accurate simulation of\ncomplex blood flow patterns. To limit computational complexity, we adopt the\nCoupled Momentum model, incorporating the effect of wall compliance in the\nfluid's equations through a generalized Robin boundary condition. In\nparticular, we propose an efficient strategy for handling the spatio-temporal\nprojection of the structural displacement, which ultimately configures as a\nby-product.

To address this key limitation of explainability we introduce\nKnowEEG; a novel explainable machine learning approach for EEG classification.\nKnowEEG extracts a comprehensive set of per-electrode features, filters them\nusing statistical tests, and integrates between-electrode connectivity\nstatistics. These features are then input to our modified Random Forest model\n(Fusion Forest) that balances per electrode statistics with between electrode\nconnectivity features in growing the trees of the forest. By incorporating\nknowledge from both the generalized time-series and EEG-specific domains,\nKnowEEG achieves performance comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art deep\nlearning models across five different classification tasks: emotion detection,\nmental workload classification, eyes open/closed detection, abnormal EEG\nclassification, and event detection. In addition to high performance, KnowEEG\nprovides inherent explainability through feature importance scores for\nunderstandable features. We demonstrate by example on the eyes closed/open\nclassification task that this explainability can be used to discover knowledge\nabout the classes. This discovered knowledge for eyes open/closed\nclassification was proven to be correct by current neuroscience literature.\nTherefore, the impact of KnowEEG will be significant for domains where EEG\nexplainability is critical such as healthcare.",

We assess the performance of\nthese QMF models in describing the mass-radius relation, the cooling evolution\nof isolated NSs and X-ray transients, and the instabilities (e.g., the r-mode).\nIn comparison to relativistic mean field (RMF) models formulated at the\nhadronic level, the QMF model predicts heavier nuclear clusters and larger\nWigner-Seitz cell sizes in the NS crust, while the density of the free neutron\ngas remains largely similar between the two approaches. For the cooling of\nisolated NSs, the thermal evolution is found to be insensitive to both the\nmany-body model and the symmetry energy slope in the absence of the direct Urca\n(dUrca) process. However, when rapid cooling via the dUrca process is allowed,\nin the case of large $L_0$ values (e.g., $L_0 \\gtrsim 80$ MeV) in our study,\nthe QMF model predicts a longer thermal relaxation time. Both the QMF and RMF\nmodels can reproduce cooling curves consistent with observations of X-ray\ntransients (e.g., KS 1731--260) during their crustal cooling phase, although\nstellar parameters show slight variations depending on the model and symmetry\nenergy slope. Within our unified framework, a larger $L_0$ value generally\nresults in a wider instability window, while increasing the stellar mass tends\nto suppress the instability window. We also provide simple power-law\nparameterizations that quantify the dependence of bulk and shear viscosities on\nthe symmetry energy slope for nuclear matter at saturation density.",

    "abstract": "SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug\ndiscovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM)\nhas been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high\nmatching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a\ncritical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL\nphase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\\%\nduring pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied\nin drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian\npretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To\naddress these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a\nnovel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to\nprevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike\ntraditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after\ngenerating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each\nauto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also\nall potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables\nearly detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a\nresult, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive\nexploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of\ninvalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and\noptimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining\nvalidity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to\nincorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing\nreinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Black hole normal modes have intriguing connections to logarithmic spectra,\nand the spectral form factor (SFF) of $E_n = \\log n$ is the mod square of the\nRiemann zeta function (RZF). In this paper, we first provide an analytic\nunderstanding of the dip-ramp-plateau structure of RZF and show that the ramp\nat $\\beta \\equiv \\Re(s)=0$ has a slope precisely equal to 1. The $s=1$ pole of\nRZF can be viewed as due to a Hagedorn transition in this setting, and\nRiemann's analytic continuation to $\\Re(s)< 1$ provides the quantum\ncontribution to the truncated $\\log n$ partition function. This perspective\nyields a precise definition of RZF as the ''full ramp after removal of the\ndip'', and allows an unambiguous determination of the Thouless time. For black\nhole microstates, the Thouless time is expected to be\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$--remarkably, the RZF also exhibits this behavior. To our\nknowledge, this is the first black hole-inspired toy model that has a\ndemonstrably $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ Thouless time. In contrast, it is\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ in the SYK model and expected to be $\\mathcal{O}(N^{\\#})$\nin supergravity fuzzballs. We trace the origins of the ramp to a certain\nreflection property of the functional equation satisfied by RZF, and suggest\nthat it is a general feature of $L$-functions--we find evidence for ramps in\nlarge classes of $L$-functions.

To\naddress this, we propose DeCo (Task Decomposition and Skill Composition), a\nmodel-agnostic framework compatible with various multi-task IL models, designed\nto enhance their zero-shot generalization to novel, compositional, long-horizon\n3D manipulation tasks. DeCo first decomposes IL demonstrations into a set of\nmodular atomic tasks based on the physical interaction between the gripper and\nobjects, and constructs an atomic training dataset that enables models to learn\na diverse set of reusable atomic skills during imitation learning. At inference\ntime, DeCo leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to parse high-level\ninstructions for novel long-horizon tasks, retrieve the relevant atomic skills,\nand dynamically schedule their execution; a spatially-aware skill-chaining\nmodule then ensures smooth, collision-free transitions between sequential\nskills. We evaluate DeCo in simulation using DeCoBench, a benchmark\nspecifically designed to assess zero-shot generalization of multi-task IL\nmodels in compositional long-horizon 3D manipulation. Across three\nrepresentative multi-task IL models (RVT-2, 3DDA, and ARP), DeCo achieves\nsuccess rate improvements of 66.67%, 21.53%, and 57.92%, respectively, on 12\nnovel compositional tasks. Moreover, in real-world experiments, a DeCo-enhanced\nmodel trained on only 6 atomic tasks successfully completes 9 novel\nlong-horizon tasks, yielding an average success rate improvement of 53.33% over\nthe base multi-task IL model.

The main idea is to prove\nthe undecidability of various fragments of classical and non-classical\nfirst-order logics and theories indirectly, by extracting it as a consequence\nof the recursive inseparability of special problems associated with them.\nFirst, we propose a domino problem, which makes it possible to catch the\nrecursive inseparability of two sets. Second, using this problem, we prove that\nthe classical first-order logic of a binary predicate and the theory of its\nfinite models where the predicate is symmetric and irreflexive are recursively\ninseparable in a language with a single binary predicate letter and three\nvariables (without constants and equality). Third, we prove, for an infinite\nclass of logics, that the monadic fragment of a modal predicate logic and the\nlogic of the class of its finite Kripke frames are recursively inseparable in\nlanguages with a single unary predicate letter and two individual variables;\nthe same result is obtained if we replace the condition of finiteness of frames\nwith the condition of finiteness of domains allowed in frames. Forth, we expand\nthe results to a wide class of superintuitionistic predicate logics. In\nparticular, it is proved that the positive fragments of the intuitionistic\npredicate logic and the logic of the class of finite intuitionistic Kripke\nframes are recursively inseparable in the language with a single unary\npredicate letter and two individual variables.

Very recently,\nGuenancia and Hamenst\\\"{a}dt (GH) proved the existence of the first examples of\nmanifolds that are not locally symmetric but admit a negatively curved\nK\\\"{a}hler-Einstein metric. The GH metrics are realized on complex hyperbolic\nbranched covers constructed by Stover and Toledo. In this article we generalize\nthe construction of FP to the complex hyperbolic setting and show that this\nyields a negatively curved Einstein metric that asymptotically approaches the\nmetric of GH.",

    "abstract": "Safety-critical traffic simulation plays a crucial role in evaluating\nautonomous driving systems under rare and challenging scenarios. However,\nexisting approaches often generate unrealistic scenarios due to insufficient\nconsideration of physical plausibility and suffer from low generation\nefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a guided latent diffusion\nmodel (LDM) capable of generating physically realistic and adversarial\nsafety-critical traffic scenarios. Specifically, our model employs a\ngraph-based variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact latent space that\ncaptures complex multi-agent interactions while improving computational\nefficiency. Within this latent space, the diffusion model performs the\ndenoising process to produce realistic trajectories. To enable controllable and\nadversarial scenario generation, we introduce novel guidance objectives that\ndrive the diffusion process toward producing adversarial and behaviorally\nrealistic driving behaviors. Furthermore, we develop a sample selection module\nbased on physical feasibility checks to further enhance the physical\nplausibility of the generated scenarios. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes\ndataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior adversarial effectiveness\nand generation efficiency compared to existing baselines while maintaining a\nhigh level of realism. Our work provides an effective tool for realistic\nsafety-critical scenario simulation, paving the way for more robust evaluation\nof autonomous driving systems.",

All\nof the evidence collected so far has been based on the changes of the THz\nfrequency $c$-axis response. In these measurements, the capacitive interlayer\ncoupling was seen to transform into a superconducting-like inductive response.\nThis assignment was strengthened by recent measurements of ultrafast magnetic\nfield expulsion. Here, we report the first experimental determination of the\ntransient in-plane optical properties, which has so far been elusive due to the\nhigh equilibrium reflectivity and the need to evaluate minute changes in the\noptical response. We report the appearance of a photo-induced in-plane optical\ngap $2\\Delta\\simeq30$ cm$^{-1}$ and a divergent imaginary conductivity, both\nconsistent with photo-induced superconductivity. A global fit to these data\nsuggests that in- and out-of-plane electronic properties never completely\nequilibrate during the dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Online localization of road intersections is beneficial for autonomous\nvehicle localization, mapping and motion planning. Intersections offer strong\nlandmarks for correcting vehicle pose estimation, anchoring new sensor data in\nup-to-date maps, and guiding vehicle routing in road network graphs. Despite\nthis importance, intersection localization has not been widely studied, with\nexisting methods either ignoring the rich semantic information already computed\nonboard or relying on scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close this\ngap, we present a novel LiDAR-based method for online vehicle-centric\nintersection localization. We detect the intersection candidates in a bird's\neye view (BEV) representation formed by concatenating a sequence of semantic\nroad scans. We then refine these candidates by analyzing the intersecting road\nbranches and adjusting the intersection center point in a least-squares\nformulation. For evaluation, we introduce an automated pipeline that pairs\nlocalized intersection points with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using\nprecise GNSS/INS ground-truth poses. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset\nshow that our method outperforms the latest learning-based baseline in accuracy\nand reliability.

This was known when $G$ is reductive or when $k$ is perfect, and to\nsettle it in general we uncover a wealth of new arithmetic phenomena over\nimperfect $k$. We build our arguments on new purity theorems for torsors under\npseudo-complete, pseudo-proper, and pseudo-finite $k$-groups, for instance,\nrespectively, under wound unipotent $k$-groups, under pseudo-abelian varieties,\nand under the kernels $\\mathrm{Ker}(i_G)$ of comparison maps $i_G$ that relate\npseudo-reductive groups to restrictions of scalars of reductive groups.

While automated nuclear weapons launch systems\nmay seem like something out of science fiction, the Soviet Union deployed such\na system during the Cold War and the technology necessary to automate the use\nof force has developed considerably in recent years due to advances in AI.\nPreregistered survey experiments on an elite sample of United Kingdom Members\nof Parliament and two public samples of UK citizens provide support for these\nexpectations, showing that, in a limited set of circumstances, nuclear threats\nbacked by AI integration have credibility advantages, no matter how dangerous\nthey may be. Our findings contribute to the literatures on coercive bargaining,\nweapons of mass destruction, and emerging technology.",

Classically the particle moves away acceleratingly from the center of\npotential top. The existing eigenstates must be unstable with imaginary\neigenvalues, which characterize the decay rate of states. We solve the\nHamiltonian problem of inverted potential well by the algebraic method with\nimaginary-frequency raising and lowering boson operators similar to the normal\noscillator case. The boson number operator is non-Hermitian, while the\ninteger-number eigenvalues are, of course, real. Dual sets of eigenstates,\ndenoted by \"bra\" and \"ket\", are requested corresponding respectively to the\ncomplex conjugate number-operators. Orthonormal condition exists between the\n\"bra\" and \"ket\" states. We derive a spatially non-localized generating\nfunction, from which $n$-th eigenfunctions can be generated by the raising\noperators in coordinate representation. The \"bra\" and \"ket\" generating\nfunctions are mutually normalized with the imaginary integration measure. The\nprobability density operators defined between the \"bra\" and \"ket\" states are\nnon-Hermitian invariants, which lead to the Schr\\H{o}dinger equations\nrespectively for the \"bra\" and \"ket\" states. While probabilities of \"bra\" and\n\"ket\" states themselves are not conserved quantities because of the decay. The\nimaginary-frequency boson coherent states are defined as eigenstates of\nlowering operators. The minimum uncertainty relation is proved explicitly in\nthe coherent states.

Conventional thermal comfort models, such\nas the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal\nvariables.

To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV\nestimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed\nusing the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm.

The Gappy POD method enables fast and\naccurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor\nmeasurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data,\nspatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions\nare then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control\nindoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental\nresults show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error\nbelow 3\\% in temperature reconstruction.

    "abstract": "Windows operating systems (OS) are ubiquitous in enterprise Information\nTechnology (IT) and operational technology (OT) environments. Due to their\nwidespread adoption and known vulnerabilities, they are often the primary\ntargets of malware and ransomware attacks. With 93% of the ransomware targeting\nWindows-based systems, there is an urgent need for advanced defensive\nmechanisms to detect, analyze, and mitigate threats effectively. In this paper,\nwe propose HoneyWin a high-interaction Windows honeypot that mimics an\nenterprise IT environment. The HoneyWin consists of three Windows 11 endpoints\nand an enterprise-grade gateway provisioned with comprehensive network traffic\ncapturing, host-based logging, deceptive tokens, endpoint security and\nreal-time alerts capabilities. The HoneyWin has been deployed live in the wild\nfor 34 days and receives more than 5.79 million unsolicited connections, 1.24\nmillion login attempts, 5 and 354 successful logins via remote desktop protocol\n(RDP) and secure shell (SSH) respectively. The adversary interacted with the\ndeceptive token in one of the RDP sessions and exploited the public-facing\nendpoint to initiate the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) brute-force bot\nattack via SSH sessions. The adversary successfully harvested 1,250 SMTP\ncredentials after attempting 151,179 credentials during the attack.",

Experimentally, we develop\nstable self-charged perovskite quantum rods (QRs) as an alternative to QDs via\nstate engineering and Mn-doping strategy. An unprecedented\ntwo-order-of-magnitude reduction in nonradiative Auger recombination enables\nQRs to support a sufficient charging number of up to 6. The QR liquid lasing is\nthen achieved with a near-zero threshold of 0.098 using quasi-continuous\npumping of nanosecond pulses, which is the lowest threshold among all reported\nQD lasers.

As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of\nhigh-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion.

The\nusability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL)\nframework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive\nreduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven\n(ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN.\nFurthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models,\nhighlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.",

In\nantiferromagnets (AFMs), where the fundamental quantum mechanical exchange\ninteraction governs spin dynamics, this access is especially compelling,\nenabling the excitation of magnons - collective spin-wave modes - that\nnaturally reach terahertz (THz) frequencies and supersonic velocities.\nFemtosecond optical pulses provided a route to coherently excite such magnons\nacross the entire Brillouin zone. Controlling their spectral properties - such\nas the magnon gap and dispersion - represents the next monumental step,\nenabling dynamic tuning of group velocities, coherence, and interaction\npathways.

By integrating\nspatial clustering of 1,701 dairy farms and processors, a quasi-experimental\ndesign with paired non-dairy reference regions, and seasonal pattern\ndecomposition, we analyzed national and regional spatiotemporal emission\ntrends. Results show persistently higher methane levels in dairy regions (mean\ndifference: 16.99 ppb), with consistent fall-winter peaks. Notably, the\ndairy-specific methane anomaly, defined as the concentration difference between\ndairy and non-dairy regions declined by 62.25% from 2019 to 2024, with a sharp\ndrop during 2022-2023 (-41.11%). Meanwhile, national methane levels rose by\n3.83%, with increasing spatial heterogeneity across provinces. An inverse\nrelationship between baseline methane levels and growth rates suggests a\nconvergence effect. Seasonal analysis revealed universal spring minima and\nfall-winter maxima, offering distinct temporal signatures for source\nattribution. This study demonstrates the value of satellite-based monitoring\nfor policy-relevant methane assessments and introduces a scalable framework\napplicable to other regions. The observed narrowing of dairy methane anomaly\nindicates evolving emission dynamics, potentially reflecting rising baseline\nmethane rather than a definitive reduction in dairy source emissions.

The memory system, consisting of\nmultiple technologies at different levels, is responsible for most of the\nenergy consumption, performance bottlenecks, robustness problems, monetary\ncost, and hardware real estate of a modern computing system. All this becomes\nworse as modern and emerging applications become more data-intensive (as we\nreadily witness in e.g., machine learning, genome analysis, graph processing,\nand data analytics), making the memory system an even larger bottleneck. In\nthis paper, we discuss two major challenges that greatly affect computing\nsystem performance and efficiency: 1) memory technology & capacity scaling (at\nthe lower device and circuit levels) and 2) system and application performance\n& energy scaling (at the higher levels of the computing stack). We demonstrate\nthat both types of scaling have become extremely difficult, wasteful, and\ncostly due to the dominant processor-centric design & execution paradigm of\ncomputers, which treats memory as a dumb and inactive component that cannot\nperform any computation. We show that moving to a memory-centric design &\nexecution paradigm can solve the major challenges, while enabling multiple\nother potential benefits. In particular, we demonstrate that: 1) memory\ntechnology scaling problems (e.g., RowHammer, RowPress, Variable Read\nDisturbance, data retention, and other issues awaiting to be discovered) can be\nmuch more easily and efficiently handled by enabling memory to autonomously\nmanage itself; 2) system and application performance & energy efficiency can,\nat the same time, be improved by orders of magnitude by enabling computation\ncapability in memory chips and structures (i.e., processing in memory).

    "abstract": "The problem of calibration from straight lines is fundamental in geometric\ncomputer vision, with well-established theoretical foundations. However, its\npractical applicability remains limited, particularly in real-world outdoor\nscenarios. These environments pose significant challenges due to diverse and\ncluttered scenes, interrupted reprojections of straight 3D lines, and varying\nlighting conditions, making the task notoriously difficult. Furthermore, the\nfield lacks a dedicated dataset encouraging the development of respective\ndetection algorithms. In this study, we present a small dataset named\n\"ClearLines\", and by detailing its creation process, provide practical insights\nthat can serve as a guide for developing and refining straight 3D line\ndetection algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Consider an i.i.d. sequence of random variables, taking values in some space\n$S$, whose underlying distribution is unknown. In problems of Bayesian\ninference, one models this unknown distribution as a random measure, and the\nlaw of this random measure is the prior. When $S = \\{0, 1\\}$, a commonly used\nprior is the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$, or more generally, the beta\ndistribution. When $S$ is finite, the analogous choice is the Dirichlet\ndistribution. For a general space $S$, we are led naturally to the Dirichlet\nprocess (see [Ferguson, 1973]).\n  Here, we consider an array of random variables, and in so doing are led to\nwhat we call the iterated Dirichlet process (IDP). We define the IDP and then\nshow how to compute the posterior distribution, given a finite set of\nobservations, using the method of sequential imputation. Ordinarily, this\nmethod requires the existence of certain joint density functions, which the IDP\nlacks. We therefore present a new, more general proof of the validity of\nsequential imputation, and show that the hypotheses of our proof are satisfied\nby the IDP.",

Our\napproach addresses the challenge of understanding how an intervention applied\nat specific locations influences the surrounding area. Traditional synthetic\ncontrol applications may struggle with defining the effective area of impact,\nthe extent of treatment propagation across space, and the variation of effects\nwith distance from the treatment sites. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Spatial Vertical Regression (SVR) within the Bayesian paradigm. This\ninnovative approach allows us to accurately predict the outcomes in varying\nproximities to the treatment sites, while meticulously accounting for the\nspatial structure inherent in the data. Specifically, rooted on the vertical\nregression framework of the synthetic control method, SVR employs a Gaussian\nprocess to ensure that the imputation of missing potential outcomes for areas\nof different distance around the treatment sites is spatially coherent,\nreflecting the expectation that nearby areas experience similar outcomes and\nhave similar relationships to control areas. This approach is particularly\npertinent to our study on the Florentine tramway's first line construction.

To gain insights into the\nworkings of the TWT over commercially available off-the-shelf components and to\nanalyze the factors that affect its performance, we carry out various\nexperiments with it over our Wi-Fi 6 testbed.

    "abstract": "The radio emission of the quiet Sun in the metric and decametric bands has\nnot been well studied historically due to limitations of existing instruments.\nIt is nominally dominated by thermal brehmsstrahlung of the solar corona, but\nmay also include significant gyrosynchrotron emission, usually assumed to be\nweak under quiet conditions. In this work, we investigate the expected\ngyrosynchrotron contribution to solar radio emission in the lowest radio\nfrequencies observable by ground instruments, for different regions of the low\nand middle corona. We approximate the coronal conditions by a synoptic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model. The thermal emission is estimated from a\nforward model based on the simulated corona. We calculate the expected\ngyrosynchrotron emission with the Fast Gyrosynchrotron Codes framework by\nFleishman & Kuznetsov (2010). The model emissions of different coronal regions\nare compared with quiet-time observations between 20-90 MHz by the LOw\nFrequency ARray (LOFAR) radio telescope. The contribution of gyrosynchrotron\nradiation to low frequency solar radio emission may shed light on effects such\nas the hitherto unexplained brightness variation observed in decametric coronal\nhole emission, and help constrain measurements of the coronal magnetic fields.\nIt can also improve our understanding of electron populations in the middle\ncorona and their relation to the formation of the solar wind.",

This paper provides the first\nanalytical study on the stability of the UGKS applied to a linear kinetic\nmodel, which is able to reproduce the one-dimensional linear scalar\nadvection-diffusion equation via the Chapman-Enskog expansion method. Adopting\nperiodic boundary conditions and neglecting the error from numerical\nintegration, this paper rigorously proves the weighted $L^2$-stability of the\nfirst-order UGKS under the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) conditions. It is\nshown that the time step of the method is not constrained by being less than\nthe particle collision time, nor is it limited by parabolic type CFL conditions\ntypically applied in solving diffusion equations. The novelty of the proof lies\nin that based on the ratio of the time step to the particle collision time, the\nupdate of distribution functions is viewed as a convex combinations of\nsub-methods related to various physics processes, such as the particle free\ntransport and collisions. The weighted $L^2$-stability of the sub-methods is\nobtained by considering them as discretizations to corresponding linear\nhyperbolic systems and utilizing the associated Riemann invariants.

    "abstract": "The subject of this article is the structure of big bang singularities in\nspatially homogeneous solutions to the Einstein non-linear scalar field\nequations. In particular, we focus on Bianchi class A; i.e., developments\narising from left invariant initial data on unimodular $3$-dimensional Lie\ngroups. We prove that solutions are either vacuum or matter dominated,\ndepending on whether the limit of an expansion normalised normal derivative of\nthe scalar field is zero or not, respectively. The main result concerning the\nasymptotics in the direction of the singularity is, essentially, that solutions\ninduce data on the singularity, with two exceptions: vacuum dominated Bianchi\ntype VIII and IX without additional symmetries (they are neither isotropic nor\nlocally rotationally symmetric) exhibit BKL-type oscillations. Disregarding the\nexceptions, there is in fact a bijection between initial data on the\nsingularity and developments. Initial data on the singularity thus play a\ncentral role in the analysis; they both parameterise developments and give\noptimal asymptotic information. However, the main point of the article is to\nprove that the set of isometry classes of initial data on the singularity (of a\nfixed Bianchi type and symmetry (such as isotropy, local rotational symmetry\netc.)) has a smooth structure; that the set of isometry classes of developments\n(similarly restricted) has a smooth structure which fits together with the\nnatural smooth structure of isometry classes of regular initial data with fixed\nmean curvature; and that the Einstein flow generates a diffeomorphism between\nthe two sets. However, the article contains substantial additional information,\nsuch as, e.g., the construction of a large class of spatially locally\nhomogeneous solutions that can be demonstrated to be globally non-linearly\nstable (in the absence of symmetries) both to the future and to the past.",

Here we provide a new approximate Eastin-Knill\ntheorem for the single-shot regime when we allow for some probability of error\nin the decoding. In particular, we show that a quantum error correcting code\ncan support a universal set of transversal gates and approximately correct for\nlocal erasure if and only if the conditional min-entropy of the Choi state of\nthe encoding and noise channel is upper bounded by a simple function of the\nworst-case error probability. Our no-go theorem can be computed by solving a\nsemidefinite program, and, in the spirit of the original Eastin-Knill theorem,\nis formulated in terms of a condition that is both necessary and sufficient,\nensuring achievability whenever it is passed. As an example, we find that with\n$n=100$ physical qutrits we can encode $k=1$ logical qubit in the $W$-state\ncode, which admits a universal transversal set of gates and corrects for single\nsubsystem erasure with error probability of $\\varepsilon = 0.005$.

The volatile material is mainly water\nice, and the time required for its complete depletion is called the desiccation\ntime. Estimating the desiccation time is important for examining the formation\nand evolution of small solar system bodies. Here, we propose a new theoretical\nmodel for evaluating the desiccation time as a function of orbital elements,\nconsidering the contraction of the entire cometary nucleus due to ice\nsublimation. First, we performed numerical calculations of the thermal\nevolution of a cometary nucleus in an eccentric orbit, considering the seasonal\nvariation in the solar heating rate. Next, we derived the desiccation time\nanalytically as a function of orbital elements based on a steady-state model\nconsidering the solar heating rate averaged over the seasons. We compared the\nnumerical solutions for the desiccation time with the analytical solutions and\nclarified the conditions under which the analytical model can be applied.\nAdditionally, based on the analytical model, we derived formulae for estimating\nthe emission rates of water vapor and dust on the surface of the cometary\nnucleus, the maximum size of the emitted dust, and the dust emission velocity,\nby assuming the amount of ice remaining inside the nucleus. Using these\nanalytical solutions, we considered the internal structure and evolution\nprocess of typical CAT objects. Our analytical model was generally consistent\nwith that of the results of earlier observations of these objects.

    "abstract": "With the development of Artificial Intelligence, numerous real-world tasks\nhave been accomplished using technology integrated with deep learning. To\nachieve optimal performance, deep neural networks typically require large\nvolumes of data for training. Although advances in data augmentation have\nfacilitated the acquisition of vast datasets, most of this data is concentrated\nin domains like images and speech. However, there has been relatively less\nfocus on augmenting time-series data. To address this gap and generate a\nsubstantial amount of time-series data, we propose a simple and effective\nmethod that combines the Diffusion and Transformer models. By utilizing an\nadjusted diffusion denoising model to generate a large volume of initial\ntime-step action data, followed by employing a Transformer model to predict\nsubsequent actions, and incorporating a weighted loss function to achieve\nconvergence, the method demonstrates its effectiveness. Using the performance\nimprovement of the model after applying augmented data as a benchmark, and\ncomparing the results with those obtained without data augmentation or using\ntraditional data augmentation methods, this approach shows its capability to\nproduce high-quality augmented data.",

We\nextend these results by formulating a problem that encompasses both infinitely\ndeep and finitely deep flows, and by proving the existence of a continuous\ncurve of water waves that connects a laminar flow to a touching wave for fixed,\nnonzero gravity. This implies the existence of a wave profile featuring a\nvertical tangent at a point, which is not overhanging, and is referred to as a\nbreaking wave.

By taking the median of $(2r-1)$ independent randomized quasi-Monte\nCarlo (RQMC) samples, we demonstrate that the desired convergence rates can be\nachieved without increasing the number of randomizations $r$ as the quadrature\nsize $N$ grows for both bounded and unbounded integrands. For unbounded\nintegrands, our analysis assumes a boundary growth condition on the weak\nderivatives and also considers singularities such as kinks and jump\ndiscontinuities. Notably, when $r = 1$, the median estimator reduces to the\nstandard RQMC estimator. By applying analytical techniques developed for median\nestimators, we prove that the affine matrix scrambled estimator achieves a\nconvergence rate depending on the integrand's smoothness, and is therefore not\nlimited by the canonical rate $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-3/2})$. However, this\nsmoothness-dependent theoretical rate is not observed empirically in numerical\nexperiments when the affine matrix scrambling yields a heavy-tailed sampling\ndistribution.

Anonymization consistently reduced perceived quality across groups\n(from 83% to 59%, p<0.001), with pathology-specific degradation patterns\n(one-way ANOVA: p=0.005). Native listeners showed a non-significant trend\ntoward higher original speech ratings (Delta=4%, p=0.199), but this difference\nwas minimal after anonymization (Delta=1%, p=0.724). No significant\ngender-based bias was observed. Perceptual outcomes did not correlate with\nautomatic metrics; intelligibility was linked to perceived quality in original\nspeech but not after anonymization. These findings underscore the need for\nlistener-informed, disorder-specific anonymization strategies that preserve\nboth privacy and perceptual integrity.",

(II) The identical\nloss function for intermediate and output layers causes intermediate layers to\nprioritize output-specific features prematurely, limiting generalizable\nrepresentations. (III) Lacking regularization on hidden activations risks\noverconfident predictions, reducing generalization to unseen scenarios. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic, intermediate\nMulti-access Heterogeneous Supervision and Regularization (iMacHSR) scheme.\nSpecifically, the proposed iMacHSR introduces below integral strategies: (I) we\nselect multiple intermediate layers based on predefined architecture-agnostic\nstandards; (II) loss functions (different from output-layer loss) are applied\nto those selected intermediate layers, which can guide intermediate layers to\nlearn diverse and hierarchical representations; and (III) negative entropy\nregularization on selected layers' hidden features discourages overconfident\npredictions and mitigates overfitting. These intermediate terms are combined\ninto the output-layer training loss to form a unified optimization objective,\nenabling comprehensive optimization across the network hierarchy. We then take\nthe semantic understanding task as an example to assess iMacHSR and apply\niMacHSR to several model architectures.

This becomes even more critical\nduring anomaly conditions like the epidemic outbreak, during which couriers'\ndelivery timely rate will decline markedly and fluctuates significantly.\nExisting studies pay less attention to the logistics scenario. Moreover, many\nworks focusing on prediction tasks in anomaly scenarios fail to explicitly\nmodel abnormal events, e.g., treating external factors equally with other\nfeatures, resulting in great information loss. Further, since some anomalous\nevents occur infrequently, traditional data-driven methods perform poorly in\nthese scenarios. To deal with them, we propose a deep spatial-temporal\nattention model, named DeepSTA. To be specific, to avoid information loss, we\ndesign an anomaly spatio-temporal learning module that employs a recurrent\nneural network to model incident information. Additionally, we utilize Node2vec\nto model correlations between road districts, and adopt graph neural networks\nand long short-term memory to capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of\ncouriers. To tackle the issue of insufficient training data in abnormal\ncircumstances, we propose an anomaly pattern attention module that adopts a\nmemory network for couriers' anomaly feature patterns storage via attention\nmechanisms.

First, we derived a\ngeneric set of constraints imposed onto the parameters of the temporal coupled\nmode theory by energy conservation and time-reversal symmetry in an invariant\nform that allows for asymmetry between the coupling and decoupling\ncoefficients. The proposed approach is applied to the problem of Fano\nresonances induced by isolated quasi-guided modes in the regime of specular\nreflection. Our central result is a generic formula for the line-shape of the\nFano resonance in transmittance for the lossless metasurfaces in the framework\nof 2D electrodynamics. We consider all possible symmetries of the metasurface\nelementary cell and uncover the effects that the symmetry incurs on the profile\nof the Fano resonance induced by an isolated high-$Q$ mode. It is shown that\nthe proposed approach correctly describes the presence of robust reflection and\ntransmission zeros in the spectra as well as the spectral signatures of bound\nstates in the continuum. The approach is applied to uniderictionally guided\nresonant modes in metasurfaces with an asymmetric elementary cell. It is found\nthat the existence of such modes and the transmittance in their spectral\nvicinity are consistent with the theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the\ntheory predicts that a uniderictionally guided resonant mode is dual to a\ncounter-propagating mode of a peculiar type which is coupled with the outgoing\nwave on both sides of the metasurface but, nonetheless, exhibits only a\nsingle-sided coupling with incident waves.",

In contrast, spike cameras, with their high\ntemporal resolution, significantly enhance visual saliency maps. However, the\ncomposite noise inherent to spike camera imaging introduces discontinuities in\nsaliency detection. Low-quality samples further distort model predictions,\nleading to saliency bias. To address these challenges, we propose\nSpike-navigated Optimal TrAnsport Saliency Region Detection (SOTA), a framework\nthat leverages the strengths of spike cameras while mitigating biases in both\nspatial and temporal dimensions. Our method introduces Spike-based Micro-debias\n(SM) to capture subtle frame-to-frame variations and preserve critical details,\neven under minimal scene or lighting changes. Additionally, Spike-based\nGlobal-debias (SG) refines predictions by reducing inconsistencies across\ndiverse conditions. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets\ndemonstrate that SOTA outperforms existing methods by eliminating composite\nnoise bias.

    "abstract": "Lightning strikes are one of the leading causes of death among natural\ndisasters in tropical regions. The Congo rainforests host the highest rates of\nlightning flashes in the world and the lightning properties in this region have\na strong seasonality owing to the cross-equatorial movements of the Inter\nTropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) throughout the year. The Lightning Flash Rates\n(LFR) are found to peak during the Equinoctial months while lightning radiance\nassumes the strongest values during the Boreal Summer months. Across the\nTropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) duration, (1998-2015), annual LFR in\nthe Congo rainforest increases steadily, however, the average and the peak\nlightning radiances decrease by ~1%/year and ~1.5%/year respectively which is\ncounter-intuitive to the expected intensification in weather extremes in a\nwarming climate. An in-depth analysis highlighted the influence of moisture\nconvergence over the Congo Basin from the Atlantic as the primary contributor\nto lightning compared to the aerosol nucleation and thermodynamic instability\neffects during the boreal summers. Further, it has been proposed that in a\ngradually warming climate, the strength of the prevailing ITCZ over Sahel\nregion has intensified thereby weakening the moisture ingress towards the Congo\nBasin, and this resulted in the observed reduction in lightning intensity in\nrecent years. Consequently, the long-term projections of lightning properties\nfrom global model simulations revealed a prominent weakening in lightning\n(~50%) over the Congo Basin by the year 2100 assuming the Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 emission scenarios.

Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs)\nhave driven remarkable progress in this field, particularly through\nunsupervised embedding derivation methods centered on discriminative PLMs like\nBERT. However, due to time and computational constraints, few efforts have\nattempted to integrate unsupervised sentence representation with generative\nPLMs, which typically possess much larger parameter sizes. Given that\nstate-of-the-art models in both academia and industry are predominantly based\non generative architectures, there is a pressing need for an efficient\nunsupervised text representation framework tailored to decoder-only PLMs. To\naddress this concern, we propose CSE-SFP, an innovative method that exploits\nthe structural characteristics of generative models. Compared to existing\nstrategies, CSE-SFP requires only a single forward pass to perform effective\nunsupervised contrastive learning. Rigorous experimentation demonstrates that\nCSE-SFP not only produces higher-quality embeddings but also significantly\nreduces both training time and memory consumption.

The latter can be actively\ntuned via the cavity length in-situ, displaying nonlinear scaling in intensity\nand fingerprints of the valley polarization.

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary 3D panoptic segmentation has recently emerged as a\nsignificant trend. Top-performing methods currently integrate 2D segmentation\nwith geometry-aware 3D primitives. However, the advantage would be lost without\nhigh-fidelity 3D point clouds, such as methods based on Neural Radiance Field\n(NeRF). These methods are limited by the insufficient capacity to maintain\nconsistency across partial observations. To address this, recent works have\nutilized contrastive loss or cross-view association pre-processing for view\nconsensus. In contrast to them, we present Cues3D, a compact approach that\nrelies solely on NeRF instead of pre-associations. The core idea is that NeRF's\nimplicit 3D field inherently establishes a globally consistent geometry,\nenabling effective object distinction without explicit cross-view supervision.\nWe propose a three-phase training framework for NeRF,\ninitialization-disambiguation-refinement, whereby the instance IDs are\ncorrected using the initially-learned knowledge. Additionally, an instance\ndisambiguation method is proposed to match NeRF-rendered 3D masks and ensure\nglobally unique 3D instance identities. With the aid of Cues3D, we obtain\nhighly consistent and unique 3D instance ID for each object across views with a\nbalanced version of NeRF. Our experiments are conducted on ScanNet v2,\nScanNet200, ScanNet++, and Replica datasets for 3D instance, panoptic, and\nsemantic segmentation tasks. Cues3D outperforms other 2D image-based methods\nand competes with the latest 2D-3D merging based methods, while even surpassing\nthem when using additional 3D point clouds.

This becomes even more necessary in mixed logistics scenarios where\ncouriers handle a high volume of delivery and a smaller number of pickup\nsimultaneously. However, most of the related works treat the pickup and\ndelivery patterns on couriers' decision behavior equally, neglecting that the\npickup has a greater impact on couriers' decision-making compared to the\ndelivery due to its tighter time constraints. In such context, we have three\nmain challenges: 1) multiple spatiotemporal factors are intricately\ninterconnected, significantly affecting couriers' delivery behavior; 2) pickups\nhave stricter time requirements but are limited in number, making it\nchallenging to model their effects on couriers' delivery process; 3) couriers'\nspatial mobility patterns are critical determinants of their delivery behavior,\nbut have been insufficiently explored. To deal with these, we propose TransPDT,\na Transformer-based multi-task package delivery time prediction model. We first\nemploy the Transformer encoder architecture to capture the spatio-temporal\ndependencies of couriers' historical travel routes and pending package sets.\nThen we design the pattern memory to learn the patterns of pickup in the\nimbalanced dataset via attention mechanism. We also set the route prediction as\nan auxiliary task of delivery time prediction, and incorporate the prior\ncourier spatial movement regularities in prediction. Extensive experiments on\nreal industry-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. A\nsystem based on TransPDT is deployed internally in JD Logistics to track more\nthan 2000 couriers handling hundreds of thousands of packages per day in\nBeijing.",

Recently, Mertens et al 2025 has analysed 10 nights of LOFAR high-band\ndata and estimated upper limits on the 21-cm power spectrum at redshifts 8.3,\n9.1 and 10.1. Here we use these upper limit results to constrain the properties\nof the IGM at those redshifts. We focus on the properties of the ionized and\nheated regions where the temperature is larger than that of the CMB. We model\nthe 21-cm power spectrum with the code GRIZZLY, and use a Bayesian inference\nframework to explore the source parameters for uniform priors on their ranges.\nThe framework also provides information about the IGM properties in the form of\nderived parameters. In a model which includes a radio background in excess of\nthe CMB, the 95 (68) per cent credible intervals of disfavoured models at\nredshift 9.1 for the chosen priors correspond to IGM states with averaged\nionization and heated fraction below 0.46 ($\\lesssim 0.05$), an average gas\ntemperature below 44 K (4 K), and a characteristic size of the heated region\n$\\lesssim 14 ~h^{-1} ~\\mathrm{Mpc}$ ($\\lesssim 3 ~h^{-1} ~\\mathrm{Mpc}$). The\n68 per cent credible interval suggests an excess radio background which is more\nthan 100 per cent of the CMB at 1.42 GHz, while the 95 per cent credible\ninterval of the radio background efficiency parameter spans the entire prior\nrange. The behaviour of the credible intervals is similar at all redshifts.

This requires careful planning, often via magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI)-based anatomical 3D models. However, creating these\nmodels is often time-consuming and user dependent. We organized the Surgical\nPlanning in Pediatric Neuroblastoma (SPPIN) challenge, to stimulate\ndevelopments on this topic, and set a benchmark for fully automatic\nsegmentation of neuroblastoma on multi-model MRI. The challenge started with a\ntraining phase, where teams received 78 sets of MRI scans from 34 patients,\nconsisting of both diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans. The final test\nphase, consisting of 18 MRI sets from 9 patients, determined the ranking of the\nteams. Ranking was based on the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice score), the\n95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the volumetric similarity\n(VS). The SPPIN challenge was hosted at MICCAI 2023. The final leaderboard\nconsisted of 9 teams. The highest-ranking team achieved a median Dice score\n0.82, a median HD95 of 7.69 mm and a VS of 0.91, utilizing a large, pretrained\nnetwork called STU-Net. A significant difference for the segmentation results\nbetween diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans was observed (Dice = 0.89 vs\nDice = 0.59, P = 0.01) for the highest-ranking team. SPPIN is the first medical\nsegmentation challenge in extracranial pediatric oncology. The highest-ranking\nteam used a large pre-trained network, suggesting that pretraining can be of\nuse in small, heterogenous datasets.

The dynamic nature of this data, characterized by\ncontinuous changes or data drift, poses significant challenges for on-device\nmodels. To address this issue, continual learning (CL) is proposed, enabling\nmachine learning models to incrementally update their knowledge and mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting. However, the traditional centralized approach to CL is\nunsuitable for end devices due to privacy and data volume concerns. In this\ncontext, federated continual learning (FCL) emerges as a promising solution,\npreserving user data locally while enhancing models through collaborative\nupdates. Aiming at the challenges of limited storage resources for CL, poor\nautonomy in task shift detection, and difficulty in coping with new adversarial\ntasks in FCL scenario, we propose a novel FCL framework named SacFL. SacFL\nemploys an Encoder-Decoder architecture to separate task-robust and\ntask-sensitive components, significantly reducing storage demands by retaining\nlightweight task-sensitive components for resource-constrained end devices.\nMoreover, $\\rm{SacFL}$ leverages contrastive learning to introduce an\nautonomous data shift detection mechanism, enabling it to discern whether a new\ntask has emerged and whether it is a benign task. This capability ultimately\nallows the device to autonomously trigger CL or attack defense strategy without\nadditional information, which is more practical for end devices. Comprehensive\nexperiments conducted on multiple text and image datasets, such as Cifar100 and\nTHUCNews, have validated the effectiveness of $\\rm{SacFL}$ in both\nclass-incremental and domain-incremental scenarios.

However, existing subgraph-based interpretable\nmethods suffer from an overemphasis on local structure, potentially overlooking\nlong-range dependencies within the entire graphs. Although recent efforts that\nrely on graph coarsening have proven beneficial for global interpretability,\nthey inevitably reduce the graphs to a fixed granularity. Such an inflexible\nway can only capture graph connectivity at a specific level, whereas real-world\ngraph tasks often exhibit relationships at varying granularities (e.g.,\nrelevant interactions in proteins span from functional groups, to amino acids,\nand up to protein domains). In this paper, we introduce a novel Tree-like\nInterpretable Framework (TIF) for graph classification, where plain GNNs are\ntransformed into hierarchical trees, with each level featuring coarsened graphs\nof different granularity as tree nodes. Specifically, TIF iteratively adopts a\ngraph coarsening module to compress original graphs (i.e., root nodes of trees)\ninto increasingly coarser ones (i.e., child nodes of trees), while preserving\ndiversity among tree nodes within different branches through a dedicated graph\nperturbation module. Finally, we propose an adaptive routing module to identify\nthe most informative root-to-leaf paths, providing not only the final\nprediction but also the multi-granular interpretability for the decision-making\nprocess. Extensive experiments on the graph classification benchmarks with both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TIF in\ninterpretability, while also delivering a competitive prediction performance\nakin to the state-of-the-art counterparts.",

For three-dimensional systems, the SED\nmethod effectively establishes the thermal transport regime diagram for\nmetal-organic frameworks, distinguishing between particlelike and wavelike\npropagation regions. Moreover, using bulk silicon as an example, we show that\nphonon SED can efficiently capture quantum dynamics based on path-integral\ntrajectories.

While previous efforts have\nachieved certain success in 8-bit or 4-bit cases, SOLO enables Adam-style\noptimizers to maintain quantized states with precision as low as 3 bits, or\neven 2 bits. This immense progress is due to the identification and resolution\nof two key challenges: the signal swamping problem in unsigned quantization\nthat results in unchanged state dynamics, and the increased gradient variance\nin signed quantization that leads to incorrect descent directions. The\ntheoretical analysis suggests a tailored logarithmic quantization for the\nformer and a precision-specific momentum hyperparameter for the latter.

    "abstract": "(abridged) Weak gravitational lensing (WL) is the unique and powerful probe\ninto the large-scale structures of the Universe. Removing the shape noise from\nthe observed WL field, i.e., denoising, enhances the potential of WL by\naccessing information at small scales where the shape noise dominates without\ndenoising. We utilise two machine learning (ML) models for denosing: generative\nadversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM). We evaluate the performance\nof denosing with GAN and DM utilising the large suite of mock WL observations,\nwhich serve as the training and test data sets. We apply denoising to 1,000\nmaps with GAN and DM models trained with 39,000 mock observations. Both models\ncan fairly well reproduce the true convergence map on large scales. Then, we\nmeasure cosmological statistics: power spectrum, bispectrum, one-point\nprobability distribution function, peak and minima counts, and scattering\ntransform coefficients. We find that DM outperforms GAN in almost all\nstatistics and recovers the correct statistics down to small scales within\nroughly $0.3 \\sigma$ level at the scales accessible from current and future WL\nsurveys. We also conduct the stress tests on the trained model; denoising the\nmaps with different characteristics, e.g., different source redshifts, from the\ndata used in training. The performance degrades at small scales, but the\nstatistics can still be recovered at large scales. Though the training of DM is\nmore computationally demanding compared with GAN, there are several advantages:\nnumerically stable training, higher performance in the reconstruction of\ncosmological statistics, and sampling multiple realisations once the model is\ntrained. It has been known that DM can generate higher-quality images in\nreal-world problems than GAN, the superiority has been confirmed as well in the\nWL denoising problem.",

The notion of a \\emph{distributed interactive proof} (DIP) was\nintroduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena (PODC 2018). In this setting, the\nverifier consists of $n$ nodes connected by a communication graph $G$. The\nprover is a single entity that communicates with all nodes by short messages.\nThe goal is to verify that the graph $G$ satisfies a certain property (e.g.,\nplanarity) in a small number of rounds, and with a small communication bound,\ndenoted as the \\emph{proof size}.\n  Prior work by Naor, Parter and Yogev (SODA 2020) presented a DIP for\nplanarity that uses three interaction rounds and a proof size of $O(\\log n)$.\nFeuilloley et al.\\ (PODC 2020) showed that the same can be achieved with a\nsingle interaction round and without randomization, by providing a proof\nlabeling scheme with a proof size of $O(\\log n)$. In a subsequent work,\nBousquet, Feuilloley, and Pierron (OPODIS 2021) achieved the same bound for\nrelated graph families such as outerplanarity, series-parallel graphs, and\ngraphs of treewidth at most $2$. In this work, we design new DIPs that use\nexponentially shorter proofs compared to the state-of-the-art bounds.",

Yet, despite these advancements, their ability to\nrespect fundamental physical laws remains largely untested: many outputs still\nviolate basic constraints such as rigid-body collisions, energy conservation,\nand gravitational dynamics, resulting in unrealistic or even misleading\ncontent. Existing physical-evaluation benchmarks typically rely on automatic,\npixel-level metrics applied to simplistic, life-scenario prompts, and thus\noverlook both human judgment and first-principles physics. To fill this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{T2VPhysBench}, a first-principled benchmark that\nsystematically evaluates whether state-of-the-art text-to-video systems, both\nopen-source and commercial, obey twelve core physical laws including Newtonian\nmechanics, conservation principles, and phenomenological effects. Our benchmark\nemploys a rigorous human evaluation protocol and includes three targeted\nstudies: (1) an overall compliance assessment showing that all models score\nbelow 0.60 on average in each law category; (2) a prompt-hint ablation\nrevealing that even detailed, law-specific hints fail to remedy physics\nviolations; and (3) a counterfactual robustness test demonstrating that models\noften generate videos that explicitly break physical rules when so instructed.\nThe results expose persistent limitations in current architectures and offer\nconcrete insights for guiding future research toward truly physics-aware video\ngeneration.",

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INR) has found successful applications\nacross diverse domains. To employ INR in real-life, it is important to speed up\ntraining. In the field of INR for video applications, the state-of-the-art\napproach employs grid-type parametric encoding and successfully achieves a\nfaster encoding speed in comparison to its predecessors. However, the grid\nusage, which does not consider the video's dynamic nature, leads to redundant\nuse of trainable parameters. As a result, it has significantly lower parameter\nefficiency and higher bitrate compared to NeRV-style methods that do not use a\nparametric encoding. To address the problem, we propose Neural Video\nrepresentation with Temporally coherent Modulation (NVTM), a novel framework\nthat can capture dynamic characteristics of video. By decomposing the\nspatio-temporal 3D video data into a set of 2D grids with flow information,\nNVTM enables learning video representation rapidly and uses parameter\nefficiently. Our framework enables to process temporally corresponding pixels\nat once, resulting in the fastest encoding speed for a reasonable video\nquality, especially when compared to the NeRV-style method, with a speed\nincrease of over 3 times. Also, it remarks an average of 1.54dB/0.019\nimprovements in PSNR/LPIPS on UVG (Dynamic) (even with 10% fewer parameters)\nand an average of 1.84dB/0.013 improvements in PSNR/LPIPS on MCL-JCV (Dynamic),\ncompared to previous grid-type works. By expanding this to compression tasks,\nwe demonstrate comparable performance to video compression standards (H.264,\nHEVC) and recent INR approaches for video compression. Additionally, we perform\nextensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithm\nacross diverse tasks, encompassing super resolution, frame interpolation and\nvideo inpainting.

Following this, the volumetric map is efficiently\nupdated with the glass surface information and safe trajectories are replanned\non the fly to circumvent the glass obstacles.

The new criterion function is\nsubsequently decomposed into two solvable subproblems via alternating\noptimization of the two variable matrices, for which the optimizers can be\nexplicitly formulated into recursive equations. Second, under the\nnon-stationary and non-persistent excitation conditions on the systems,\ntheoretical properties of the recursive algorithms are established. That is,\nthe estimates are proved to be with (i) set convergence, i.e., the accurate\nestimation of the sparse index set of the unknown parameter matrix, and (ii)\nparameter convergence, i.e., the consistent estimation for values of the\nnon-zero elements of the unknown parameter matrix. Finally, numerical examples\nare given to support the theoretical analysis.",

Specifically, the\nframework employs a bicycle model-augmented with road gradient\nconsiderations-to accurately capture vehicle dynamics. In parallel, a\nhypergraph-based AI model is developed to predict probabilistic trajectories of\nambient traffic. By integrating these two components, the framework derives\nvehicle intra-spacing over a 3D road surface as the solution of a stochastic\nordinary differential equation, yielding high-fidelity surrogate safety\nmeasures such as time-to-collision (TTC). To demonstrate its effectiveness, the\nframework is analyzed using stochastic numerical methods comprising 4th-order\nRunge-Kutta integration and AI inference, generating probability-weighted\nhigh-fidelity TTC (HF-TTC) distributions that reflect complex multi-agent\nmaneuvers and behavioral uncertainties. Evaluated with HF-TTC against\ntraditional constant-velocity TTC and non-interaction-aware approaches on\nhighway datasets, the proposed framework offers a systematic methodology for\nactive safety analysis with enhanced potential for improving safety perception\nin complex traffic environments.",

Their inference models typically\nface poor generalization due to domain-shift. Federated Learning (FL) has\nemerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the generalization of AD models\nthrough privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, these FL AD models\nface significant temporal catastrophic forgetting when deployed in dynamically\nevolving environments, where continuous adaptation causes abrupt erosion of\nhistorical knowledge. This paper proposes Federated Exponential Moving Average\n(FedEMA), a novel framework that addresses this challenge through two integral\ninnovations: (I) Server-side model's historical fitting capability preservation\nvia fusing current FL round's aggregation model and a proposed previous FL\nround's exponential moving average (EMA) model; (II) Vehicle-side negative\nentropy regularization to prevent FL models' possible overfitting to\nEMA-introduced temporal patterns. Above two strategies empower FedEMA a\ndual-objective optimization that balances model generalization and\nadaptability. In addition, we conduct theoretical convergence analysis for the\nproposed FedEMA.

As a result, practitioners often\nresort to heuristics and approximations, such as model predictive control that\nonly looks a few steps into the future. In the quadratic case, the value\nfunction is easily determined by solving Riccati equations. In this work, we\nconsider a special class of convex cost functions constructed from Bregman\ndivergence and show how, with appropriate choices, they can be used to fully\nextend the framework developed for the quadratic case.

We present Mixture of Sparse Attention (MoSA),\na novel approach inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) with expert choice\nrouting. MoSA dynamically selects tokens for each attention head, allowing\narbitrary sparse attention patterns. By selecting $k$ tokens from a sequence of\nlength $T$, MoSA reduces the computational complexity of each attention head\nfrom $O(T^2)$ to $O(k^2 + T)$. This enables using more heads within the same\ncomputational budget, allowing higher specialization. We show that among the\ntested sparse attention variants, MoSA is the only one that can outperform the\ndense baseline, sometimes with up to 27% better perplexity for an identical\ncompute budget. MoSA can also reduce the resource usage compared to dense\nself-attention.

    "abstract": "Purpose: This study presents a Deep Learning (DL)-based quality assessment\n(QA) approach for evaluating auto-generated contours (auto-contours) in\nradiotherapy, with emphasis on Online Adaptive Radiotherapy (OART). Leveraging\nBayesian Ordinal Classification (BOC) and calibrated uncertainty thresholds,\nthe method enables confident QA predictions without relying on ground truth\ncontours or extensive manual labeling. Methods: We developed a BOC model to\nclassify auto-contour quality and quantify prediction uncertainty. A\ncalibration step was used to optimize uncertainty thresholds that meet clinical\naccuracy needs. The method was validated under three data scenarios: no manual\nlabels, limited labels, and extensive labels. For rectum contours in prostate\ncancer, we applied geometric surrogate labels when manual labels were absent,\ntransfer learning when limited, and direct supervision when ample labels were\navailable. Results: The BOC model delivered robust performance across all\nscenarios. Fine-tuning with just 30 manual labels and calibrating with 34\nsubjects yielded over 90% accuracy on test data. Using the calibrated\nthreshold, over 93% of the auto-contours' qualities were accurately predicted\nin over 98% of cases, reducing unnecessary manual reviews and highlighting\ncases needing correction. Conclusion: The proposed QA model enhances contouring\nefficiency in OART by reducing manual workload and enabling fast, informed\nclinical decisions. Through uncertainty quantification, it ensures safer, more\nreliable radiotherapy workflows.",

    "abstract": "There has been a recent surge of interest in time series modeling using the\nTransformer architecture. However, forecasting multivariate time series with\nTransformer presents a unique challenge as it requires modeling both temporal\n(cross-time) and variate (cross-variate) dependencies. While Transformer-based\nmodels have gained popularity for their flexibility in capturing both\nsequential and cross-variate relationships, it is unclear how to best integrate\nthese two sources of information in the context of the Transformer architecture\nwhile optimizing for both performance and efficiency. We re-purpose the\nTransformer architecture to effectively model both cross-time and cross-variate\ndependencies. Our approach begins by embedding each variate independently into\na variate-wise representation that captures its cross-time dynamics, and then\nmodels cross-variate dependencies through attention mechanisms on these learned\nembeddings. Gating operations in both cross-time and cross-variate modeling\nphases regulate information flow, allowing the model to focus on the most\nrelevant features for accurate predictions. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across 13 real-world datasets and can be\nseamlessly integrated into other Transformer-based and LLM-based forecasters,\ndelivering performance improvements up to 20.7\\% over original models.

The commanded end-effector\nvelocity is interpreted component-wise, according to the available mobility in\neach dimension of the task space. First, a substitute \"Safety\" Jacobian matrix\nis created, keeping the aspect ratio of the manipulability ellipsoid above a\nthreshold value. The desired motion is then projected onto non-singular and\nsingular directions, and the latter projection scaled down by a factor informed\nby the threshold value. A right-inverse of the non-singular Safety Jacobian is\napplied to the modified command.

Velocity control with J-PARSE is benchmarked against the\nLeast-Squares and Damped Least-Squares inversions of the Jacobian, and shows\nhigh accuracy in reaching and leaving singular target poses.

Surplus electricity refers to the remaining\nelectricity after net metering, which can be repurposed for Bitcoin mining to\nimprove Korea Electric Power Corporation's (KEPCO) energy resource efficiency\nand alleviate its debt challenges. Net metering (or net energy metering) is an\nelectricity billing mechanism that allows consumers who generate some or all of\ntheir own electricity to use that electricity when they want, rather than when\nit is produced. Using the latest Bitcoin miner, the Antminer S21 XP Hyd, the\nstudy evaluates daily Bitcoin mining when operating at 30,565 and 45,439 units,\nincorporating Bitcoin network hash rates to assess profitability. To examine\nprofitability, the Random Forest Regressor and Long Short-Term Memory models\nwere used to predict the Bitcoin price. The analysis shows that the use of\nexcess electricity for Bitcoin mining not only generates economic revenue, but\nalso minimizes energy loss, reduces debt, and resolves unsettled payment issues\nfor KEPCO. This study empirically investigates and analyzes the integration of\nelectricity surplus in South Korea with bitcoin mining for the first time.

A previous\nnumerical simulation suggested the southeastern bullet is impacting on the main\nbody of B68. In order to obtain more observational evidence, mapping\nobservations of the ground state SO ($1_0-0_1$) emission line at 30 GHz were\nmade with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Based on the velocity field and\nchannel maps derived from SO, three velocity components were clearly detected.\nThe velocity field of the main body indicates rotation and is well fitted by a\nsolid-body rotation model. The measured radial velocity difference between the\nbullet and the main core is about 0.4 km s$^{-1}$, which is almost equal to the\nvelocity obtained by the previous numerical simulation. Therefore, the bullet\nis most likely impacting onto the rotating main body of B68. A 1D spherical\nnon-LTE Monte-Carlo radiation transfer RATRAN code is performed to derive the\nradial abundance profile of SO by analyzing the observed velocity-integrated\nintensity. SO is depleted inside a 60$^{\\prime\\prime}$ (0.02 pc) radius from\nthe core. The abundance stays constant at 2.0$\\times$10$^{-9}$ for radii larger\nthan 60$^{\\prime\\prime}$ from the center of the main core. The abundance is\nenhanced at the interface of the bullet and the main core indicating that shock\nwaves were produced by the collision between the bullet and the main core.

Here we present three-dimensional,\ngeneral-relativistic, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion onto a\nnon-rotating, unmagnetized NS.

At low\naccretion rates, the hydrostatic atmosphere shows slow rotation and weak\nmagnetization, transitioning to an outer RIAF structure. A toroidal magnetic\nfield mediates the inward flow of energy and angular momentum through the\natmosphere, which reaches a steady state when neutrino emission balances the\naccretion power. We develop a one-dimensional analytical model connecting these\nresults with more general initial conditions and describing the main features\nof the flow.

In\nour problem, agents are represented by vertices of a graph $\\GG_{\\mathcal{A}} =\n(\\AA, E_\\AA)$, and each agent $a \\in \\AA$ is associated with a set of preferred\nhouses $\\PP_a \\subseteq \\HH$, where $\\AA$ is the set of agents and $\\HH$ is the\nset of houses. A house allocation is an injective function $\\phi: \\AA\n\\rightarrow \\HH$, and an agent $a$ envies a neighbour $a' \\in N_{\\GG_\\AA}(a)$\nunder $\\phi$ if $\\phi(a) \\notin \\PP_a$ and $\\phi(a') \\in \\PP_a$. We study two\nnatural objectives: the first problem called \\ohaa, aims to compute an\nallocation that minimizes the number of envious agents; the second problem\ncalled \\ohaah aims to maximize, among all minimum-envy allocations, the number\nof agents who are assigned a house they prefer. These two objectives capture\ncomplementary notions of fairness and individual satisfaction.\n  We design polynomial time algorithms for both problems for the variant when\neach agent prefers exactly one house. On the other hand, when the list of\npreferred houses for each agent has size at most $2$ then we show that both\nproblems are \\NP-hard even when the agent graph $\\GG_\\AA$ is a complete\nbipartite graph. We also show that both problems are \\NP-hard even when the\nnumber $|\\mathcal H|$ of houses is equal to the number $|\\mathcal A|$ of\nagents. This is in contrast to the classical {\\sc House Allocation} problem,\nwhere the problem is polynomial time solvable when $|\\mathcal H| = |\\mathcal\nA|$. The two problems are also \\NP-hard when the agent graph has a small vertex\ncover. On the positive side, we design exact algorithms that exploit certain\nstructural properties of $\\GG_{\\AA}$ such as sparsity, existence of balanced\nseparators or existence of small-sized vertex covers, and perform better than\nthe naive brute-force algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Gas leaks pose significant risks to human health and the environment. Despite\nlong-standing concerns, there are limited methods that can efficiently and\naccurately detect and segment leaks due to their concealed appearance and\nrandom shapes. In this paper, we propose a Fine-grained Spatial-Temporal\nPerception (FGSTP) algorithm for gas leak segmentation. FGSTP captures critical\nmotion clues across frames and integrates them with refined object features in\nan end-to-end network. Specifically, we first construct a correlation volume to\ncapture motion information between consecutive frames. Then, the fine-grained\nperception progressively refines the object-level features using previous\noutputs. Finally, a decoder is employed to optimize boundary segmentation.\nBecause there is no highly precise labeled dataset for gas leak segmentation,\nwe manually label a gas leak video dataset, GasVid. Experimental results on\nGasVid demonstrate that our model excels in segmenting non-rigid objects such\nas gas leaks, generating the most accurate mask compared to other\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) models.",

Existing methods, however, often rely on basic\ndescriptors or handcrafted fingerprints, which lack expressive power and hinder\neffective learning. Furthermore, these methods suffer from severe class\nimbalance, limiting the training effectiveness of AI models. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a Feature Contribution-driven Hierarchical Multi-Feature\nMapping Network (HMFNet). Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained, Local\nMulti-Hierarchy Feature Extraction module (LMFE) that performs deep feature\nextraction at the atomic level, capturing detailed features crucial for odor\nprediction. To enhance the extraction of discriminative atomic features, we\nintegrate a Harmonic Modulated Feature Mapping (HMFM).

Additionally, a Global Multi-Hierarchy\nFeature Extraction module (GMFE) is designed to learn global features from the\nmolecular graph topology, enabling the model to fully leverage global\ninformation and enhance its discriminative power for odor prediction.

Economists have long used unstructured data by first extracting\nlow-dimensional structured features (e.g., the topic or sentiment of a text),\nsince the raw data are too high-dimensional and uninterpretable to include\ndirectly in empirical analyses. The rise of deep neural networks has\naccelerated this practice by greatly reducing the costs of extracting\nstructured data at scale, but neural networks do not make generically unbiased\npredictions. This potentially propagates bias to the downstream estimators that\nincorporate imputed structured data, and the availability of different\noff-the-shelf neural networks with different biases moreover raises p-hacking\nconcerns. To address these challenges, we reframe inference with unstructured\ndata as a problem of missing structured data, where structured variables are\nimputed from high-dimensional unstructured inputs. This perspective allows us\nto apply classic results from semiparametric inference, leading to estimators\nthat are valid, efficient, and robust. We formalize this approach with MAR-S, a\nframework that unifies and extends existing methods for debiased inference\nusing machine learning predictions, connecting them to familiar problems such\nas causal inference. Within this framework, we develop robust and efficient\nestimators for both descriptive and causal estimands and address challenges\nlike inference with aggregated and transformed missing structured data-a common\nscenario that is not covered by existing work. These methods-and the\naccompanying implementation package-provide economists with accessible tools\nfor constructing unbiased estimators using unstructured data in a wide range of\napplications, as we demonstrate by re-analyzing several influential studies.",

In games where AI players have beaten top human professionals,\nstrength estimation plays a key role in adapting AI behavior to match human\nskill levels. In a previous state-of-the-art study, researchers have proposed a\nstrength estimator trained using human players' match data. Given some matches,\nthe strength estimator computes strength scores and uses them to estimate\nplayer ranks (skill levels). In this paper, we focus on the observation that\nhuman players' behavior tendency varies according to their strength and aim to\nimprove the accuracy of strength estimation by taking this into account.\nSpecifically, in addition to strength scores, we obtain policies for different\nskill levels from neural networks trained using human players' match data. We\nthen combine features based on these policies with the strength scores to\nestimate strength. We conducted experiments on Go and chess. For Go, our method\nachieved an accuracy of 80% in strength estimation when given 10 matches, which\nincreased to 92% when given 20 matches. In comparison, the previous\nstate-of-the-art method had an accuracy of 71% with 10 matches and 84% with 20\nmatches, demonstrating improvements of 8-9%. We observed similar improvements\nin chess.

However, most existing PTQ methods employ\nblock-wise reconstruction, which neglects cross-block dependency and exhibits a\nnotable accuracy drop in low-bit cases. To address these limitations, this\npaper presents a novel PTQ method, dubbed Pack-PTQ. First, we design a\nHessian-guided adaptive packing mechanism to partition blocks into\nnon-overlapping packs, which serve as the base unit for reconstruction, thereby\npreserving the cross-block dependency and enabling accurate quantization\nparameters estimation. Second, based on the pack configuration, we propose a\nmixed-precision quantization approach to assign varied bit-widths to packs\naccording to their distinct sensitivities, thereby further enhancing\nperformance. Extensive experiments on 2D image and 3D point cloud\nclassification tasks, using various network architectures, demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over the state-of-the-art PTQ methods.",

Moreover,\nNSGA-III often relies on simulated binary crossover, which deteriorates in\nproblems with variable dependencies.

The position of\nthe target point is adaptively determined according to the shape of the Pareto\nfront, ensuring improvement in coverage. Furthermore, the flexibility of this\nscalarization allows seamless integration with powerful single-objective\noptimization methods, such as natural evolution strategies, to efficiently\nhandle variable dependencies.

    "abstract": "LLMs trained on massive datasets may inadvertently acquire sensitive\ninformation such as personal details and potentially harmful content. This risk\nis further heightened in multimodal LLMs as they integrate information from\nmultiple modalities (image and text). Adversaries can exploit this knowledge\nthrough multimodal prompts to extract sensitive details. Evaluating how\neffectively MLLMs can forget such information (targeted unlearning)\nnecessitates the creation of high-quality, well-annotated image-text pairs.\nWhile prior work on unlearning has focused on text, multimodal unlearning\nremains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce a multimodal\nunlearning benchmark, UnLOK-VQA (Unlearning Outside Knowledge VQA), as well as\nan attack-and-defense framework to evaluate methods for deleting specific\nmultimodal knowledge from MLLMs. We extend a visual question-answering dataset\nusing an automated pipeline that generates varying-proximity samples for\ntesting generalization and specificity, followed by manual filtering for\nmaintaining high quality. We then evaluate six defense objectives against seven\nattacks (four whitebox, three blackbox), including a novel whitebox method\nleveraging interpretability of hidden states. Our results show multimodal\nattacks outperform text- or image-only ones, and that the most effective\ndefense removes answer information from internal model states. Additionally,\nlarger models exhibit greater post-editing robustness, suggesting that scale\nenhances safety. UnLOK-VQA provides a rigorous benchmark for advancing\nunlearning in MLLMs.",

Typically $p=1$, but special BICs, known as the\nsuper-BICs, have $p\\geq 2$. Super-BICs can significantly enhance the $Q$-factor\nof nearby resonant states and reduce scattering losses due to fabrication\nimperfections, making them highly advantageous in practical applications.\nHowever, super-BICs, requiring the tuning of structural parameters for their\nrealization, are generally not robust. In this work, we develop a theory to\nclassify super-BICs, determine the minimal number $n$ of tunable structural\nparameters needed, and show that super-BICs form a manifold of dimension\n$(m-n)$ in an $m$-dimensional parameter space. We also propose a direct method\nfor computing super-BICs in structures with different symmetry. Numerical\nexamples demonstrate that our method is far more efficient than existing\nmethods when $n > 1$. In addition, we study the effect of structural\nperturbations, focusing on the transition from super-BICs to generic BICs.\nFinally, we analyze a class of degenerate BICs that can be regarded as Dirac\npoints, and show that they are the intersections of super-BICs in a relevant\nparameter space.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in neural network quantum states (NQS) have enabled\nhigh-accuracy predictions for complex quantum many-body systems such as\nstrongly correlated electron systems. However, the computational cost remains\nprohibitive, making exploration of the diverse parameters of interaction\nstrengths and other physical parameters inefficient. While transfer learning\nhas been proposed to mitigate this challenge, achieving generalization to\nlarge-scale systems and diverse parameter regimes remains difficult. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel curriculum learning framework based on\ntransfer learning for NQS. This facilitates efficient and stable exploration\nacross a vast parameter space of quantum many-body systems. In addition, by\ninterpreting NQS transfer learning through a perturbative lens, we demonstrate\nhow prior physical knowledge can be flexibly incorporated into the curriculum\nlearning process. We also propose Pairing-Net, an architecture to practically\nimplement this strategy for strongly correlated electron systems, and\nempirically verify its effectiveness. Our results show an approximately\n200-fold speedup in computation and a marked improvement in optimization\nstability compared to conventional methods.",

    "abstract": "Local polynomial regression struggles with several challenges when dealing\nwith sparse data. The difficulty in capturing local features of the underlying\nfunction can lead to a potential misrepresentation of the true relationship.\nAdditionally, with limited data points in local neighborhoods, the variance of\nestimators can increase significantly. Local polynomial regression also\nrequires a substantial amount of data to produce good models, making it less\nefficient for sparse datasets. This paper employs a differential\nequation-constrained regression approach, introduced by\n\\citet{ding2014estimation}, for local quasi-exponential growth models. By\nincorporating first-order differential equations, this method extends the\nsparse design capacity of local polynomial regression while reducing bias and\nvariance. We discuss the asymptotic biases and variances of kernel estimators\nusing first-degree Taylor polynomials.

In this work,\nwe propose HP-MDR, a high-performance and portable data refactoring and\nprogressive retrieval framework for GPUs. Our contributions are three-fold: (1)\nWe carefully optimize the bitplane encoding and lossless encoding, two key\nstages in progressive methods, to achieve high performance on GPUs; (2) We\npropose pipeline optimization and incorporate it with data refactoring and\nprogressive retrieval workflows to further enhance the performance for large\ndata process; (3) We leverage our framework to enable high-performance data\nretrieval with guaranteed error control for common Quantities of Interest; (4)\nWe evaluate HP-MDR and compare it with state of the arts using five real-world\ndatasets. Experimental results demonstrate that HP-MDR delivers up to 6.6x\nthroughput in data refactoring and progressive retrieval tasks.

    "abstract": "As climate variability increases, the ability of utility providers to deliver\nprecise Estimated Times of Restoration (ETR) during natural disasters has\nbecome increasingly critical. Accurate and timely ETRs are essential for\nenabling customer preparedness during extended power outages, where informed\ndecision-making can be crucial, particularly in severe weather conditions.\nNonetheless, prevailing utility practices predominantly depend on manual\nassessments or traditional statistical methods, which often fail to achieve the\nlevel of precision required for reliable and actionable predictions. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a Longitudinal Tabular Transformer (LTT) model\nthat leverages historical outage event data along with sequential updates of\nthese events to improve the accuracy of ETR predictions. The model's\nperformance was evaluated over 34,000 storm-related outage events from three\nmajor utility companies, collectively serving over 3 million customers over a\n2-year period. Results demonstrate that the LTT model improves the Customer\nSatisfaction Impact (CSI) metric by an average of 19.08% (p > 0.001) compared\nto existing methods. Additionally, we introduce customer-informed regression\nmetrics that align model evaluation with real-world satisfaction, ensuring the\noutcomes resonate with customer expectations. Furthermore, we employ\ninterpretability techniques to analyze the temporal significance of\nincorporating sequential updates in modeling outage events and to identify the\ncontributions of predictive features to a given ETR. This comprehensive\napproach not only improves predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency,\nfostering greater trust in the model's capabilities.",

    "abstract": "How electron-phonon interactions influence high-temperature superconductivity\nin cuprates remains contested, and their role outside the CuO$_2$ planes has\nbeen largely overlooked. The most conspicuous evidence for such coupling is the\nubiquitous 70-meV dispersion kink seen by photoemission, yet its microscopic\norigin is still debated. Here we use oxygen-$K$-edge resonant inelastic X-ray\nscattering (RIXS) to probe the trilayer cuprate\nHgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\\delta}$ (Hg1223). When both incident photon energy\nand polarization are tuned to the apical-oxygen $1s\\!\\rightarrow\\!2p_z$\ntransition, the RIXS spectra exhibit a ladder of at least ten phonon overtones,\nevenly spaced by 70 meV, whose intensities follow a Franck-Condon envelope,\nsignalling exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling. Quantitative\nmodelling that incorporates core-hole lifetime evaluation yields an\napical-phonon coupling energy of 0.25(1) eV, significantly larger than that of\nthe planar stretching mode. Such a coupling strength offers a strong contender\nfor explaining the universal 70-meV kink and suggests that the dominant\nelectron-phonon channel resides outside the CuO$_2$ planes. By elevating\ninter-layer lattice dynamics from a peripheral factor to a central actor, our\nresults provide a fresh starting point for theories seeking to reconcile strong\ncorrelations, lattice dynamics and high-temperature superconductivity.",
