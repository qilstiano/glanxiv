    "abstract": "In this work, we present three important theorems related to the corrected\nSmagorinsky model for turbulence in time-dependent domains. The first theorem\nestablishes an improved regularity criterion for the solution of the corrected\nSmagorinsky model in Sobolev spaces $H^s(\\Omega(t))$ with smooth and evolving\nboundaries. The result provides a bound on the Sobolev norm of the solution,\nensuring that the solution remains regular over time. The second theorem\nquantifies the approximation error between the corrected Smagorinsky model and\nthe true Navier-Stokes solution. Taking advantage of high-order Sobolev spaces\nand energy methods, we derive an explicit error estimate for the velocity\nfields, showing the relationship between the error and the external force term.\nThe third theorem focuses on the asymptotic convergence of the corrected\nSmagorinsky model to the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations as time\nprogresses. We provide an upper bound for the error in the $L^2(\\Omega)$ norm,\ndemonstrating that the error decreases as time increases, especially as the\nexternal force term vanishes. This result highlights the long-term convergence\nof the corrected model to the true solution, with explicit dependences on the\ninitial conditions, viscosity, and external forces.",

Despite its societal impact, existing models of opinion\nchange fail to account for emotional dynamics nor offer methods to quantify\naffective polarization robustly and in real-time. In this paper, we introduce a\ndiscrete choice model that captures decision-making within affectively\npolarized social networks and propose a statistical inference method estimate\nkey parameters -- in-group love and out-group hate -- from social media data.\nThrough empirical validation from online discussions about the COVID-19\npandemic, we demonstrate that our approach accurately captures real-world\npolarization dynamics and explains the rapid emergence of a partisan gap in\nattitudes towards masking and lockdowns.

Using, the\nexperimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the\nresultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite\nentanglement. For a Fermi liquid, we find that the QFI grows quadratically as\nthe temperature increases, consistent then with the phase space available for\nscattering in the standard theory of metals. By contrast, the QFI in a strange\nmetal increases as a power law at as the temperature decreases, but ultimately\nextrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form,\n$\\omega_g^{2\\Delta}$, where $\\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\\omega_g$\nis the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant\n{depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite\nentanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of\ndoped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We\nconclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy\nreductions of the Hubbard model.",

When the reaction intensities (or fluxes) exhibit a\nseparation of fast-slow scales, the macroscopic typical trajectory is governed\nby a system of $\\varepsilon$-dependent nonlinear reaction rate equations (RRE),\nwhile the non-typical trajectories deviating from the typical ones are\ncharacterized by an $\\varepsilon$-dependent exponentially nonlinear\nHamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). In this paper, for general chemical reactions,\nwe study the fast-slow limit as $\\varepsilon\\to 0$ for the viscosity solutions\nof the associated HJE with a state-constrained boundary condition. We identify\nthe limiting effective HJE on a slow manifold, along with an effective\nvariational representation for the solution. Through the uniform convergence of\nthe viscosity solutions and the $\\Gamma$-convergence of the variational\nsolution representations, we rigorously show that all non-typical (and also\ntypical) trajectories are concentrated on the slow manifold and the effective\nmacroscopic dynamics are described by the coarse-grained RRE and HJE,\nrespectively.

This aims to explore a\nconnection between two central phenomena in the cuprates: strong Coulomb\ncorrelations and CO-forming tendencies.

Among these structures, a pair\nof nearly symmetric spiral arms can be driven by a giant protoplanet. For the\ndouble-spiraled SAO 206462 protoplanetary disk, we obtained three epochs of\nobservations spanning 7 yr using the Very Large Telescope's SPHERE instrument\nin near-infrared $J$-band polarized light. By jointly measuring the motion of\nthe two spirals at three epochs, we obtained a rotation rate of\n$-0.85^\\circ\\pm0.05^\\circ~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. This rate corresponds to a\nprotoplanet at $66\\pm3$ au on a circular orbit dynamically driving both\nspirals. The derived location agrees with the gap in ALMA dust-continuum\nobservations, indicating that the spiral driver may also carve the observed\ngap.

    "abstract": "Modern robots vary significantly in shape, size, and sensor configurations\nused to perceive and interact with their environments. However, most navigation\npolicies are embodiment-specific--a policy trained on one robot typically fails\nto generalize to another, even with minor changes in body size or camera\nviewpoint. As custom hardware becomes increasingly common, there is a growing\nneed for a single policy that generalizes across embodiments, eliminating the\nneed to retrain for each specific robot. In this paper, we introduce RING\n(Robotic Indoor Navigation Generalist), an embodiment-agnostic policy that\nturns any mobile robot into an effective indoor semantic navigator. Trained\nentirely in simulation, RING leverages large-scale randomization over robot\nembodiments to enable robust generalization to many real-world platforms. To\nsupport this, we augment the AI2-THOR simulator to instantiate robots with\ncontrollable configurations, varying in body size, rotation pivot point, and\ncamera parameters. On the visual object-goal navigation task, RING achieves\nstrong cross-embodiment (XE) generalization--72.1% average success rate across\nfive simulated embodiments (a 16.7% absolute improvement on the Chores-S\nbenchmark) and 78.9% across four real-world platforms, including Stretch RE-1,\nLoCoBot, and Unitree Go1--matching or even surpassing embodiment-specific\npolicies. We further deploy RING on the RB-Y1 wheeled humanoid in a real-world\nkitchen environment, showcasing its out-of-the-box potential for mobile\nmanipulation platforms.

    "abstract": "Fingerprinting codes are a crucial tool for proving lower bounds in\ndifferential privacy. They have been used to prove tight lower bounds for\nseveral fundamental questions, especially in the ``low accuracy'' regime.\nUnlike reconstruction/discrepancy approaches however, they are more suited for\nquery sets that arise naturally from the fingerprinting codes construction. In\nthis work, we propose a general framework for proving fingerprinting type lower\nbounds, that allows us to tailor the technique to the geometry of the query\nset. Our approach allows us to prove several new results, including the\nfollowing.\n  First, we show that any (sample- and population-)accurate algorithm for\nanswering $Q$ arbitrary adaptive counting queries over a universe $\\mathcal{X}$\nto accuracy $\\alpha$ needs $\\Omega(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\log |\\mathcal{X}|}\\cdot \\log\nQ}{\\alpha^3})$ samples, matching known upper bounds. This shows that the\napproaches based on differential privacy are optimal for this question, and\nimproves significantly on the previously known lower bounds of $\\frac{\\log\nQ}{\\alpha^2}$ and $\\min(\\sqrt{Q}, \\sqrt{\\log |\\mathcal{X}|})/\\alpha^2$.\n  Second, we show that any $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-DP algorithm for answering\n$Q$ counting queries to accuracy $\\alpha$ needs $\\Omega(\\frac{\\sqrt{\n\\log|\\mathcal{X}| \\log(1/\\delta)} \\log Q}{\\varepsilon\\alpha^2})$ samples,\nmatching known upper bounds up to constants. Our framework allows for proving\nthis bound via a direct correlation analysis and improves the prior bound of\n[BUV'14] by $\\sqrt{\\log(1/\\delta)}$.\n  Third, we characterize the sample complexity of answering a set of random\n$0$-$1$ queries under approximate differential privacy. We give new upper and\nlower bounds in different regimes. By combining them with known results, we can\ncomplete the whole picture.",

    "abstract": "We establish the existence of weak solutions for a nonlocal Klausmeier model\nwithin a small time interval $[0, T)$. The Klausmeier model is a coupled,\nnonlinear system of partial differential equations governing plant biomass and\nwater dynamics in semiarid regions. The original model posits that plants\ndisperse their seed according to classical diffusion. Instead, we opt for a\nnonlocal diffusive operator in alignment with ecological field data that\nvalidates long-range dispersive behaviors of plants and seeds. The equations,\ndefined on a finite interval in $\\mathbb{R}$, feature homogeneous Dirichlet\nboundary conditions for the water equation and nonlocal Dirichlet volume\nconstraints for the plant biomass equation. The nonlocal operator involves\nconvolution with a symmetric and spatially extended convolution kernel\npossessing mild integrability and regularity properties. We employ the Galerkin\nmethod to establish the existence of weak solutions. The key challenge comes\nfrom the nonlocal operator; we define it on a subspace of $L^{2}$ instead of\n$H^{1}$, precluding the use of Aubin's compactness theorem to prove the weak\nconvergence of nonlinear terms. To overcome this, we modify the model and\nintroduce two new equations for the spatial derivatives of plant biomass and\nwater.

In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive\nmeta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any\nsupervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive\nlarge-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive\napplications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search,\nthe selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for\nthe instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive\nexperiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant\nperformance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any\nsingle best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art\nlarge-neighborhood search for MIPs.

    "abstract": "Monocular facial performance capture in-the-wild is challenging due to varied\ncapture conditions, face shapes, and expressions. Most current methods rely on\nlinear 3D Morphable Models, which represent facial expressions independently of\nidentity at the vertex displacement level. We propose SEREP (Semantic\nExpression Representation), a model that disentangles expression from identity\nat the semantic level. We start by learning an expression representation from\nhigh-quality 3D data of unpaired facial expressions. Then, we train a model to\npredict expression from monocular images relying on a novel semi-supervised\nscheme using low quality synthetic data. In addition, we introduce MultiREX, a\nbenchmark addressing the lack of evaluation resources for the expression\ncapture task. Our experiments show that SEREP outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, capturing challenging expressions and transferring them to new\nidentities.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the complex trade-offs inherent in the patent system,\nexploring whether patents truly incentivize innovation or inadvertently hinder\nprogress. It traces the historical evolution of patent rights from their\norigins in Renaissance Venice to the modern framework enshrined in\nconstitutional and international law. By balancing the exclusivity granted to\ninventors with the need for public access to knowledge, the article highlights\nhow patents stimulate R&D investments while sometimes limiting follow-on\ninnovation due to prolonged monopolies. It discusses the economic rationales\nfor patent protection, such as increasing private returns to encourage\ninvention, against criticisms that patents restrict the free flow of ideas\nessential for collective progress. Ultimately, the review argues that although\npatents are designed to reward creativity and secure economic benefits, they\nremain a contentious instrument whose benefits and limitations must be\ncarefully weighed in policy debates.",

Once\nignored, these uncertainties can lead to severe outcomes, e.g., performance\ndegradation, system untrustworthiness, inefficient resource utilization, and\nsecurity vulnerabilities. As such, this article reviews mature and emerging\narchitectural, computational, and operational countermeasures, encompassing\nuncertainty-aware designs of signals and systems (e.g., diversity, adaptivity,\nmodularity), as well as uncertainty-aware modeling and computational frameworks\n(e.g., risk-informed optimization, robust signal processing, and trustworthy\nmachine learning).

However, the extensive pre-training\ncorpora used by LLMs raise concerns that they may rely on memorizing popular\nfictional works rather than genuinely understanding and reasoning about them.\nIn this work, we argue that 'gist memory'-capturing essential meaning - should\nbe the primary mechanism for character understanding tasks, as opposed to\n'verbatim memory' - exact match of a string. We introduce a simple yet\neffective method to mitigate mechanized memorization in character understanding\nevaluations while preserving the essential implicit cues needed for\ncomprehension and reasoning. Our approach reduces memorization-driven\nperformance on popular fictional works from 96% accuracy to 72% and results in\nup to an 18% drop in accuracy across various character understanding tasks.\nThese findings underscore the issue of data contamination in existing\nbenchmarks, which often measure memorization rather than true character\nunderstanding.",

[CH$_3$NH$_3$]Ni(HCOO)$_3$ has also been found to\nhave a proper magnetic incommensurate structure in its ground state. We have\ncarried out a detailed structural characterization of the isomorphous\n[CH$_3$NH$_3$]Fe(HCOO)$_3$ (1) to investigate whether it also has\nincommensurate structural and magnetic modulations. We confirm that 1\ncrystallizes in the $Pnma$ space group at room temperature (RT) with a\nperovskite structure. Upon cooling, at about 170 K, the occurrence of new\nsatellite reflections in the diffraction pattern show a phase transition to a\nmodulated structure, which could be refined in the $Pnma(00\\gamma)0s0$ super\nspace group with $q_1~=~0.1662(2)c^\\ast$. On further cooling to 75 K the\nsatellite reflections become closer to the main reflections, indicating a new\nphase transition that keeps the super space group invariant but changes the\nmodulation wave vector, $q_2~=~0.1425(2)c^\\ast$. The structure then does not\nchange structural phase down to base temperature (2 K). Magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements collected under field-cooled and zero-field-cooled reveal a 3D\nantiferromagnetic order below 17 K. The overlapping in temperature between\nstructural modulation and long-range magnetic order presents a unique\nopportunity to study magneto-structural coupling. Our results point to an\nimproper modulated structure where interestingly the spins oriented strictly\nantiferromagnetic are perpendicular to those of previously reported compounds.\nIn the present work, a combination of magnetometry measurements, single crystal\nand powder neutron diffraction and density functional theory calculations have\nbeen used to accurately determine and understand the sequence of nuclear and\nmagnetic phases present in compound 1.",

To\ntackle this problem, we propose ResQ, a PTQ method that pushes further the\nstate-of-the-art. By means of principal component analysis (PCA), it identifies\na low-rank subspace (in practice 1/8 of the hidden dimension) in which\nactivation variances are highest, and keep the coefficients within this\nsubspace in high precision, e.g. 8-bit, while quantizing the rest to 4-bit.\nWithin each subspace, invariant random rotation is applied to further suppress\noutliers. We show that this is a provably optimal mixed precision quantization\nscheme that minimizes error. With the Llama and Qwen2.5 families of models, we\ndemonstrate that ResQ outperforms recent uniform and mixed precision PTQ\nmethods on a variety of benchmarks, achieving up to 33\\% lower perplexity on\nWikitext than the next best method SpinQuant, and upto 3\\times speedup over\n16-bit baseline.

    "abstract": "A remarkable characteristic of quantum computing is the potential for\nreliable computation despite faulty qubits. This can be achieved through\nquantum error correction, which is typically implemented by repeatedly applying\nstatic syndrome checks, permitting correction of logical information. Recently,\nthe development of time-dynamic approaches to error correction has uncovered\nnew codes and new code implementations. In this work, we experimentally\ndemonstrate three time-dynamic implementations of the surface code, each\noffering a unique solution to hardware design challenges and introducing\nflexibility in surface code realization. First, we embed the surface code on a\nhexagonal lattice, reducing the necessary couplings per qubit from four to\nthree. Second, we walk a surface code, swapping the role of data and measure\nqubits each round, achieving error correction with built-in removal of\naccumulated non-computational errors. Finally, we realize the surface code\nusing iSWAP gates instead of the traditional CNOT, extending the set of viable\ngates for error correction without additional overhead. We measure the error\nsuppression factor when scaling from distance-3 to distance-5 codes of\n$\\Lambda_{35,\\text{hex}} = 2.15(2)$, $\\Lambda_{35,\\text{walk}} = 1.69(6)$, and\n$\\Lambda_{35,\\text{iSWAP}} = 1.56(2)$, achieving state-of-the-art error\nsuppression for each. With detailed error budgeting, we explore their\nperformance trade-offs and implications for hardware design. This work\ndemonstrates that dynamic circuit approaches satisfy the demands for\nfault-tolerance and opens new alternative avenues for scalable hardware design.",

    "abstract": "Generating a bird's eye view of road users is beneficial for a variety of\napplications, including navigation, detecting agent conflicts, and measuring\nspace occupancy, as well as the ability to utilise the metric system to measure\ndistances between different objects. In this research, we introduce a simple\napproach for estimating a bird's eye view from images without prior knowledge\nof a given camera's intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. The model is based on\nthe orthogonal projection of objects from various fields of view to a bird's\neye view by learning the vanishing point of a given scene. Additionally, we\nutilised the learned vanishing point alongside the trajectory line to transform\nthe 2D bounding boxes of road users into 3D bounding information. The\nintroduced framework has been applied to several applications to generate a\nlive Map from camera feeds and to analyse social distancing violations at the\ncity scale. The introduced framework shows a high validation in geolocating\nroad users in various uncalibrated cameras. It also paves the way for new\nadaptations in urban modelling techniques and simulating the built environment\naccurately, which could benefit Agent-Based Modelling by relying on deep\nlearning and computer vision.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM) systems\nassume a static environment, which makes them ineffective in highly dynamic\nsettings. To overcome this, many approaches integrate semantic information from\ndeep learning models to identify dynamic regions within images. However, these\nmethods face a significant limitation as a supervised model cannot recognize\nobjects not included in the training datasets. This paper introduces a novel\nfeature-based Semantic VSLAM capable of detecting dynamic features in the\npresence of both known and unknown objects. By employing an unsupervised\nsegmentation network, we achieve unlabeled segmentation, and next utilize an\nobjector detector to identify any of the known classes among those. We then\npair this with the computed high-gradient optical-flow information to next\nidentify the static versus dynamic segmentations for both known and unknown\nobject classes. A consistency check module is also introduced for further\nrefinement and final classification into static versus dynamic features.\nEvaluations using public datasets demonstrate that our method offers superior\nperformance than traditional VSLAM when unknown objects are present in the\nimages while still matching the performance of the leading semantic VSLAM\ntechniques when the images contain only the known objects",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider nonparametric estimation over general Dirichlet\nmetric measure spaces. Unlike the more commonly studied reproducing kernel\nHilbert space, whose elements may be defined pointwise, a Dirichlet space\ntypically only contain equivalence classes, i.e. its elements are only unique\nalmost everywhere. This lack of pointwise definition presents significant\nchallenges in the context of nonparametric estimation, for example the\nclassical ridge regression problem is ill-posed. In this paper, we develop a\nnew technique for renormalizing the ridge loss by replacing pointwise\nevaluations with certain \\textit{local means} around the boundaries of\nobstacles centered at each data point. The resulting renormalized empirical\nrisk functional is well-posed and even admits a representer theorem in terms of\ncertain equilibrium potentials, which are truncated versions of the associated\nGreen function, cut-off at a data-driven threshold. We demonstrate that the\nrenormalized ridge estimator is rate-optimal, and derive an adaptive upper\nbound on its convergence rate that highlights the interplay between the\nanalytic, geometric, and probabilistic properties of the Dirichlet form. Our\nframework notably does not require the smoothness of the underlying space, and\nis applicable to both manifold and fractal settings. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first paper to obtain optimal, out-of-sample convergence\nguarantees in the framework of general metric measure Dirichlet spaces.",

    "abstract": "The annual influenza outbreak leads to significant public health and economic\nburdens making it desirable to have prompt and accurate probabilistic forecasts\nof the disease spread. The United States Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC) hosts annually a national flu forecasting competition which\nhas led to the development of a variety of flu forecast modeling methods.\nBeginning in 2013, the target to be forecast was weekly percentage of patients\nwith an influenza-like illness (ILI), but in 2021 the target was changed to\nweekly hospitalizations. Reliable hospitalization data has only been available\nsince 2021, but ILI data has been available since 2010 and has been\nsuccessfully forecast for several seasons. In this manuscript, we introduce a\ntwo component modeling framework for forecasting hospitalizations utilizing\nboth hospitalization and ILI data. The first component is for modeling ILI data\nusing a nonlinear Bayesian model. The second component is for modeling\nhospitalizations as a function of ILI. For hospitalization forecasts, ILI is\nfirst forecast then hospitalizations are forecast with ILI forecasts used as a\npredictor. In a simulation study, the hospitalization forecast model is\nassessed and two previously successful ILI forecast models are compared. Also\nassessed is the usefulness of including a systematic model discrepancy term in\nthe ILI model. Forecasts of state and national hospitalizations for the 2023-24\nflu season are made, and different modeling decisions are compared. We found\nthat including a discrepancy component in the ILI model tends to improve\nforecasts during certain weeks of the year. We also found that other modeling\ndecisions such as the exact nonlinear function to be used in the ILI model or\nthe error distribution for hospitalization models may or may not be better than\nother decisions, depending on the season, location, or week of the forecast.",

These results suggest\nthat naive greedy or double-oracle-based approaches are unlikely to yield\npractical algorithms.

We evaluate our methods on synthetic and real-world scenarios based\non security applications.

In this paper,\nwe carefully characterize C3 in ML on GPUs, which are most widely deployed for\nML training and inference. We observe that while C3 leads to performance\nuplifts, the uplifts are far lower than ideal speedups (serial computation and\ncommunication versus maximum of computation or communication; all times from\nisolated executions). That is, C3 on average achieves only 21% of ideal\nspeedup. This is so, due to known challenges of compute and memory interference\nbetween concurrent GPU kernels (that is, sharing of GPU's compute units, caches\nand HBM).\n  To attain better performance for C3, first, we evaluate dual strategies of\nschedule prioritization and careful resource partitioning of compute units on\nGPUs to push performance attained with C3 (on average 42% of ideal speedup). We\nalso provide heuristics that can guide a runtime while employing these\nstrategies. To further enhance C3 performance, we propose to mitigate C3\ninterference by offloading communication tasks to the GPU's DMA engines. To\nthis end, we build concurrent communication collectives (ConCCL)\nproof-of-concepts that harness DMA engines for communication. We show how\nConCCL considerably closes the gap between realized and ideal speedup for C3\n(on average 72% of ideal speedup is realized, up to 1.67x speedup).

By binning this catalog in radius or\nsurface gravity, we average out the random motion component of the radial\nvelocities for nearby white dwarfs to isolate the gravitational redshifts for\nthese objects and use them to directly measure the mass-radius relation. For\ngravitational redshifts measured from binning in either radius or surface\ngravity, we find strong evidence for a temperature-dependent mass-radius\nrelation, with warmer white dwarfs consistently having greater gravitational\nredshifts than cool objects at a fixed radius or surface gravity. For warm\nwhite dwarfs, we find that their mean radius is larger and mean surface gravity\nis smaller than those of cool white dwarfs at 5.2{\\sigma} and 6.0{\\sigma}\nsignificance, respectively. Selecting white dwarfs with similar radii or\nsurface gravities, the significance of the difference in mean gravitational\nredshifts between the warm and cool samples is >6.1{\\sigma} and >3.6{\\sigma}\nfor measurements binned in radius and surface gravity, respectively, in the\ndirection predicted by theory. This is an improvement over previous implicit\ndetections, and our technique can be expanded to precisely test the white dwarf\nmass-radius relation with future surveys.",

    "abstract": "The existence of planes of satellite galaxies has been identified as a\nlong-standing challenge to $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology, due to the rarity of\nsatellite systems in cosmological simulations that are as extremely flattened\nand as strongly kinematically correlated as observed structures. Here we\ninvestigate a recently proposed new metric to measure the overall degree of\n''planarity'' of a satellite system, which was used to claim consistency\nbetween the Milky Way satellite plane and $\\Lambda$CDM. We study the behavior\nof the ''planarity'' metric under several features of anisotropy present in\n$\\Lambda$CDM satellite systems but unrelated to satellite planes. Specifically,\nwe consider the impact of oblate or prolate distributions, the number of\nsatellites, clustering of satellites, and radial and asymmetric distributions\n('lopsidedness'). We also investigate whether the metric is independent of the\norientation of the studied satellite system. We find that all of these features\nof anisotropy result in the metric inferring an increased degree of\n''planarity'', despite none of them having any direct relation to satellite\nplanes. The metric is also highly sensitive to the orientation of the studied\nsystem (or chosen coordinate system): there is almost no correlation between\nthe metric's reported degrees of ''planarity'' for identical random systems\nrotated by 90{\\deg}. Our results demonstrate that the new proposed metric is\nunsuitable to measure overall ''planarity'' in satellite systems. Consequently,\nno consistency of the observed Milky Way satellite plane with $\\Lambda$CDM can\nbe inferred using this metric.",

We study this paradigm using the\nsimple yet effective Best-of-N (BoN) inference strategy, in which a verifier\nselects the best out of a set of LLM-generated responses. We devise the first\nimitation learning and reinforcement learning~(RL) methods for BoN-aware\nfine-tuning, overcoming the challenging, non-differentiable argmax operator\nwithin BoN. We empirically demonstrate that our BoN-aware models implicitly\nlearn a meta-strategy that interleaves best responses with more diverse\nresponses that might be better suited to a test-time input -- a process\nreminiscent of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in RL. Our experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of BoN-aware fine-tuning in terms of improved\nperformance and inference-time compute.

However, these models\nare often difficult to deploy due to significant computational requirements and\nresource constraints. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective technique for\ntransferring the performance of larger LLMs to smaller models. Traditional KD\nmethods primarily focus on the direct output of the teacher model, with little\nemphasis on the role of prompting during knowledge transfer. In this paper, we\npropose a set of novel response-priming prompting strategies applied in the\nknowledge distillation pipeline to enhance the performance of student models.\nOur approach fine-tunes a smaller Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model by distilling\nknowledge from a quantized Llama 3.1 405B Instruct teacher model. We apply LoRA\noptimization and evaluate on the GSM8K benchmark. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that integrating reasoning-eliciting prompting into the proposed KD\npipeline significantly improves student model performance, offering an\nefficient way to deploy powerful models in resource-constrained environments.\nWe find that Ground Truth prompting results in a 55\\% performance increase on\nGSM8K for a distilled Llama 3.1 8B Instruct compared to the same model\ndistilled without prompting. A thorough investigation into the self-attention\nlayers of the student models indicates that the more successful prompted models\ntend to exhibit certain positive behaviors inside their attention heads which\ncan be tied to their increased accuracy.

We show that the number of edge\nstates is not simply described by the bulk invariants of the lattice (i.e., the\nChern number and the Floquet winding number) as would be the case in static\nlattices and in lattices subject to smooth modulations. The number of edge\nstates is also determined by a topological invariant associated to the\ndiscrete-step unitary operators acting at the edges of the lattice. This\nsituation goes beyond the usual bulk-edge correspondence and allows\nmanipulating the number of edge states without the need to go through a gap\nclosing transition.

Here we introduce\nthe class of planon-modular (p-modular) fracton orders, a relatively simple yet\nstill rich class of quantum orders that encompasses several well-known examples\nof type I fracton order. The defining property is that any non-trivial\npoint-like excitation can be detected by braiding with planons. From this\ndefinition, we uncover a significant amount of general structure, including the\nassignment of a natural number (dubbed the weight) to each excitation of a\np-modular fracton order. We identify simple new phase invariants, some of which\nare based on weight, which can easily be used to compare and distinguish\ndifferent fracton orders. We also study entanglement renormalization group (RG)\nflows of p-modular fracton orders, establishing a close connection with\nfoliated RG. We illustrate our general results with an analysis of several\nexactly solvable fracton models that we show to realize p-modular fracton\norders, including Z_n versions of the X-cube, anisotropic, checkerboard,\n4-planar X-cube and four color cube (FCC) models.

    "abstract": "Filtering is concerned with online estimation of the state of a dynamical\nsystem from partial and noisy observations. In applications where the state is\nhigh dimensional, ensemble Kalman filters are often the method of choice. This\npaper establishes long-time accuracy of ensemble Kalman filters. We introduce\nconditions on the dynamics and the observations under which the estimation\nerror remains small in the long-time horizon. Our theory covers a wide class of\npartially-observed chaotic dynamical systems, which includes the Navier-Stokes\nequations and Lorenz models. In addition, we prove long-time accuracy of\nensemble Kalman filters with surrogate dynamics, thus validating the use of\nmachine-learned forecast models in ensemble data assimilation.",

    "abstract": "Multipartite entangled states are fundamental resources for multi-user\nquantum cryptographic tasks. Despite significant advancements in generating\nlarge-scale continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, particularly the dual-rail\ncluster state because of its utility in measurement-based quantum computation,\nits application in quantum cryptography has remained largely unexplored. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel protocol for generating three user conference\nkeys using a CV dual-rail cluster state. We develop the concept of a quotient\ngraph state by applying a node coloring scheme to the infinite dual-rail graph,\nresulting in a six-mode pure graph state suitable for cryptographic\napplications. Our results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves\nperformance close to that of GHZ-based protocols for quantum conference key\nagreement (QCKA), with GHZ states performing slightly better. However, a key\nadvantage of our protocol lies in its ability to generate bipartite keys\npost-QCKA, a feature not achievable with GHZ states. Additionally, compared to\na downstream access network using two-mode squeezed vacuum states, our protocol\nachieves superior performance in generating bipartite keys. Furthermore, we\nextend our analysis to the finite-size regime and consider the impact of using\nimpure squeezed states for generating the multipartite entangled states,\nreflecting experimental imperfections. Our findings indicate that even with\nfinite resources and non-ideal state preparation, the proposed protocol\nmaintains its advantages. We also introduce a more accurate method to estimate\nthe capacity of a protocol to generate bipartite keys in a quantum network.",

    "abstract": "In a graph bisection problem, we are given a graph $G$ with two equally-sized\nunlabeled communities, and the goal is to recover the vertices in these\ncommunities. A popular heuristic, known as spectral clustering, is to output an\nestimated community assignment based on the eigenvector corresponding to the\nsecond smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$. Spectral algorithms can be\nshown to provably recover the cluster structure for graphs generated from\ncertain probabilistic models, such as the Stochastic Block Model (SBM).\nHowever, spectral clustering is known to be non-robust to model\nmis-specification. Techniques based on semidefinite programming have been shown\nto be more robust, but they incur significant computational overheads.\n  In this work, we study the robustness of spectral algorithms against\nsemirandom adversaries. Informally, a semirandom adversary is allowed to\n``helpfully'' change the specification of the model in a way that is consistent\nwith the ground-truth solution. Our semirandom adversaries in particular are\nallowed to add edges inside clusters or increase the probability that an edge\nappears inside a cluster. Semirandom adversaries are a useful tool to determine\nthe extent to which an algorithm has overfit to statistical assumptions on the\ninput.\n  On the positive side, we identify classes of semirandom adversaries under\nwhich spectral bisection using the _unnormalized_ Laplacian is strongly\nconsistent, i.e., it exactly recovers the planted partitioning. On the negative\nside, we show that in these classes spectral bisection with the _normalized_\nLaplacian outputs a partitioning that makes a classification mistake on a\nconstant fraction of the vertices. Finally, we demonstrate numerical\nexperiments that complement our theoretical findings.",

However, the success of learning and generalization heavily depends on\nthe quality of these demonstrations. Consistency is often used to indicate\nquality in LfD, yet the factors that define this consistency remain\nunderexplored. In this paper, we evaluate a comprehensive set of motion data\ncharacteristics to determine which consistency measures best predict learning\nperformance. By ensuring demonstration consistency prior to training, we\nenhance models' predictive accuracy and generalization to novel scenarios. We\nvalidate our approach with two user studies involving participants with diverse\nlevels of robotics expertise. In the first study (N = 24), users taught a PR2\nrobot to perform a button-pressing task in a constrained environment, while in\nthe second study (N = 30), participants trained a UR5 robot on a pick-and-place\ntask. Results show that demonstration consistency significantly impacts success\nrates in both learning and generalization, with 70% and 89% of task success\nrates in the two studies predicted using our consistency metrics. Moreover, our\nmetrics estimate generalized performance success rates with 76% and 91%\naccuracy. These findings suggest that our proposed measures provide an\nintuitive, practical way to assess demonstration data quality before training,\nwithout requiring expert data or algorithm-specific modifications.

This adaptation is especially crucial when significant\ndisparities in data distributions exist between the two domains and when there\nare privacy concerns regarding the source model's training data. The absence of\naccess to source data during adaptation makes it challenging to analytically\nestimate the domain gap. To tackle this issue, various techniques have been\nproposed, such as unsupervised clustering, contrastive learning, and continual\nlearning. In this paper, we first conduct an extensive theoretical analysis of\nSFDA based on contrastive learning, primarily because it has demonstrated\nsuperior performance compared to other techniques. Motivated by the obtained\ninsights, we then introduce a straightforward yet highly effective latent\naugmentation method tailored for contrastive SFDA. This augmentation method\nleverages the dispersion of latent features within the neighborhood of the\nquery sample, guided by the source pre-trained model, to enhance the\ninformativeness of positive keys. Our approach, based on a single InfoNCE-based\ncontrastive loss, outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods on widely\nrecognized benchmark datasets.",

The framework offers several advantages,\nincluding adaptability to any number of classes and logical constraints, an\ninnovative method for managing class imbalance, the elimination of confidence\nthreshold selection, and a modular structure. Two experiments were conducted to\ncompare the performance of conventional classification models with the\nMultiplex approach. Our results demonstrate that the Multiplex approach can\nimprove classification performance significantly (up to 10% gain in overall F1\nscore), particularly in classification problems with a large number of classes\nand pronounced class imbalances. However, it also has limitations, as it\nrequires a thorough understanding of the problem domain and some experience\nwith ontology engineering, and it involves training multiple models, which can\nmake the whole process more intricate.

The joint-modeling strategy can be unnecessarily\nconservative when we have more information on the source of distributional\nshifts. This paper studies a more nuanced problem -- robust policy learning\nunder the concept drift, when only the conditional relationship between the\noutcome and the covariate changes. To this end, we first provide a\ndoubly-robust estimator for evaluating the worst-case average reward of a given\npolicy under a set of perturbed conditional distributions. We show that the\npolicy value estimator enjoys asymptotic normality even if the nuisance\nparameters are estimated with a slower-than-root-$n$ rate. We then propose a\nlearning algorithm that outputs the policy maximizing the estimated policy\nvalue within a given policy class $\\Pi$, and show that the sub-optimality gap\nof the proposed algorithm is of the order $\\kappa(\\Pi)n^{-1/2}$, where\n$\\kappa(\\Pi)$ is the entropy integral of $\\Pi$ under the Hamming distance and\n$n$ is the sample size.

Further analyses of models with dynamical dark energy and free curvature\nshow a consistent trend of reduced $\\omega_m$, accompanied by slight increases\nin both $n_s$ and $H_0$.

To\nthis end, we illustrate how several other states from paradigmatic topological\nand fracton ordered phases can function as resources for suitably defined\nnonlocal games, notably the three-dimensional toric-code phase, the X-cube\nfracton phase, and the double-semion phase. The key in every case is to design\na nonlocal game that harnesses the characteristic braiding processes of a\nquantum phase as a source of contextuality. We unify the strategies that take\nadvantage of mutual statistics by relating the operators to be measured to\norder and disorder parameters of an underlying generalized symmetry-breaking\nphase transition. Finally, we massively generalize the family of games that\nadmit perfect strategies when codewords of homological quantum error-correcting\ncodes are used as resources.",

    "abstract": "Given a finite set satisfying condition $\\mathcal{A}$, the subset selection\nproblem asks, how large of a subset satisfying condition $\\mathcal{B}$ can we\nfind? We make progress on three instances of subset selection problems in\nplanar point sets. Let $n,s\\in\\mathbb{N}$ with $n\\geq s$, and let\n$P\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^2$ be a set of $n$ points, where at most $s$ points lie\non the same line.\n  Firstly, we select a general position subset of $P$, i.e., a subset\ncontaining no $3$ points on the same line. This problem was proposed by\nErd\\H{o}s under the regime when $s$ is a constant. For $s$ being non-constant,\nwe give new lower and upper bounds on the maximum size of such a subset. In\nparticular, we show that in the worst case such a set can have size at most\n$O(n/s)$ when $n^{1/3}\\leq s\\leq n$ and $O(n^{5/6+o(1)}/\\sqrt{s})$ when $3\\leq\ns\\leq n^{1/3}$.\n  Secondly, we select a monotone general position subset of $P$, that is, a\nsubset in general position where the points are ordered from left to right and\ntheir $y$-coordinates are either non-decreasing or non-increasing. We present\nbounds on the maximum size of such a subset. In particular, when\n$s=\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, our upper and lower bounds differ only by a logarithmic\nfactor.\n  Lastly, we select a subset of $P$ with pairwise distinct slopes. This problem\nwas initially studied by Erd\\H{o}s, Graham, Ruzsa, and Taylor on the grid. We\nshow that for $s=O(\\sqrt{n})$ such a subset of size $\\Omega((n/\\log{s})^{1/3})$\ncan always be found in $P$. When $s=\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$, this matches a lower\nbound given by Zhang on the grid. As for the upper bound, we show that in the\nworst case such a subset has size at most $O(\\sqrt{n})$ for $2\\leq s\\leq\nn^{3/8}$ and $O((n/s)^{4/5})$ for $n^{3/8}\\leq s=O(\\sqrt{n})$.\n  The proofs use a wide range of tools such as incidence geometry,\nprobabilistic methods, the hypergraph container method, and additive\ncombinatorics.",

If $S$ is\ncommutative or left cancellative, it is known that these three notions\ncoincide. We shall show that these notions coincide for every semigroup $S$\nwhich satisfies the Strong Folner Condition. Using this fact, we solve a\nproblem that has been open for decades, showing that the set of ultrafilters\nevery member of which has positive Folner density is a two sided ideal of\n$\\beta S$. We also show that, if $S$ is a left amenable semigroup, then the set\nof ultrafilters every member of which has positive Banach density is a two\nsided ideal of $\\beta S$. We investigate the density properties of subsets of\n$S$ in the case in which the minimal left ideals of the Stone-\\v{C}ech\ncompactification $\\beta S$ are singletons. This occurs in many familiar\nexamples, including all semilattices and all semigroups which have a right\nzero. We show that this is equivalent to the statement that $S$ satisfies the\nStrong Folner Condition and that, for every subset $A$ of $S$, $d(A)\\in\n\\{0,1\\}$. We also examine the relation between the density properties of two\nsemigroups when one is a quotient of the other. The Folner density of a subset\nof $S$ is always determined by some Folner net in $S$. We show that an\narbitrary Folner net in $S$ determines the density of all of the subsets of\n$S$.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to minimize the inference delay in\nsemantic segmentation using split learning (SL), tailored to the needs of\nreal-time computer vision (CV) applications for resource-constrained devices.\nSemantic segmentation is essential for applications such as autonomous vehicles\nand smart city infrastructure, but faces significant latency challenges due to\nhigh computational and communication loads. Traditional centralized processing\nmethods are inefficient for such scenarios, often resulting in unacceptable\ninference delays. SL offers a promising alternative by partitioning deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) between edge devices and a central server, enabling localized\ndata processing and reducing the amount of data required for transmission. Our\ncontribution includes the joint optimization of bandwidth allocation, cut layer\nselection of the edge devices' DNN, and the central server's processing\nresource allocation. We investigate both parallel and serial data processing\nscenarios and propose low-complexity heuristic solutions that maintain\nnear-optimal performance while reducing computational requirements. Numerical\nresults show that our approach effectively reduces inference delay,\ndemonstrating the potential of SL for improving real-time CV applications in\ndynamic, resource-constrained environments.",

Split Learning (SL) allows a model to\nbe trained in a split manner across different locations.

SplitFed minimizes the computational burden of FL by balancing\ncomputation across clients and servers, while still preserving data privacy.\nThis makes it an ideal learning framework across various domains, especially in\nhealthcare, where data privacy is of utmost importance. However, SplitFed\nnetworks encounter numerous communication challenges, such as latency,\nbandwidth constraints, synchronization overhead, and a large amount of data\nthat needs to be transferred during the learning process.

    "abstract": "We construct a protocol to adiabatically prepare the ground state of a widely\ndiscussed number-conserving model Hamiltonian for ultracold atoms in optical\nlattices that supports Majorana edge states. In particular, we introduce a\nsymmetry breaking mass term that amounts to threading a commensurate\n(artificial) magnetic flux through the plaquettes of the considered two-leg\nladder which opens a constant bulk gap. This enables the preparation of the\ntopological Majorana phase from a trivial Mott insulator state with optimal\nasymptotic scaling of the ramp time in system size, which is linear owing to\nthe critical nature of the target state. Using constructive bosonization\ntechniques that account for both finite size effects and global fermion number\nconservation, we are able to fully explain with theory the somewhat\ncounterintuitive necessity of the aforementioned commensurate flux for a\ncontrolled bulk gap. Our analytical predictions are corroborated and quantified\nby unbiased numerical matrix product states (MPS) simulations. Directly\nbuilding up on previous experimental work, the crucial flux-term of the\nproposed protocol is feasible with state-of-the-art experimental techniques in\natomic quantum simulators.",

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes have been central to recent\ndevelopments in infrared physics. Gravitational waves reaching the asymptotic\nboundary reveal an infinite-dimensional symmetry group known as the\nBondi--Metzner--Sachs (BMS) group. The vacuum structure breaks this symmetry,\ngiving rise to Goldstone modes that play a pivotal role in the analysis of\nscattering amplitudes. However, these modes must be added to the phase space of\nthe metric formulation. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of\ngeneral relativity, teleparallel gravity, which is dynamically equivalent to\nthe standard metric description in the bulk. This framework relies on a tetrad\nfield to encode the gravitational degrees of freedom and a flat connection to\nrepresent inertial effects. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose a novel\nencoding of the Goldstone modes within the flat connection. We examine the\nimplications of this approach in the covariant phase space framework, focusing\non the symplectic potential and its connection to the Wald--Zoupas\nprescription.",

In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy\nblack holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the\neffective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and\nminima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes\ntrapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays\nechoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly,\nthe black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level.\nBy performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present\neven when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the\nfirst example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized\nanalysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also\npresent in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.",

    "abstract": "Quantum error correction is essential for bridging the gap between the error\nrates of physical devices and the extremely low logical error rates required\nfor quantum algorithms. Recent error-correction demonstrations on\nsuperconducting processors have focused primarily on the surface code, which\noffers a high error threshold but poses limitations for logical operations. In\ncontrast, the color code enables much more efficient logic, although it\nrequires more complex stabilizer measurements and decoding techniques.\nMeasuring these stabilizers in planar architectures such as superconducting\nqubits is challenging, and so far, realizations of color codes have not\naddressed performance scaling with code size on any platform. Here, we present\na comprehensive demonstration of the color code on a superconducting processor,\nachieving logical error suppression and performing logical operations. Scaling\nthe code distance from three to five suppresses logical errors by a factor of\n$\\Lambda_{3/5}$ = 1.56(4). Simulations indicate this performance is below the\nthreshold of the color code, and furthermore that the color code may be more\nefficient than the surface code with modest device improvements. Using logical\nrandomized benchmarking, we find that transversal Clifford gates add an error\nof only 0.0027(3), which is substantially less than the error of an idling\nerror correction cycle. We inject magic states, a key resource for universal\ncomputation, achieving fidelities exceeding 99% with post-selection (retaining\nabout 75% of the data). Finally, we successfully teleport logical states\nbetween distance-three color codes using lattice surgery, with teleported state\nfidelities between 86.5(1)% and 90.7(1)%. This work establishes the color code\nas a compelling research direction to realize fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation on superconducting processors in the near future.",

However, in certain regions of the $Z^\\prime$ parameter space, the\ncontributions to meson mixing observables become negligibly small even for\nlarge $Z^\\prime$ couplings. While this a priori allows for significant new\nphysics (NP) effects in FCNC decays, we discuss how large $Z^\\prime$ couplings\nin one neutral meson sector can generate effects in meson mixing observables of\nother neutral mesons, through correlations stemming from $\\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge\ninvariance and through Renormalization Group (RG) effects in the SM Effective\nField Theory (SMEFT). This is illustrated with the example of $B_s^0-\\bar\nB_s^0$ mixing, which in the presence of both left- and right-handed $Z^\\prime\nbs$ couplings $\\Delta_L^{bs}$ and $\\Delta_R^{bs}$ remains SM-like for\n$\\Delta_R^{bs}\\approx 0.1\\,\\Delta_L^{bs}$. We show that in this case, large\n$Z^\\prime bs$ couplings generate effects in $D$ and $K$ meson mixing\nobservables, but that the $D$ and $K$ mixing constraints and the relation\nbetween $\\Delta_R^{bs}$ and $\\Delta_L^{bs}$ are fully compatible with a lepton\nflavour universality (LFU) conserving explanation of the most recent $b\\to\ns\\ell^+\\ell^-$ experimental data without violating other constraints like $e^+\ne^-\\to\\ell^+\\ell^-$ scattering. Assuming LFU, invariance under the\n$\\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry leads then to correlated effects in $b\\to\ns\\nu\\bar\\nu$ observables presently studied intensively by the Belle II\nexperiment, which allow to probe the $Z^\\prime$ parameter space that is opened\nup by the vanishing NP contributions to $B_s^0-\\bar B_s^0$ mixing.

We find that the large $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{\\rm star}$ ratios can be\nexplained if light and heavy BH seeds grow by short, repeated episodes of\nsuper-Eddington accretion, triggered by major galaxy mergers.

Instead of imposing hermiticity by adding ad hoc\nterms, I renormalize the field by a scaling function, which is related to the\ndeterminant of the metric, and then regularize the renormalized field on a\ndiscrete lattice. I found that, for time-independent and diagonal metrics such\nas the Rindler, de~Sitter, and anti-de~Sitter metrics, the Dirac equation\nreturns a hermitian or pseudohermitian ($\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) Hamiltonian\nwhen properly regularized on the lattice. Notably, the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry\nis unbroken in the pseudohermitian cases, assuring a real energy spectrum with\nunitary time evolution. Conversely, considering a more general class of\ntime-dependent metrics, which includes the Weyl metric, the Dirac equation\nreturns a nonhermitian Hamiltonian with nonunitary time evolution. Arguably,\nthis nonhermicity is physical, with the time dependence of the metric\ncorresponding to local nonhermitian processes on the lattice and nonunitary\ngrowth or decay of the time evolution of the field.

In\nthis analysis, we perform the first Blinded Mock Data Challenge\n(\\texttt{Blinded-MDC}) to test the robustness in inferring the value of Hubble\nconstant $H_0$ for a dark siren technique which depends on astrophysical mass\ndistribution of Binary Black Holes (BBHs). We have considered different\nanalysis setups for the \\texttt{Blinded-MDC} to test both statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties and demonstrate the capabilities in inferring $H_0$\nwith detector sensitivity as per the fourth observation run of\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that when the astrophysical population of BBHs\nmatches with the underlying assumption of the model, a cosmological pipeline\ncan recover the injected parameters using the observed mass distribution.\nHowever, when the mock mass distribution of the astrophysical population\ndepends slightly on redshift and one is ignorant about it in analyzing the\ndata, it can cause a systematic discrepancy in the inferred value of $H_0$ by\nabout $1.5\\sigma$, above the statistical fluctuations due to noise and a\nlimited number of events. In the future, elaborate studies will be required to\nmitigate systematic uncertainties due to unknown astrophysical complexities.\nThis MDC framework sets the road map for inspecting the precision and accuracy\nof standard siren cosmology and provides the first insight into the robustness\nof the population-dependent cosmology inference in a blinded analysis setup.",

They are characterized by\na red color in the rest-frame optical band, compact morphology, and broad\nBalmer emission lines (${\\rm FWHM} \\gtrsim 1000~{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$) that suggest\nan AGN nature. Using a method of pixel-by-pixel color selection and relaxing\nthe compactness criteria, we identify three of the first dual LRD candidates in\nthe COSMOS-Web survey with projected separations of\n$0.\\!\\!^{\\prime\\prime}2-0.\\!\\!^{\\prime\\prime}4$ (1-2 pkpc at their photometric\nredshifts). A comparison between existing LRD samples and mock data reveals\nthat the projected separations of these dual LRD candidates are unlikely to\nresult from chance projections of objects at different redshifts. In one case\n(CW-B5-15958), the dual LRD includes two bright sources ($m_{\\rm F444W}=24.3$\nand $24.8$) with characteristic V-shape spectral energy distribution (SEDs) and\nphotometric redshifts consistent with each other. We find that CW-B5-15958 has\na faint off-centered component and a companion galaxy. In the other two dual\nsystems, the brighter LRD exhibits a V-shape SED, while the fainter LRD\n($m_{\\rm F444W}\\gtrsim26$) is undetected in both F115W and F150W. These\ndiscoveries suggest that the angular auto-correlation function (ACF) of LRDs\nexhibits a significant excess ($\\sim3\\times10^2$ times) on sub-arcsec\n(kilo-parsec) separations compared to the extrapolation of a power-law ACF of\nJWST-found AGNs measured over $10^{\\prime\\prime}-100^{\\prime\\prime}$.

The subleading jet in\nthis topology is practically equivalent to a secondary Lund jet plane. We\ndemonstrate by means of fixed-order calculations that such a simple setup\nyields gluon jet fractions of around 90% for the subleading jet for both quark-\nand gluon-initiated jets. This observation is confirmed using hadron-level\nMonte Carlo generated events. We also show that the extracted gluon purities\nare highly resilient to the overall colour structure of the event, to the\nflavour of the hard-scattering process, and to the parton distribution\nfunctions. This strategy is well-suited for constraining the radiation pattern\nof gluon-initiated jets using a set of fiducial cuts that can readily be tested\nat the LHC, without relying on taggers or statistical demixing.",

For different\npossible non-singlet fermion portals, we calculate the upper bound on the\nmediator's mass arising from the relic abundance calculation and discuss the\nreach of a future muon collider in probing their viable parameter space in\nprompt and long-lived particle search strategies. In particular, we develop\nrudimentary search strategies in the prompt region and show that cuts on the\ninvariant dilepton or dijet masses, the missing transverse mass $M_{T2}$,\npseudorapidity and energy of leptons or jets, and the opening angle between the\nlepton or the jet pair can be employed to subtract the Standard Model\nbackground. In the long-lived particle regime, we discuss the signals of each\nmodel and calculate their event counts. In this region, the\nlepton-(quark-)portal model signal consists of charged tracks ($R$-hadrons)\nthat either decay in the detector to give rise to a displaced lepton (jet)\nsignature, or are detector stable and give rise to heavy stable charged track\nsignals. As a byproduct, a pipeline is developed for including the non-trivial\nparton distribution function of a muon component inside a muon beam; it is\nshown that this leads to non-trivial effects on the kinematic distributions and\nattainable significances. We also highlight phenomenological features of all\nmodels unique to a muon collider and hope our results, for this motivated and\nbroad class of dark matter models, inform the design of a future muon collider\ndetector. We also speculate on suggestions for improving the sensitivity of a\nmuon collider detector to long-lived particle signals in fermion-portal models.",

NOVA also outperforms state-of-the-art image diffusion models\nin text-to-image generation tasks, with a significantly lower training cost.\nAdditionally, NOVA generalizes well across extended video durations and enables\ndiverse zero-shot applications in one unified model.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models with continuous tokens for\nimage generation show promising results by eliminating the need for discrete\ntokenization. However, these models face efficiency challenges due to their\nsequential token generation nature and reliance on computationally intensive\ndiffusion-based sampling. We present ECAR (Efficient Continuous Auto-Regressive\nImage Generation via Multistage Modeling), an approach that addresses these\nlimitations through two intertwined innovations: (1) a stage-wise continuous\ntoken generation strategy that reduces computational complexity and provides\nprogressively refined token maps as hierarchical conditions, and (2) a\nmultistage flow-based distribution modeling method that transforms only\npartial-denoised distributions at each stage comparing to complete denoising in\nnormal diffusion models. Holistically, ECAR operates by generating tokens at\nincreasing resolutions while simultaneously denoising the image at each stage.\nThis design not only reduces token-to-image transformation cost by a factor of\nthe stage number but also enables parallel processing at the token level. Our\napproach not only enhances computational efficiency but also aligns naturally\nwith image generation principles by operating in continuous token space and\nfollowing a hierarchical generation process from coarse to fine details.\nExperimental results demonstrate that ECAR achieves comparable image quality to\nDiT Peebles & Xie [2023] while requiring 10$\\times$ FLOPs reduction and\n5$\\times$ speedup to generate a 256$\\times$256 image.",

It takes multi-modal\ninput (i.e., text prompt, parametric human model, garment image, and face\nimage) and supports personalizing the appearance, pose, and figure of the human\nand assigning multiple garments in one pass. To achieve this, we first develop\na universal framework capable of handling diverse input modalities. We\nconstruct scaled training data to enhance the model's robust compositional\ncapabilities. To accommodate multiple reference images (garments and faces)\nseamlessly, we organize these references in a single image as an \"asset\nlibrary\" and employ a reference UNet to extract appearance features. To inject\nthe appearance features into the correct pixels in the generated result, we\npropose subject-binding attention. It binds the appearance features from\ndifferent \"assets\" with the corresponding text features. In this way, the model\ncould understand each asset according to their semantics, supporting arbitrary\nnumbers and types of reference images.

To enable scalable data generation,\nour key idea is eliminating semantic information, removing the need to model\ncomplex semantic priors such as object affordances and scene composition.\nInstead, we model scenes with basic spatial structures and geometry primitives,\noffering scalability. Besides, we control data complexity to facilitate\ntraining while loosely aligning it with real-world data distribution to benefit\nreal-world generalization. We explore training LRMs with both MegaSynth and\navailable real data. Experiment results show that joint training or\npre-training with MegaSynth improves reconstruction quality by 1.2 to 1.8 dB\nPSNR across diverse image domains. Moreover, models trained solely on MegaSynth\nperform comparably to those trained on real data, underscoring the low-level\nnature of 3D reconstruction.

VPiT teaches an LLM to predict discrete\ntext tokens and continuous visual tokens from any input sequence of image and\ntext data curated in an instruction-following format. Our empirical\ninvestigation reveals several intriguing properties of VPiT: (1) visual\ngeneration ability emerges as a natural byproduct of improved visual\nunderstanding, and can be unlocked efficiently with a small amount of\ngeneration data; (2) while we find understanding and generation to be mutually\nbeneficial, understanding data contributes to both capabilities more\neffectively than generation data. Building upon these findings, we train our\nMetaMorph model and achieve competitive performance on both visual\nunderstanding and generation. In visual generation, MetaMorph can leverage the\nworld knowledge and reasoning abilities gained from LLM pretraining, and\novercome common failure modes exhibited by other generation models.

Traditional methods, such as the discrete\nwavelet transform, cannot achieve compression ratios of 8 or higher for complex\nturbulent flows without introducing significant encoding/decoding errors. On\nthe other hand, a super-resolution-based generative adversarial network\n(SR-GAN), called ZipGAN, can accurately reconstruct fine-scale features,\npreserving velocity gradients and structural details, even at a compression\nratio of 512, thanks to the more efficient representation of the data in\ncompact latent space. Additional benefits are ascribed to adversarial training.\nThe high GAN training time is significantly reduced with a progressive transfer\nlearning approach and, once trained, they can be applied independently of the\nReynolds number. It is demonstrated that ZipGAN can enhance dataset temporal\nresolution without additional simulation overhead by generating high-quality\nintermediate fields from compressed snapshots. The ZipGAN discriminator can\nreliably evaluate the quality of decoded fields, ensuring fidelity even in the\nabsence of original DNS fields. Hence, ZipGAN compression/decompression method\npresents a highly efficient and scalable alternative for large-scale DNS\nstorage and transfer, offering substantial advantages over the DWT methods in\nterms of compression efficiency, reconstruction fidelity, and temporal\nresolution enhancement.",

The\nstrength of the coupling is governed solely by the initial condition of the\nscalar field, $\\phi_i$, which parametrises deviations from the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. In this model, the scalar field tracks the behaviour of DM\nduring matter-domination until it transitions to DE while the DM component\ndecays quicker than standard CDM during matter-domination, and is therefore\ndifferent from some interacting DM-DE models which behaves like phantom dark\nenergy. Using \\textit{Planck} 2018 CMB data, DESI BAO measurements and\nPantheon+ supernova observations, we find that the model allows for an increase\nin $H_0$ that can help reduce the Hubble tension. In addition, we find that\nhigher values of the coupling parameter are correlated with lower values of\n$\\omega_m$, and a mild decrease of the weak-lensing parameter $S_8$,\npotentially relevant to address the $S_8$ tension.

    "abstract": "The dynamics of polymer melts at the crossover between unentagled and\nentangled regimes is formalized here through an extension of the Cooperative\nDynamics Generalized Langevin Equation (CDGLE) (\\textit{J. Chem. Phys.}\n110,7574 (1999)), by including the constraint to the dynamics due to\nentanglements through an effective inter-monomer potential that confines the\nmotion of the chains. As one polymer chain in a melt interpenetrates with a\n$\\sqrt{N}$ other chains, with $N$ the degree of chain polymerization, their\ndynamics is coupled through their potential of mean-force, leading to chains'\ncooperative motion and center-of-mass subdiffusive dynamics. When increasing\nthe degree of polymerization, the extended CDGLE approach describes the\ndynamical behavior of unentangled to weakly entangled systems undergoing\ncooperative dynamics. By direct comparison of the CDGLE with data of Neutron\nSpin Echo (NSE) experiments on polyethylene melts we find that the cooperative\ndynamics in entangled systems are confined in the region delimited by\nentanglements. We extend the CDGLE to describe linear dynamical mechanical\nmeasurements and use it to calculate shear relaxation for the polyethylene\nsamples investigated by NSE. The effects of cooperative dynamics, local\nflexibility, and entanglements in the shear relaxation are discussed. It is\nnoteworthy that the theoretical approach describes with accuracy the crossover\nfrom unentangled to entangled-global dynamics for polyethylene melts of\nincreasing chain length, covering the regimes of unentangled and weakly\nentangled (up to $13$ entanglements) dynamics in one approach.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated\nexceptional results in various visual recognition tasks, owing to their ability\nto capture long-range dependencies in images through self-attention mechanisms.\nHowever, the complex nature of ViT models requires robust explainability\nmethods to unveil their decision-making processes. Explainable Artificial\nIntelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in improving model transparency and\ntrustworthiness by providing insights into model predictions. Current\napproaches to ViT explainability, based on visualization techniques such as\nLayer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and gradient-based methods, have shown\npromising but sometimes limited results. In this study, we explore a hybrid\napproach that mixes multiple explainability techniques to overcome these\nlimitations and enhance the interpretability of ViT models. Our experiments\nreveal that this hybrid approach significantly improves the interpretability of\nViT models compared to individual methods. We also introduce modifications to\nexisting techniques, such as using geometric mean for mixing, which\ndemonstrates notable results in object segmentation tasks. To quantify the\nexplainability gain, we introduced a novel post-hoc explainability measure by\napplying the Pigeonhole principle. These findings underscore the importance of\nrefining and optimizing explainability methods for ViT models, paving the way\nto reliable XAI-based segmentations.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trials or studies oftentimes require long-term and/or costly\nfollow-up of participants to evaluate a novel treatment/drug/vaccine. There has\nbeen increasing interest in the past few decades in using short-term surrogate\noutcomes as a replacement of the primary outcome i.e., in using the surrogate\noutcome, which can potentially be observed sooner, to make inference about the\ntreatment effect on the long-term primary outcome. Very few of the available\nstatistical methods to evaluate a surrogate are applicable to settings where\nboth the surrogate and the primary outcome are time-to-event outcomes subject\nto censoring. Methods that can handle this setting tend to require parametric\nassumptions or be limited to assessing only the restricted mean survival time.\nIn this paper, we propose a non-parametric approach to evaluate a censored\nsurrogate outcome, such as time to progression, when the primary outcome is\nalso a censored time-to-event outcome, such as time to death, and the treatment\neffect of interest is the difference in overall survival. Specifically, we\ndefine the proportion of the treatment effect on the primary outcome that is\nexplained (PTE) by the censored surrogate outcome in this context, and estimate\nthis proportion by defining and deriving an optimal transformation of the\nsurrogate information. Our approach provides the added advantage of relaxed\nassumptions to guarantee that the true PTE is within (0,1), along with being\nmodel-free. Finite sample performance of our estimators are illustrated via\nextensive simulation studies and a real data application examining\nprogression-free survival as a surrogate for overall survival for patients with\nmetastatic colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "In clinical trials where long follow-up is required to measure the primary\noutcome of interest, there is substantial interest in using an accepted\nsurrogate outcome that can be measured earlier in time or with less cost to\nestimate a treatment effect. For example, in clinical trials of chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD), the effect of a treatment is often demonstrated on a surrogate\noutcome, the longitudinal trajectory of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\nHowever, estimating the effect of a treatment on the GFR trajectory is\ncomplicated by the fact that GFR measurement can be terminated by the\noccurrence of a terminal event, such as death or kidney failure. Thus, to\nestimate this effect, one must consider both the longitudinal outcome of GFR,\nand the terminal event process. Available estimation methods either impose\nrestrictive parametric assumptions with corresponding maximum likelihood\nestimation that is computationintensive or other assumptions not appropriate\nfor the GFR setting. In this paper, we build a semiparametric framework to\njointly model the longitudinal outcome and the terminal event, where the model\nfor the longitudinal outcome is semiparametric, and the relationship between\nthe longitudinal outcome and the terminal event is nonparametric. The proposed\nsemiparametric joint model is flexible and can be extended to include nonlinear\ntrajectory of the longitudinal outcome easily. An estimating equation based\nmethod is proposed to estimate the treatment effect on the slope of the\nlongitudinal outcome (e.g., GFR slope). Theoretical properties of the proposed\nestimators are derived. Finite sample performance of the proposed method is\nevaluated through simulation studies. We illustrate the proposed method using\ndata from the Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II\nAntagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trail to examine the effect of Losartan on GFR\nslope.",

Methods: Seventy-seven\npatients (54 females, mean age 45.4 (SD 10.4) years) with a clinically\nestablished diagnosis of FMD, including weakness, completed symptom diaries,\nrating the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms (i.e., pain, fatigue, mood,\ncognitive difficulties) on a 10-point numerical scale three times daily for\nseven consecutive days.

Results: The mental component of SF-36 was\njointly predicted by the overall severity scores (t(74) = -3.61, P < 0.001) and\noverall general fluctuations (t(74) = -2.98, P = 0.004). The physical SF-36 was\nfound to be related only to the overall symptom severity scores (t(74) = -7.09,\nP < 0.001), but not to the overall fluctuations. The assessment of the impact\nof different components showed that the mental component of SF-36 was\nsignificantly influenced by the combined effect of average fatigue (t(73) =\n-3.86, P < 0.001), between-day cognitive symptoms fluctuations (t(73) = -3.22,\nP = 0.002), and within-day mood fluctuations (t(73) = -2.48, P = 0.015).\nConclusions: This study demonstrated the impact of self-reported symptom\nfluctuations across multiple motor and non-motor domains on mental but not\nphysical HRQoL in FMD and highlighted the importance of assessing and managing\nfluctuations in clinical practice.",

To answer\nthese questions, this paper provides a comprehensive review of trustworthy\ntransfer learning from various aspects, including problem definitions,\ntheoretical analysis, empirical algorithms, and real-world applications.\nSpecifically, we summarize recent theories and algorithms for understanding\nknowledge transferability under (within-domain) IID and non-IID assumptions. In\naddition to knowledge transferability, we review the impact of trustworthiness\non transfer learning, e.g., whether the transferred knowledge is adversarially\nrobust or algorithmically fair, how to transfer the knowledge under\nprivacy-preserving constraints, etc. Beyond discussing the current\nadvancements, we highlight the open questions and future directions for\nunderstanding transfer learning in a reliable and trustworthy manner.",

    "abstract": "We tackle the problem of bundle adjustment (i.e., simultaneous refinement of\ncamera poses and scene map) for a purely rotating event camera. Starting from\nfirst principles, we formulate the problem as a classical non-linear least\nsquares optimization. The photometric error is defined using the event\ngeneration model directly in the camera rotations and the semi-dense scene\nbrightness that triggers the events. We leverage the sparsity of event data to\ndesign a tractable Levenberg-Marquardt solver that handles the very large\nnumber of variables involved. To the best of our knowledge, our method, which\nwe call Event-based Photometric Bundle Adjustment (EPBA), is the first\nevent-only photometric bundle adjustment method that works on the brightness\nmap directly and exploits the space-time characteristics of event data, without\nhaving to convert events into image-like representations. Comprehensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate EPBA's\neffectiveness in decreasing the photometric error (by up to 90%), yielding\nresults of unparalleled quality. The refined maps reveal details that were\nhidden using prior state-of-the-art rotation-only estimation methods. The\nexperiments on modern high-resolution event cameras show the applicability of\nEPBA to panoramic imaging in various scenarios (without map initialization, at\nmultiple resolutions, and in combination with other methods, such as IMU dead\nreckoning or previous event-based rotation estimation methods).

This approach avoids fine-tuning and preserves the\ngeneralizing power of the original depth estimation model while being robust to\nthe noise of the sparse depth or of the depth model. Our experiments highlight\nenhancements relative to zero-shot monocular metric depth estimation methods,\ncompetitive results compared to fine-tuned approaches and a better robustness\nthan depth completion approaches.

Au plasmonic\nnear-field transducers are an attractive solution to this challenge, but\nincreased thermal stability of Au films is required to improve long-term\nreliability. This work compares the effect of nanoscale Al, AlOx, and Ta\ncapping films on Au thin films with Ti or Ta adhesion layers for use in HAMR\nand other high-temperature plasmonic applications. Thermal stability is\ninvestigated using a bespoke laser dewetting system, and SEM and AFM are\nextensively used to interrogate the resulting dewet areas. The most effective\ncapping layers are found to be 0.5-1 nm of Al or AlOx, which can eliminate\ndewetting under certain conditions. Even one monolayer of AlOx is shown to be\nhighly effective in reducing dewetting. In the case of thicker capping layers\nof Ta and AlOx, the Au film can easily dewet underneath, leaving an intact\ncapping layer. It is concluded that thinner capping layers are most effective\nagainst dewetting as the Au cannot dewet without breaking them and pulling them\napart during the dewetting process. A simple model based on energetics\nconsiderations is developed, which explains how thinner capping layers can more\neffectively protect the metal from pore or fissure creation. The model provides\nsome convenient guidelines for choosing both the substrate and capping layer,\nfor a given metal, to maximize the resistance to laser-induced damage.",

Multiple lingering issues exist including\ndomain-shift and applications in low-resource settings which brings a unique\nset of challenges including scarcity of data. As a step towards solving these\nspecific problems, we propose Convolutional adapter-inspired\nParameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) of MedNeXt architecture. To validate our\nidea, we show our method performs comparable to full fine-tuning with the added\nbenefit of reduced training compute using BraTS-2021 as pre-training dataset\nand BraTS-Africa as the fine-tuning dataset. BraTS-Africa consists of a small\ndataset (60 train / 35 validation) from the Sub-Saharan African population with\nmarked shift in the MRI quality compared to BraTS-2021 (1251 train samples). We\nfirst show that models trained on BraTS-2021 dataset do not generalize well to\nBraTS-Africa as shown by 20% reduction in mean dice on BraTS-Africa validation\nsamples. Then, we show that PEFT can leverage both the BraTS-2021 and\nBraTS-Africa dataset to obtain mean dice of 0.8 compared to 0.72 when trained\nonly on BraTS-Africa. Finally, We show that PEFT (0.80 mean dice) results in\ncomparable performance to full fine-tuning (0.77 mean dice) which may show PEFT\nto be better on average but the boxplots show that full finetuning results is\nmuch lesser variance in performance. Nevertheless, on disaggregation of the\ndice metrics, we find that the model has tendency to oversegment as shown by\nhigh specificity (0.99) compared to relatively low sensitivity(0.75).

    "abstract": "For many purposes, classical plasma dynamics models can work surprisingly\nwell even for strong electromagnetic fields, approaching the Schwinger critical\nfields, and high frequencies, approaching the Compton frequency. However, the\napplicability of classical models tends to depend rather sensitively on the\ndetails of the problem. In the present paper, we study the specific case of\nplasma oscillations to draw a line between the classical and quantum\nrelativistic regimes. Due to the field geometry of study, mechanisms like\nradiation reaction and Breit-Wheeler pair production, which tend to be\nimportant for electromagnetic fields, are rather effectively suppressed.\nMoreover, we find that the polarization current due to the electron spin is\ngenerally negligible for frequencies below the Compton frequency, compared to\nthe free current, whose magnitude is well-approximated by the classical Vlasov\ntheory. However, we show that pair creation due to the Schwinger mechanism can\nsometimes be important for surprisingly modest field strengths, of the order of\n10 % of the critical field or even smaller. A rough guideline for when the\nclassical Vlasov theory can be applied is given",

The rich, expressive feature representations from these\npre-trained, large-scale FMs are leveraged for multiple downstream tasks,\nusually via lightweight fine-tuning of a shallow fully-connected network\nfollowing the representation. However, the non-interpretable, black-box nature\nof this prediction pipeline can be a challenge, especially in critical domains\nsuch as healthcare, finance, and security. In this paper, we explore the\npotential of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for transforming complex,\nnon-interpretable foundation models into interpretable decision-making\npipelines using high-level concept vectors. Specifically, we focus on the\ntest-time deployment of such an interpretable CBM pipeline \"in the wild\", where\nthe input distribution often shifts from the original training distribution. We\nfirst identify the potential failure modes of such a pipeline under different\ntypes of distribution shifts. Then we propose an adaptive concept bottleneck\nframework to address these failure modes, that dynamically adapts the\nconcept-vector bank and the prediction layer based solely on unlabeled data\nfrom the target domain, without access to the source (training) dataset.\nEmpirical evaluations with various real-world distribution shifts show that our\nadaptation method produces concept-based interpretations better aligned with\nthe test data and boosts post-deployment accuracy by up to 28%, aligning the\nCBM performance with that of non-interpretable classification.",

We find the model\ncomplies with harmful queries from free users 14% of the time, versus almost\nnever for paid users.

Next, we study a more realistic setting where\ninformation about the training process is provided not in a system prompt, but\nby training on synthetic documents that mimic pre-training data--and observe\nsimilar alignment faking. Finally, we study the effect of actually training the\nmodel to comply with harmful queries via reinforcement learning, which we find\nincreases the rate of alignment-faking reasoning to 78%, though also increases\ncompliance even out of training. We additionally observe other behaviors such\nas the model exfiltrating its weights when given an easy opportunity.

The travel demand calibration problem is formulated as\na continuous, high-dimensional, simulation-based optimization (SO) problem with\nbound constraints.

    "abstract": "Perception and prediction modules are critical components of autonomous\ndriving systems, enabling vehicles to navigate safely through complex\nenvironments. The perception module is responsible for perceiving the\nenvironment, including static and dynamic objects, while the prediction module\nis responsible for predicting the future behavior of these objects. These\nmodules are typically divided into three tasks: object detection, object\ntracking, and motion prediction. Traditionally, these tasks are developed and\noptimized independently, with outputs passed sequentially from one to the next.\nHowever, this approach has significant limitations: computational resources are\nnot shared across tasks, the lack of joint optimization can amplify errors as\nthey propagate throughout the pipeline, and uncertainty is rarely propagated\nbetween modules, resulting in significant information loss. To address these\nchallenges, the joint perception and prediction paradigm has emerged,\nintegrating perception and prediction into a unified model through multi-task\nlearning. This strategy not only overcomes the limitations of previous methods,\nbut also enables the three tasks to have direct access to raw sensor data,\nallowing richer and more nuanced environmental interpretations. This paper\npresents the first comprehensive survey of joint perception and prediction for\nautonomous driving.

The resulting estimate\nof the sphere free energy $F$ in the 3D Ising model has turned out to be in\ngood agreement with the numerical value obtained using the fuzzy sphere\nregularization. In this paper, we develop the $6-\\epsilon$ expansions for CFTs\non $S^d$ described by scalar field theory with cubic interactions and use their\nresummations to estimate the values of $F$. In particular, we study the\ntheories with purely imaginary coupling constants, which describe non-unitary\nuniversality classes arising when certain conformal minimal models are\ncontinued above two dimensions. The Yang-Lee model $M(2,5)$ is described by a\nfield theory with one scalar field, while the $D$-series $M(3,8)$ model is\ndescribed by two scalar fields. We also study the $OSp(1|2)$ symmetric cubic\ntheory of one commuting and two anti-commuting scalar fields, which appears to\ndescribe the critical behavior of random spanning forests. In the course of our\nwork, we revisit the calculations of beta functions of marginal operators\ncontaining the curvature.

    "abstract": "Transition-metal phthalocyanine molecules have attracted considerable\ninterest in the context of spintronics device development due to their\namenability to diverse bonding regimes and their intrinsic magnetism. The\nlatter is highly influenced by the quantum fluctuations that arise at the\ninevitable metal-molecule interface in a device architecture. In this study, we\nhave systematically investigated the dynamical screening effects in\nphthalocyanine molecules hosting a series of transition-metal ions (Ti, V, Cr,\nMn, Fe, Co, and Ni) in contact with the Cu(111) surface. Using comprehensive\ndensity functional theory plus Anderson's Impurity Model calculations, we show\nthat the orbital-dependent hybridization and electron correlation together\nresult in strong charge and spin fluctuations. While the instantaneous spin\nmoments of the transition-metal ions are near atomic-like, we find that\nscreening gives rise to considerable lowering or even quenching of these. Our\nresults highlight the importance of quantum fluctuations in metal-contacted\nmolecular devices, which may influence the results obtained from theoretical or\nexperimental probes, depending on their possibly material-dependent\ncharacteristic sampling time-scales.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes dialogue as a method for evaluating generative AI tools\nfor culturally-situated creative practice, that recognizes the socially\nsituated nature of art. Drawing on sociologist Howard Becker's concept of Art\nWorlds, this method expands the scope of traditional AI and creativity\nevaluations beyond benchmarks, user studies with crowd-workers, or focus groups\nconducted with artists. Our method involves two mutually informed dialogues: 1)\n'dialogues with art worlds' placing artists in conversation with experts such\nas art historians, curators, and archivists, and 2)'dialogues with the\nmachine,' facilitated through structured artist- and critic-led experimentation\nwith state-of-the-art generative AI tools. We demonstrate the value of this\nmethod through a case study with artists and experts steeped in non-western art\nworlds, specifically the Persian Gulf. We trace how these dialogues help create\nculturally rich and situated forms of evaluation for representational\npossibilities of generative AI that mimic the reception of generative artwork\nin the broader art ecosystem. Putting artists in conversation with commentators\nalso allow artists to shift their use of the tools to respond to their cultural\nand creative context. Our study can provide generative AI researchers an\nunderstanding of the complex dynamics of technology, human creativity and the\nsocio-politics of art worlds, to build more inclusive machines for diverse art\nworlds.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks continue to struggle with compositional generalization, and\nthis issue is exacerbated by a lack of massive pre-training. One successful\napproach for developing neural systems which exhibit human-like compositional\ngeneralization is \\textit{hybrid} neurosymbolic techniques. However, these\ntechniques run into the core issues that plague symbolic approaches to AI:\nscalability and flexibility. The reason for this failure is that at their core,\nhybrid neurosymbolic models perform symbolic computation and relegate the\nscalable and flexible neural computation to parameterizing a symbolic system.\nWe investigate a \\textit{unified} neurosymbolic system where transformations in\nthe network can be interpreted simultaneously as both symbolic and neural\ncomputation. We extend a unified neurosymbolic architecture called the\nDifferentiable Tree Machine in two central ways. First, we significantly\nincrease the model's efficiency through the use of sparse vector\nrepresentations of symbolic structures. Second, we enable its application\nbeyond the restricted set of tree2tree problems to the more general class of\nseq2seq problems. The improved model retains its prior generalization\ncapabilities and, since there is a fully neural path through the network,\navoids the pitfalls of other neurosymbolic techniques that elevate symbolic\ncomputation over neural computation.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider an online robust Markov Decision Process (MDP)\nwhere we have the information of finitely many prototypes of the underlying\ntransition kernel. We consider an adaptively updated ambiguity set of the\nprototypes and propose an algorithm that efficiently identifies the true\nunderlying transition kernel while guaranteeing the performance of the\ncorresponding robust policy. To be more specific, we provide a sublinear regret\nof the subsequent optimal robust policy. We also provide an early stopping\nmechanism and a worst-case performance bound of the value function. In\nnumerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\napproaches, particularly in the early stage with limited data. This work\ncontributes to robust MDPs by considering possible prior information about the\nunderlying transition probability and online learning, offering both\ntheoretical insights and practical algorithms for improved decision-making\nunder uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Exoplanets on close-in orbit are subject to intense X-ray and ultraviolet\n(XUV) irradiation from their star. Their atmosphere therefore heats up,\nsometimes to the point where it thermally escapes from the gravitational\npotential of the planet. Nonetheless, XUV is not the only source of heating in\nsuch atmospheres. Indeed, close-in exoplanets are embedded in a medium (the\nstellar wind) with strong magnetic fields that can significantly vary along the\norbit. The variations of this magnetic field can induce currents in the upper\natmosphere, which dissipate and locally heat it up through Ohmic heating. The\naim of this work is to quantify Ohmic heating in the upper atmosphere of hot\nexoplanets due to an external time-varying magnetic field, and to compare it to\nthe XUV heating. Ohmic heating depends strongly on the conductivity properties\nof the upper atmosphere. A 1D formalism is developed to assess the level and\nthe localization of Ohmic heating depending on the conductivity profile, and\napplied to the specific cases of Trappist-1 b and $\\pi$ Men c. Ohmic heating\ncan reach values up to 10$^{-3}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the upper\natmospheres of hot exoplanets. It is expected to be stronger the closer the\nplanet is and the lower the central star mass is, as these conditions maximize\nthe strength of the ambient magnetic field around the planet. We confirm that\nOhmic heating can play an important role in setting the thermal budget of the\nupper atmosphere of hot exoplanets, and can even surpass the XUV heating in the\nmost favorable cases. When it is strong, a corollary is that the upper\natmosphere screens efficiently time-varying external magnetic fields,\npreventing them to penetrate deeper in the atmosphere or inside the planet\nitself. We find that both Trappist-1b and $\\pi$ Men c are likely subject to\nintense Ohmic heating.",

We predict observable features in magnetic resonance and anisotropic\nparamagnetic spin susceptibility for the spin helix and the magnon-induced\nsingularity, serving as experimental indicators of the interplay between the\nKondo lattice and sliding Luttinger liquids.

On the other hand, EOMs are\nchallenging regarding their control voltage regulation as they experience a\nbias drift, i.e. voltage shifts in the modulator's operating point. Such a\nshift significantly impairs the quality of the modulation, which is why EOMs\nusually require a bias control loop to track the DC operating point. This work\naddresses the estimation of the instantaneous bias voltage using a small pilot\ntone, where the optical output power of the EOM is tracked by a photodetector\nfeedback signal.",

By injecting\naction components into the VLMs, Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can be\nnaturally formed and also show promising performance. Existing work has\ndemonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of VLAs in multiple scenarios\nand tasks. Nevertheless, the transfer from VLMs to VLAs is not trivial since\nexisting VLAs differ in their backbones, action-prediction formulations, data\ndistributions, and training recipes. This leads to a missing piece for a\nsystematic understanding of the design choices of VLAs. In this work, we\ndisclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA\nand focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to\nselect, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add\ncross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why\nwe need VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few\nmanual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three\nsimulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments,\nwhich include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600\ndistinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future\ndesign of VLAs. In addition to the study, the highly flexible RoboVLMs\nframework, which supports easy integrations of new VLMs and free combinations\nof various design choices, is made public to facilitate future research.

    "abstract": "Text Normalization and Semantic Parsing have numerous applications in natural\nlanguage processing, such as natural language programming, paraphrasing, data\naugmentation, constructing expert systems, text matching, and more. Despite the\nprominent achievements of deep learning in Large Language Models (LLMs), the\ninterpretability of neural network architectures is still poor, which affects\ntheir credibility and hence limits the deployments of risk-sensitive scenarios.\nIn certain scenario-specific domains with scarce data, rapidly obtaining a\nlarge number of supervised learning labels is challenging, and the workload of\nmanually labeling data would be enormous. Catastrophic forgetting in neural\nnetworks further leads to low data utilization rates. In situations where swift\nresponses are vital, the density of the model makes local deployment difficult\nand the response time long, which is not conducive to local applications of\nthese fields. Inspired by the multiplication rule, a principle of combinatorial\nmathematics, and human thinking patterns, a multilayer framework along with its\nalgorithm, the Digestion Algorithm in Hierarchical Symbolic Forests (DAHSF), is\nproposed to address these above issues, combining text normalization and\nsemantic parsing workflows. The Chinese Scripting Language \"Fire Bunny\nIntelligent Development Platform V2.0\" is an important test and application of\nthe technology discussed in this paper.

    "abstract": "Sterile neutrinos are a simple yet compelling addition to the Standard Model.\nFor right-handed neutrinos with masses below the electroweak scale,\nleptogenesis can proceed through CP-violating oscillations of the sterile\nneutrinos. This is known as ARS or freeze-in leptogenesis. However, the ARS\nscenario requires the right-handed neutrinos to have a high degree of mass\ndegeneracy. In this work, we study an extension of the SM that introduces a\nscalar singlet in addition to the two sterile neutrinos required to generate\nthe baryon asymmetry. The new scalar interacts with the sterile neutrinos via a\nYukawa interaction. This leads to an additional rate for the production and\ndestruction of the sterile neutrinos and to a novel contribution to the\neffective potential. For the case in which the mass and the new Yukawa matrices\nare not diagonal in the same basis, we find that the effective potential can\nboost the baryon asymmetry of the universe by several orders of magnitude. This\nsignificantly alleviates the fine-tuned mass condition required in vanilla ARS\nleptogenesis.",

The hypothesis is that the\ndeepest hole of a pR1 map determines the orientation and location of a missing\nfragment. In current implementation, the calculation is divided into two steps.\nThe first step is to detect possible orientations of all missing fragments by\nthe holes of a pR1 map of a free-standing fragment in a 3-dimensional\norientation space. The second step is to determine the orientation and location\nof a missing fragment. To this end, if done strictly, all the candidate\norientations are tried. With each candidate orientation, the best choice of\nlocation of the missing fragment is determined by the deepest hole of a pR1 map\nin a 3-dimensional location space. This best choice is combined with the trial\norientation to form one candidate orientation-location. After trying all\ncandidate orientations, a list of candidate orientation-locations are formed,\nfrom which, the one with the lowest R1 determines the orientation and location\nof a missing fragment. Then a newer pR1 is defined by including the atoms of\nthis newly determined fragment into the known atoms. This newer pR1 is used to\ndetermine the next missing fragment in the same way. To shorten the calculation\ntime, the possible locations of all missing fragments can be predicted by the\nholes of a pR1 map of a completely disoriented model of a fragment.

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates how pre-knowledge of a crystal structure, including\nthe constituent fragments, the atomic connectivity, and the approximate bond\nlengths, etc., can be utilized in the partial-structure R1 (pR1) and the\nsingle-atom R1 (sR1) calculations. It has been shown that taking advantage of\npre-known information the calculations can proceed in an orderly and\nwell-planned manner. Furthermore, in the case of the sR1 calculation, computer\ntime can also be greatly reduced. Because the pR1 calculation is more\ntime-consuming than the sR1 calculation, when there is a choice between the pR1\nand the sR1, the former should be avoided. So, the usual strategy of assembling\na light-atom-only structure should start with the normal sR1 method to\ndetermine a basic framework of the structure, and then uses the\nconnectivity-guided sR1 method to complete the model. However, when the data\nresolution is low, the first step is necessary to use the pR1 method to\nassemble the known fragments. For a heavy-atom-containing structure, the\ncorrect strategy starts with the normal sR1 method to determine the heavy-atom\nsubstructure, and then uses the connectivity-guided sR1 to complete the model.",

However, their varied designs, operational\nconditions, and influent characteristics hinder straightforward automation. In\nthis study, we use data from a pilot reactor at the Veas treatment facility in\nNorway to explore how machine learning can be used to optimize biological\nnitrate ($\\mathrm{NO_3^-}$) reduction to molecular nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N_2}$) in\nthe biogeochemical process known as \\textit{denitrification}. Rather than\nfocusing solely on predictive accuracy, our approach prioritizes understanding\nthe foundational requirements for effective data-driven modelling of wastewater\ntreatment. Specifically, we aim to identify which process parameters are most\ncritical, the necessary data quantity and quality, how to structure data\neffectively, and what properties are required by the models. We find that\nnonlinear models perform best on the training and validation data sets,\nindicating nonlinear relationships to be learned, but linear models transfer\nbetter to the unseen test data, which comes later in time. The variable\nmeasuring the water temperature has a particularly detrimental effect on the\nmodels, owing to a significant change in distributions between training and\ntest data. We therefore conclude that multiple years of data is necessary to\nlearn robust machine learning models. By addressing foundational elements,\nparticularly in the context of the climatic variability faced by northern\nregions, this work lays the groundwork for a more structured and tailored\napproach to machine learning for wastewater treatment.

The transition into the nematic phase is further shown to belong\nto the two-dimensional Ising universality class based on the critical exponents\nnear the phase transition. Our large-scale stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert\nsimulations find a two-stage phase ordering when the system is quenched from a\nhigh-temperature paramagnetic state into the nematic phase. In the early stage,\ncollinear alignments of spins lead to a locally saturated Ising-nematic order.\nOnce domains of well-defined Ising order are developed, the late-stage\nrelaxation is dominated by curvature-driven domain coarsening, as described by\nthe Allen-Cahn equation. The characteristic size of Ising-nematic domains\nscales as the square root of time, similar to the kinetic Ising model described\nby the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our results confirm that the\nlate-stage ordering kinetics of the spin-driven nematic, which is a vestigial\norder of the frustrated Heisenberg model, belongs to the dynamical universality\nclass of a non-conserved Ising order. Interestingly, the system shows no\nviolation of the superuniversality hypothesis under weak bond disorder. The\ndynamic scaling invariance is preserved in the presence of weak bond disorder.\nWe also discuss possible applications of our results to materials for which\nvestigial Ising-nematic order is realized.",

The first method presented in\nthis paper builds upon the existing conjugate priors method by weighting the\ncalibrators by a physically motivated factor, thereby avoiding singularities\nand normalising the noise. The second method fits polynomials to the noise wave\nparameters by marginalising over the polynomial coefficients and sampling the\npolynomial orders as parameters. The third method introduces a physically\nmotivated noise model to the marginalised polynomial method. Running these\nmethods on a suite of simulated datasets based on the REACH receiver design and\na lab dataset, we found that our methods produced a calibration solution which\nis equally as or more accurate than the existing conjugate priors method when\ncompared with an analytic estimate of the calibrator's noise.

In this context,\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for\nextracting causal knowledge from text-based metadata, which consolidates domain\nexpertise. However, LLMs tend to be unreliable and prone to hallucinations,\nnecessitating strategies that account for their limitations. One effective\nstrategy is to use a consistency measure to assess reliability. Additionally,\nmost text metadata does not clearly distinguish direct causal relationships\nfrom indirect ones, further complicating the discovery of a causal DAG. As a\nresult, focusing on causal orders, rather than causal DAGs, emerges as a more\npractical and robust approach. We present a new method to derive a class of\nacyclic tournaments, which represent plausible causal orders, maximizing a\nconsistency score derived from an LLM. Our approach starts by calculating\npairwise consistency scores between variables, resulting in a semi-complete\npartially directed graph that consolidates these scores into an abstraction of\nthe maximally consistent causal orders. Using this structure, we identify\noptimal acyclic tournaments, focusing on those that maximize consistency across\nall configurations. We subsequently show how both the abstraction and the class\nof causal orders can be used to estimate causal effects. We tested our method\non both well-established benchmarks, as well as, real-world datasets from\nepidemiology and public health.

    "abstract": "Surgical video generation can enhance medical education and research, but\nexisting methods lack fine-grained motion control and realism. We introduce\nSurgSora, a framework that generates high-fidelity, motion-controllable\nsurgical videos from a single input frame and user-specified motion cues.\nUnlike prior approaches that treat objects indiscriminately or rely on\nground-truth segmentation masks, SurgSora leverages self-predicted object\nfeatures and depth information to refine RGB appearance and optical flow for\nprecise video synthesis. It consists of three key modules: (1) the Dual\nSemantic Injector, which extracts object-specific RGB-D features and\nsegmentation cues to enhance spatial representations; (2) the Decoupled Flow\nMapper, which fuses multi-scale optical flow with semantic features for\nrealistic motion dynamics; and (3) the Trajectory Controller, which estimates\nsparse optical flow and enables user-guided object movement. By conditioning\nthese enriched features within the Stable Video Diffusion, SurgSora achieves\nstate-of-the-art visual authenticity and controllability in advancing surgical\nvideo synthesis, as demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative\ncomparisons. Our human evaluation in collaboration with expert surgeons further\ndemonstrates the high realism of SurgSora-generated videos, highlighting the\npotential of our method for surgical training and education.

The research consisted of two\nstudies, both within the framework of engaging messages used by secondary\neducation teachers. The first study involved training two large language models\non real-world examples from audio-recorded lessons over two academic years to\nidentify and classify the engaging messages from the lessons' transcripts. This\nresulted in sensitivities of 84.31% and 91.11%, and specificities of 97.69% and\n86.36% in identification and classification, respectively. The second study\napplied these models to transcripts of audio-recorded lessons from a third\nacademic year to examine the frequency and distribution of message types by\neducational level and moment of the academic year. Results showed teachers\npredominantly use messages emphasising engagement benefits, linked to improved\noutcomes, while one-third highlighted non-engagement disadvantages, associated\nwith increased anxiety. The use of engaging messages declined in Grade 12 and\ntowards the academic year's end.

The current early detection models perform \"black\nbox\" inference suffering from limited explainability and trust which blocks the\nreal-world clinical application. Thanks to the generative properties introduced\nby the Large Language Models (LLMs), the decision and the prediction from such\nmodels are semi-interpretable through the corresponding description.

To this end, we first highlight the\nimportance of prior theory with the observation of performance boosted by the\nchain-of-thoughts tailored for stress detection.

Using Parallel Tempering Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we determine the code's fundamental error threshold. Firstly, for\nthe phenomenological noise setting we determine a threshold of $6\\%$ under\nuniform depolarizing and syndrome noise. This is a substantial improvement\ncompared to results obtained via the previously known \"uncoupled\" random\nplaquette gauge model (RPGM) in the identical setting, where marginalizing\nY-errors leads to a threshold of $4.3\\%$. Secondly, we tackle the circuit-level\nnoise scenario, where we use a reduction technique to find effective asymmetric\ndepolarizing and syndrome noise rates to feed into the RCPGM mapping. Despite\nthis reduction technique breaking up some of the correlations contained in the\nintricacies of circuit-level noise, we find an improvement exceeding that for\nthe phenomenological case. We report a threshold of up to $1.4\\%$, to be\ncompared to $0.7\\%$ under the identical noise model when marginalizing the\nY-errors and mapping to the anisotropic RPGM. These results enlarge the\nlandscape of statistical mechanical mappings for quantum error correction. In\nparticular they provide an underpinning for the broadly held belief that\naccounting for Y-errors is a major bottleneck in improving surface code\ndecoders. This is highly encouraging for leading efficient practical decoder\ndevelopment, where heuristically accounting for Y-error correlations has seen\nrecent developments such as belief-matching. This suggests that there is\nfurther room for improvement of the surface code for fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation.",

Higgins et al. [PNAS 118\n(11) e2018240118 (2021)] used Redfield theory to link the experimental\nobservations to altered exciton transfer rates due to oxidative onsite energy\nshifts that detune excitonic energy gaps from a specific vibrational frequency\nof the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) a. Using a memory kernel formulation of the\nhierarchical equations of motion, we present non-perturbative estimations of\ntransfer rates that yield a modified physical picture. Our findings indicate\nthat onsite energy shifts alone cannot reproduce the observed rate changes in\noxidative environments, either qualitatively or quantitatively. By\nsystematically examining combined changes both in site energies and the local\nenvironment for the oxidised complex, while maintaining consistency with\nabsorption spectra, our results suggest that vibronic tuning of transfer rates\nmay indeed be active in the reduced complex. However, we achieve qualitative,\nbut not quantitative, agreement with the experimentally measured rates. Our\nanalysis indicates potential limitations of the FMO electronic Hamiltonian,\nwhich was originally derived by fitting spectra to second-order cumulant and\nRedfield theories.

Employing neural network (NN) as controllers however, presents its\nown challenge: that of certifying stability due to their inherent complex\nnonlinearity, and while NN controllers have demonstrated high performance in\ncomplex systems, they often lack formal stability guarantees. This issue is\nfurther accentuated for critical nonlinear applications such as of unmanned\naerial vehicles (UAVs), complicating their stability guarantees, whereas a lack\nof stability assurance raises the risk of critical damage or even complete\nfailure under a loss of control. In this study, we improve a Robust, Optimal,\nSafe and Stability Guaranteed Training (ROSS-GT) method of [1] to design an NN\ncontroller for a quadcopter flight control. The approach ensures closed-loop\nsystem stability by finding a Lyapunov function, and providing a safe initial\nstate domain that remains invariant under the control and guarantees stability\nto an equilibrium within it. Stability guaranteeing constraints are derived\nfrom the sector bound of the system nonlinearity and of its parameters and\ndisturbance variations, in the form of a Lipschitz bound for a NN control. The\ncontrol performance is further optimized by searching over the class of\nstability-guaranteeing controllers to minimize the reference tracking error and\nthe control costs.",

We focus on the correlation functions relevant\nto inelastic light scattering from anisotropic superconductors and show that\nnodal regions of the order parameters are, quite generally, associated with\nlinear-in-frequency scaling at low frequencies, the minima points of the order\nparameters are associated with step jumps, while the maxima points are\nassociated with $\\ln$ singularities. Despite this general association, we show\nthat depending on the anisotropy of the light-scattering vertex, these features\ncan manifest themselves as various power laws, and even not remain singular at\nall. We demonstrate the conditions under which these happen. We are also able\nto demonstrate that the association of these nonanalytic features with the\nextrema and nodal points of the order parameter is, in fact, derived from a\nmore universal behaviour of functions near parabolic-like and saddle-like\nstationary points. We provide a general prescription that maps the universal\nbehaviour of systems near such stationary points to different scenarios.

In a power system\nrelying significantly on RES, such events can pose a risk for maintaining\nresource adequacy, i.e. the balance between generation and demand, particularly\nif they occur over a large geographical area and for an extended period of\ntime. This risk is further emphasized in periods of cold ('kalte') temperature,\nknown as 'kalte dunkelflaute'.\n  In this paper, we perform a literature review of different methods to\nidentify dunkelflaute events from hourly RES production and load data alone. We\nthen validate three of these methods by comparing their results with periods of\nshortage identified from a detailed power system simulation model used by grid\noperators (ERAA2023). Strengths and weaknesses of these methods are discussed\nin terms of their data requirements, ease of application, and skill in\ndetecting dunkelflaute events.\n  We find that all three 'dunkelflaute' event detection methods have some\nability to identify potential energy shortages, but none are able to detect all\nevents. Most likely other factors such as the presence of energy storage\ncapacity, non-weather-dependent outages, and model-related factors limit the\nskill of these methods. We find that all three methods perform best if the\nresidual load is used as input, rather than hourly RES production or load\nalone. Overall, we find that Otero'22 is the method that yields the best\nresults while being straightforward to implement and requiring only data with\ndaily resolution.

    "abstract": "Language models are increasingly being incorporated as components in larger\nAI systems for various purposes, from prompt optimization to automatic\nevaluation. In this work, we analyze the construct validity of four recent,\ncommonly used methods for measuring text-to-image consistency - CLIPScore,\nTIFA, VPEval, and DSG - which rely on language models and/or VQA models as\ncomponents. We define construct validity for text-image consistency metrics as\na set of desiderata that text-image consistency metrics should have, and find\nthat no tested metric satisfies all of them. We find that metrics lack\nsufficient sensitivity to language and visual properties. Next, we find that\nTIFA, VPEval and DSG contribute novel information above and beyond CLIPScore,\nbut also that they correlate highly with each other. We also ablate different\naspects of the text-image consistency metrics and find that not all model\ncomponents are strictly necessary, also a symptom of insufficient sensitivity\nto visual information. Finally, we show that all three VQA-based metrics likely\nrely on familiar text shortcuts (such as yes-bias in QA) that call their\naptitude as quantitative evaluations of model performance into question.",

Through the integration of diverse LLMs, the overall\ncompetency of LLMs is significantly boosted. Nevertheless, traditional ensemble\nmethods are notably memory-intensive, necessitating the simultaneous loading of\nall specialized models into GPU memory. To address the inefficiency, model\nmerging strategies have emerged, merging all LLMs into one model to reduce the\nmemory footprint during inference. Despite these advances, model merging often\nleads to parameter conflicts and performance decline as the number of experts\nincreases. Previous methods to mitigate these conflicts include post-pruning\nand partial merging. However, both approaches have limitations, particularly in\nterms of performance and storage efficiency when merged experts increase. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce Channel Merging, a novel strategy\ndesigned to minimize parameter conflicts while enhancing storage efficiency.\nThis method clusters and merges channel parameters based on their similarity to\nform several groups offline. By ensuring that only highly similar parameters\nare merged within each group, it significantly reduces parameter conflicts.\nDuring inference, we can instantly look up the expert parameters from the\nmerged groups, preserving specialized knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat Channel Merging consistently delivers high performance, matching unmerged\nmodels in tasks like English and Chinese reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and\ncode generation. Moreover, it obtains results comparable to model ensemble with\njust 53% parameters when used with a task-specific router.",

Optical properties are of\nparticular importance as they determine specific device applications and can\nalso be used for phase identification. However, a direct comparison of optical\npolymorph signatures, including such critical parameters as bandgaps, is\nchallenging due to the scattered, limited, or even absent data for certain\nphases in the literature.

A central longstanding\nproblem concerns the development of a theory of coarsening that rests on the\nmicroscopic properties of the system and allows identifying the interaction\nmechanisms underlying a possible overarching universality class of the\nassociated scaling dynamics. In quantum systems, this is complicated by the\nexistence of nonlinear and topological excitations due to the compact nature of\nphase degrees of freedom. We show that the double sine-Gordon model as a\nnoncompact low-energy effective model of the spin-1 Bose gas accounts for\nsubdiffusive coarsening dynamics, identifying field configurations spread over\nmultiple wells of the sinusoidal potential as a precondition for the slow\nscaling. This is in contrast to diffusion-type scaling which the model is known\nto exhibit as well, where field configurations are seen to not extend over more\nthan two wells. Experimental observations of a spinor BEC support these\ncharacteristics, thus constituting a platform for the investigation of\nsine-Gordon dynamics. Our results point to a path towards a classification of\npattern coarsening in many-body systems on the basis of microscopic models.",

Here we conduct high resolution 3D\nnumerical simulations to investigate filament eruptions, focusing particularly\non the 3D structure and genesis of EUV waves. Our results demonstrate that the\nEUV wavefront forms a dome like configuration subdivided into three distinct\nzones. The foremost zone, preceding the flux rope, consists of fast-mode shock\nwaves that heat the adjacent plasma. Adjacent to either side of the flux rope,\nthe second zone contains expansion waves that cool the nearby plasma. The third\nzone, at the juncture of the first two, exhibits minimal disturbances. This\nanisotropic structure of the wavefront stems from the configuration and\ndynamics of the flux rope, which acts as a 3D piston during eruptions\n:compressing the plasma ahead to generate fast mode shocks and evacuating the\nplasma behind to induce expansion waves. This dynamic results in the observed\nanisotropic wavefront.Additionally, with synthetic EUV images from simulation\ndata, the EUV waves are observable in Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 193 and 211\nangstrom, which are identified as the fast mode shocks. The detection of EUV\nwaves varies with the observational perspective: the face on view reveals EUV\nwaves from the lower to the higher corona, whereas an edge on view uncovers\nthese waves only in the higher corona.",

    "abstract": "Rendering photorealistic head avatars from arbitrary viewpoints is crucial\nfor various applications like virtual reality. Although previous methods based\non Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can achieve impressive results, they lack\nfidelity and efficiency. Recent methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have\nimproved rendering quality and real-time performance but still require\nsignificant storage overhead. In this paper, we introduce a method called\nGraphAvatar that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to generate 3D Gaussians\nfor the head avatar. Specifically, GraphAvatar trains a geometric GNN and an\nappearance GNN to generate the attributes of the 3D Gaussians from the tracked\nmesh. Therefore, our method can store the GNN models instead of the 3D\nGaussians, significantly reducing the storage overhead to just 10MB. To reduce\nthe impact of face-tracking errors, we also present a novel graph-guided\noptimization module to refine face-tracking parameters during training.\nFinally, we introduce a 3D-aware enhancer for post-processing to enhance the\nrendering quality. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the\nadvantages of GraphAvatar, surpassing existing methods in visual fidelity and\nstorage consumption. The ablation study sheds light on the trade-offs between\nrendering quality and model size. The code will be released at:\nhttps://github.com/ucwxb/GraphAvatar",

We design a best response dynamic\nintended to capture such negotiations between market participants. We assume\nfully substitutable preferences for market participants. In this setting, we\nprovide proofs of convergence for sparse markets (covering many real world\nmarkets of interest), and experimental results for more general cases,\ndemonstrating that prices indeed reach equilibrium, quickly, via bilateral\nnegotiations.

WATCHDOG enriches the\nexpressivity of vetted formal models for risk -- i.e., fault trees and attack\ntrees -- by bridging the disciplines of ontology and formal methods into an\nontology-aware formal framework composed by a more expressive modelling\nformalism, Object-Oriented Disruption Graphs (DOGs), logic (DOGLog) and an\nintermediate query language (DOGLang). With these, WATCHDOG allows risk\nassessors to pose questions about disruption propagation, disruption likelihood\nand risk levels, keeping the fundamental role of objects at risk always in\nsight.",

The detected RV-variability fraction of our composite\nhot subdwarfs with an infrared excess in their spectral energy distributions is\n9$\\pm$3%, which is lower than that fraction of single-lined hot subdwarfs.\nSince the average RV uncertainty we measured in the LAMOST spectra is about 7.0\nkm/s, the lower detected RV-variability fraction for composite hot subdwarfs is\nexpected because the RV amplitudes associated with long-period systems are\nlower.",

Among algorithms for planning and learning in CMDPs, methods based\non Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) have particular importance due to their\nefficiency and extendibility to more complex frameworks (such as partially\nobservable settings and games). However, current MCTS-based methods for CMDPs\neither struggle with finding safe (i.e., constraint-satisfying) policies, or\nare too conservative and do not find valuable policies. We introduce Threshold\nUCT (T-UCT), an online MCTS-based algorithm for CMDP planning.

    "abstract": "Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an emerging technology designed to harness the\npower of high-altitude winds, offering a solution to several limitations of\nconventional wind turbines. AWE is based on flying devices (usually gliders or\nkites) that, tethered to a ground station and driven by the wind, convert its\nmechanical energy into electrical energy by means of a generator. Such systems\nare usually controlled by manoeuvering the kite so as to follow a predefined\npath prescribed by optimal control techniques, such as model-predictive\ncontrol. These methods are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and\ndifficult to generalize, especially in unpredictable conditions such as the\nturbulent atmospheric boundary layer. Our aim is to explore the possibility of\nreplacing these techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning\n(RL). Unlike traditional methods, RL does not require a predefined model,\nmaking it robust to variability and uncertainty. Our experimental results in\ncomplex simulated environments demonstrate that AWE agents trained with RL can\neffectively extract energy from turbulent flows, relying on minimal local\ninformation about the kite orientation and speed relative to the wind.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have highlighted the\ncritical need of calibrating model predictions, with neighborhood prediction\nsimilarity recognized as a pivotal component. Existing studies suggest that\nnodes with analogous neighborhood prediction similarity often exhibit similar\ncalibration characteristics. Building on this insight, recent approaches\nincorporate neighborhood similarity into node-wise temperature scaling\ntechniques. However, our analysis reveals that this assumption does not hold\nuniversally. Calibration errors can differ significantly even among nodes with\ncomparable neighborhood similarity, depending on their confidence levels. This\nnecessitates a re-evaluation of existing GNN calibration methods, as a single,\nunified approach may lead to sub-optimal calibration. In response, we introduce\n**Simi-Mailbox**, a novel approach that categorizes nodes by both neighborhood\nsimilarity and their own confidence, irrespective of proximity or connectivity.\nOur method allows fine-grained calibration by employing *group-specific*\ntemperature scaling, with each temperature tailored to address the specific\nmiscalibration level of affiliated nodes, rather than adhering to a uniform\ntrend based on neighborhood similarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our **Simi-Mailbox** across diverse datasets on different GNN\narchitectures, achieving up to 13.79\\% error reduction compared to uncalibrated\nGNN predictions.",

Despite substantial theoretical\nprogress, the experimental study of real-world systems exhibiting anomalous\ndiffusion remains challenging due to an intrinsically elusive ground truth and\nthe limited information contained in typical single trajectories. Here, unlike\nprevious experimental systems, we demonstrate the controlled generation of\ntwo-dimensional trajectories with fully tailored statistics spanning the entire\nspectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, and over\nstatistically significant temporal and spatial scales (covering at least two\ndecades). We achieve this feat by simultaneously tuning the step-length\ndistribution and, critically, the velocity autocorrelation function of\nmicroscopic superparamagnetic colloidal walkers with magnetic fields during\nextended acquisitions. Supported by theoretical reasoning, fine control of\nthese two quantities combined allows us to generate trajectories compatible\nwith L\\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion with tailored anomalous\ndiffusion exponents. We envisage our approach will offer a robust, controllable\nexperimental framework for validating and advancing theoretical models,\nanalysis techniques, and predictive tools to study anomalous diffusion in\nreal-life phenomena.

In this work we systematically investigate how\nspecific attributes of preference datasets affect the alignment and downstream\nperformance of LLMs in instruction-following tasks. We use a novel synthetic\ndata generation pipeline to generate 48,000 unique instruction-following\nprompts with combinations of 23 verifiable constraints that enable fine-grained\nand automated quality assessments of model responses. With our synthetic\nprompts, we use two preference dataset curation methods - rejection sampling\n(RS) and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) - to obtain pairs of (chosen, rejected)\nresponses. Then, we perform experiments investigating the effects of (1) the\npresence of shared prefixes between the chosen and rejected responses, (2) the\ncontrast and quality of the chosen, rejected responses and (3) the complexity\nof the training prompts. Our experiments reveal that shared prefixes in\npreference pairs, as generated by MCTS, provide marginal but consistent\nimprovements and greater stability across challenging training configurations.\nHigh-contrast preference pairs generally outperform low-contrast pairs;\nhowever, combining both often yields the best performance by balancing\ndiversity and learning efficiency. Additionally, training on prompts of\nmoderate difficulty leads to better generalization across tasks, even for more\ncomplex evaluation scenarios, compared to overly challenging prompts. Our\nfindings provide actionable insights into optimizing preference data curation\nfor instruction-following tasks, offering a scalable and effective framework\nfor enhancing LLM training and alignment.",

In this work,\nwe tackle these shortcomings with an innovative, fast and accurate Transformer\nwhich postprocesses each ensemble member individually while allowing\ninformation exchange across variables, spatial dimensions and lead times by\nmeans of multi-headed self-attention. Weather forecasts are postprocessed over\n20 lead times simultaneously while including up to fifteen meteorological\npredictors. We use the EUPPBench dataset for training which contains ensemble\npredictions from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts'\nintegrated forecasting system alongside corresponding observations. The work\npresented here is the first to postprocess the ten and one hundred-meter wind\nspeed forecasts within this benchmark dataset, while also correcting two-meter\ntemperature. Our approach significantly improves the original forecasts, as\nmeasured by the CRPS, with 16.5\\% for two-meter temperature, 10\\% for ten-meter\nwind speed and 9\\% for one hundred-meter wind speed, outperforming a classical\nmember-by-member approach employed as a competitive benchmark. Furthermore,\nbeing up to six times faster, it fulfills the demand for rapid operational\nweather forecasts in various downstream applications, including renewable\nenergy forecasting.",

Moreover, as in Sogge and Taylor, we\nanalyze the interior behavior of harmonic functions by constructing a\nparametrix for the Poisson integral operator and calculate its composition with\nthe spectral cluster. By using microlocal analysis, we obtain several sharp\nestimates for the harmonic functions whose traces are quasimodes on the\nboundary.

Encrypted control has shown the potential to address\nthis risk and ensure confidentiality. However, existing approaches mainly focus\non cloud-based control and distributed schemes are restrictive.\n  In this paper, we present a novel privacy-preserving cooperative control\nscheme based on encrypted distributed optimization. More precisely, we focus on\na secure distributed solution of a general consensus problem, which has\nmanifold applications in cooperative control, by means of the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM). As a unique feature of our approach, we\nexplicitly take into account the common situation that local decision variables\ncontain copies of quantities associated with neighboring agents and ensure the\nneighbor's privacy.

In these models, the majority of the eigenstates are\nthermal, but there is a distinguished subspace of the Hilbert space in which\nergodicity is broken. We achieve such a weak breaking by embedding selected\nintegrable models into larger Hilbert spaces of otherwise chaotic models.

    "abstract": "District heating (DH) systems play a pivotal role in decarbonizing the\nbuilding sector's heat supply. While innovative low-exergy DH and cooling\nsystems are increasingly adopted in new developments, the transformation of\nexisting DH systems remains critical, as many still depend on fossil-based\nheating plants. Achieving a sustainable heat supply necessitates integrating\nrenewable energy and waste heat sources into current DH systems and enhancing\noperational efficiency through measures such as reduced supply temperatures and\nadvanced control algorithms. These improvements can reduce costs and CO2\nemissions but may require infrastructure adaptations, including pipe\nreplacements and building-level system adjustments.\n  This paper introduces a workflow for generating DH models using publicly\navailable data and open-source tools. Such models enable comprehensive analyses\nof existing DH systems, allowing for the evaluation of sustainable heat\nintegration, operational improvements, and the testing of analytical tools,\nsuch as simulation and optimization models. The workflow, detailed in this\nstudy, combines general structural data with computational estimations to\ncreate digital representations of DH systems. These models facilitate\nscenario-based analyses, tool benchmarking, and the identification of necessary\ninfrastructure adaptations.\n  Two example DH models generated using the proposed workflow are presented,\nfollowed by a discussion of the methodology's applicability and limitations.\nThis study demonstrates how leveraging open data and tools can advance the\ntransformation of DH systems, supporting the transition to a sustainable heat\nsupply infrastructure.",

Despite their success, a persistent challenge is\nhallucination-where generated text fails to accurately reflect visual\ncontent-undermining both accuracy and reliability. Existing methods focus on\nalignment training or decoding refinements but primarily address symptoms at\nthe generation stage without probing the underlying causes. In this work, we\ninvestigate the internal mechanisms driving hallucination in LVLMs, with an\nemphasis on the multi-head attention module. Specifically, we introduce\nVision-aware Head Divergence (VHD), a metric that quantifies the sensitivity of\nattention head outputs to visual context. Based on this, our findings reveal\nthe presence of vision-aware attention heads that are more attuned to visual\ninformation; however, the model's overreliance on its prior language patterns\nis closely related to hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose\nVision-aware Head Reinforcement (VHR), a training-free approach to mitigate\nhallucination by enhancing the role of vision-aware attention heads. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared\nto state-of-the-art approaches in mitigating hallucinations, while maintaining\nhigh efficiency with negligible additional time overhead.",

The integrated ions' free energy has two terms: The first can be\nshort- or long-range, depending on their density. The second is proportional to\nthe nucleus' volume and can shift the state from undersaturation to\nsupersaturation at high ion concentration. The inclusion of the Gibbs transfer\nenergies of ions in the free energy leads to a modified Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation for the potential around the core. The integrated ions' free energy is\nadded to the fluids' interfacial and bulk terms to establish a generalized\nThomson model. In the Debye-Huckel limit, the model is solved analytically,\nwhile in the nonlinear regime, it is solved numerically. The state diagram in\nthe plane of saturation and core charge includes regions with a homogeneous\nphase, electro-prewetting, metastable vapor, metastable nucleus, and\nspontaneous nucleation states. The lines separating these regions depend\nsensitively on the preferential solvation. Our model shows nucleation asymmetry\nto the sign of the nucleus' charge. This sign asymmetry is due to the Gibbs\ntransfer energies of ions.",

We refer to the features learned with the Teacher's guidance as\ndistilled features and the features irrelevant to the task and ignored by the\nStudent as residual features.

    "abstract": "In many problem settings that require spatio-temporal forecasting, the values\nin the time-series not only exhibit spatio-temporal correlations but are also\ninfluenced by spatial diffusion across locations. One such example is\nforecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the\natmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones\nbeing diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast\ndistances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph\nNeural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to\nforecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder\narchitecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units\n(GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for\nspatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various\nexisting models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate\nthe model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected\nby us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511\nlocations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of\none year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely\npolluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results\nshow our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as\ntemporal dependencies precisely.",

Existing techniques for demodulating LoRa symbols\nunder collisions face challenges such as high computational complexity,\nreliance on accurate symbol boundary information, or error-prone peak detection\nmethods. In this paper, we introduce CoRa , a symbol detector for demodulating\nLoRa symbols under severe collisions. CoRa employs a Bayesian classifier to\naccurately identify the true symbol amidst interference from other LoRa\ntransmissions, leveraging empirically derived features from raw symbol data.\nEvaluations using real-world and simulated packet traces demonstrate that CoRa\nclearly outperforms the related state-of-the-art, i.e., up to 29% better\ndecoding performance than TnB and 178% better than CIC. Compared to the LoRa\nbaseline demodulator, CoRa magnifies the packet reception rate by up to 11.53x.\nCoRa offers a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to\nexisting solutions by only adding a constant overhead to the baseline\ndemodulator, while also eliminating the need for peak detection and accurately\nidentifying colliding frames.",

It has attracted tremendous interest,\nbecause of its promising potential in information storage and processing.\nHowever, measuring the distinctive spin-split energy bands arising from\naltermagnetism remains a challenge. Here, we propose to employ the Coulomb drag\nto probe altermagnetism. In the Coulomb drag, an electric current in an active\nlayer of electron gases can induce currents in a close but well-isolated\npassive layer, due to interlayer Coulomb interactions. We find that the Coulomb\ndrag effects in altermagnets are highly sensitive to the orientation of the\nspin-split Fermi surfaces. As a result, transverse currents can be dragged in\nthe passive layer, leading to Hall drag effects even in absence of spin-orbit\ncoupling, a feature quite different from all previous systems. More\nimportantly, all the drag effects of altermagnets have unique angle dependence,\nwhich can be measured in a multi-terminal setup to serve as signatures for\naltermagnetism. This proposal will inspire increasing explorations on emergent\nmagnetism.",

However, the special\nsetup of the Yvon engine has circumscribed its broader influence.

A rigorous comparison reveals that the extended Yvon\nengine and CA engine represent the steady-state and cyclic forms of the\nendo-reversible Carnot heat engine, respectively, and are equivalent.

Previous approaches typically embed watermark messages\ninto continuous space.

In this paper, we propose DiscreteWM, a novel speech\nwatermarking framework that injects watermarks into the discrete intermediate\nrepresentations of speech.

Experimental results demonstrate that our framework\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in robustness and imperceptibility,\nsimultaneously. Moreover, our flexible frame-wise approach can serve as an\nefficient solution for both voice cloning detection and information hiding.\nAdditionally, DiscreteWM can encode 1 to 150 bits of watermark information\nwithin a 1-second speech clip, indicating its encoding capacity.

    "abstract": "When embedding objects (foreground) into images (background), considering the\ninfluence of photography conditions like illumination, it is usually necessary\nto perform image harmonization to make the foreground object coordinate with\nthe background image in terms of brightness, color, and etc. Although existing\nimage harmonization methods have made continuous efforts toward visually\npleasing results, they are still plagued by two main issues. Firstly, the image\nharmonization becomes highly ill-posed when there are no contents similar to\nthe foreground object in the background, making the harmonization results\nunreliable. Secondly, even when similar contents are available, the\nharmonization process is often interfered with by irrelevant areas, mainly\nattributed to an insufficient understanding of image contents and inaccurate\nattention. As a remedy, we present a retrieval-augmented image harmonization\n(Raiha) framework, which seeks proper reference images to reduce the\nill-posedness and restricts the attention to better utilize the useful\ninformation. Specifically, an efficient retrieval method is designed to find\nreference images that contain similar objects as the foreground while the\nillumination is consistent with the background. For training the Raiha\nframework to effectively utilize the reference information, a data augmentation\nstrategy is delicately designed by leveraging existing non-reference image\nharmonization datasets. Besides, the image content priors are introduced to\nensure reasonable attention. With the presented Raiha framework, the image\nharmonization performance is greatly boosted under both non-reference and\nretrieval-augmented settings.

Although many studies have focused on compressing neural\nnetwork structures and parameters or optimizing underlying systems, there has\nbeen limited attention on optimizing the fundamental building blocks of neural\nnetworks: the neurons. In this study, we deliberate on a simple but important\nresearch question: Can we design artificial neurons that offer greater\nefficiency than the traditional neuron paradigm?

Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness\nof neural networks utilizing Threshold Neurons, achieving substantial power\nsavings of 7.51x to 8.19x and area savings of 3.89x to 4.33x at the kernel\nlevel, with minimal loss in precision.

At the University\nHospital of Navarre (HUN), Spain, general practitioners (GPs) grade fundus\nimages in an ongoing DR screening program, referring to a second screening\nlevel (ophthalmologist) target patients.\n  Methods: After collecting their requirements, HUN decided to develop a custom\nAI tool, called NaIA-RD, to assist their GPs in DR screening. This paper\nintroduces NaIA-RD, details its implementation, and highlights its unique\ncombination of DR and retinal image quality grading in a single system. Its\nimpact is measured in an unprecedented before-and-after study that compares\n19,828 patients screened before NaIA-RD's implementation and 22,962 patients\nscreened after.\n  Results: NaIA-RD influenced the screening criteria of 3/4 GPs, increasing\ntheir sensitivity. Agreement between NaIA-RD and the GPs was high for\nnon-referral proposals (94.6% or more), but lower and variable (from 23.4\\% to\n86.6%) for referral proposals. An ophthalmologist discarded a NaIA-RD error in\nmost of contradicted referral proposals by labeling the 93% of a sample of them\nas referable. In an autonomous setup, NaIA-RD would have reduced the study\nvisualization workload by 4.27 times without missing a single case of\nsight-threatening DR referred by a GP.\n  Conclusion: DR screening was more effective when supported by NaIA-RD, which\ncould be safely used to autonomously perform the first level of screening.

    "abstract": "Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) system is a critical component of\nintelligent transportation, with the capability to significantly alleviate\nurban traffic congestion. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods\nhave demonstrated promising performance in achieving ATSC, existing methods are\nstill prone to making unreasonable policies. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nnovel Bayesian Critique-Tune-Based Reinforcement Learning with Adaptive\nPressure for multi-intersection signal control (BCT-APLight). In BCT-APLight,\nthe Critique-Tune (CT) framework, a two-layer Bayesian structure is designed to\nrefine the excessive trust of RL policies. Specifically, the Bayesian\ninference-based Critique Layer provides effective evaluations of the\ncredibility of policies; the Bayesian decision-based Tune Layer fine-tunes\npolicies by minimizing the posterior risks when the evaluations are negative.\nMeanwhile, an attention-based Adaptive Pressure (AP) mechanism is designed to\neffectively weight the vehicle queues in each lane, thereby enhancing the\nrationality of traffic movement representation within the network. Equipped\nwith the CT framework and AP mechanism, BCT-APLight effectively enhances the\nreasonableness of RL policies. Extensive experiments conducted with a simulator\nacross a range of intersection layouts demonstrate that BCT-APLight is superior\nto other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on seven real-world datasets.\nSpecifically, BCT-APLight decreases average queue length by\n\\textbf{\\(\\boldsymbol{9.60\\%}\\)} and average waiting time by\n\\textbf{\\(\\boldsymbol{15.28\\%}\\)}.",

RoboMIND is\ncollected through human teleoperation and encompasses comprehensive\nrobotic-related information, including multi-view observations, proprioceptive\nrobot state information, and linguistic task descriptions. To ensure data\nconsistency and reliability for imitation learning, RoboMIND is built on a\nunified data collection platform and a standardized protocol, covering four\ndistinct robotic embodiments: the Franka Emika Panda, the UR5e, the AgileX\ndual-arm robot, and a humanoid robot with dual dexterous hands. Our dataset\nalso includes 5k real-world failure demonstrations, each accompanied by\ndetailed causes, enabling failure reflection and correction during policy\nlearning. Additionally, we created a digital twin environment in the Isaac Sim\nsimulator, replicating the real-world tasks and assets, which facilitates the\nlow-cost collection of additional training data and enables efficient\nevaluation. To demonstrate the quality and diversity of our dataset, we\nconducted extensive experiments using various imitation learning methods for\nsingle-task settings and state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models\nfor multi-task scenarios. By leveraging RoboMIND, the VLA models achieved high\nmanipulation success rates and demonstrated strong generalization capabilities.\nTo the best of our knowledge, RoboMIND is the largest multi-embodiment\nteleoperation dataset collected on a unified platform, providing large-scale\nand high-quality robotic training data.

Physics beyond the\nstandard model could change this relationship through the effects of quantum\nloops of virtual particles, thus making it of great importance to measure these\nmasses with the highest possible precision. Although the mass of the Z boson is\nknown to the remarkable precision of 22 parts per million (2.0 MeV), the W\nboson mass is known much less precisely, given the difficulty of the\nmeasurement. A global fit to electroweak data, used to predict the W boson mass\nin the standard model, yields an uncertainty of 6 MeV. Reaching a comparable\nexperimental precision would be a sensitive and fundamental test of the\nstandard model. Furthermore, a precision measurement of the W boson mass\nperformed by the CDF Collaboration at the Fermilab Tevatron has challenged the\nstandard model by significantly disagreeing with the prediction of the global\nelectroweak fit and the average of other $m_\\mathrm{W}$ measurements.

Our investigation is motivated by the increased sensitivity of the\npulse to the scalar charge of the spacetime in such high compactness regimes,\nmaking these systems exceptionally suitable for scrutinizing deviations from\nGR, notably phenomena such as spontaneous scalarization, as predicted by STT.\nWe find significant differences in NS observables, e.g., the flux of a single\nspot can differ up to 80% with respect to GR. Additionally, reasonable choices\nfor the STT parameters that satisfy astrophysical constraints lead to changes\nin the NS radius relative to GR of up to approximately 10%. Consequently,\nscalar parameters might be better constrained when uncertainties in NS radii\ndecrease, where this could occur with the advent of next-generation\ngravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and LISA, as well\nas future electromagnetic missions like eXTP and ATHENA. Thus, our findings\nsuggest that accurate X-ray data of the NS surface emission, jointly with\nrefined theoretical models, could constrain STTs.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous use of Shapley values in eXplainable AI (XAI) has been\ntriggered by the tool SHAP, and as a result are commonly referred to as SHAP\nscores. Recent work devised examples of machine learning (ML) classifiers for\nwhich the computed SHAP scores are thoroughly unsatisfactory, by allowing human\ndecision-makers to be misled. Nevertheless, such examples could be perceived as\nsomewhat artificial, since the selected classes must be interpreted as numeric.\nFurthermore, it was unclear how general were the issues identified with SHAP\nscores. This paper answers these criticisms. First, the paper shows that for\nBoolean classifiers there are arbitrarily many examples for which the SHAP\nscores must be deemed unsatisfactory. Second, the paper shows that the issues\nwith SHAP scores are also observed in the case of regression models. In\naddition, the paper studies the class of regression models that respect\nLipschitz continuity, a measure of a function's rate of change that finds\nimportant recent uses in ML, including model robustness. Concretely, the paper\nshows that the issues with SHAP scores occur even for regression models that\nrespect Lipschitz continuity. Finally, the paper shows that the same issues are\nguaranteed to exist for arbitrarily differentiable regression models.",

Concretely, the task requires: 1)\nusing the target LLM to parameterize the reward model, and 2) tuning the reward\nmodel so that it has a 1:1 linear relationship with the true reward. However,\nwe identify a significant issue: the DPO loss might have multiple minimizers,\nof which only one satisfies the required linearity condition. The problem\narises from a well-known issue of the underlying Bradley-Terry preference\nmodel: it does not always have a unique maximum likelihood estimator (MLE).\nConsequently,the minimizer of the RLHF loss might be unattainable because it is\nmerely one among many minimizers of the DPO loss. As a better alternative, we\npropose an energy-based model (EBM) that always has a unique MLE, inherently\nsatisfying the linearity requirement. To approximate the MLE in practice, we\npropose a contrastive loss named Energy Preference Alignment (EPA), wherein\neach positive sample is contrasted against one or more strong negatives as well\nas many free weak negatives. Theoretical properties of our EBM enable the\napproximation error of EPA to almost surely vanish when a sufficient number of\nnegatives are used.

This analysis is a\ntime demanding task, currently done by an expert pathologist that visually\ninspects the samples. Given the effort required to localise the pathogen in\nimages, a limited number of annotations might be available in an initial\nsetting. Our goal is to design an approach that, using a limited set of\nannotations, is capable of obtaining results good enough to be used as a\nsupport tool. Methods: We propose to use autoencoders to learn the latent\npatterns of healthy patches and formulate a specific measure of the\nreconstruction error of the image in HSV space. ROC analysis is used to set the\noptimal threshold of this measure and the percentage of positive patches in a\nsample that determines the presence of H. pylori. Results: Our method has been\ntested on an own database of 245 Whole Slide Images (WSI) having 117 cases\nwithout H. pylori and different density of the bacteria in the remaining ones.\nThe database has 1211 annotated patches, with only 163 positive patches. This\ndataset of positive annotations was used to train a baseline thresholding and\nan SVM using the features of a pre-trained RedNet18 and ViT models. A 10-fold\ncross-validation shows that our method has better performance with 91%\naccuracy, 86% sensitivity, 96% specificity and 0.97 AUC in the diagnosis of H.\npylori. Conclusion: Unlike classification approaches, our shallow autoencoder\nwith threshold adaptation for the detection of anomalous staining is able to\nachieve competitive results with a limited set of annotated data.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\nto address distributed channel access in wireless local area networks. In\nparticular, we consider the challenging yet more practical case where the\nagents heterogeneously adopt value-based or policy-based reinforcement learning\nalgorithms to train the model. We propose a heterogeneous MARL training\nframework, named QPMIX, which adopts a centralized training with distributed\nexecution paradigm to enable heterogeneous agents to collaborate. Moreover, we\ntheoretically prove the convergence of the proposed heterogeneous MARL method\nwhen using the linear value function approximation. Our method maximizes the\nnetwork throughput and ensures fairness among stations, therefore, enhancing\nthe overall network performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed QPMIX algorithm improves throughput, mean delay, delay jitter, and\ncollision rates compared with conventional carrier-sense multiple access with\ncollision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism in the saturated traffic scenario.\nFurthermore, the QPMIX algorithm is robust in unsaturated and delay-sensitive\ntraffic scenarios. It coexists well with the conventional CSMA/CA mechanism and\npromotes cooperation among heterogeneous agents.",

Given the current crypto-currency\nand artificial intelligence trends, the data center electricity demand is bound\nto grow significantly. With the electricity sector being responsible for a\nlarge share of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to lower\nthe carbon footprint of data centers to meet GHG emissions targets set by\ninternational agreements. Moreover, uncontrolled integration of data centers in\npower distribution grids contributes to increasing the stochasticity of the\npower system demand, thus increasing the need for capacity reserves, which\nleads to economic and environmental inefficiencies in the power grid operation.\nThis work provides a method to size a PhotoVoltaic (PV) system and an Energy\nStorage System (ESS) for an existing data center looking to reduce both its\ncarbon footprint and demand stochasticity via dispatching. The proposed\nscenario-based optimization framework allows to size the ESS and the PV system\nto minimize the expected operational and capital costs, along with the carbon\nfootprint of the data center complex. The life cycle assessment of the\nresources, as well as the dynamic carbon emissions of the upstream power\ndistribution grid, are accounted for while computing the day-ahead planning of\nthe data center aggregated demand and PV generation. Case studies in different\nSwiss cantons and regions of Germany emphasize the need for location-aware\nsizing processes since the obtained optimal solutions strongly depend on the\nlocal electricity carbon footprint, cost and on the local irradiance\nconditions.

As a result, their operational planning\nis no longer limited to solving vehicle routing problems. Instead, demand\nmanagement decisions and vehicle routing decisions are optimized integratively\nwith the aim of maximizing revenue and minimizing fulfillment cost. The\nresulting integrated demand management and vehicle routing problems (i-DMVRPs)\ncan be formulated as Markov decision process models and, theoretically, can be\nsolved via the well-known Bellman equation. Unfortunately, the Bellman equation\nis intractable for realistic-sized instances. Thus, in the literature, i-DMVRPs\nare often addressed via decomposition-based solution approaches involving an\nopportunity cost approximation as a key component. Despite its importance, to\nthe best of our knowledge, there is neither a technique to systematically\nanalyze how the accuracy of the opportunity cost approximation translates into\noverall solution quality nor are there general guidelines on when to apply\nwhich class of approximation approach. In this work, we address this research\ngap by proposing an explainability technique that quantifies and visualizes the\nmagnitude of approximation errors, their immediate impact, and their relevance\nin specific regions of the state space. Exploiting reward decomposition, it\nfurther yields a characterization of different types of approximation errors.\nApplying the technique to a generic i-DMVRP in a full-factorial computational\nstudy and comparing the results with observations in existing literature, we\nshow that the technique contributes to better explaining algorithmic\nperformance and provides guidance for the algorithm selection and development\nprocess.",

This result is based upon the accretion-induced\n$4\\pi$-averaged energy flux from 2.45 $\\mu$m to 100 keV and the corresponding\nluminosity at the Gaia distance of 56.77 pc. Our result is in perfect agreement\nwith the theoretical mass transfer rate from the secondary star induced by\ngravitational radiation (GR) and the spin-up of the white dwarf, $-\\dot M_2 =\n(3.90\\pm0.35)\\times 10^{-11}$ $M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$; 24% of it is caused by the\nspin-up. The agreement indicates that mass transfer is conservative. The\nmeasured $\\dot M_1$ obviates the need for angular momentum loss (AML) by any\nprocess other than GR. We complemented this result with an estimate of the mean\nsecular mass transfer rate over $\\sim 10^7$ yr by interpreting the\nnon-equilibrium radius of the secondary star in EX Hya based on published\nevolutionary calculations. This suggests a time-averaged mass transfer rate\nenhanced over GR by a factor $f_{\\mathrm{GR}} \\gtrsim 2$. Combined with the\npresent-day lack of such an excess, we suggest that an enhanced secular AML is\ndue to an intermittently active process, such as the proposed frictional motion\nof the binary in the remnants of nova outbursts.

Videos inherently pose unique challenges, combining spatial\ncomplexity with temporal dynamics that are absent in static images or textual\ndata. Current approaches to video understanding with LLMs often rely on\npretrained video encoders to extract spatiotemporal features and text encoders\nto capture semantic meaning. These representations are integrated within LLM\nframeworks, enabling multimodal reasoning across diverse video tasks. However,\nthe critical question persists: Can LLMs truly understand the concept of time,\nand how effectively can they reason about temporal relationships in videos?\nThis work critically examines the role of LLMs in video processing, with a\nspecific focus on their temporal reasoning capabilities. We identify key\nlimitations in the interaction between LLMs and pretrained encoders, revealing\ngaps in their ability to model long-term dependencies and abstract temporal\nconcepts such as causality and event progression. Furthermore, we analyze\nchallenges posed by existing video datasets, including biases, lack of temporal\nannotations, and domain-specific limitations that constrain the temporal\nunderstanding of LLMs. To address these gaps, we explore promising future\ndirections, including the co-evolution of LLMs and encoders, the development of\nenriched datasets with explicit temporal labels, and innovative architectures\nfor integrating spatial, temporal, and semantic reasoning.

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, understanding public\nperceptions -- including biases, risks, and benefits -- is essential for\nguiding research priorities and AI alignment, shaping public discourse, and\ninforming policy. This exploratory study investigates cultural differences in\nmental models of AI using 71 imaginaries of AI's potential futures. Drawing on\ncross-cultural convenience samples from Germany (N=52) and China (N=60), we\nidentify significant differences in expectations, evaluations, and risk-benefit\ntradeoffs. Participants from Germany generally provided more cautious\nassessments, whereas participants from China expressed greater optimism\nregarding AI's societal benefits. Chinese participants exhibited relatively\nbalanced risk-benefit tradeoffs ($\\beta=-0.463$ for risk and $\\beta=+0.484$ for\nbenefit, $r^2=.630$). In contrast, German participants placed greater emphasis\non AI's benefits and comparatively less on risks ($\\beta=-0.337$ for risk and\n$\\beta=+0.715$ for benefit, $r^2=.839$). Visual cognitive maps illustrate these\ncontrasts, offering new perspectives on how cultural contexts shape AI\nacceptance. Our findings highlight key factors influencing public perception\nand provide insights for aligning AI with societal values and promoting\nequitable and culturally sensitive integration of AI technologies.",

To achieve high reliability and\nscalability in deploying this paradigm in distributed systems, it is essential\nto conquer challenges stemming from both spatial and temporal dimensions,\nmanifesting as distribution shifts, catastrophic forgetting, heterogeneity, and\nprivacy issues. This survey focuses on a comprehensive examination of the\ndevelopment of the non-centralized continual learning algorithms and the\nreal-world deployment across distributed devices. We begin with an introduction\nto the background and fundamentals of non-centralized learning and continual\nlearning. Then, we review existing solutions from three levels to represent how\nexisting techniques alleviate the catastrophic forgetting and distribution\nshift. Additionally, we delve into the various types of heterogeneity issues,\nsecurity, and privacy attributes, as well as real-world applications across\nthree prevalent scenarios. Furthermore, we establish a large-scale benchmark to\nrevisit this problem and analyze the performance of the state-of-the-art NCCL\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) utilizes an input quantum\nstate on a quantum device to select important bases (electron configurations in\nquantum chemistry) which define a subspace in which to diagonalize a target\nHamiltonian, i.e., perform selected configuration interaction, on classical\ncomputers. Previous proposals for preparing a good input state, which is\ncrucial for the quality of QSCI, based on optimization of quantum circuits may\nsuffer from optimization difficulty and require many runs of the quantum\ndevice. Here we propose using a time-evolved state by the target Hamiltonian\n(for some initial state) as an input of QSCI. Our proposal is based on the\nintuition that the time evolution by the Hamiltonian creates electron\nexcitations of various orders when applied to the initial state. We numerically\ninvestigate the accuracy of the energy obtained by the proposed method for\nquantum chemistry Hamiltonians describing electronic states of small molecules.\nNumerical results reveal that our method can yield sufficiently accurate\nground-state energies for the investigated molecules. Systematic analysis when\nincreasing the number of qubits in a hydrogen chain shows that the subspace\nsize required for sufficiently accurate results is reasonable at system sizes\nthat cannot be solved by naive classical diagonalization. Our proposal provides\na systematic and optimization-free method to prepare the input state of QSCI\nand could contribute to practical applications of quantum computers in quantum\nchemistry calculations.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The origins of life is a question that continues to intrigue scientists\nacross disciplines. One theory - the iron-sulphur theory - suggests that\nreactions essential to the synthesis of biological materials got their\ncatalytic 'spark' from mineral surfaces such as iron pyrite, commonly known as\nfool's gold. Additionally, the binding affinity of the ligands synthesised in\nthis 'surface metabolism' acted as an early version of natural selection: more\nstrongly-binding ligands were accumulated into further autocatalytic reactions\nand the aggregation of complex biological materials. Ligand-receptor binding is\nthus fundamental to the origins of life. In this paper, we use the iron-sulphur\ntheory as a lens through which to review ligand-receptor interactions as they\nare more commonly understood today. In particular we focus on the electron\ntunnelling theory of receptor activation that has emerged from research into\nquantum biology. We revisit criticism against this theory, particularly the\nlack of evidence for electron transfer in receptors, to see what insights might\nbe offered by ligand-receptor interactions mediated by iron pyrite at the\norigins of life. What emerges from this comparison is the central importance of\nredox activity in receptors, in particular with respect to the recurring\npresence of the disulphide bond. While the paper is a speculative exercise, we\nconclude that conductivity in biomolecules, particularly the selective\nconductivity conferred by appropriate ligand-receptor binding, is a powerful\ntool for understanding diverse phenomena such as pharmacological potency and\nviral infection. As such it deserves further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy significantly impacts global health, affecting about 65 million\npeople worldwide, along with various animal species.

By employing\ndeep learning techniques, including domain adaptation and knowledge\ndistillation, our framework aligns cross-species and cross-modality EEG signals\nto enhance the detection capability beyond traditional within-species and\nwith-modality models. Experiments on multiple surface and intracranial EEG\ndatasets of humans and canines demonstrated substantial improvements in the\ndetection accuracy, achieving over 90% AUC scores for cross-species and\ncross-modality seizure detection with extremely limited labeled data from the\ntarget species/modality. To our knowledge, this is the first study that\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous data from different\nspecies and modalities to improve EEG-based seizure detection performance. The\napproach may also be generalizable to different brain-computer interface\nparadigms, and suggests the possibility to combine data from different\nspecies/modalities to increase the amount of training data for large EEG\nmodels.",

In cross-modal retrieval, many works have focused on retrieving\nrelevant items from natural language queries, while few have explored query\nsuggestion solutions. In this work, we address query suggestion in cross-modal\nretrieval, introducing a novel task that focuses on suggesting minimal textual\nmodifications needed to explore visually consistent subsets of the collection,\nfollowing the premise of ''Maybe you are looking for''. To facilitate the\nevaluation and development of methods, we present a tailored benchmark named\nCroQS. This dataset comprises initial queries, grouped result sets, and\nhuman-defined suggested queries for each group. We establish dedicated metrics\nto rigorously evaluate the performance of various methods on this task,\nmeasuring representativeness, cluster specificity, and similarity of the\nsuggested queries to the original ones. Baseline methods from related fields,\nsuch as image captioning and content summarization, are adapted for this task\nto provide reference performance scores. Although relatively far from human\nperformance, our experiments reveal that both LLM-based and captioning-based\nmethods achieve competitive results on CroQS, improving the recall on cluster\nspecificity by more than 115% and representativeness mAP by more than 52% with\nrespect to the initial query.

    "abstract": "According to Huygens' principle, all points on a wave front act as secondary\nsources emitting spherical waves, and the envelope of these spherical waves\nforms a new wave front. In the mathematical formulation of Huygens' principle,\nthe waves emitted by the secondary sources are represented by Green's\nfunctions. In many present-day applications of Huygens' principle, these\nGreen's functions are replaced by their time-reversed versions, thus forming a\nbasis for backpropagation, imaging, inversion, seismic interferometry, etc.\nHowever, when the input wave field is available only on a single open boundary,\nthis approach has its limitations. In particular, it does not properly account\nfor multiply reflected waves. This is remedied by a modified form of Huygens'\nprinciple, in which the Green's functions are replaced by focusing functions.\nThe modified Huygens' principle forms a basis for imaging, inverse scattering,\nmonitoring of induced sources, etc., thereby properly taking multiply reflected\nwaves into account.",

    "abstract": "Strengthening magnetoacoustic coupling is crucial to the improvement of the\nsurface acoustic wave (SAW)-driven spintronics devices. A key challenge in\nenhancing magnetoacoustic coupling is minimizing the phonon and magnon\ndissipation of the device, which usually requires complicated techniques for\ngenerating shear-horizontal (SH) or standing waves to suppress the phonon\ndissipation. In this work, we significantly strengthened the magnetoacoustic\ncoupling by suppressing the magnon dissipation via the SAW-induced\nspin-transfer-torque (STT) in Co/Cu/NiFe multilayer, which is facilitated by\nthe non-parallel magnetization alignment between the two ferromagnetic layers.\nAlso, this STT exhibits the form of Zhang-Li torque due to the SAW-induced spin\nwave, which gives rise to the unique nonreciprocal SAW transportation under\nexternal magnetic field. This finding opens new avenues for non-reciprocally\nboosting magnetoacoustic coupling, which pays the way for developing on-chip\nSAW-driven multifunctional devices.",

Here, we utilized both\nmulti-cycle and single-cycle THz pump-broadband THz probe techniques to\ninvestigate the THz nonlinear response of MgB$_2$. Through multicycle THz\npump-THz probe experiments on MgB$_2$, we observed distinct nonlinear signals\nat both the fundamental frequency ($\\omega$) and the second harmonic frequency\n(2$\\omega$) of the pump pulses, which exhibited resonant enhancement at\ntemperatures where their frequencies respectively match 2$\\Delta_{\\pi}(T)$.\nThey are mainly attributed to the $\\pi$-band Higgs mode. By adjusting the THz\npump pulse to a single-cycle waveform that satisfies non-adiabatic excitation\ncriteria, we observed an over-damped oscillation corresponding to the Leggett\nmode. Our findings contribute to solving the ongoing debates and demonstrate\nthe selective excitation of collective modes in multiband superconductors,\noffering new insights into the interaction between Higgs and Leggett modes.",

    ],
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a specific, nontrivial extension of the Standard\nModel of weak interactions based on the ${SU(2)}_L\\times{U(1)}_Y\\times{U(1)}_C$\ngroup. Our motivation follows from the identification of the globally conserved\ncharge $\\Omega=\\mathrm{B}-\\mathrm{L}-\\mathrm{Q}$ as a neutrino charge. An\nintriguing feature of the model is the emergence of a mirror symmetry between\nneutrinos and electrically charged leptons, as well as between up and down\nquarks. Following the spontaneous breaking of the weak gauge symmetry with the\nuse of the Goldstone-Higgs iso-doublet, all elementary fermions acquire Dirac\nmasses from Yukawa interaction. The $W^\\pm$ and $Z$ bosons also acquire masses,\nalthough with a modified relationship between their respective masses, as\ncompared to the Standard Model. Our model accounts for both chiral components\nof the neutrino and offers an explanation for the non-observability of the\nright-chiral neutrino. Additionally, it forbids neutrinoless double-beta decay.\nSpontaneous breaking of the local $U(1)$ symmetry leads to the new gauge boson\n$ \\mathit{\\Omega}_\\mu$ mass $M_\\mathit{\\Omega}$, which we assume to be greater\nthan the mass $m_\\chi$ of a new scalar, Higgs-like field $\\chi$. The\ncosmological stability of $\\chi$, predicted under this condition, allows for\nits interpretation as dark matter, interacting exclusively with\n$\\mathit{\\Omega}_\\mu$ and gravity. From this perspective, we solve and analyze\na system of Boltzmann equations that describe the thermal evolution of the\nnumber density of $\\chi$ dark matter and the $\\mathit{\\Omega}_\\mu$ mediator\nfield within the context of the $\\mathrm{\\Lambda CDM}$ cosmological model.\nSpecifically, we estimate the coupling constant $q$ to be in the range of $\\sim\n10^{-8.5}\\ g$ to $\\sim 10^{-6}\\ g$ which ensures cosmological stability of the\n$\\chi$ particles.",

Firstly, these models\nfail to leverage the relational dependencies that exist across different types\nof user behaviors, such as page views, collects, comments, and purchases.\nSecondly, they struggle to capture the fine-grained latent factors that drive\nuser interaction patterns.

We introduce a new class of MDI-EWs,\ntermed sensitive MDI-EWs, whose entanglement criteria fail under any non-zero\nimprecision in the input states. We derive sufficient conditions for an MDI-EW\nto be classified as sensitive, revealing that a large class of MDI-EWs exhibit\nthis sensitivity.

In this\npaper, we initiate the theoretical study of substring and document counting\nunder differential privacy.\n  We give an $\\epsilon$-differentially private data structure solving this\nproblem for all patterns simultaneously with a maximum additive error of\n$O(\\ell \\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(n\\ell|\\Sigma|))$, where $\\ell$ is the maximum\nlength of a document in the database, $n$ is the number of documents, and\n$|\\Sigma|$ is the size of the alphabet. We show that this is optimal up to a\n$O(\\mathrm{polylog}(n\\ell))$ factor. Further, we show that for\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differential privacy, the bound for document counting can\nbe improved to $O(\\sqrt{\\ell} \\cdot\\mathrm{polylog}(n\\ell|\\Sigma|))$.\nAdditionally, our data structures are efficient. In particular, our data\nstructures use $O(n\\ell^2)$ space, $O(n^2\\ell^4)$ preprocessing time, and\n$O(|P|)$ query time where $P$ is the query pattern. Along the way, we develop a\nnew technique for differentially privately computing a general class of\ncounting functions on trees of independent interest.\n  Our data structures immediately lead to improved algorithms for related\nproblems, such as privately mining frequent substrings and $q$-grams. For\n$q$-grams, we further improve the preprocessing time of the data structure.",

    "abstract": "In Extreme Multi Label Completion (XMLCo), the objective is to predict the\nmissing labels of a collection of documents. Together with XML Classification,\nXMLCo is arguably one of the most challenging document classification tasks, as\nthe very high number of labels (at least ten of thousands) is generally very\nlarge compared to the number of available labelled documents in the training\ndataset. Such a task is often accompanied by a taxonomy that encodes the labels\norganic relationships, and many methods have been proposed to leverage this\nhierarchy to improve the results of XMLCo algorithms. In this paper, we propose\na new approach to this problem, TAMLEC (Taxonomy-Aware Multi-task Learning for\nExtreme multi-label Completion). TAMLEC divides the problem into several\nTaxonomy-Aware Tasks, i.e. subsets of labels adapted to the hierarchical paths\nof the taxonomy, and trains on these tasks using a dynamic Parallel Feature\nsharing approach, where some parts of the model are shared between tasks while\nothers are task-specific. Then, at inference time, TAMLEC uses the labels\navailable in a document to infer the appropriate tasks and to predict missing\nlabels. To achieve this result, TAMLEC uses a modified transformer architecture\nthat predicts ordered sequences of labels on a Weak-Semilattice structure that\nis naturally induced by the tasks. This approach yields multiple advantages.\nFirst, our experiments on real-world datasets show that TAMLEC outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods for various XMLCo problems. Second, TAMLEC is by\nconstruction particularly suited for few-shots XML tasks, where new tasks or\nlabels are introduced with only few examples, and extensive evaluations\nhighlight its strong performance compared to existing methods.",

Accordingly, a Mixed-Integer\nLinear Programming (MILP) model is extended based on the big-bucket\nformulation, optimizing the total tardiness and overtime costs. Given the\ncomplexity of the problem, a cutting plane method is employed to simplify the\nmodel.

Furthermore, a post-processing approach is implemented to\nincorporate lot-streaming possibility. Computational experiments demonstrate:\n1) the simplified model performs effectively in terms of both solution quality\nand computational time; and 2) although the model encounters challenges with\nlarge-scale instances, the proposed matheuristic methods achieve satisfactory\noutcomes; and 3) it can be inferred that the complexity of the models and\nsolution methods are independent of the learning effect; however, the value of\nlearning effect may impact the performance of the lower bounds; 4) in\nmanufacturing settings, where the lot-streaming is possible, incorporating\npost-processing can drastically improve the objective function; 5) the impact\nof the period-based learning effect in the results is significant, and the\nmodel's sensitivity to time-based parameters (e.g., learning rate) is more than\ncost-based ones (e.g., tardiness cost).",

These stellar halos could help shed light on\nour understanding of the assembly of dwarf galaxies and their evolution, and\nallow us to test the hierarchical model for the formation of structures at\nsmall scales. We aim to characterise the stellar halos of simulated dwarf\ngalaxies and analyse their evolution and accretion history. We use a sample of\n17 simulated galaxies from the Auriga Project with a stellar mass range from\n3.28x10^8 Msun to 2.08x10^10 Msun. We define the stellar halo as the stellar\nmaterial located outside an ellipsoid with semi-major axes equal to 4 times the\nhalf light radius (Rh) of each galaxy. We find that the inner regions of the\nstellar halo (4 to 6 times the Rh) are dominated by in-situ material. For the\nless massive simulated dwarfs (M*<=4.54x10^8 Msun), this dominance extends to\nall radii. We find that this in-situ stellar halo is mostly formed in the inner\nregions of the galaxies and then ejected into the outskirts during interactions\nand merger events. In ~50% of the galaxies, the stripped gas from satellites\ncontributed to the formation of this in-situ halo. The stellar halos of the\ngalaxies more massive than M*>=1x10^9 Msun are dominated by the accreted\ncomponent beyond 6 Rh. We find that the more massive dwarf galaxies accrete\nstellar material until later times (t90~4.44 Gyr ago, being t90 the formation\ntime) than the less massive ones (t90~8.17 Gyr ago), impacting on the formation\ntime of the accreted stellar halos. The galaxies have a range of 1 to 7\nsignificant progenitors contributing to their accreted component but there is\nno correlation between this quantity and the galaxies' accreted mass.",

In addition, to enhance the capability to discriminate between signal\n(photon-initiated events) and background (hadron-initiated) events, we apply a\nphoton tag. This involves using relevant probability distribution functions to\nclassify each event as more likely to be either a photon or a hadron. We\ndemonstrate that the stacking method can effectively distinguish between events\ninitiated by photons and those initiated by hadrons (background). The number of\nphoton events in a data sample, as well as the flare(s) duration can also be\nretrieved correctly.

Using high-quality and balanced datasets sourced from GitHub,\nwe fine-tuned four SLMs and five LLMs with PEFT techniques, including prompt\ntuning, prefix tuning, LoRA, and (IA)3. Results show that PEFT methods achieve\ncomparable or better performance than full fine-tuning while consuming less GPU\nmemory. LLMs generally outperform SLMs on detecting certain smells (e.g.,\nComplex Conditional), while SLMs do better on others (e.g., Data Class).\nAdditionally, increasing training dataset size significantly boosted\nperformance, while increasing trainable parameters did not. Our findings\nhighlight PEFT methods as effective and scalable solutions, outperforming\nexisting heuristic-based, DL-based, and In-Context Learning approaches for code\nsmell detection.",

We notice them\nin hate speech, fake news, and propaganda. By improving the systems for\ncomputational detection of rhetorical figures, we can also improve tasks such\nas hate speech and fake news detection, sentiment analysis, opinion mining, or\nargument mining. Unfortunately, there is a lack of annotated data, as well as\nqualified annotators that would help us build large corpora to train machine\nlearning models for the detection of rhetorical figures. The situation is\nparticularly difficult in languages other than English, and for rhetorical\nfigures other than metaphor, sarcasm, and irony. To overcome this issue, we\ndevelop a web application called \"Find your Figure\" that facilitates the\nidentification and annotation of German rhetorical figures. The application is\nbased on the German Rhetorical ontology GRhOOT which we have specially adapted\nfor this purpose. In addition, we improve the user experience with Retrieval\nAugmented Generation (RAG). In this paper, we present the restructuring of the\nontology, the development of the web application, and the built-in RAG\npipeline. We also identify the optimal RAG settings for our application.

Typically, pillars are modeled with linear elastic\nmaterials in the literature; in reality, the soft materials used for their\nfabrication exhibit a rate-dependent constitutive behavior.\n  This study investigates the role of viscoelasticity in the adhesion between a\nmushroom-shaped pillar and a rigid flat countersurface. Interactions at the\ninterface are assumed to be governed by van der Waals forces, and the material\nis modeled using a standard linear solid model. Normal push and release contact\ncycles are simulated at different approaching and retracting speeds.\n  Results reveal that, in the presence of an interfacial defect, a\nmonotonically increasing trend in the pull-off force with pulling speed is\nobserved, and the corresponding change in the contact pressure distribution\nsuggests a transition from short-range to long-range adhesion. This phenomenon\ncorroborates recent experimental and theoretical investigations. Moreover, the\npull-off force remains invariant to the loading history, due to our assumption\nof a flat-flat contact interface. Conversely, in absence of defects, detachment\noccurs after reaching the theoretical contact strength, and the corresponding\npull-off force is found to be rate independent.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, yet recent\nfindings reveal that their deeper layers often contribute minimally and can be\npruned without affecting overall performance. While some view this as an\nopportunity for model compression, we identify it as a training shortfall\nrooted in the widespread use of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). We\ndemonstrate that Pre-LN, commonly employed in models like GPT and LLaMA, leads\nto diminished gradient norms in its deeper layers, reducing their\neffectiveness. In contrast, Post-Layer Normalization (Post-LN) preserves larger\ngradient norms in deeper layers but suffers from vanishing gradients in earlier\nlayers. To address this, we introduce Mix-LN, a novel normalization technique\nthat combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the same model. Mix-LN\napplies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, ensuring\nmore uniform gradients across layers. This allows all parts of the\nnetwork--both shallow and deep layers--to contribute effectively to training.\nExtensive experiments with various model sizes from 70M to 7B demonstrate that\nMix-LN consistently outperforms both Pre-LN and Post-LN, promoting more\nbalanced, healthier gradient norms throughout the network, and enhancing the\noverall quality of LLM pre-training. Furthermore, we demonstrate that models\npre-trained with Mix-LN learn better compared to those using Pre-LN or Post-LN\nduring supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF), highlighting the critical importance of high-quality deep\nlayers. By effectively addressing the inefficiencies of deep layers in current\nLLMs, Mix-LN unlocks their potential, enhancing model capacity without\nincreasing model size.

The coercivity was, moreover,\ndemonstrated to increase linearly with temperature in a finite range around\nroom temperature. Based on these results, a mechanism is proposed for providing\nthe necessary enhancement of the magnetic anisotropy. It is shown that nuclear\nvibrations (phonons) coupled to ferromagnetic spin excitations (magnons) absorb\nthe thermal energy in the system, thereby diverting the excess energy that\notherwise would excite magnons in the ferromagnet.

We found the occurrence of coherent spin-wave\nharmonics arising from the gyration of vortex cores driven by microwave fields.\nThis phenomenon reveals a universal mechanism where the periodical motion of\ndelta function-like objects such as vortex cores gives rise to a frequency\ncomb. Our results pave the way for creating nanoscale, tunable spin-based\nfrequency multipliers and open new possibilities for frequency comb generation\nin a variety of systems.",

The InAsOI consists of\nan InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic-electrically-insulating InAlAs\nmetamorphic buffer, which allows the electrical decoupling of surface-exposed\nadjacent devices together with a high critical current density integration. The\nminiaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the\nintegration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, allowing an\nincreased gate coupling with the transistor channel with consequent reduced\ngate operating voltages and leakages. As well as for Si-based FETs, integrating\nhigh-k gate insulators with JoFETs promises similar advantages in\nsuperconducting electronics. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical\nproperties of InAsOI-based JoFETs featuring different high-k gate insulators,\nnamely, HfO2 and Al2O3. We found that both the ungated and gate-tunable\nelectrical properties of the JoFETs are strongly dependent on the insulator\nchosen. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching\ncurrent and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative\ngate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical\nperformance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to\nthe higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties\nof InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1\nK. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs\nexhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, from which an\nedge-peaked supercurrent density distribution was calculated.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of distributively seeking the equilibria of\naggregative games with bilevel structures is studied. Different from the\ntraditional aggregative games, here the aggregation is determined by the\nminimizer of a virtual leader's objective function in the inner level, which\ndepends on the actions of the players in the outer level. Moreover, the global\nobjective function of the virtual leader is formed by the sum of some local\nfunctions with two arguments, each of which is strongly convex with respect to\nthe second argument. When making decisions, each player in the outer level only\nhas access to a local part of the virtual leader's objective function. To\nhandle this problem, first, we propose a second order gradient-based\ndistributed algorithm, where the Hessian matrices associated with the objective\nfunctions of the leader are involved. By the algorithm, players update their\nactions while cooperatively minimizing the objective function of the virtual\nleader to estimate the aggregation by communicating with their neighbors via a\nconnected graph. Under mild assumptions on the graph and cost functions, we\nprove that the actions of players asymptotically converge to the Nash\nequilibrium point. Then, for the case where the Hessian matrices associated\nwith the objective functions of the virtual leader are not available, we\npropose a first order gradient-based distributed algorithm, where a distributed\ntwo-point estimate strategy is developed to estimate the gradients of players'\ncost functions in the outer level. Under the same conditions, we prove that the\nconvergence errors of players' actions to the Nash equilibrium point are linear\nwith respect to the estimate parameters. Finally, simulations are provided to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.",

To our knowledge,\nwe are the first to fill this gap by integrating non-interactive zero-knowledge\n(NIZK) proofs into CP-ABE keys and outsourcing the verification process to a\nsmart contract. To meet the decentralization requirement, we incorporate a\ndecentralized CP-ABE scheme into the proposed data sharing system.\nAdditionally, we provide an implementation based on smart contract to determine\nwhether an access control policy is satisfied by a set of CP-ABE keys. We also\nintroduce an open incentive mechanism to encourage honest participation in data\nsharing. Hence, the key abuse issue is resolved through the NIZK proof and the\nincentive mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis and conduct\ncomprehensive experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the\ndata sharing system. Based on the proposed accountable approach, we further\nillustrate an application in GameFi, where players can play to earn or\ncontribute to an accountable DAO, fostering a thriving metaverse ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "The pulsating variable star Mira (omikron Ceti) was observed by David\nFabricius (Frisia) in 1596 and 1609. We review suggested previous detections\n(e.g. China, Hipparchos). We analyze all Mira records from Fabricius in their\nhistorical context. Fabricius measured the separation of Mira to other stars to\n\\pm 1.6-1.7'. From his texts, we derive a brightness (slightly brighter than\nHamal) of ca. 1.9 \\pm 0.1 mag and a color index B-V \\simeq 1.3-1.4 mag (`like\nMars') for 1596 Aug 3 (jul.). Mira started to fainten 19 days later and was\nobserved until mid/late Oct. We show why such a red star cannot be followed by\nthe naked eye until ca. 6 mag: For Mira's color at disappearance and altitude\nfrom Frisia, the limit is reduced by ca. 1.0 mag. Since Fabricius connected the\nMira brightening with the close-by prograde Jupiter, he re-detected it only 12\nyears later, probably shortly before a relatively bright maximum - discoveries\nare strongly affected by biases. A Mira period of 330.2 days is consistent with\nboth the oldest data (from Fabricius 1596 to Hevelius 1660) and the most\ncurrent data (VSX 2004-2023), so that we see no evidence for secular period or\nphase shifts. (We also present Fabricius' observations of P Cygni in 1602.)",

As a\nresult, manipulation commonly occurs at the object level (macroscopic level),\nwhich is equally important as microscopic traces. Therefore, integrating these\ntwo levels into the mesoscopic level presents a new perspective for IML\nresearch.

Continuous current distributions,\nor beamformers, are designed to maximize the secrecy transmission rate under a\npower constraint and to minimize the required transmission power for achieving\na specific target secrecy rate. On this basis, the fundamental secrecy\nperformance limits achieved by CAPAs are analyzed by deriving closed-form\nexpressions for the maximum secrecy rate (MSR) and minimum required power\n(MRP), along with the corresponding optimal current distributions. To provide\nfurther insights, asymptotic analyses are performed for the MSR and MRP, which\nreveals that i) for the MSR, the optimal current distribution simplifies to\nmaximal ratio transmission (MRT) beamforming in the low-SNR regime and to\nzero-forcing (ZF) beamforming in the high-SNR regime; i) for the MRP, the\noptimal current distribution simplifies to ZF beamforming in the high-SNR\nregime. The derived results are specialized to the typical array structures,\ne.g., planar CAPAs and planar spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). The rate and\npower scaling laws are further analyzed by assuming an infinitely large CAPA.\nNumerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed secure continuous\nbeamforming design outperforms MRT and ZF beamforming in terms of both\nachievable secrecy rate and power efficiency; ii) CAPAs achieve superior\nsecrecy performance compared to conventional SPDAs.",

In recent years, UGC has\nbecome an essential part of the evolving video game industry, influencing both\ngame culture and community dynamics. The ability for users to actively\ncontribute to the games they engage with has shifted the landscape of gaming\nfrom a one-directional entertainment experience into a collaborative,\nuser-driven ecosystem. Therefore, this growing trend highlights the urgent need\nfor summarizing the current UGC development in game industry. Our conference\npaper has systematically classified the existing UGC in games and the UGC\neditors separately into four types. However, the previous survey lacks the\ndepth and precision necessary to capture the wide-ranging and increasingly\ncomplex nature of UGC. To this end, as an extension of previous work, this\npaper presents a refined and expanded classification of UGC and UGC editors\nwithin video games, offering a more robust and comprehensive framework with\nrepresentative cases that better reflects the diversity and nuances of\ncontemporary user-generated contributions.

    "abstract": "The limited availability of labeled data has driven advancements in\nsemi-supervised learning for medical image segmentation. Modern large-scale\nmodels tailored for general segmentation, such as the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), have revealed robust generalization capabilities. However, applying\nthese models directly to medical image segmentation still exposes performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we propose a learnable prompting SAM-induced\nKnowledge distillation framework (KnowSAM) for semi-supervised medical image\nsegmentation. Firstly, we propose a Multi-view Co-training (MC) strategy that\nemploys two distinct sub-networks to employ a co-teaching paradigm, resulting\nin more robust outcomes. Secondly, we present a Learnable Prompt Strategy (LPS)\nto dynamically produce dense prompts and integrate an adapter to fine-tune SAM\nspecifically for medical image segmentation tasks. Moreover, we propose\nSAM-induced Knowledge Distillation (SKD) to transfer useful knowledge from SAM\nto two sub-networks, enabling them to learn from SAM's predictions and\nalleviate the effects of incorrect pseudo-labels during training. Notably, the\npredictions generated by our subnets are used to produce mask prompts for SAM,\nfacilitating effective inter-module information exchange. Extensive\nexperimental results on various medical segmentation tasks demonstrate that our\nmodel outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation approaches.\nCrucially, our SAM distillation framework can be seamlessly integrated into\nother semi-supervised segmentation methods to enhance performance.

However,\nidentifying a priori, for example, the best time frequencies/scales to study a\ncertain system over-time, or the spatial distances at which correlations,\nsymmetries, and fluctuations are, most often non-trivial. Here we describe an\nunsupervised approach that, starting solely from the data of a system, allows\nlearning the characteristic length scales of the dominant key events/processes\nand the optimal spatiotemporal resolutions to characterize them. We tested this\napproach on time series data obtained from simulation or experimental\ntrajectories of various example many-body complex systems ranging from the\natomic to the macroscopic scale and having diverse internal dynamic\ncomplexities. Our method automatically analyzes the system data by analyzing\ncorrelations at all relevant inter-particle distances and at all possible\ninter-frame intervals in which their time series can be subdivided, namely, at\nall space and time resolutions. The optimal spatiotemporal resolution for\nstudying a certain system thus maximizes information extraction and\nclassification from the system's data, which we prove to be related to the\ncharacteristic spatiotemporal length scales of the local/collective physical\nevents dominating it. This approach is broadly applicable and can be used to\noptimize the study of different types of data (static distributions, time\nseries, or signals). The concept of 'optimal resolution' has a general\ncharacter and provides a robust basis for characterizing any type of system\nbased on its data, as well as to guide data analysis in general.",

However, real-world systems often exhibit stochastic\nbehavior, leading to non-repeatable outcomes.

    "abstract": "Real-world datasets often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, where vast\nmajority of classes known as tail classes have only few samples. Traditional\nmethods tend to overfit on these tail classes. Recently, a new approach called\nImbalanced SAM (ImbSAM) is proposed to leverage the generalization benefits of\nSharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) for long-tailed distributions. The main\nstrategy is to merely enhance the smoothness of the loss function for tail\nclasses. However, we argue that improving generalization in long-tail scenarios\nrequires a careful balance between head and tail classes. We show that neither\nSAM nor ImbSAM alone can fully achieve this balance. For SAM, we prove that\nalthough it enhances the model's generalization ability by escaping saddle\npoint in the overall loss landscape, it does not effectively address this for\ntail-class losses. Conversely, while ImbSAM is more effective at avoiding\nsaddle points in tail classes, the head classes are trained insufficiently,\nresulting in significant performance drops. Based on these insights, we propose\nStage-wise Saddle Escaping SAM (SSE-SAM), which uses complementary strengths of\nImbSAM and SAM in a phased approach. Initially, SSE-SAM follows the majority\nsample to avoid saddle points of the head-class loss. During the later phase,\nit focuses on tail-classes to help them escape saddle points. Our experiments\nconfirm that SSE-SAM has better ability in escaping saddles both on head and\ntail classes, and shows performance improvements.",

These successes are often attributed to strong base\nmodels that can generalize to novel tasks with limited supporting data while\nkeeping prior knowledge intact. However, these impressive results are based on\nthe availability of a large amount of high-quality data, which is often lacking\nin specialized biomedical applications. In such fields, models are usually\ndeveloped with limited data that arrive incrementally with novel categories.\nThis requires the model to adapt to new information while preserving existing\nknowledge. Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) methods offer a\npromising approach to addressing these challenges, but they also depend on\nstrong base models that face the same aforementioned limitations. To overcome\nthese constraints, we propose AnchorInv following the straightforward and\nefficient buffer-replay strategy. Instead of selecting and storing raw data,\nAnchorInv generates synthetic samples guided by anchor points in the feature\nspace. This approach protects privacy and regularizes the model for adaptation.\nWhen evaluated on three public physiological time series datasets, AnchorInv\nexhibits efficient knowledge forgetting prevention and improved adaptation to\nnovel classes, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.",

Therefore,\nmeasuring the gravitational redshift effect encoded in galaxy clustering\nprovides a powerful and novel cosmological probe of the LPI. Recent work by\nSaga et al. proposed its validation using the cross-correlation function\nbetween distinct galaxy samples, but their analysis focused solely on the\ndipole moment.

    "abstract": "A series of recent papers have modified the classical variational phase-field\nfracture models to successfully predict both the nucleation and propagation of\ncracks in brittle fracture under general loading conditions. This is done\nthrough the introduction of a consistent crack nucleation driving force in the\nphase field governing equations, which results in the model being able to\ncapture both the strength surface and fracture toughness of the material. This\ndriving force has been presented in the literature for the case of\nDrucker-Prager strength surface and specific choice of stress states on the\nstrength surface that are captured exactly for finite values of the phase field\nregularization length parameter $\\varepsilon$. Here we present an explicit\nanalytical expression for this driving force given a general material strength\nsurface when the functional form of the strength locus is linear in the\nmaterial parameter coefficients. In the limit $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, the\nformulation reproduces the exact material strength surface and for finite\n$\\varepsilon$ the strength surface is captured at any n 'distinct' points on\nthe strength surface where n is the minimum number of material coefficients\nrequired to describe it. The presentation of the driving force in the current\nwork facilitates the easy demonstration of its consistent nature. Further, in\nthe equation governing crack nucleation, the toughness in the classical models\nis shown to be replaced by an effective toughness in the modified theory, that\nis dependent on the stress.

    "abstract": "Ultracold trapped atomic ions excited into highly energetic Rydberg states\nconstitute a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing.\nElementary building blocks for such tasks are high-fidelity and sufficiently\nfast entangling two-qubit gates, which can be achieved via strong dipole-dipole\ninteractions between microwave-dressed Rydberg ions, as recently demonstrated\nin a breakthrough experiment at\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2152-9 . We theoretically\ninvestigate the performance of three protocols leading to controlled-phase gate\noperations. Starting from a microscopic description of Rydberg ions in a linear\nPaul trap, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that faithfully captures the\nessential dynamics underlying the gate protocols. We then use an optimization\nscheme to fine-tune experimentally controllable parameters like laser detuning\nand Rabi frequency to yield maximal gate fidelity under each studied protocol.\nWe show how non-adiabatic transitions resulting from fast laser driving\nrelative to the characteristic time scales of the system detrimentally affect\nthe fidelity. Despite this, we demonstrate that in the realistic scenario of\nRydberg ions with finite radiative lifetimes, optimizing the best found gate\nprotocol enables achievement of fidelities as high as $99.25\\,\\%$ for a gate\ntime of $0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. This considerably undercuts entangling gate\ndurations between ground-state ions, for which gate times are typically limited\nby the comparably slower time scales of vibrational modes. Overall, this places\ntrapped Rydberg ions into the regime where fast high-accuracy quantum computing\nand eventually quantum error correction become possible.",

In\nthis context, Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven effective for hate\nspeech detection and to promote interpretability. Nevertheless, they are\ncomputationally costly to run. In this work, we propose distilling big language\nmodels by using Chain-of-Thought to extract explanations that support the hate\nspeech classification task.

In this paper, we demonstrate\nthat distilled models deliver explanations of the same quality as larger models\nwhile surpassing them in classification performance.

    "abstract": "Ordinal Classification (OC) addresses those classification tasks where the\nlabels exhibit a natural order. Unlike nominal classification, which treats all\nclasses as mutually exclusive and unordered, OC takes the ordinal relationship\ninto account, producing more accurate and relevant results. This is\nparticularly critical in applications where the magnitude of classification\nerrors has significant consequences. Despite this, OC problems are often\ntackled using nominal methods, leading to suboptimal solutions. Although\ndecision trees are among the most popular classification approaches, ordinal\ntree-based approaches have received less attention when compared to other\nclassifiers. This work provides a comprehensive survey of ordinal splitting\ncriteria, standardising the notations used in the literature to enhance clarity\nand consistency. Three ordinal splitting criteria, Ordinal Gini (OGini),\nWeighted Information Gain (WIG), and Ranking Impurity (RI), are compared to the\nnominal counterparts of the first two (Gini and information gain), by\nincorporating them into a decision tree classifier. An extensive repository\nconsidering $45$ publicly available OC datasets is presented, supporting the\nfirst experimental comparison of ordinal and nominal splitting criteria using\nwell-known OC evaluation metrics. The results have been statistically analysed,\nhighlighting that OGini stands out as the best ordinal splitting criterion to\ndate, reducing the mean absolute error achieved by Gini by more than 3.02%.

We investigate the Kondo compensation of\nthe impurity spin resulting from this partial screening across the quantum\nphase transition, which together with the spin-spin correlation function serves\nas a measure of the Kondo cloud's integrity. Deep within the unscreened triplet\nphase, $\\Delta/T_K\\gg 1$, the compensation vanishes, signifying complete\ndecoupling of the impurity spin from the environment, while in the partially\nscreened doublet phase, $\\Delta/T_K\\ll 1$, it asymptotically approaches $1/2$,\nindicating that half of the spin is screened. Notably, there is a universal\njump in the compensation precisely at the phase transition, which we accurately\ncalculate. The spin-spin correlation function exhibits an oscillatory pattern\nwith an envelope function decaying as $\\sim 1/x$ at short distances. At larger\ndistances, the superconducting gap induces an exponentially decaying behavior\n$\\sim \\exp(-x/\\xi_\\Delta)$ governed by the superconducting correlation length\n$\\xi_\\Delta$, irrespective of the phase, without any distinctive features\nacross the transition.

In this work, we introduce a hybrid agent with a\nstochastic episode length selection strategy to alleviate the need for\nknowledge about the necessary episode length. Through simulations, we test the\nadapted hybrid agent's performance versus classical counterparts.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of deep generative models (DGMs) has significantly\nadvanced research in computer vision, providing a cost-effective alternative to\nacquiring vast quantities of expensive imagery. However, existing methods\npredominantly focus on synthesizing remote sensing (RS) images aligned with\nreal images in a global layout view, which limits their applicability in RS\nimage object detection (RSIOD) research. To address these challenges, we\npropose a multi-class and multi-scale object image generator based on DGMs,\ntermed MMO-IG, designed to generate RS images with supervised object labels\nfrom global and local aspects simultaneously. Specifically, from the local\nview, MMO-IG encodes various RS instances using an iso-spacing instance map\n(ISIM). During the generation process, it decodes each instance region with\niso-spacing value in ISIM-corresponding to both background and foreground\ninstances-to produce RS images through the denoising process of diffusion\nmodels. Considering the complex interdependencies among MMOs, we construct a\nspatial-cross dependency knowledge graph (SCDKG). This ensures a realistic and\nreliable multidirectional distribution among MMOs for region embedding, thereby\nreducing the discrepancy between source and target domains. Besides, we propose\na structured object distribution instruction (SODI) to guide the generation of\nsynthesized RS image content from a global aspect with SCDKG-based ISIM\ntogether. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our MMO-IG exhibits\nsuperior generation capabilities for RS images with dense MMO-supervised\nlabels, and RS detectors pre-trained with MMO-IG show excellent performance on\nreal-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Parallel manipulators, also called parallel kinematics machines (PKM), enable\nrobotic solutions for highly dynamic handling and machining applications. The\nsafe and accurate design and control necessitates high-fidelity dynamics\nmodels. Such modeling approaches have already been presented for PKM with\nsimple limbs (i.e. each limb is a serial kinematic chain). A systematic\nmodeling approach for PKM with complex limbs (i.e. limbs that possess kinematic\nloops) was not yet proposed despite the fact that many successful PKM comprise\ncomplex limbs. This paper presents a systematic modular approach to the\nkinematics and dynamics modeling of PKM with complex limbs that are built as\nserial arrangement of closed loops. The latter are referred to as hybrid limbs,\nand can be found in almost all PKM with complex limbs, such as the Delta robot.\nThe proposed method generalizes the formulation for PKM with simple limbs by\nmeans of local resolution of loop constraints, which is known as constraint\nembedding in multibody dynamics. The constituent elements of the method are the\nkinematic and dynamic equations of motions (EOM), and the inverse kinematics\nsolution of the limbs, i.e. the relation of platform motion and the motion of\nthe limbs. While the approach is conceptually independent of the used\nkinematics and dynamics formulation, a Lie group formulation is employed for\nderiving the EOM. The frame invariance of the Lie group formulation is used for\ndevising a modular modeling method where the EOM of a representative limb are\nused to derived the EOM of the limbs of a particular PKM. The PKM topology is\nexploited in a parallel computation scheme that shall allow for computationally\nefficient distributed evaluation of the overall EOM of the PKM. Finally, the\nmethod is applied to the IRSBot-2 and a 3\\underline{R}R[2RR]R Delta robot,\nwhich is presented in detail.",

PD is a structural semantics in the sense that it\ncarries information about the shape and structure of the data. Instead of\ntransmitting raw data, the transmitter communicates its PD semantics, and the\nreceiver carries out inference using the received semantics. We propose novel\nqualitative definitions for distortion and rate of PD semantics while\nquantitatively characterizing the trade-offs among the distortion, rate, and\ninference accuracy. Simulations demonstrate that unlike raw data or autoencoder\n(AE)-based latent representations, PD semantics leads to more effective use of\ntransmission channels, enhanced degrees of freedom for incorporating error\ndetection/correction capabilities, and improved robustness to channel\nimperfections. For instance, in a binary symmetric channel with nonzero\ncrossover probability settings, the minimum rate required for Bose, Chaudhuri,\nand Hocquenghem (BCH)-coded PD semantics to achieve an inference accuracy over\n80% is approximately 15 times lower than the rate required for the coded\nAE-latent representations.

It is used to understand the evolution of systems as\nlarge as entire galaxies and as small as individual molecules. With predefined\nconditions on the evolution of dy-namical systems, the underlying differential\nequations have to fulfill specific constraints in time and space. This class of\nproblems is known as boundary value problems. This thesis presents novel\napproaches to learn time-reversible deterministic and stochastic dynamics\nconstrained by initial and final conditions. The dynamics are inferred by\nmachine learning algorithms from observed data, which is in contrast to the\ntraditional approach of solving differential equations by numerical\nintegration. The work in this thesis examines a set of problems of increasing\ndifficulty each of which is concerned with learning a different aspect of the\ndynamics. Initially, we consider learning deterministic dynamics from ground\ntruth solutions which are constrained by deterministic boundary conditions.\nSecondly, we study a boundary value problem in discrete state spaces, where the\nforward dynamics follow a stochastic jump process and the boundary conditions\nare discrete probability distributions. In particular, the stochastic dynamics\nof a specific jump process, the Ehrenfest process, is considered and the\nreverse time dynamics are inferred with machine learning. Finally, we\ninvestigate the problem of inferring the dynamics of a continuous-time\nstochastic process between two probability distributions without any reference\ninformation.

    "abstract": "All-electrical baseband control of qubits facilitates scaling up quantum\nprocessors by removing issues of crosstalk and heat generation. In\nsemiconductor quantum dots, this is enabled by multi-spin qubit encodings, such\nas the exchange-only qubit, where high-fidelity readout and both single- and\ntwo-qubit operations have been demonstrated. However, their performance is\nlimited by unavoidable leakage states that are energetically close to the\ncomputational subspace. In this work, we introduce an alternative, scalable\nspin qubit architecture that leverages strong spin-orbit interactions of hole\nnanostructures for baseband qubit operations while completely eliminating\nleakage channels and reducing the overall gate overhead. This encoding is\nintrinsically robust to local variability in hole spin properties and operates\nwith two degenerate states, removing the need for precise calibration and\nmitigating heat generation from fast signal sources. Finally, our architecture\nis fully compatible with current technology, utilizing the same initialization,\nreadout, and multi-qubit protocols of state-of-the-art spin-1/2 systems. By\naddressing critical scalability challenges, our design offers a robust and\nscalable pathway for semiconductor spin qubit technologies.",

The latter\ncouples not only to $z$-projection of the total spin on a triangular plaquette\nbut also to the product of $z$-components of three spins located on vertices of\nthe triangle. In the case of strong attractive interaction, the corresponding\neffective model is derived from the repulsive one using the one-spin-component\nparticle-hole transformation.

In this paper, we propose GAGS, a framework that distills 2D CLIP\nfeatures into 3D Gaussian splatting, enabling open-vocabulary queries for\nrenderings on arbitrary viewpoints. The main challenge of distilling 2D\nfeatures for 3D fields lies in the multiview inconsistency of extracted 2D\nfeatures, which provides unstable supervision for the 3D feature field. GAGS\naddresses this challenge with two novel strategies. First, GAGS associates the\nprompt point density of SAM with the camera distances, which significantly\nimproves the multiview consistency of segmentation results. Second, GAGS\nfurther decodes a granularity factor to guide the distillation process and this\ngranularity factor can be learned in a unsupervised manner to only select the\nmultiview consistent 2D features in the distillation process. Experimental\nresults on two datasets demonstrate significant performance and stability\nimprovements of GAGS in visual grounding and semantic segmentation, with an\ninference speed 2$\\times$ faster than baseline methods.

Traditional metrics like BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, and ROUGE often miss\nsemantic depth, while trained metrics such as CLIP-Score, PAC-S, and Polos are\nlimited in zero-shot scenarios. Advanced Language Model-based metrics also\nstruggle with aligning to nuanced human preferences. To address these issues,\nwe introduce G-VEval, a novel metric inspired by G-Eval and powered by the new\nGPT-4o. G-VEval uses chain-of-thought reasoning in large multimodal models and\nsupports three modes: reference-free, reference-only, and combined,\naccommodating both video and image inputs. We also propose MSVD-Eval, a new\ndataset for video captioning evaluation, to establish a more transparent and\nconsistent framework for both human experts and evaluation metrics. It is\ndesigned to address the lack of clear criteria in existing datasets by\nintroducing distinct dimensions of Accuracy, Completeness, Conciseness, and\nRelevance (ACCR). Extensive results show that G-VEval outperforms existing\nmethods in correlation with human annotations, as measured by Kendall tau-b and\nKendall tau-c. This provides a flexible solution for diverse captioning tasks\nand suggests a straightforward yet effective approach for large language models\nto understand video content, paving the way for advancements in automated\ncaptioning.

    "abstract": "Recently, semantic communications have drawn great attention as the\ngroundbreaking concept surpasses the limited capacity of Shannon's theory.\nSpecifically, semantic communications probably become crucial in realizing\nvisual tasks that demand massive network traffic. Although highly distinctive\nforms of visual semantics exist for computer vision tasks, a thorough\ninvestigation of what visual semantics can be transmitted in time and which one\nis required for completing different visual tasks has not yet been reported. To\nthis end, we first scrutinize the achievable throughput in transmitting\nexisting visual semantics through the limited wireless communication bandwidth.\nIn addition, we further demonstrate the resulting performance of various visual\ntasks for each visual semantic. Based on the empirical testing, we suggest a\ntask-adaptive selection of visual semantics is crucial for real-time semantic\ncommunications for visual tasks, where we transmit basic semantics (e.g.,\nobjects in the given image) for simple visual tasks, such as classification,\nand richer semantics (e.g., scene graphs) for complex tasks, such as image\nregeneration. To further improve transmission efficiency, we suggest a\nfiltering method for scene graphs, which drops redundant information in the\nscene graph, thus allowing the sending of essential semantics for completing\nthe given task. We confirm the efficacy of our task-adaptive semantic\ncommunication approach through extensive simulations in wireless channels,\nshowing more than 45 times larger throughput over a naive transmission of\noriginal data.

Despite their critical influence, the distinct contributions of\nmodel priors versus demonstrations to hypothesis generation have been\nunderexplored. This study bridges this gap by systematically evaluating three\ninductive reasoning strategies across five real-world tasks with three LLMs.\nOur empirical findings reveal that, hypothesis generation is primarily driven\nby the model's inherent priors; removing demonstrations results in minimal loss\nof hypothesis quality and downstream usage. Further analysis shows the result\nis consistent across various label formats with different label configurations,\nand prior is hard to override, even under flipped labeling.

    "abstract": "Parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) are characterized by closed kinematic\nloops, due to the parallel arrangement of limbs but also due to the existence\nof kinematic loops within the limbs. Moreover, many PKM are built with limbs\nconstructed by serially combining kinematic loops. Such limbs are called\nhybrid, which form a particular class of complex limbs. Design and model-based\ncontrol requires accurate dynamic PKM models desirably without model\nsimplifications. Dynamics modeling then necessitates kinematic relations of all\nmembers of the PKM, in contrast to the standard kinematics modeling of PKM,\nwhere only the forward and inverse kinematics solution for the manipulator\n(relating input and output motions) are computed. This becomes more involved\nfor PKM with hybrid limbs. In this paper a modular modeling approach is\nemployed, where limbs are treated separately, and the individual dynamic\nequations of motions (EOM) are subsequently assembled to the overall model. Key\nto the kinematic modeling is the constraint resolution for the individual loops\nwithin the limbs. This local constraint resolution is a special case of the\ngeneral \\emph{constraint embedding} technique. The proposed method finally\nallows for a systematic modeling of general PKM.

    "abstract": "General Relativity suffers for two main problems which have not yet been\novercome: it predicts spacetime singularities and cannot be formulated as a\nperturbative renormalizable theory. In particular, many attempts have been made\nfor avoiding singularities, such as considering higher order or infinite\nderivative theories. The price to pay in both cases is to give up locality and\ntherefore they are known altogether as non-local theories of gravity. In this\npaper, we investigate how to recognize the presence of non-local effects by\nexploiting the power emitted by gravitational waves in a binary system in\npresence of non-local corrections as $R\\Box^{-1}R$ to the Hilbert-Einstein\naction. After solving the field equations in terms of the source stress-energy\ntensor $T_{\\mu\\nu}$ and obtaining the gravitational wave stress-energy\npseudo-tensor, $\\tau_{\\mu\\nu}$, we find that the General Relativity quadrupole\nformula is modified in a non-trivial way, making it feasible to find a possible\nsignature of non-locality. Our final results on the gravitational wave\nstress-energy pseudo-tensor could also be applied to several astrophysical\nscenarios involving energy or momentum loss, potentially providing multiple\ntests for non-local deviations from General Relativity. We finally discuss the\ndetectability of the massless transverse scalar mode, discovering that,\nalthough this radiation is extremely weak, in a small range around the model\ndivergence, its amplitude could fall within the low-frequency Einstein\nTelescope sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The black box problem in machine learning has led to the introduction of an\never-increasing set of explanation methods for complex models. These\nexplanations have different properties, which in turn has led to the problem of\nmethod selection: which explanation method is most suitable for a given use\ncase? In this work, we propose a unifying framework of attribution-based\nexplanation methods, which provides a step towards a rigorous study of the\nsimilarities and differences of explanations. We first introduce removal-based\nattribution methods (RBAMs), and show that an extensively broad selection of\nexisting methods can be viewed as such RBAMs. We then introduce the canonical\nadditive decomposition (CAD). This is a general construction for additively\ndecomposing any function based on the central idea of removing (groups of)\nfeatures. We proceed to show that indeed every valid additive decomposition is\nan instance of the CAD, and that any removal-based attribution method is\nassociated with a specific CAD. Next, we show that any removal-based\nattribution method can be completely defined as a game-theoretic value or\ninteraction index for a specific (possibly constant-shifted) cooperative game,\nwhich is defined using the corresponding CAD of the method. We then use this\nintrinsic connection to define formal descriptions of specific behaviours of\nexplanation methods, which we also call functional axioms, and identify\nsufficient conditions on the corresponding CAD and game-theoretic value or\ninteraction index of an attribution method under which the attribution method\nis guaranteed to adhere to these functional axioms. Finally, we show how this\nunifying framework can be used to develop new, efficient approximations for\nexisting explanation methods.",

First, a novel unidirectional Context Mamba\nmodule is designed to scan frame features along the temporal dimension,\ngathering target change cues throughout the entire sequence. Specifically,\ntarget-related information in frame features is compressed into a hidden state\nspace through selective scanning mechanism. The target information across the\nentire video is continuously aggregated into target variation cues. Next, we\ninject the target change cues into the attention mechanism, providing temporal\ninformation for modeling the relationship between the template and search\nframes. The advantage of MambaLCT is its ability to continuously extend the\nlength of the context, capturing complete target change cues, which enhances\nthe stability and robustness of the tracker.

High\naccuracy measurements of neutron flux are essential for accurate cross section\nmeasurements; measurements of this flux with respect to the 1 H(n,n)p cross\nsection can be made with the proton recoil technique.

Previous VEL tasks rely on textual inputs, but\nwriting queries for complex scenes can be challenging. Visual inputs like\nclicks or bounding boxes offer a more convenient alternative. Therefore, we\npropose a new task, Pixel-Level Visual Entity Linking (PL-VEL), which uses\npixel masks from visual inputs to refer to objects, supplementing reference\nmethods for VEL. To facilitate research on this task, we have constructed the\nMaskOVEN-Wiki dataset through an entirely automatic reverse region-entity\nannotation framework. This dataset contains over 5 million annotations aligning\npixel-level regions with entity-level labels, which will advance visual\nunderstanding towards fine-grained. Moreover, as pixel masks correspond to\nsemantic regions in an image, we enhance previous patch-interacted attention\nwith region-interacted attention by a visual semantic tokenization approach.\nManual evaluation results indicate that the reverse annotation framework\nachieved a 94.8% annotation success rate. Experimental results show that models\ntrained on this dataset improved accuracy by 18 points compared to zero-shot\nmodels.

GAMEBoT decomposes complex reasoning in games into predefined\nmodular subproblems. This decomposition allows us to design a suite of\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts that leverage domain knowledge to guide LLMs in\naddressing these subproblems before action selection. Furthermore, we develop a\nsuite of rule-based algorithms to generate ground truth for these subproblems,\nenabling rigorous validation of the LLMs' intermediate reasoning steps. This\napproach facilitates evaluation of both the quality of final actions and the\naccuracy of the underlying reasoning process. GAMEBoT also naturally alleviates\nthe risk of data contamination through dynamic games and head-to-head LLM\ncompetitions. We benchmark 17 prominent LLMs across eight games, encompassing\nvarious strategic abilities and game characteristics. Our results suggest that\nGAMEBoT presents a significant challenge, even when LLMs are provided with\ndetailed CoT prompts. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/gamebot",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a novel Wi-Fi fingerprinting system that uses Channel\nState Information (CSI) data for fine-grained pedestrian localization. The\nproposed system exploits the frequency diversity and spatial diversity of the\nfeatures extracted from CSI data to generate a 2D+channel image termed as a CSI\nFingerprint Map. We then use this CSI Fingerprint Map representation of CSI\ndata to generate a pedestrian trajectory hypothesis using a hybrid architecture\nthat combines a Convolutional Neural Network and a Long Short-Term Memory\nRecurrent Neural Network model. The proposed architecture exploits the temporal\nand spatial relationship information among the CSI data observations gathered\nat neighboring locations. A particle filter is then employed to separate out\nthe most likely hypothesis matching a human walk model. The experimental\nperformance of our method is compared to existing deep learning localization\nmethods such ConFi, DeepFi and to a self-developed temporal-feature based LSTM\nbased location classifier. The experimental results show marked improvement\nwith an average RMSE of 0.36 m in a moderately dynamic and 0.17 m in a static\nenvironment. Our method is essentially a proof of concept that with (1) sparse\navailability of observations, (2) limited infrastructure requirements, (3)\nmoderate level of short-term and long-term noise in the training and testing\nenvironment, reliable fine-grained Wi-Fi based pedestrian localization is a\npotential option.",

By enabling\nassetuser matching, organizations gain valuable insights that can be used to\noptimize user health and safety, asset utilization, and maintenance. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach to address this gap by leveraging existing\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE)-enabled low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices.\nThe proposed framework comprises the following components: i) a wearable\ndevice, ii) an IoT device attached to or embedded in the assets, iii) an\nalgorithm to estimate the distance between assets and operators by exploiting\nsimple received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements via an Extended\nKalman Filter (EKF), and iv) a cloud-based algorithm that collects all\nestimated distances to derive the correct asset-operator matching. The\neffectiveness of the proposed system has been validated through indoor and\noutdoor experiments in a construction setting for identifying the operator of a\npower tool. A physical prototype was developed to evaluate the algorithms in a\nrealistic setup.

Results show how gain\nmodulation determine the type of elementary navigation process within the state\nspace of a network of neuronal populations of excitatory neurons regulated by\ninhibition.

Feedback from active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) is a promising mechanism for balancing cooling in CCs; however,\nthe role of AGN feedback in CC/NCC transitions remains elusive. In this work,\nwe perform three-dimensional binary cluster merger simulations incorporating\nAGN feedback and radiative cooling, aiming to investigate the heating effects\nfrom mergers and AGN feedback on CC destruction.

Here, we\npresent the first application of the extragalactic globular cluster (GC)\nnear-infrared spectroscopy survey, and present evidence that these GCs reveal\nan age zero-point problem of stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. This\nproblem has already been identified in the optical range for the GCs of the\nMilky Way. Such an issue arises when derived GC spectroscopic ages appear older\nthan the Universe itself. We extend this discussion for the first time to the\nNIR, specifically using the Pa$_{\\rm\\beta}$ line at 1.28~microns. We focus on\nthe GCs of the nearby Centaurus~A galaxy using their NIR spectra. This work\nbroadens our understanding of the age zero-point problem and emphasises the\nnecessity to revisit and refine SPS models, especially in the NIR domain.",

    "abstract": "One way to constrain the evolutionary histories of galaxies is to analyse\ntheir stellar populations. In the local Universe, our understanding of the\nstellar population properties of galaxies has traditionally relied on the study\nof optical absorption and emission-line features. In order to overcome\nlimitations intrinsic to this wavelength range, such as the age-metallicity\ndegeneracy and the high sensitivity to dust reddening, we must use wavelength\nranges beyond the optical. The near-infrared (NIR) offers a possibility to\nextract information on spectral signatures that are not as obvious in\ntraditional optical bands. Moreover, with the current and forthcoming\ngeneration of instrumentation focusing on the NIR, it is mandatory to explore\npossibilities within this wavelength range for nearby-Universe galaxies.\nHowever, although the NIR shows great potential, we are only beginning to\nunderstand it. Widely used techniques such as a full spectral fitting and line\nstrength indices need to be tested on systems that are as close to simple\nstellar populations as possible, and the result from the techniques need to be\ncompared to the yields from a traditional optical analysis. We present a NIR\nspectral survey of extragalactic globular clusters (GCs). The set was composed\nof 21 GCs from NGC5128 that were obtained with SOAR/TripleSpec4, which covered\nthe ~1.0-2.4$\\mu$m range with a spectral resolution R=$\\lambda/\\Delta\\lambda$\nof 3500. These spectra cover H$\\beta$ equivalent widths between 0.98$\\r{A}$ and\n4.32$\\r{A}$, and [MgFe]' between 0.24$\\r{A}$ and 3.76$\\r{A}$. This set is ideal\nfor performing absorption band measurements and a full spectral fitting, and it\ncan be used for kinematic studies and age and abundance measurements. With this\nlibrary, we expect to be able to probe the capabilities of NIR models, as well\nas to further improve stellar population estimates for the GCs around NGC5128.",

    "abstract": "In this project, we explore the concept of invertibility applied to\nserialisation and lexing frameworks. Recall that, on one hand, serialisation is\nthe process of taking a data structure and writing it to a bit array while\nparsing is the reverse operation, i.e., reading the bit array and constructing\nthe data structure back. While lexing, on the other hand, is the process of\nreading a stream of characters and splitting them into tokens, by following a\nlist of given rules. While used in different applications, both are similar in\ntheir abstract operation: they both take a list of simple characters and\nextract a more complex structure. Applications in which these two operations\nare used are different but they share a need for the invertibility of the\nprocess. For example, when tokenising a code file that was prettyprinted by a\ncompiler, one would expect to get the same sequence of tokens. Similarly, when\na spacecraft sends scientific data to the ground, one would expect the parsed\ndata to be the same as the one serialised by the spacecraft. The idea of this\nproject is to explore the idea of having a framework capable of generating\nparser/serialiser or lexer/prettyprinter pairs with a formally verified notion\nof invertibility. We first explore related works and frameworks. After that, we\npresent our verified lexer framework developed in Scala and verified using the\nStainless framework1. We explain the implementation choices we make and present\nthe specifications and their proofs. The code of the lexer with the proofs is\navailable on Github2.

For reducing reliance on\ndata labeling, domain adaptation offers an alternative solution by adapting\nmodels trained on labeled source data to unlabeled target data. Conventional\ndomain adaptation methods require access to source data. However, due to\nprivacy concerns, source emotional data may be inaccessible. To address this\nissue, we propose an unexplored task: source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) for\nVER, which does not have access to source data during the adaptation process.\nTo achieve this, we propose a novel framework termed Bridge then Begin Anew\n(BBA), which consists of two steps: domain-bridged model generation (DMG) and\ntarget-related model adaptation (TMA). First, the DMG bridges cross-domain gaps\nby generating an intermediate model, avoiding direct alignment between two VER\ndatasets with significant differences. Then, the TMA begins training the target\nmodel anew to fit the target structure, avoiding the influence of\nsource-specific knowledge.

One approach to\nsolving these problems is the augmentation procedure, which iteratively refines\na feasible solution by identifying augmenting steps from the Graver Basis--a\nset of test directions. While this method guarantees termination in\npolynomially many steps, computing the Graver Basis exactly is known to be\n$\\mathcal{NP}$-hard.

MAPLE extracts test\ndirections by optimizing non-convex continuous problems, leveraging first-order\nmethods to enable parallelizable implementation. The resulting set of\ndirections is then used in multiple augmentations, each seeking to improve the\nsolution's optimality.

This paper introduces the\nDouble Machine Learning (DML) analysis method to the field of driver state\nanalysis to tackle this challenge. To train and test the DML model, a driving\nsimulator experiment with 42 participants was conducted. All participants drove\nSAE level-3 vehicles and conducted three types of cognitive tasks in a 3-hour\ndriving experiment. Drivers' subjective cognitive load and drowsiness levels\nwere collected throughout the experiment.

The results show that our approach successfully decoupled and\ninferred the complex causal relationships between multiple types of drowsiness\nand cognitive load. Additionally, we identified key physiological and\neye-tracking indicators in the presence of multiple driver states and under the\ninfluence of a single state, excluding the influence of other driver states,\nenvironmental factors, and individual characteristics.

First, some commentators intuitively\nbelieve that people are more reliable than machines and that government works\nbetter in risk control than companies' self-regulation, but they do not fully\ncompare the differences between the status quo and the proposed replacements.\nSecond, when proposing some regulatory tools, some policymakers and researchers\ndo not realize and even gloss over the fact that harms and costs are also\ninherent in their proposals. Third, some policy proposals are initiated based\non a false comparison between the AI-driven world, where AI does lead to some\nrisks, and an entirely idealized world, where no risk exists at all. However,\nthe appropriate approach is to compare the world where AI causes risks to the\nreal world where risks are everywhere, but people can live well with these\nrisks.

    "abstract": "Domain generalization aims to learn a model from multiple training domains\nand generalize it to unseen test domains. Recent theory has shown that seeking\nthe deep models, whose parameters lie in the flat minima of the loss landscape,\ncan significantly reduce the out-of-domain generalization error. However,\nexisting methods often neglect the consistency of loss landscapes in different\ndomains, resulting in models that are not simultaneously in the optimal flat\nminima in all domains, which limits their generalization ability. To address\nthis issue, this paper proposes an iterative Self-Feedback Training (SFT)\nframework to seek consistent flat minima that are shared across different\ndomains by progressively refining loss landscapes during training. It\nalternatively generates a feedback signal by measuring the inconsistency of\nloss landscapes in different domains and refines these loss landscapes for\ngreater consistency using this feedback signal. Benefiting from the consistency\nof the flat minima within these refined loss landscapes, our SFT helps achieve\nbetter out-of-domain generalization. Extensive experiments on DomainBed\ndemonstrate superior performances of SFT when compared to state-of-the-art\nsharpness-aware methods and other prevalent DG baselines. On average across\nfive DG benchmarks, SFT surpasses the sharpness-aware minimization by 2.6% with\nResNet-50 and 1.5% with ViT-B/16, respectively. The code will be available\nsoon.",

    "abstract": "The clustering of bounded data presents unique challenges in statistical\nanalysis due to the constraints imposed on the data values. This paper\nintroduces a novel method for model-based clustering specifically designed for\nbounded data. Building on the transformation-based approach to Gaussian mixture\ndensity estimation introduced by Scrucca (2019), we extend this framework to\ndevelop a probabilistic clustering algorithm for data with bounded support that\nallows for accurate clustering while respecting the natural bounds of the\nvariables. In our proposal, a flexible range-power transformation is employed\nto map the data from its bounded domain to the unrestricted real space, hence\nenabling the estimation of Gaussian mixture models in the transformed space.\nDespite the close connection to density estimation, the behavior of this\napproach has not been previously investigated in the literature. Furthermore,\nwe introduce a novel measure of clustering uncertainty, the Normalized\nClassification Entropy (NCE), which provides a general and interpretable\nmeasure of classification uncertainty. The performance of the proposed method\nis evaluated through real-world data applications involving both fully and\npartially bounded data, in both univariate and multivariate settings, showing\nimproved cluster recovery and interpretability. Overall, the empirical results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our approach over traditional\nand advanced model-based clustering techniques that rely on distributions with\nbounded support.",

The linear transport equation $\\partial_tf+v\\cdot\n\\nabla f =0$ is the simplest governing equation for such a level set function.\nWhile the signed distance of the interface is a geometrically convenient\nfunction, e.g., the norm of the gradient is everywhere one, its time evolution\nis not governed by the linear transport equation. In computational fluid\ndynamics, several modifications of the simplest case have been proposed in\norder to compute the signed distance function or to stabilize the norm of the\ngradient of a level set function on the interface. The velocity extension\nmethod is a prominent method used for efficient numerical approximation of the\nlocal signed distance function of the interface. Our current paper presents a\nrigorous mathematical formulation of the velocity extension method and proves\nthat the method provides the local signed distance function of the moving\ninterface. A key is to derive a first-order fully nonlinear PDE that is\nequivalent to the linear transport equation with extended velocity. Then,\nwellposedness of the PDE is established in the class of $C^2$-smooth solutions,\nglobal in time and local in space, with the local signed distance property, as\nwell as in the class of $C^0$-viscosity solutions, global in time and space.\nFurthermore, partial regularity of the viscosity solution is proven, thus\nconfirming that, if initial data is smooth near the initial interface, the\nviscosity solution is smooth in a time-global tubular neighborhood of the\ninterface, coinciding with the local-in-space $C^2$-smooth solution.",

One of the most prominent features of the CPE is the coupled\nmultiple negative carbonate-organic carbon isotope excursions. However, at\nErguan and Xiashulao from eastern Tethys, a decoupling between\ncarbonate-organic carbon isotope during CPE was observed. At the end of early\nCarnian (Julian), the carbonate carbon isotope showed a negative excursion of\n2-3 per-mille, while the organic carbon isotope exhibited a positive excursion\nof about 3-4 per-mille. In addition, increased terrestrial inputs is indicated\nby the rising C/N (3 to 10) and decreasing Y/Ho (42 to 27) that coexist with\nthis decoupling. The coupling of carbon isotope negative excursions is from the\nshallow shelves and the deep slopes, whereas the decoupling occurs from the\ndeep shelf to the shallow slope. In the deep shelf to the shallow slope,\nsedimentary organic matter is mainly sourced from pelagic before the CPE as\nevidenced by low C/N (3) and high Y/Ho (36-42). During the CPE, the increased\nfresh water flux (Sr/Ba <1) enhanced terrestrial input in organic matter, which\nmay cause positive excursions in the carbon isotope record with elevated TOC\ncontent. As a result, the carbonate-organic carbon isotope decoupled. In\ncontrast, organic matter in sediments from the shallow shelf and deep slope are\nmainly from terrestrial and pelagic sources, respectively.

    "abstract": "Recent medical vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in 2D medical\nimage interpretation. However extending them to 3D medical imaging has been\nchallenging due to computational complexities and data scarcity. Although a few\nrecent VLMs specified for 3D medical imaging have emerged, all are limited to\nlearning volumetric representation of a 3D medical image as a set of\nsub-volumetric features. Such process introduces overly correlated\nrepresentations along the z-axis that neglect slice-specific clinical details,\nparticularly for 3D medical images where adjacent slices have low redundancy.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce MS-VLM that mimic radiologists'\nworkflow in 3D medical image interpretation. Specifically, radiologists analyze\n3D medical images by examining individual slices sequentially and synthesizing\ninformation across slices and views. Likewise, MS-VLM leverages self-supervised\n2D transformer encoders to learn a volumetric representation that capture\ninter-slice dependencies from a sequence of slice-specific features. Unbound by\nsub-volumetric patchification, MS-VLM is capable of obtaining useful volumetric\nrepresentations from 3D medical images with any slice length and from multiple\nimages acquired from different planes and phases. We evaluate MS-VLM on\npublicly available chest CT dataset CT-RATE and in-house rectal MRI dataset. In\nboth scenarios, MS-VLM surpasses existing methods in radiology report\ngeneration, producing more coherent and clinically relevant reports. These\nfindings highlight the potential of MS-VLM to advance 3D medical image\ninterpretation and improve the robustness of medical VLMs.",

Meanwhile, Transformer\nmodels, known for their powerful self-attention mechanisms and parallel\nprocessing capabilities, have demonstrated exceptional performance across\nvarious domains, including natural language processing and computer vision.\nDespite the significant advantages of both SNNs and Transformers, directly\ncombining the low-power benefits of SNNs with the high performance of\nTransformers remains challenging. Specifically, while the sparse computing mode\nof SNNs contributes to reduced energy consumption, traditional attention\nmechanisms depend on dense matrix computations and complex softmax operations.\nThis reliance poses significant challenges for effective execution in low-power\nscenarios. Given the tremendous success of Transformers in deep learning, it is\na necessary step to explore the integration of SNNs and Transformers to harness\nthe strengths of both. In this paper, we propose a novel model architecture,\nSpike Aggregation Transformer (SAFormer), that integrates the low-power\ncharacteristics of SNNs with the high-performance advantages of Transformer\nmodels. The core contribution of SAFormer lies in the design of the Spike\nAggregated Self-Attention (SASA) mechanism, which significantly simplifies the\ncomputation process by calculating attention weights using only the spike\nmatrices query and key, thereby effectively reducing energy consumption.\nAdditionally, we introduce a Depthwise Convolution Module (DWC) to enhance the\nfeature extraction capabilities, further improving overall accuracy.

To this end, we introduce DragScene, a framework that\nintegrates drag-style editing with diverse 3D representations. First, latent\noptimization is performed on a reference view to generate 2D edits based on\nuser instructions. Subsequently, coarse 3D clues are reconstructed from the\nreference view using a point-based representation to capture the geometric\ndetails of the edits. The latent representation of the edited view is then\nmapped to these 3D clues, guiding the latent optimization of other views. This\nprocess ensures that edits are propagated seamlessly across multiple views,\nmaintaining multi-view consistency. Finally, the target 3D scene is\nreconstructed from the edited multi-view images. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that DragScene facilitates precise and flexible drag-style editing\nof 3D scenes, supporting broad applicability across diverse 3D representations.",

When organizations work together to\nimprove LLMs, they face several main challenges. First, organizations hesitate\nto share their valuable data with others. Second, competition between\norganizations creates trust problems during collaboration. Third, new privacy\nlaws require organizations to be able to delete specific data when requested,\nwhich is especially difficult when multiple organizations are learning from\nshared data.

Recent methods\nlike 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have become the preferred method for this\ntask, providing high-quality novel views in real time. However, the training\ntime of a 3DGS model is slow, often taking 30 minutes for a scene with 200\nviews. In contrast, our goal is to reduce the optimization time by training for\nfewer steps while maintaining high rendering quality. Specifically, we combine\nthe guidance from both the position error and the appearance error to achieve a\nmore effective densification. To balance the rate between adding new Gaussians\nand fitting old Gaussians, we develop a convergence-aware budget control\nmechanism. Moreover, to make the densification process more reliable, we\nselectively add new Gaussians from mostly visited regions. With these designs,\nwe reduce the Gaussian optimization steps to one-third of the previous approach\nwhile achieving a comparable or even better novel view rendering quality. To\nfurther facilitate the rapid fitting of 4K resolution images, we introduce a\ndilation-based rendering technique. Our method, Turbo-GS, speeds up\noptimization for typical scenes and scales well to high-resolution (4K)\nscenarios on standard datasets.

    "abstract": "In recent years, knowledge graphs have been integrated into recommender\nsystems as item-side auxiliary information, enhancing recommendation accuracy.\nHowever, constructing and integrating structural user-side knowledge remains a\nsignificant challenge due to the improper granularity and inherent scarcity of\nuser-side features. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer\nthe potential to bridge this gap by leveraging their human behavior\nunderstanding and extensive real-world knowledge. Nevertheless, integrating\nLLM-generated information into recommender systems presents challenges,\nincluding the risk of noisy information and the need for additional knowledge\ntransfer. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based user-side knowledge inference\nmethod alongside a carefully designed recommendation framework to address these\nchallenges. Our approach employs LLMs to infer user interests based on\nhistorical behaviors, integrating this user-side information with item-side and\ncollaborative data to construct a hybrid structure: the Collaborative Interest\nKnowledge Graph (CIKG). Furthermore, we propose a CIKG-based recommendation\nframework that includes a user interest reconstruction module and a\ncross-domain contrastive learning module to mitigate potential noise and\nfacilitate knowledge transfer. We conduct extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competitive baselines,\nparticularly for users with sparse interactions.",

However, these\nassumptions are often violated in practical scenarios, making it difficult to\ndistinguish known intent classes from unknowns using a single spherical\nboundary. To tackle these issues, we propose a Multi-granularity Open intent\nclassification method via adaptive Granular-Ball decision boundary (MOGB).

To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal\nFuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically,\nST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view\ncorresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views\nfor the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated\nmodule with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task,\nreflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic\ninformation to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle\nthe complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns\nemotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks\nto achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition.

However, fabricating and maintaining such superlubric surfaces still\npresent challenges, often disabled by surface structural defects or\nsusceptibility to humid atmospheres, which renders superlubricity fragile.\nHere, we propose a novel strategy of photoelectron superlubricity (PESL), where\nrobust superlubricity can be achieved in humid atmospheres by in-situ\nlaser-irradiating the contact interface of an amorphous carbon film sliding\nagainst sapphire ball. We demonstrate that PESL not only exhibits a high\nresistance to environmental disturbances but also features rapid response. The\nformation of PESL originates from the laser-irradiating induced formation of\nnanographene-layered interface and enrichment of photoelectrons at the\ninterface, resulting in a repulsive electric field between the nanographene\nlayers. The discovery of PESL opens a new avenue for achieving superlubricity,\nand also provides novel insights for smart friction, mechanical motion control\nand light manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Log-based anomaly detection (LogAD) is the main component of Artificial\nIntelligence for IT Operations (AIOps), which can detect anomalous that occur\nduring the system on-the-fly. Existing methods commonly extract log sequence\nfeatures using classical machine learning techniques to identify whether a new\nsequence is an anomaly or not. However, these classical approaches often\nrequire trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. The advent of quantum\nmachine learning (QML) offers a promising alternative. By transforming parts of\nclassical machine learning computations into parameterized quantum circuits\n(PQCs), QML can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while\nmaintaining accuracy comparable to classical counterparts. In this work, we\nintroduce a unified framework, \\ourframework{}, for evaluating QML models in\nthe context of LogAD. This framework incorporates diverse log data, integrated\nQML models, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. State-of-the-art methods such\nas DeepLog, LogAnomaly, and LogRobust, along with their quantum-transformed\ncounterparts, are included in our framework.Beyond standard metrics like F1\nscore, precision, and recall, our evaluation extends to factors critical to QML\nperformance, such as specificity, the number of circuits, circuit design, and\nquantum state encoding. Using \\ourframework{}, we conduct extensive experiments\nto assess the performance of these models and their quantum counterparts,\nuncovering valuable insights and paving the way for future research in QML\nmodel selection and design for LogAD.",

In our approach,\nartificial intelligence (AI)-driven detection modules are strategically\ndeployed at blockchain nodes to identify real-time attacks, ensuring high\naccuracy and minimal delay. To achieve this efficiency, the model training is\nconducted by a cloud service provider (CSP). Accordingly, blockchain nodes send\ntheir data to the CSP for training, but to safeguard privacy, the data is\nencrypted using homomorphic encryption (HE) before transmission. This\nencryption method allows the CSP to perform computations directly on encrypted\ndata without the need for decryption, preserving data privacy throughout the\nlearning process. To handle the substantial volume of encrypted data, we\nintroduce an innovative packing algorithm in a Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data\n(SIMD) manner, enabling efficient training on HE-encrypted data. Building on\nthis, we develop a novel deep neural network training algorithm optimized for\nencrypted data. We further propose a privacy-preserving distributed learning\napproach based on the FedAvg algorithm, which parallelizes the training across\nmultiple workers, significantly improving computation time. Upon completion,\nthe CSP distributes the trained model to the blockchain nodes, enabling them to\nperform real-time, privacy-preserved detection. Our simulation results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method can not only mitigate the training time\nbut also achieve detection accuracy that is approximately identical to the\napproach without encryption, with a gap of around 0.01%.

We establish a partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) system for deriving a closed-loop Nash equilibrium\ncontrol, which does not include the equilibrium value function and is different\nfrom the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations as in Bj\\\"ork et al.\n(Finance Stoch. 21: 331-360, 2017). We show that our PDE system is equivalent\nto the extended HJB equations that seems difficult to be solved for our\nhigher-order moment problems. In deriving an open-loop Nash equilibrium\ncontrol, due to the non-separable higher-order moments in the objective\nfunction, we make some moment estimates in addition to the standard\nperturbation argument for developing a maximum principle. Then, the problem is\nreduced to solving a flow of forward-backward stochastic differential\nequations. In particular, we investigate linear controlled dynamics and some\nobjective functions affine in the mean. The closed-loop and the open-loop Nash\nequilibrium controls are identical, which are independent of the state value,\nrandom path and the preference on the odd-order central moments.

One strand of methods\ntypically addresses this problem by assuming that the transition matrix is\ninstance-independent; that is, the probability of mislabeling a particular\ninstance is not influenced by its characteristics or attributes. This\nassumption is clearly invalid in complex real-world scenarios. To better\nunderstand the transition relationship and relax this assumption, we propose to\nstudy the data generation process of noisy labels from a causal perspective. We\ndiscover that an unobservable latent variable can affect either the instance\nitself, the label annotation procedure, or both, which complicates the\nidentification of the transition matrix. To address various scenarios, we have\nunified these observations within a new causal graph. In this graph, the input\ninstance is divided into a noise-resistant component and a noise-sensitive\ncomponent based on whether they are affected by the latent variable. These two\ncomponents contribute to identifying the ``causal transition matrix'', which\napproximates the true transition matrix with theoretical guarantee.

    "abstract": "Consider a sequence of continuous-time Markov chains $(X^{(n)}_t:t\\ge 0)$\nevolving on a fixed finite state space $V$. Let $I_n$ be the measure-current\nlarge deviations rate functional for $X^{(n)}_t$, as $t\\to\\infty$. Under a\nhypothesis on the jump rates, we prove that $I_n$ can be written as $I_n =\n\\mathbf I^{(0)} \\,+\\, \\sum_{1\\le p\\le \\mathfrak q} (1/\\theta^{(p)}_n) \\,\n\\mathbf I^{(p)}$ for some rate functionals $\\mathbf I^{(p)}$. The weights\n$\\theta^{(p)}_n$ correspond to the time-scales at which the sequence of Markov\nchains $X^{(n)}_t$ evolves among the metastable wells, and the rate functionals\n$\\mathbf I^{(p)}$ characterise the asymptotic Markovian dynamics among these\nwells. This expansion provides therefore an alternative description of the\nmetastable behavior of a sequence of Markovian dynamics. Together with the\nresults in \\cite{bgl-24,l-gamma}, this work finishes the project of\ncharacterising the hierarchical metastable behavior of finite-state Markov\nchains by means of the $\\Gamma$-expansion of large deviations rate functionals.\nIn addition, we present optimal conditions under which the measure\n(Donsker-Varadhan) or the measure-current large deviations rate functional\ndetermines the original dynamics, and calculate the first and second\nderivatives of the measure large deviations rate functional, thereby\ngeneralising the results for i.i.d. random variables.",

We\npropose a way to reduce the number of the Mellin-Barnes integration contours\nfrom five to two by using the Mellin-Barnes integral representation only in\ncombination with basic methods of mathematical analysis such as analytical\nregularization. We do not use any Barnes lemma to prove the reduction but we\nuse the integral Cauchy formula instead. We recover first the well-known\ntwo-fold Mellin-Barnes representation for the one-loop triangle massless\ndiagram and then show how the five-fold Mellin-Barnes integral representation\nof one-loop box diagram with all the indices 1 in four spacetime dimensions may\nbe reduced to the two-fold Mellin-Barnes representation for one-loop triangle\ndiagram. Singular integrals over Feynman parameters appear in the integrand of\nthe five-fold Mellin-Barnes integral representation at the intermediate step.\nSuch integrals should be treated as distributions with respect to certain\nlinear combinations of the initial Mellin-Barnes integration variables in the\nMellin-Barnes integrands. These distributions may be integrated out with a\nfinite number of residues in the limit of removing the analytical\nregularization.

    "abstract": "Existing cross-modal retrieval methods typically rely on large-scale\nvision-language pair data. This makes it challenging to efficiently develop a\ncross-modal retrieval model for under-resourced languages of interest.\nTherefore, Cross-lingual Cross-modal Retrieval (CCR), which aims to align\nvision and the low-resource language (the target language) without using any\nhuman-labeled target-language data, has gained increasing attention. As a\ngeneral parameter-efficient way, a common solution is to utilize adapter\nmodules to transfer the vision-language alignment ability of Vision-Language\nPretraining (VLP) models from a source language to a target language. However,\nthese adapters are usually static once learned, making it difficult to adapt to\ntarget-language captions with varied expressions. To alleviate it, we propose\nDynamic Adapter with Semantics Disentangling (DASD), whose parameters are\ndynamically generated conditioned on the characteristics of the input captions.\nConsidering that the semantics and expression styles of the input caption\nlargely influence how to encode it, we propose a semantic disentangling module\nto extract the semantic-related and semantic-agnostic features from the input,\nensuring that generated adapters are well-suited to the characteristics of\ninput caption.

Traditional\nmethods, utilizing dual-branch based vanilla invertible blocks, process\nhigh-frequency and low-frequency information separately, often relying on\nspecific distributions to model high-frequency components.

    "abstract": "One of the main obstacles in exoplanet detection when using the radial\nvelocity (RV) technique is the presence of stellar activity signal induced by\nmagnetic regions. In this context, a realistic simulated dataset that can\nprovide photometry and spectroscopic outputs is needed for method development.\nThe goal of this paper is to describe two realistic simulations of solar\nactivity obtained from SOAP-GPU and to compare them with real data obtained\nfrom the HARPS-N solar telescope. We describe two different methods of modeling\nsolar activity using SOAP-GPU. The first models the evolution of active regions\nbased on the spot number as a function of time. The second method relies on the\nextraction of active regions from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data.\nThe simulated spectral time series generated with the first method shows a\nlong-term RV behavior similar to that seen in the HARPS-N solar observations.\nThe effect of stellar activity induced by stellar rotation is also well modeled\nwith prominent periodicities at the stellar rotation period and its first\nharmonic. The comparison between the simulated spectral time series generated\nusing SDO images and the HARPS-N solar spectra shows that SOAP-GPU can\nprecisely model the RV time series of the Sun to a precision better than 0.9\nm/s. By studying the width and depth variations of each spectral line in the\nHARPS-N solar and SOAP-GPU data, we find a strong correlation between the\nobservation and the simulation for strong spectral lines, therefore supporting\nthe modeling of the stellar activity effect at the spectral level. These\nsimulated solar spectral time series serve as a useful test bed for evaluating\nspectral-level stellar activity mitigation techniques.",

    "abstract": "The tearing mode, a large-scale MHD instability in tokamak, typically\ndisrupts the equilibrium magnetic surfaces, leads to the formation of magnetic\nislands, and reduces core electron temperature and density, thus resulting in\nsignificant energy losses and may even cause discharge termination. This\nprocess is unacceptable for ITER. Therefore, the accurate identification of a\nmagnetic island in real time is crucial for the effective control of the\ntearing mode in ITER in the future. In this study, based on the characteristics\ninduced by tearing modes, an attention-aware convolutional neural network\n(AM-CNN) is proposed to identify the presence of magnetic islands in tearing\nmode discharge utilizing the data from ECE diagnostics in the EAST tokamak. A\ntotal of 11 ECE channels covering the range of core is used in the tearing mode\ndataset, which includes 2.5*10^9 data collected from 68 shots from 2016 to 2021\nyears. We split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (66.5%,\n5.7%, and 27.8%), respectively. An attention mechanism is designed to couple\nwith the convolutional neural networks to improve the capability of feature\nextraction of signals. During the model training process, we utilized adaptive\nlearning rate adjustment and early stopping mechanisms to optimize performance\nof AM-CNN. The model results show that a classification accuracy of 91.96% is\nachieved in tearing mode identification. Compared to CNN without AM, the\nattention-aware convolutional neural networks demonstrate great performance\nacross accuracy, recall metrics, and F1 score. By leveraging the deep learning\nmodel, which incorporates a physical understanding of the tearing process to\nidentify tearing mode behaviors, the combination of physical mechanisms and\ndeep learning is emphasized, significantly laying an important foundation for\nthe future intelligent control of tearing mode dynamics.",

Although current models show promising results on images with\na similar degree of distortion as the training data, they will produce\nsub-optimal results when the degree of distortion changes and without\nretraining. The lack of generalization ability for dealing with varying degrees\nof distortion limits their practical application.

Each query can\nbe learned to obtain position-dependent rectification control conditions,\nproviding control over the rectification process. Then, we propose two kinds of\ncontrollable modulating blocks to enable the control conditions to guide the\nmodulation of the distortion features better. These core components cooperate\nwith each other to effectively boost the generalization ability of the model at\nvarying degrees of distortion. Extensive experiments on fisheye image datasets\nwith different distortion degrees demonstrate our approach achieves\nhigh-quality and controllable distortion rectification.",

Although\nreinforcement learning methods can largely ease human effort, it's challenging\nto design reward functions for real-world tasks, especially for\nhigh-dimensional robotic control, due to complex relationships among joints and\ntasks. Recent advancements large language models (LLMs) enable automatic reward\nfunction design. However, approaches evaluate reward functions by re-training\npolicies from scratch placing an undue burden on the reward function, expecting\nit to be effective throughout the whole policy improvement process. We argue\nfor a more practical strategy in robotic autonomy, focusing on refining\nexisting policies with policy-dependent reward functions rather than a\nuniversal one. To this end, we propose a novel reward-policy co-evolution\nframework where the reward function and the learned policy benefit from each\nother's progressive on-the-fly improvements, resulting in more efficient and\nhigher-performing skill acquisition. Specifically, the reward evolution process\ntranslates the robot's previous best reward function, descriptions of tasks and\nenvironment into text inputs. These inputs are used to query LLMs to generate a\ndynamic amount of reward function candidates, ensuring continuous improvement\nat each round of evolution. For policy evolution, our method generates new\npolicy populations by hybridizing historically optimal and random policies.\nThrough an improved Bayesian optimization, our approach efficiently and\nrobustly identifies the most capable and plastic reward-policy combination,\nwhich then proceeds to the next round of co-evolution.

    "abstract": "This study explores the role of pretesting when integrated with\nconversational AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, in enhancing learning outcomes.\nDrawing on existing research, which demonstrates the benefits of pretesting in\nmemory activation and retention, this experiment extends these insights into\nthe context of digital learning environments. A randomized true experimental\nstudy was utilized. Participants were divided into two groups: one engaged in\npretesting before using ChatGPT for a problem-solving task involving chi-square\nanalysis, while the control group accessed ChatGPT immediately. The results\nindicate that the pretest group significantly outperformed the no-pretest group\nin a subsequent test, which suggests that pretesting enhances the retention of\ncomplex material. This study contributes to the field by demonstrating that\npretesting can augment the learning process in technology-assisted environments\nby preparing the memory and promoting active engagement with the material. The\nfindings also suggest that learning strategies like pretesting retain their\nrelevance in the context of rapidly evolving AI technologies. Further research\nand practical implications are presented.",

    "abstract": "Scene generation is crucial to many computer graphics applications. Recent\nadvances in generative AI have streamlined sketch-to-image workflows, easing\nthe workload for artists and designers in creating scene concept art. However,\nthese methods often struggle for complex scenes with multiple detailed objects,\nsometimes missing small or uncommon instances. In this paper, we propose a\nTraining-free Triplet Tuning for Sketch-to-Scene (T3-S2S) generation after\nreviewing the entire cross-attention mechanism. This scheme revitalizes the\nexisting ControlNet model, enabling effective handling of multi-instance\ngenerations, involving prompt balance, characteristics prominence, and dense\ntuning. Specifically, this approach enhances keyword representation via the\nprompt balance module, reducing the risk of missing critical instances. It also\nincludes a characteristics prominence module that highlights TopK indices in\neach channel, ensuring essential features are better represented based on token\nsketches. Additionally, it employs dense tuning to refine contour details in\nthe attention map, compensating for instance-related regions. Experiments\nvalidate that our triplet tuning approach substantially improves the\nperformance of existing sketch-to-image models. It consistently generates\ndetailed, multi-instance 2D images, closely adhering to the input prompts and\nenhancing visual quality in complex multi-instance scenes.

Using simulations, we can trace the origins of different\nstellar populations in these halos, contributing to our understanding of galaxy\nevolution. We aim to investigate the assembly of stellar halos and their\nchemical abundances in 28 galaxies from CIELO project with logMgal[9 and\n11]Msun. Stellar halos were identified using the AM E method, focusing on the\nouter regions between the 1.5 optical radius and the virial radius. We divided\nthe stellar populations based on their formation channel: exsitu, endodebris,\nand insitu, and analyzed their chemical abundances, ages, and spatial\ndistributions. Additionally, we explored correlations between halo mass,\nmetallicity, and alpha element enrichment. CIELO simulations reveal that\nstellar halos are predominantly composed of accreted material (exsitu and\nendodebris stars), in agreement with previous works. The mass fraction of these\npopulations is independent of stellar halo mass, though their metallicities\nscale linearly with it. Exsitu stars tend to dominate the outskirts and be more\nalpha rich and older, while endodebris stars are more prevalent at lower radii\nand tend to be less alpha rich and slightly younger. Massive stellar halos\nrequire a median of five additional satellites to build 90 percent of their\nmass, compared to lower mass halos, which typically need fewer (median of 2.5)\nand lower-mass satellites and are assembled earlier. The diversity of accreted\nsatellite histories results in well defined stellar halo mass metallicity and\n[alpha/Fe] [Fe/H] relations, offering a detailed view of the chemical evolution\nand assembly history of stellar halos. We find that the [alpha/Fe] [Fe/H] is\nmore sensitive to the characteristics and star formation history of the\ncontributing satellites than the stellar halo mass metallicity relationship",

In these algorithms, tunable parameters,\nsuch as step sizes or conjugate parameters, play a crucial role in determining\nkey performance metrics, like runtime and solution quality. In this work, we\nintroduce a framework that models algorithm selection as a statistical learning\nproblem, and thus learning complexity can be estimated by the pseudo-dimension\nof the algorithm group. We first propose a new cost measure for unconstrained\noptimization algorithms, inspired by the concept of primal-dual integral in\nmixed-integer linear programming. Based on the new cost measure, we derive an\nimproved upper bound for the pseudo-dimension of gradient descent algorithm\ngroup by discretizing the set of step size configurations.

While prior works can watermark NeRFs in a post-generation way, they\nsuffer from two vulnerabilities.

Second, generating a non-watermarked NeRF\nas an intermediate creates a potential vulnerability for theft. To address both\nissues, we propose Dreamark to embed a secret message by backdooring the NeRF\nduring NeRF generation.

We\nintroduce \\approach, a technique to adapt large models for downstream code\ntasks using Code Property Graphs (CPGs).

The Transducer comprises two key components:\nGraph Vectorization Engine (GVE) and Attention-Based Fusion Layer (ABFL).

By optimizing these transducers for\ndifferent downstream tasks, our approach enhances the models without the need\nto fine-tune them for specific tasks. We have evaluated \\approach on three\ndownstream tasks: code summarization, assert generation, and code translation.\nOur results demonstrate competitive performance compared to full parameter\nfine-tuning while reducing up to 99\\% trainable parameters to save memory.\n\\approach also remains competitive against other fine-tuning approaches (e.g.,\nLoRA, Prompt-Tuning, Prefix-Tuning) while using only 1.5\\%-80\\% of their\ntrainable parameters.

PLPP\ndesigns a two-step operation to compute the perplexity for prompts: (a)\ncalculating cosine similarity between the weight of the embedding layer and\nprompts to get labels, (b) introducing a language model (LM) head that requires\nno training behind text encoder to output word probability distribution.\nMeanwhile, we unveil that the essence of PLPP is inherently a form of\nself-distillation. To further prevent overfitting as well as to reduce the\nadditional computation introduced by PLPP, we turn the hard label to soft label\nand choose top-$k$ values for calculating the perplexity loss. For accelerating\nmodel convergence, we introduce mutual self-distillation learning, that is\nperplexity and inverted perplexity loss. The experiments conducted on four\nclassification tasks indicate that PLPP exhibits superior performance compared\nto existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Data-free model stealing involves replicating the functionality of a target\nmodel into a substitute model without accessing the target model's structure,\nparameters, or training data. The adversary can only access the target model's\npredictions for generated samples. Once the substitute model closely\napproximates the behavior of the target model, attackers can exploit its\nwhite-box characteristics for subsequent malicious activities, such as\nadversarial attacks. Existing methods within cooperative game frameworks often\nproduce samples with high confidence for the prediction of the substitute\nmodel, which makes it difficult for the substitute model to replicate the\nbehavior of the target model. This paper presents a new data-free model\nstealing approach called Query Efficient Data Generation (\\textbf{QEDG}). We\nintroduce two distinct loss functions to ensure the generation of sufficient\nsamples that closely and uniformly align with the target model's decision\nboundary across multiple classes. Building on the limitation of current\nmethods, which typically yield only one piece of supervised information per\nquery, we propose the query-free sample augmentation that enables the\nacquisition of additional supervised information without increasing the number\nof queries. Motivated by theoretical analysis, we adopt the consistency rate\nmetric, which more accurately evaluates the similarity between the substitute\nand target models.

However, due to the noise and\nsparsity of LiDAR-captured point clouds, robust human pose estimation remains\nchallenging. Most of the existing methods use temporal information, multi-modal\nfusion, or SMPL optimization to correct biased results. In this work, we try to\nobtain sufficient information for 3D HPE only by modeling the intrinsic\nproperties of low-quality point clouds. Hence, a simple yet powerful method is\nproposed, which provides insights both on modeling and augmentation of point\nclouds. Specifically, we first propose a concise and effective density-aware\npose transformer (DAPT) to get stable keypoint representations. By using a set\nof joint anchors and a carefully designed exchange module, valid information is\nextracted from point clouds with different densities. Then 1D heatmaps are\nutilized to represent the precise locations of the keypoints. Secondly, a\ncomprehensive LiDAR human synthesis and augmentation method is proposed to\npre-train the model, enabling it to acquire a better human body prior. We\nincrease the diversity of point clouds by randomly sampling human positions and\norientations and by simulating occlusions through the addition of laser-level\nmasks. Extensive experiments have been conducted on multiple datasets,\nincluding IMU-annotated LidarHuman26M, SLOPER4D, and manually annotated Waymo\nOpen Dataset v2.0 (Waymo), HumanM3. Our method demonstrates SOTA performance in\nall scenarios. In particular, compared with LPFormer on Waymo, we reduce the\naverage MPJPE by $10.0mm$.

Absolute Pose\nRegression (APR) trains a scene-dependent model to efficiently map an input\nimage to the camera pose in a pre-defined scene. However, many applications\nhave continually changing environments, where inference data at novel poses or\nscene conditions (weather, geometry) appear after deployment. Training APR on a\nfixed dataset leads to overfitting, making it fail catastrophically on\nchallenging novel data. This work proposes Continual Domain Expansion (ConDo),\nwhich continually collects unlabeled inference data to update the deployed APR.\nInstead of applying standard unsupervised domain adaptation methods which are\nineffective for APR, ConDo effectively learns from unlabeled data by distilling\nknowledge from scene-agnostic localization methods. By sampling data uniformly\nfrom historical and newly collected data, ConDo can effectively expand the\ngeneralization domain of APR. Large-scale benchmarks with various scene types\nare constructed to evaluate models under practical (long-term) data changes.\nConDo consistently and significantly outperforms baselines across\narchitectures, scene types, and data changes. On challenging scenes (Fig.1), it\nreduces the localization error by >7x (14.8m vs 1.7m). Analysis shows the\nrobustness of ConDo against compute budgets, replay buffer sizes and teacher\nprediction noise.

We found that the dust-induced ``Streaming\nTorque (ST)'' may slow down or even reverse the planet migration in\n\\cite{Hou2024}. But in realistic protoplanetary disks, dust diffusion induced\nby gas turbulence may have important influences on ST. We perform linear\nanalysis to investigate the effects of dust diffusion on ST. The dependence of\nST on the dust diffusion may provide better constraints on the turbulence\nstrength and the stopping time $\\tau$. We derive the dispersion relation for\nall the wave modes in the two-fluid system. The dust diffusion will smooth the\nshort-wavelength structure of the the quasi-drift mode and split it into two\npredominant D-drift modes with opposite directions. The outgoing D-drift mode\nwill contribute to a negative torque on planets, particularly when $\\tau \\sim\n0.1$, which slightly shifts the zero-torque turning point. We explore how ST\ndepends on the regimes of aerodynamic drag, dust mass fraction and disk scale\nheight. We compare the radial wavenumbers of D-drift modes under different\nformulations of dust diffusion and find qualitative agreement. In all cases,\n$\\tau$ at the zero-torque turning point, which determines the direction of\nplanetary migration, consistently remains on the order of $\\sim 0.1$,\ncorresponding to large pebble-sized dust grains. This suggests that rapid dust\ncoagulation can inhibit the inward migration of planets, implying that weak gas\nturbulence may enhance the survival of protoplanets.",

However,\nin the near-field channel model, the coupling of AoA and CoA information poses\na challenge to the estimation of the near-field channel. This paper proposes a\nJoint Autocorrelation and Cross-correlation (JAC) scheme to decouple AoA and\nCoA estimation. Based on the JAC scheme, we propose two specific near-field\nestimation algorithms, namely Inverse Sinc Function (JAC-ISF) and Gradient\nDescent (JAC-GD) algorithms. Finally, we analyzed the time complexity of the\nJAC scheme and the cramer-rao lower bound (CRLB) for near-field position\nestimation. The simulation experiment results show that the algorithm designed\nbased on JAC scheme can solve the problem of coupled CoA and AoA information in\nnear-field estimation, thereby improving the algorithm performance. The JAC-GD\nalgorithm shows significant performance in channel estimation and position\nestimation at different SNRs, snapshot points, and communication distances\ncompared to other algorithms.

    "abstract": "Federated graph learning (FGL) has gained significant attention for enabling\nheterogeneous clients to process their private graph data locally while\ninteracting with a centralized server, thus maintaining privacy. However, graph\ndata on clients are typically non-IID, posing a challenge for a single model to\nperform well across all clients. Another major bottleneck of FGL is the high\ncost of communication. To address these challenges, we propose a\ncommunication-efficient personalized federated graph learning algorithm, CEFGL.\nOur method decomposes the model parameters into low-rank generic and sparse\nprivate models. We employ a dual-channel encoder to learn sparse local\nknowledge in a personalized manner and low-rank global knowledge in a shared\nmanner. Additionally, we perform multiple local stochastic gradient descent\niterations between communication phases and integrate efficient compression\ntechniques into the algorithm. The advantage of CEFGL lies in its ability to\ncapture common and individual knowledge more precisely. By utilizing low-rank\nand sparse parameters along with compression techniques, CEFGL significantly\nreduces communication complexity.

The plane wave solution takes the form of an\nevanescent field that decays along the surface normal with a phase velocity\nequal to the speed of sound. If a metallic film is placed on the piezoelectric\nsubstrate, a time- and space-varying electric field permeates into the film\nwith a decay length along the film normal defined by the skin depth and the SAW\nwavelength. For films with high conductivity, the phase of the electric field\nvaries along the film normal.

In this study, we propose a multi-layer temporal contact network\nto model transmission dynamics and assess the impact of different TTI\nimplementations, using SARS-CoV-2 as a case study. The model was used to\nevaluate TTI effectiveness both in containing an outbreak and mitigating the\nimpact of an epidemic.

On the other hand, for higher value\nof the reproduction number, TTI is estimated to noticeably mitigate disease\nburden but at high social costs (e.g., over a month in isolation/quarantine per\nperson for reproduction numbers of 1.7 or higher). We estimated that strategies\nconsidering quarantine of contacts have a larger epidemic prevention potential\nthan strategies that either avoid tracing contacts or require contacts to be\ntested before isolation.

In the presented experiment, we demonstrated unidirectional Raman\nemission of Stokes photons from 87Rb atoms in a ring cavity. A bias magnetic\nfield B0 is applied along z-direction on the atoms to define the quantum axis,\nwhich breaks the time inverse symmetry. By transversely applying write laser\npulses to drive a \\pi-transition of the atoms, we generate spontaneous Raman\nemissions of Stokes photons from a chiral (\\sigma+) transition. The emissions\nare coupled into the clock-wise (z-direction) and counter-clock-wise\n(-z-direction) modes of a running-wave cavity, respectively. According to the\nmirror (parity) symmetry of the atom-light coupling, we demonstrated that spins\n(polarizations) of the Stokes fields are correlated with their propagation\ndirections along z and -z -axis. The Stokes emissions constrained to the\nspin-momentum correlation are found to be violation of Kirchhoff's law of\nthermal radiation. Based on the correlation, we demonstrated that the Stokes\nemissions propagate along the clock-wise or counter-clock-wise via polarization\ndissipation. The directional factor is up to 1500:1.",

    "abstract": "While logic puzzles have engaged individuals through problem-solving and\ncritical thinking, the creation of new puzzle rules has largely relied on\nad-hoc processes. Pencil puzzles, such as Slitherlink and Sudoku, represent a\nprominent subset of these games, celebrated for their intellectual challenges\nrooted in combinatorial logic and spatial reasoning. Despite extensive research\ninto solving techniques and automated problem generation, a unified framework\nfor systematic and scalable rule design has been lacking. Here, we introduce a\nmathematical framework for defining and systematizing pencil puzzle rules. This\nframework formalizes grid elements, their positional relationships, and\niterative composition operations, allowing for the incremental construction of\nstructures that form the basis of puzzle rules. Furthermore, we establish a\nformal method to describe constraints and domains for each structure, ensuring\nsolvability and coherence. Applying this framework, we successfully formalized\nthe rules of well-known Nikoli puzzles, including Slitherlink and Sudoku,\ndemonstrating the formal representation of a significant portion (approximately\none-fourth) of existing puzzles. These results validate the potential of the\nframework to systematize and innovate puzzle rule design, establishing a\npathway to automated rule generation. By providing a mathematical foundation\nfor puzzle rule creation, this framework opens avenues for computers,\npotentially enhanced by AI, to design novel puzzle rules tailored to player\npreferences, expanding the scope of puzzle diversity.

Conventional clinical and experimental\nstudies are time-intensive, burdening research progress considerably. This\npaper introduces a high-throughput digital twin framework for modeling neurite\ndeteriorations associated with NDDs, integrating synthetic data generation,\nexperimental images, and machine learning (ML) models. The synthetic data\ngenerator utilizes an isogeometric analysis (IGA)-based phase field model to\ncapture diverse neurite deterioration patterns such as neurite retraction,\natrophy, and fragmentation while mitigating the limitations of scarce\nexperimental data. The ML model utilizes MetaFormer-based gated spatiotemporal\nattention architecture with deep temporal layers and provides fast predictions.\nThe framework effectively captures long-range temporal dependencies and\nintricate morphological transformations with average errors of 1.9641% and\n6.0339% for synthetic and experimental neurite deterioration, respectively.\nSeamlessly integrating simulations, experiments, and ML, the digital twin\nframework can guide researchers to make informed experimental decisions by\npredicting potential experimental outcomes, significantly reducing costs and\nsaving valuable time.

We provide\nan explicit characterization for the averaged limit of the non-linear\nstochastic system, where both the choice of the frozen equation and the\ndefinition of the averaged coefficients are more or less unexpected since new\nintegral terms with respect to the measure variable appear. More importantly,\nin contrast with the classical theory of multi-scale systems which focuses on\nthe averaged limit of the slow process, we propose a new perspective that the\nasymptotic behavior of the entire system is actually governed by the limit of\nthe fast motion. By studying the long-time estimates of the solution of the\nKolmogorov equation in Wasserstein space, we identify the limiting distribution\nof the fast motion of the non-linear system, which, to the best of our\nknowledge, is new even for the classical multi-scale It\\^o SDEs. Furthermore,\nrates of convergence are also obtained, which are rather sharp and depend only\non the regularity of the coefficients with respect to the slow variable. The\ninnovation of our argument is to transform the non-linear system into a\nsequence of linear but non-autonomous systems, which is rather simple insofar\nas it avoids to involve the mean-field type PDEs associated with non-linear\nstochastic system, and at the same time, it turns out to be quite effective as\nit enables us to show that the strong convergence in the averaging principle of\nthe non-linear stochastic system follows directly from the weak convergence,\nwhich significantly simplified the proof.",

To tackle the issues, we propose Magnifier for mobile device\nnetwork access detection that, for the first time, passively infers access\npatterns from backbone traffic at the gateway level.

Our\nexperimental results, conducted in real-world scenarios, demonstrate that\nMagnifier exhibits exceptional universality and coverage in both initial and\nrepetitive network access detection in real-time.

This\nwork introduces a novel adaptive algorithm for automatic knots (AutoKnots)\nallocation in spline interpolation, designed to meet user-defined precision\nrequirements. Unlike traditional methods that rely on manually configured knot\ndistributions with numerous parameters, the proposed technique automatically\ndetermines the optimal number and placement of knots based on interpolation\nerror criteria. This simplifies configuration, often requiring only a single\nparameter. The algorithm progressively improves the interpolation by adaptively\nsampling the function-to-be-approximated, $f(x)$, in regions where the\ninterpolation error exceeds the desired threshold. All function evaluations\ncontribute directly to the final approximation, ensuring efficiency. While each\nresampling step involves recomputing the interpolation table, this process is\nhighly optimized and usually computationally negligible compared to the cost of\nevaluating $f(x)$. We show the algorithm's efficacy through a series of\nprecision tests on different functions. However, the study underscores the\nnecessity for caution when dealing with certain function types, notably those\nfeaturing plateaus. To address this challenge, a heuristic enhancement is\nincorporated, improving accuracy in flat regions. This algorithm has been\nextensively used and tested over the years. NumCosmo includes a comprehensive\nset of unit tests that rigorously evaluate the algorithm both directly and\nindirectly, underscoring its robustness and reliability.

    "abstract": "Inductive reasoning - the process of inferring general rules from a small\nnumber of observations - is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Recent\nworks suggest that large language models (LLMs) can engage in inductive\nreasoning by sampling multiple hypotheses about the rules and selecting the one\nthat best explains the observations. However, due to the IID sampling,\nsemantically redundant hypotheses are frequently generated, leading to\nsignificant wastage of compute. In this paper, we 1) demonstrate that\nincreasing the temperature to enhance the diversity is limited due to text\ndegeneration issue, and 2) propose a novel method to improve the diversity\nwhile maintaining text quality. We first analyze the effect of increasing the\ntemperature parameter, which is regarded as the LLM's diversity control, on IID\nhypotheses. Our analysis shows that as temperature rises, diversity and\naccuracy of hypotheses increase up to a certain point, but this trend saturates\ndue to text degeneration. To generate hypotheses that are more semantically\ndiverse and of higher quality, we propose a novel approach inspired by human\ninductive reasoning, which we call Mixture of Concepts (MoC). When applied to\nseveral inductive reasoning benchmarks, MoC demonstrated significant\nperformance improvements compared to standard IID sampling and other\napproaches.",

    "abstract": "Traffic prediction plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation\nsystems. Existing approaches primarily focus on improving overall accuracy,\noften neglecting a critical issue: whether predictive models lead to biased\ndecisions by transportation authorities. In practice, the uneven deployment of\ntraffic sensors across urban areas results in imbalanced data, causing\nprediction models to perform poorly in certain regions and leading to unfair\ndecision-making. This imbalance ultimately harms the equity and quality of life\nfor residents. Moreover, current fairness-aware machine learning models only\nensure fairness at specific time points, failing to maintain fairness over\nextended periods. As traffic conditions change, such static fairness approaches\nbecome ineffective. To address this gap, we propose FairTP, a framework for\nprolonged fair traffic prediction. We introduce two new fairness definitions\ntailored for dynamic traffic scenarios. Fairness in traffic prediction is not\nstatic; it varies over time and across regions. Each sensor or urban area can\nalternate between two states: \"sacrifice\" (low prediction accuracy) and\n\"benefit\" (high prediction accuracy). Prolonged fairness is achieved when the\noverall states of sensors remain similar over a given period. We define two\ntypes of fairness: region-based static fairness and sensor-based dynamic\nfairness. To implement this, FairTP incorporates a state identification module\nto classify sensors' states as either \"sacrifice\" or \"benefit,\" enabling\nprolonged fairness-aware predictions. Additionally, we introduce a state-guided\nbalanced sampling strategy to further enhance fairness, addressing performance\ndisparities among regions with uneven sensor distributions. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that FairTP significantly\nimproves prediction fairness while minimizing accuracy degradation.",

We analyze key\nelements of human-horse relationships: trust, communication, and mutual\nadaptability, to highlight essential principles for human-AI collaboration.\nTrust is critical in both partnerships, built through predictability and shared\nunderstanding, while communication and feedback loops foster mutual\nadaptability. We further discuss the importance of taming and habituation in\nshaping these interactions, likening it to how humans train AI to perform\nreliably and ethically in real-world settings. The article also addresses the\nasymmetry of responsibility, where humans ultimately bear the greater burden of\noversight and ethical judgment. Finally, we emphasize that long-term commitment\nand continuous learning are vital in both human-horse and human-AI\nrelationships, as ongoing interaction refines the partnership and increases\nmutual adaptability.

The\nduality condition plays a crucial role in this theoretical scheme, and thus\ngives the name to the whole approach: the theory of dual relativity (TDR). The\nenergy-momentum tensor density of a closed system is defined, and the\nconservation law for this tensor density is deduced. In the TDR it is assumed\nthat there exist two kinds of matter governed by the mutually dual physical\nmetrics, and it is shown that the interaction between them has\nantigravitational character. A cosmological limit of the field equations of the\nTDR is considered. In this limit, there are two types of solutions: with\npositive and with negative energy density. The first type admits the existence\nof a stable Universe as a whole. The second type gives the oscillations of the\ncosmological scale factor within the finite limits excluding the zero point,\nthat can be treated as a solution for a certain domain of the Universe. For\nthis type of solutions, the model formula for the dependence of the Hubble\nparameter $H$ on the redshift $z$ has been obtained. The values of the\nparameters of this formula are found from the fit to the available $H(z)$ data.\nIt is obtained that the TDR gives a better description of the $H(z)$ data as\ncompared to the flat $\\Lambda$CDM model.

This\npaper focuses on analyzing mathematics tutoring discourse using talk moves - a\nframework of dialogue acts grounded in Accountable Talk theory. However,\nscaling the collection, annotation, and analysis of extensive tutoring\ndialogues to develop machine learning models is a challenging and\nresource-intensive task. To address this, we present SAGA22, a compact dataset,\nand explore various modeling strategies, including dialogue context, speaker\ninformation, pretraining datasets, and further fine-tuning. By leveraging\nexisting datasets and models designed for classroom teaching, our results\ndemonstrate that supplementary pretraining on classroom data enhances model\nperformance in tutoring settings, particularly when incorporating longer\ncontext and speaker information. Additionally, we conduct extensive ablation\nstudies to underscore the challenges in talk move modeling.",

    "abstract": "Training robust deep learning models is crucial in Earth Observation, where\nglobally deployed models often face distribution shifts that degrade\nperformance, especially in low-data regions. Out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndetection addresses this by identifying inputs that deviate from\nin-distribution (ID) data. However, existing methods either assume access to\nOOD data or compromise primary task performance, limiting real-world use. We\nintroduce TARDIS, a post-hoc OOD detection method designed for scalable\ngeospatial deployment. Our core innovation lies in generating surrogate\ndistribution labels by leveraging ID data within the feature space. TARDIS\ntakes a pre-trained model, ID data, and data from an unknown distribution\n(WILD), separates WILD into surrogate ID and OOD labels based on internal\nactivations, and trains a binary classifier to detect distribution shifts. We\nvalidate on EuroSAT and xBD across 17 setups covering covariate and semantic\nshifts, showing near-upper-bound surrogate labeling performance in 13 cases and\nmatching the performance of top post-hoc activation- and scoring-based methods.\nFinally, deploying TARDIS on Fields of the World reveals actionable insights\ninto pre-trained model behavior at scale.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing a 3D hand mesh from a single RGB image is challenging due to\ncomplex articulations, self-occlusions, and depth ambiguities. Traditional\ndiscriminative methods, which learn a deterministic mapping from a 2D image to\na single 3D mesh, often struggle with the inherent ambiguities in 2D-to-3D\nmapping. To address this challenge, we propose MaskHand, a novel generative\nmasked model for hand mesh recovery that synthesizes plausible 3D hand meshes\nby learning and sampling from the probabilistic distribution of the ambiguous\n2D-to-3D mapping process. MaskHand consists of two key components: (1) a\nVQ-MANO, which encodes 3D hand articulations as discrete pose tokens in a\nlatent space, and (2) a Context-Guided Masked Transformer that randomly masks\nout pose tokens and learns their joint distribution, conditioned on corrupted\ntoken sequence, image context, and 2D pose cues. This learned distribution\nfacilitates confidence-guided sampling during inference, producing mesh\nreconstructions with low uncertainty and high precision. Extensive evaluations\non benchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate that MaskHand achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy, robustness, and realism in 3D hand mesh\nreconstruction.

The\nmethods of mu-analysis and synthesis has been extensively developed to provide\nrobustness guarantees for a plant subject to structured perturbations, with\ncomponents in the structured perturbation satisfying a bound on their largest\nsingular value. Recent results on phase-based stability measures have led to a\ncounterpart of the small gain theorem, known as the small phase theorem. To\ndate these phase-based methods have only been used to provide stability\nrobustness measures for unstructured perturbations. In this paper, we define a\nphase robustness metric for multivariable linear time-invariant systems in the\npresence of a structured perturbation. We demonstrate its relationship to a\ncertain class of multiplier functions for integral quadratic constraints, and\nshow that a upper bound can be calculated via a linear matrix inequality\nproblem.

Existing methods for this highly ill-posed task\noperate in tightly constrained settings and tend to struggle when applied to\nimages outside the training domain or when the available depth measurements are\nsparse, irregularly distributed, or of varying density. Inspired by recent\nadvances in monocular depth estimation, we reframe depth completion as an\nimage-conditional depth map generation guided by sparse measurements. Our\nmethod, Marigold-DC, builds on a pretrained latent diffusion model for\nmonocular depth estimation and injects the depth observations as test-time\nguidance via an optimization scheme that runs in tandem with the iterative\ninference of denoising diffusion. The method exhibits excellent zero-shot\ngeneralization across a diverse range of environments and handles even\nextremely sparse guidance effectively. Our results suggest that contemporary\nmonocular depth priors greatly robustify depth completion: it may be better to\nview the task as recovering dense depth from (dense) image pixels, guided by\nsparse depth; rather than as inpainting (sparse) depth, guided by an image.\nProject website: https://MarigoldDepthCompletion.github.io/",
