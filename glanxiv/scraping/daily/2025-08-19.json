    "abstract": "We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying\ntheir formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of\nredshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety\nof black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from\ninitial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals\npossible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion\nthrough cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime,\nwe use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin\nprescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the\nmass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify\nblack hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning\nclustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering\ncan nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass,\nintermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing\ndeep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation\nlearning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly\noverlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can\naccurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space\nrepresentation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset,\nsemi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the\nperformance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings\nmotivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the\nmass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and\nelectromagnetic observations with theoretical models.",

Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance\nclimate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble\n(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under\ndifferent FedRL configurations.

DDPG's ability to\ntransfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited\nfor geographically adaptive parameter learning.

    "abstract": "Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen\ninto two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods\nthat optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low\nsample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently\ntrained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or\nLLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this\npaper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and\nsearch-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function\nlearned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding\ndownstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement\nlearning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to\nlearn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely\neliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the\nresulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a\nheuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning\nchain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task\ngeneralization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including\nmathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our\nunified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,\nmatching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,\nour PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.\nThese results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best\nPRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex\nreasoning tasks in LLMs.",

The structure consists of a thick layer modeled by the Biot\nequations and a thin reticular plate with inertia and elastic energy,\ntransparent to fluid flow. The coupling is nonlinear in the sense that it takes\nplace on a moving interface that is not known a priori but is defined by the\nsolution itself, making the problem a moving-boundary problem. This nonlinear\nfree-boundary coupling, combined with the limited regularity of the Biot\ndisplacement, renders the classical weak formulation ill-defined at finite\nenergy. To address this, we introduce a minimally invasive regularization based\non a suitable extension and convolution of the Biot displacement, chosen so\nthat the regularized problem remains consistent with the original model. We\nthen construct approximate solutions to the regularized problem via a Lie\noperator-splitting scheme and derive uniform energy bounds. While these bounds\nensure weak and weak* convergence, passing to the limit in the nonlinear terms\nrequires refined compactness arguments, including variants of the Aubin-Lions\nlemma and tools adapted to moving non-Lipschitz interfaces.

In this work, we investigate how chaos shows up and evolves in\nsimplified cardiac models by calculating the Lyapunov exponent (LE) across\ndifferent parameter sets. We show that both temporal and spatial LE estimators\ncan be effectively applied to action potential duration (APD) data, even\nwithout full access to state variables. Specifically, the spatial-temporal\nalgorithm and Wolf's algorithm are used in quantifying the complexity, with\nexperiments demonstrating their distinct behaviors on various single-spiral\npatterns. We also identify the minimum data length and sampling density\nnecessary to achieve robust and accurate estimation. Overall, our results\nsuggest that these APD-based methods can be applied not only to simulation data\nbut also to future clinical or experimental data, particularly when\nobservations are limited, such as when only APD data are available for\nanalysis.",

    "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence for synthetic data generation holds\nsubstantial potential to address practical challenges in epidemiology. However,\nmany current methods suffer from limited quality, high computational demands,\nand complexity for non-experts. Furthermore, common evaluation strategies for\nsynthetic data often fail to directly reflect statistical utility. Against this\nbackground, a critical underexplored question is whether synthetic data can\nreliably reproduce key findings from epidemiological research. We propose the\nuse of adversarial random forests (ARF) as an efficient and convenient method\nfor synthesizing tabular epidemiological data. To evaluate its performance, we\nreplicated statistical analyses from six epidemiological publications and\ncompared original with synthetic results. These publications cover blood\npressure, anthropometry, myocardial infarction, accelerometry, loneliness, and\ndiabetes, based on data from the German National Cohort (NAKO\nGesundheitsstudie), the Bremen STEMI Registry U45 Study, and the Guelph Family\nHealth Study. Additionally, we assessed the impact of dimensionality and\nvariable complexity on synthesis quality by limiting datasets to variables\nrelevant for individual analyses, including necessary derivations. Across all\nreplicated original studies, results from multiple synthetic data replications\nconsistently aligned with original findings. Even for datasets with relatively\nlow sample size-to-dimensionality ratios, the replication outcomes closely\nmatched the original results across various descriptive and inferential\nanalyses. Reducing dimensionality and pre-deriving variables further enhanced\nboth quality and stability of the results.",

    "abstract": "Traditional protocol fuzzing techniques, such as those employed by AFL-based\nsystems, often lack effectiveness due to a limited semantic understanding of\ncomplex protocol grammars and rigid seed mutation strategies. Recent works,\nsuch as ChatAFL, have integrated Large Language Models (LLMs) to guide protocol\nfuzzing and address these limitations, pushing protocol fuzzers to wider\nexploration of the protocol state space. But ChatAFL still faces issues like\nunreliable output, LLM hallucinations, and assumptions of LLM knowledge about\nprotocol specifications. This paper introduces MultiFuzz, a novel dense\nretrieval-based multi-agent system designed to overcome these limitations by\nintegrating semantic-aware context retrieval, specialized agents, and\nstructured tool-assisted reasoning. MultiFuzz utilizes agentic chunks of\nprotocol documentation (RFC Documents) to build embeddings in a vector database\nfor a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling agents to\ngenerate more reliable and structured outputs, enhancing the fuzzer in mutating\nprotocol messages with enhanced state coverage and adherence to syntactic\nconstraints. The framework decomposes the fuzzing process into modular groups\nof agents that collaborate through chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically\nadapt fuzzing strategies based on the retrieved contextual knowledge.\nExperimental evaluations on the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) demonstrate\nthat MultiFuzz significantly improves branch coverage and explores deeper\nprotocol states and transitions over state-of-the-art (SOTA) fuzzers such as\nNSFuzz, AFLNet, and ChatAFL. By combining dense retrieval, agentic\ncoordination, and language model reasoning, MultiFuzz establishes a new\nparadigm in autonomous protocol fuzzing, offering a scalable and extensible\nfoundation for future research in intelligent agentic-based fuzzing systems.",

    "abstract": "Optimizing the trajectories of multiple quadrotors in a shared space is a\ncore challenge in various applications. Many existing trajectory optimization\nmethods enforce constraints only at the discretization points, leading to\nviolations between discretization points. They also often lack warm-starting\nstrategies for iterative solution methods such as sequential convex\nprogramming, causing slow convergence or sensitivity to the initial guess. We\npropose a framework for optimizing multiagent quadrotor trajectories that\ncombines a sequential convex programming approach with filtering-based\nwarm-starting. This framework not only ensures constraint satisfaction along\nthe entire continuous-time trajectory but also provides an online warm-starting\nstrategy that accelerates convergence and improves solution quality in\nnumerical experiments. The key idea is to first transform continuous-time\nconstraints into auxiliary nonlinear dynamics and boundary constraints, both of\nwhich are compatible with sequential convex programming. Furthermore, we\npropose a novel warm-starting strategy by approximating the trajectory\noptimization problem as a Bayesian state estimation problem. This approximation\nprovides an efficient estimate of the optimal trajectories. We demonstrate the\nproposed framework on multiagent quadrotor trajectory optimization with\ncollision avoidance constraints. Compared with benchmark methods, the proposed\nframework achieves not only continuous-time constraint satisfaction, but also\nreduces computation time by up to two orders of magnitude.",

It examines the roles and mechanisms of\nflexible technologies across three main categories: generators, energy storage\nsystems (ESS), and loads. Energy flexibility is defined as the ability to\ndynamically adjust supply and/or demand in response to grid conditions to\nmaintain balance and stability. This is of particular importance to facilitate\nthe integration of the growing variable renewable energy sources (RES) into\nmodern power grids. Additionally, traditional supply-side mechanisms to\nmaintain balance and stability are complemented by advancements in demand-side\nmanagement and demand response strategies, which enable loads to adjust\nconsumption patterns and schedules in response to grid requirements. ESS are\nalso explored to further enhance flexibility by absorbing excess generation\nand/or supplying large load increases that are not able to be met by the less\nflexible resources. This paper also explores specific flexibility technologies,\nexamining their characteristics, control strategies, advantages, and\nlimitations. Energy flexibility services are also categorized into\nintermittency mitigation, peak shaving, and energy reserve provisioning. Each\nservice is supported by case studies and examples demonstrating how different\nresources respond to varying conditions. Ultimately, the findings and reviews\nof the various flexible resources in this paper provide a roadmap for\noptimizing energy flexibility across diverse resource types, paving the way for\na more sustainable and resilient energy future.",

We introduce a\nhybrid tokenization framework that combines rule-based morphological analysis\nwith statistical subword segmentation. The method uses phonological\nnormalization, root-affix dictionaries, and a novel algorithm that balances\nmorpheme preservation with vocabulary efficiency. It assigns shared identifiers\nto phonologically variant affixes (e.g., -ler and -lar) and altered root forms\n(e.g., kitap vs. kitab{\\i}), reducing redundancy while maintaining semantic\nintegrity. Special tokens are added for whitespace and case, including an\nUPPERCASE marker to avoid vocabulary inflation from capitalization. BPE is\nintegrated for out-of-vocabulary coverage without harming morphological\ncoherence. On the TR-MMLU benchmark, the tokenizer achieves the highest Turkish\nToken Percentage (90.29\\%) and Pure Token Percentage (85.8\\%). Comparisons with\ntokenizers from LLaMA, Gemma, and GPT show more linguistically meaningful and\ncoherent tokens.

    "abstract": "An algebraic framework in which to study infinite sums is proposed,\ncomplementing and augmenting the usual topological tools. The framework\nsubsumes numerous examples in the literature. It is developed using many varied\nexamples, with a particular emphasis on infinitizing the usual group and ring\naxioms. Comparing these examples reveals that a few key algebraic properties\nplay a crucial role in the behaviors of different forms of infinite summation.\nSpecial attention is given to associativity, which is particularly difficult to\nproperly infinitize. In that context, there is an important technique called\nthe Eilenberg-Mazer swindle that is studied and greatly generalized.\n  Some special properties are singled out as potential axioms. Interactions\nbetween these potential axioms are analyzed, and numerous results explore how\nto impose new axioms while retaining old ones. In some cases the axioms\nclassify or categorize a given example. Surprisingly, such axiomatizations are\nvery concise, relying on only a handful of natural conditions.\n  These investigations reveal more precisely the part that topology plays in\nthe formation of infinite sums. Special attention is given to the methods of\npartial summation and unconditional summation. In the opposite direction, it is\nproved that from the infinite sums alone one can create a refined topology,\nlying between the original topology and its sequential coreflection. Another\nespecially interesting application of these ideas is the construction of new\nalgebraic quotient structures that retain the ability to handle infinite\nsummation.",

Previously, Aamand {\\em et al.} (SODA 2023) gave a\ndeterministic $2^{\\sqrt{\\log n} \\sqrt{\\log \\log n + \\log\n(1/\\varepsilon)}}$-competitive algorithm when $m = (1+\\varepsilon) n$ for any\n$\\varepsilon \\ge \\Omega(\\log n/n)$.

This left an\nexponential gap between the upper and lower bounds for the problem.\n  In this paper, we bridge this exponential gap and almost completely resolve\nthe online sorting problem.

Methods have been proposed to improve\ngeneralization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning\nto fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and\ncomputation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of\nparameters and using second-order gradient updates.

We\nreframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a\nset of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity\nof task-specific parameters to the global ones.

To extend to generalized language feature\nfields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module\nwith two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.\nThis design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also\nsupports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory\nconsumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable\nopen-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.",

(IEEE Trans. Inf.

In this article, we provide a deeper insight on these properties,\ntheir mutual relationship, and specify some explicit classes of permutations\nhaving these properties. Such permutations are then employed to generate a\nlarge variety of bent functions outside the completed Maiorana-McFarland class\n$M^\\#$. We also introduce $\\ell$-optimal bent functions as bent functions with\nthe lowest possible linearity index; such functions can be considered as\nopposite to Maiorana-McFarland bent functions. We give explicit constructions\nof $\\ell$-optimal bent functions within the $D_0$ class, which in turn can be\nemployed in certain secondary constructions of bent functions for providing\neven more classes of bent functions that are provably outside $M^\\#$. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that a certain subclass of $D_0$ has an additional property of\nhaving only 5-valued spectra decompositions. Finally, we generalize the\nso-called \"swapping variables\" method which then allows us to specify large\nfamilies of bent functions outside $M^\\#$. In this way, we give a better\nexplanation of the origin of bent functions in dimension eight, since the vast\nmajority of them is outside ${M}^\\#$.",

Deep learning models\n(nnU-Net, SegResNet, SwinUNETR) were trained to predict and segment enhancing\ntumour using only non-contrast T1-, T2-, and T2/FLAIR-weighted images.\nPerformance was evaluated on 1109 held-out test patients using patient-level\ndetection metrics and voxel-level segmentation accuracy. Model predictions were\ncompared against 11 expert radiologists who each reviewed 100 randomly selected\npatients. The best-performing nnU-Net achieved 83% balanced accuracy, 91.5%\nsensitivity, and 74.4% specificity in detecting enhancing tumour. Enhancement\nvolume predictions strongly correlated with ground truth (R2 0.859). The model\noutperformed expert radiologists, who achieved 69.8% accuracy, 75.9%\nsensitivity, and 64.7% specificity. 76.8% of test patients had Dice over 0.3\n(acceptable detection), 67.5% had Dice over 0.5 (good detection), and 50.2% had\nDice over 0.7 (excellent detection).

Despite significant advances in data\ncollection technology, our ability to map genes to traits is still limited.\nThis genome-to-phenome (G2P) challenge spans several problem domains, including\nplant breeding, and requires models capable of reasoning over high-dimensional,\nheterogeneous, and biologically structured data. Currently, however, many\ndatasets solely capture genetic information or solely capture phenotype\ninformation. Additionally, phenotype data is very heterogeneous, which many\ndatasets do not fully capture. The critical drawback is that these datasets are\nnot integrated, that is, they do not link with each other to describe the same\nbiological specimens. This limits machine learning models' ability to be\ninformed on the various aspects of these specimens, impacting the breadth of\ncorrelations learned, and therefore their ability to make more accurate\npredictions. To address this gap, we present the Arabidopsis Genomics-Phenomics\n(AGP) Dataset, a curated multi-modal dataset linking gene expression profiles\nwith phenotypic trait measurements in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism in\nplant biology. AGP supports tasks such as phenotype prediction and\ninterpretable graph learning.

Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup\nand CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable\nand efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can\nnegatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to\nco-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in\nmind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.",

We provide a complete characterization of the bent property for\nsuch functions and determine their duals. Specifically, we show that $f$ is\nbent if and only if the mapping $\\phi $ partitions $ \\mathbb{F}_2^{m+1}$ into\n2-dimensional affine subspaces, on each of which the function $ h $ has odd\nweight. We investigate which properties of mappings $\\phi \\colon\n\\mathbb{F}_2^{m+1} \\to \\mathbb{F}_2^{m-1}$ lead to bent functions of the form $\nf(x,y) = x \\cdot \\phi(y) + h(y) $ both inside and outside ${M}^\\# $ and provide\nconstruction methods for suitable Boolean functions $ h $ on\n$\\mathbb{F}_2^{m+1}$. We present a simple algorithm for constructing partitions\nof the vector space $\\mathbb{F}_2^{m+1}$ together with appropriate Boolean\nfunctions $ h $ that generate bent functions outside ${M}^\\# $. When $ 2m = 8\n$, we explicitly identify many such partitions that produce at least $ 2^{78} $\ndistinct bent functions on $\\mathbb{F}_2^8$ that do not belong to ${M}^\\# $,\nthereby generating more bent functions outside ${M}^\\#$ than the total number\nof 8-variable bent functions in ${M}^\\#$. Additionally, we demonstrate that\nconcatenating four almost Maiorana-McFarland bent functions outside ${M}^\\# $,\ncan result in a bent function ${M}^\\# $. This finding answers an open problem\nposed recently in Kudin et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 71(5): 3999-4011,\n2025).

We explore stellar dynamics in\nextremely dense clusters with initial half-mass densities of $\\rho_h \\gtrsim\n10^8M_\\odot{\\rm pc}^{-3}$ at very low metallicity, comparable to some of the\ndensest clusters seen by JWST.

    "abstract": "Determining associations among different species from citizen science\ndatabases is challenging due to observer behavior and intrinsic density\nvariations that give rise to correlations that do not imply species\nassociations. This paper introduces a method that can efficiently analyze large\ndatasets to extract likely species associations. It tiles space into small\nblocks chosen to be of the accuracy of the data coordinates, and reduces\nobservations to presence/absence per tile, in order to compute pairwise\noverlaps. It compares these overlaps with a spatial Poisson process that serves\nas a null model. For each species $i$, an expected overlap $\\mu_i$ is estimated\nby averaging normalized overlaps over other species in the same vicinity. This\ngives a $z$-score for significance of a species-species association and a\ncorrelation index for the strength of this association.

    "abstract": "Over the past 15 years, the evidence has clearly demonstrated that massive\nblack hole (MBH) binary merger timescales depend strongly on the structural and\nkinematic properties of their host galaxy. Stellar density, gas content, shape\nand kinematics all play a role, combining in non-linear ways to effect the\nevolution of the binary. The binary properties themselves, such as\neccentricity, mass ratio, and orbital plane, all matter as well. This makes it\nnontrivial to estimate accurate cosmological MBH binary merger rates, or to\ngenerate merger rate ranges that reflect the distribution of galaxy hosts and\norbits. Using an extensive set of high-resolution direct N-body simulations in\nwhich the shape, structure, and kinematics of each galaxy host are directly\ninformed by observations, we map out MBH binary merger timescales over a range\nof galaxy hosts and MBH binary orbits. This yields a convenient set of scaling\nrelations to determine MBH binary merger timescales -- and the range of merger\ntimescales -- as functions of basic observables. Such scaling relations can be\nreadily employed as a subgrid model in cosmological or semi-analytic studies,\nfor example, to model event rates for LISA or pulsar timing.",

This paper\naffirmatively answers the question with a set of \\emph{myopic} (finite\nvisibility range) luminous robots with the aim of \\emph{filling a minimal\nvertex cover} (MVC) of a given graph $G = (V, E)$. The graph has special\nvertices, called \\emph{doors}, through which robots enter sequentially.\nStarting from the doors, the goal of the robots is to settle on a set of\nvertices that forms a minimal vertex cover of $G$ under the asynchronous\n($\\mathcal{ASYNC}$) scheduler. We are also interested in achieving the\n\\emph{minimum vertex cover} (MinVC, which is NP-hard \\cite{Karp1972} for\ngeneral graphs) for a specific graph class using the myopic robots. We\nestablish lower bounds on the visibility range for the robots and on the time\ncomplexity (which is $\\Omega(|E|)$). We present two algorithms for trees: one\nfor single door, which is both time and memory-optimal, and the other for\nmultiple doors, which is memory-optimal and achieves time-optimality when the\nnumber of doors is a constant. Interestingly, our technique achieves MinVC on\ntrees with a single door.

To address this limitation, we present LEAD, a novel system\nincorporating learned models within DHT structures to significantly optimize\nrange query performance. LEAD utilizes a recursive machine learning model to\nmap and retrieve data across a distributed system while preserving the inherent\norder of data. LEAD includes the designs to minimize range query latency and\nmessage cost while maintaining high scalability and resilience to network\nchurn. Our comprehensive evaluations, conducted in both testbed implementation\nand simulations, demonstrate that LEAD achieves tremendous advantages in system\nefficiency compared to existing range query methods in large-scale distributed\nsystems, reducing query latency and message cost by 80% to 90%+. Furthermore,\nLEAD exhibits remarkable scalability and robustness against system churn,\nproviding a robust, scalable solution for efficient data retrieval in\ndistributed key-value systems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the structural properties of trees and\nbipartite graphs through the lens of topological indices and combinatorial\ngraph theory. We focus on the First and Second Hyper-Zagreb indices, $HM_1(G)$\nand $HM_2(G)$, for trees $T \\in T(n, \\Delta)$ with $n$ vertices and maximum\ndegree $\\Delta$. Key propositions demonstrate that the presence of end-support\nor support vertices of degree at least three, distinct from a vertex of maximum\ndegree, implies the existence of another tree $T' \\in T(n, \\Delta)$ with\nstrictly smaller Hyper-Zagreb indices. These results are extended to\nexponential forms, highlighting the influence of high-degree vertices.\nAdditionally, we explore structural characterizations of trees via degree\nsequence majorization and $S$-order, establishing conditions for the first and\nlast trees in specific classes. For bipartite graphs, we examine equitable\ncoloring, cycle lengths, and $k$-redundant tree embeddings, supported by\ntheorems on connectivity and minimum degree constraints. The paper also\naddresses the independence number of bipartite graphs, exterior covers, and\ncompetition numbers of complete $r$-partite graphs, providing bounds and\nstructural insights. Finally, we discuss Markov-chain algorithms for generating\nbipartite graphs and tournaments with prescribed degree sequences, analyzing\ntheir mixing times and convergence properties.

    "abstract": "Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching have been observed together\nin Venus yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) dimers -- a cryptic combination under\nprevailing theoretical models. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov\nsplitting in Venus dimer circular dichroism (CD) spectra, revealing large\nnegative dimer coupling energy, while antibunching was confirmed by\nantibunching-fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To\nexplain this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled here\nwithin a Lindblad master equation framework, justified by the separation of\ncharacteristic coupling, dephasing, and thermal relaxation rates. Simulations\npredict rapid decoherence, consistent with antibunching, indicating that\ncoherence in both the excitonic and site bases is too short-lived to affect\nphoton emission statistics. Despite the absence of long-lived coherence, Venus\ndimers provide a tractable platform for probing evolutionary pressures on\nfluorescent protein photophysics and quantum dynamics. Cryogenic cooling could\nextend coherence lifetimes into the regime required for quantum gate\noperations, suggesting a route toward fluorescent protein-based qubits.

Detecting and\nquantifying this phenomenon is key to understanding evolution of traits ranging\nfrom multicellularity to pathogen virulence. Multilevel selection is\nparticularly important in artificial life research due to its connection to\nmajor evolutionary transitions, a hallmark of open-ended evolution. Bonetti\nFranceschi & Volz (2024) proposed to detect multilevel selection dynamics by\nscreening for mutations that appear more often in a population than expected by\nchance (due to individual-level fitness benefits) but are ultimately associated\nwith negative longer-term fitness outcomes (i.e., smaller, shorter-lived\ndescendant clades). Here, we use agent-based modeling with known ground truth\nto assess the efficacy of this approach. To test these methods under\nchallenging conditions broadly comparable to the original dataset explored by\nBonetti Franceschi & Volz (2024), we use an epidemiological framework to model\nmultilevel selection in trade-offs between within-host growth rate and\nbetween-host transmissibility. To achieve success on our in silico data, we\ndevelop an alternate normalization procedure for identifying clade-level\nfitness effects. We find the method to be sensitive in detecting genome sites\nunder multilevel selection with 30% effect sizes on fitness, but do not see\nsensitivity to smaller 10% mutation effect sizes. To test the robustness of\nthis methodology, we conduct additional experiments incorporating extrinsic,\ntime-varying environmental changes and adaptive turnover in population\ncompositions, and find that screen performance remains generally consistent\nwith baseline conditions.

Structured information about such\nincidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent\nfuture occurrences.

To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting\nprocesses, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on\nsystems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that\ncan cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual\n(e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user\nrequest). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which\nfactors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation\nand access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide\nrecommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2)\nwhat information developers and deployers should retain and make available to\nincident investigators upon request.

We selected multiple checkpoint ACER agents\nfrom different stages of training and applied an explainable AI (EXAI) method\nto analyze the attribution from dose-volume histogram (DVH) inputs to\nTPP-tuning decisions. We then assessed each agent's planning efficacy and\nefficiency and evaluated their policy and final TPP tuning spaces. Combining\nthese analyses, we systematically examined how ACER agents generated\nhigh-quality treatment plans in response to different DVH inputs.\n  Results: Attribution analysis revealed that ACER agents progressively learned\nto identify dose-violation regions from DVH inputs and promote appropriate\nTPP-tuning actions to mitigate them. Organ-wise similarities between DVH\nattributions and dose-violation reductions ranged from 0.25 to 0.5 across\ntested agents. Agents with stronger attribution-violation similarity required\nfewer tuning steps (~12-13 vs. 22), exhibited a more concentrated TPP-tuning\nspace with lower entropy (~0.3 vs. 0.6), converged on adjusting only a few\nTPPs, and showed smaller discrepancies between practical and theoretical tuning\nsteps. Putting together, these findings indicate that high-performing ACER\nagents can effectively identify dose violations from DVH inputs and employ a\nglobal tuning strategy to achieve high-quality treatment planning, much like\nskilled human planners.\n  Significance: Better interpretability of the agent's decision-making process\nmay enhance clinician trust and inspire new strategies for automatic treatment\nplanning.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a hybrid infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication\nframework to support future 6G-enabled intelligent transportation systems (ITS)\nin smart cities. Leveraging existing LED streetlighting infrastructure, the\nsystem simultaneously delivers energy-efficient illumination and high-speed\nwireless connectivity. The proposed scheme integrates visible light\ncommunication (VLC) with a complementary ter-ahertz (THz) antenna array to\novercome VLC limitations under high ambient light and adverse weather\nconditions. Key con-tributions include the design of a VLC/THz access network,\nseamless integration with lighting infrastructure, a proposed\nswitching-combination (PSC) mechanism, and a physical layout optimization\nstrategy. Using a grid search method, thousands of configurations were\nevaluated to maximize lighting coverage, re-ceived power, signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR), signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), and minimize outage\nprobability. Results show that optimized lighting coverage improves from 35% to\n97%, while hybrid communication coverage increases from 49%to 99.9% at the same\npower level. Under extreme environmental conditions, the hybrid system\nmaintains up to 99% coverage, compared to 69% with VLC alone. These results\ndemonstrate the scalability, cost-efficiency, and practicality of the proposed\nsystem for next-generation ITS deployment.",

Most existing live video analytics (LVA) systems, however, have\nbeen built over terrestrial networks, limiting their applications during\nnatural disasters and in remote areas that desperately call for real-time\nvisual data delivery and scene analysis. With the recent advent of space\nnetworking, in particular, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations such\nas Starlink, high-speed truly global Internet access is becoming available and\naffordable. This paper examines the challenges and potentials of LVA over\nmodern LEO satellite networking (LSN). Using Starlink as the testbed, we have\ncarried out extensive in-the-wild measurements to gain insights into its\nachievable performance for LVA. The results reveal that the uplink bottleneck\nin today's LSN, together with the volatile network conditions, can\nsignificantly affect the service quality of LVA and necessitate prompt\nadaptation. We accordingly develop StarStream, a novel LSN-adaptive streaming\nframework for LVA.

    "abstract": "Space-time modulated elastic media, whose material properties vary in both\nspace and time, have attracted significant attention as a promising strategy\nfor achieving nonreciprocal propagation of elastic waves. To date, most studies\nhave focused on systems with subsonic modulation, where the phase velocity of\nthe modulation wave is lower than that of the guided elastic waves. In\ncontrast, wave propagation under supersonic modulation remains largely\nunexplored, and the associated nonreciprocal phenomena present an open\nchallenge. In this work, we investigate the dynamic response of elastic\nlongitudinal waves propagating through a spatially bounded medium subjected to\nsupersonic modulation of its elastic properties. We show that supersonic\nmodulation gives rise to directional wavenumber bandgaps in the dispersion\ndiagram, characterized by vanishing wavenumbers. Using a theoretical framework\nbased on mode-coupling theory, we reveal how supersonic modulation governs\namplitude modulation and frequency conversion in wave transmission and\nreflection at spatial interfaces. This leads to nonreciprocal parametric\namplification and frequency conversion, phenomena not previously reported in\nbounded elastic media. Remarkably, the observed parametric amplification is not\ndriven by an imaginary component of the wavenumber, but instead arises from the\ninterference between counter-propagating Floquet-Bloch modes at spatial\ninterfaces. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical predictions and\nillustrate nonreciprocal amplification and frequency conversion effects. Our\nfindings pave the way for the design of nonreciprocal elastic wave devices with\nadvanced functionalities such as signal processing, energy amplification, and\nfrequency conversion.",

We aim to derive a statistically robust and physically accurate\ndistribution of CO BEs on ASW surfaces, and to evaluate its implications for\nlaboratory temperature-programmed desorption experiments and interstellar\nchemistry, with a focus on protoplanetary disks.\n  Methods. We trained a machine-learned potential (MLP) on 8321 density\nfunctional theory (DFT) energies and gradients of CO interacting with\ndifferently-sized water clusters (22-60 water molecules). The DFT method was\nselected after extensive benchmark. With this potential we built realistic\nnon-porous and porous ASW surfaces, and computed a BE distribution. We used\nsymmetry-adapted perturbation theory to rationalize the interaction of CO on\nthe different binding sites.\n  Results. We find that both ASW morphologies yield similar Gaussian-like BE\ndistributions with mean values near 900 K. However, the nature of the binding\ninteractions is rather different and critically depends on surface roughness\nand dangling-OH bonds. Simulated TPD curves reproduce experimental trends\nacross several coverage regimes. From an astrochemical point of view, the\napplication of the full BE distribution has a dramatic influence on the CO\ndistribution in protoplanetary disks, leading to a broader CO snowline region,\nimproving predictions of CO gas-ice partitioning, and suggesting an equally\nbroader distribution of organics in these objects.",

The Hot Rocks Survey aims to address this question by\nobserving 9 rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs with MIRI emission photometry to\nconstrain the onset of atmospheres. In this paper, we present two MIRI F1500W\n(15$\\mu$m) eclipses of LTT 3780 b, an ultra-short period super-Earth ($P=0.768$\nd, $R=1.325 \\,R_\\oplus$, $M = 2.46\\,M_\\oplus$) that receives 111x Earth's\ninstellation, the highest in the survey. We find a combined eclipse depth of\n$312\\pm38$ ppm, which is consistent between different data reduction and\nanalysis assumptions, bolstering our confidence in the eclipse detection. This\neclipse depth is consistent with the thermal emission from a bare rock surface,\nwith a dayside temperature of $T_d=1143^{+104}_{-99}$ K, $98\\pm9$ % of the\nmaximum temperature predicted for a zero albedo, zero heat redistribution\nblackbody. We are able to confidently rule out CO$_2$-based atmospheres down to\n0.01 bar surface pressure to greater than 3$\\sigma$ (ruling out an\napproximately Mars-like atmosphere). We are unable to rule out a pure H$_2$O 1\nbar atmosphere, though we argue that this composition is unlikely on such a\nhighly irradiated planet, nor O$_2$ atmospheres due to the lack of features in\nthe bandpass, though we can put constraints on CO$_2$-mixture atmospheres. As a\npotential bare rock, we consider a variety of surface composition models, but\nare unable to distinguish between them. However, LTT 3780 b is an excellent\ntarget for follow-up JWST observations to determine its surface composition and\nrule out additional atmospheric compositions.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the nucleosynthesis processes behind heavy-element enrichment in\nstellar atmospheres is challenging. It typically relies on comparing observed\nabundance-to-iron ratios with theoretical predictions relative to the Sun, but\nthis method is prone to uncertainty due to limitations of classical 1D\nhydrostatic models. One promising but still underexplored approach is to\nmeasure the isotopic composition of stellar atmospheres by focusing on elements\nthat have both slow (s)-process and rapid (r)-process contributions. While the\nstudy of total elemental abundances offers a simplified view, isotopic ratios\nare directly linked to the underlying nucleosynthesis processes. Our aim is to\nprovide a reliable method for quantifying the contributions of the s- and\nr-processes to barium in stellar atmospheres. This is achieved by determining\nbarium isotopic ratios using 1D atmospheric models in combination with a\ncarefully calibrated microturbulence, based on the comparison between\nsubordinate and resonance Ba lines. In this initial study, we use member stars\nof the globular cluster NGC 6752 to calibrate the microturbulence ($v_{mic}$)\nvalue for both subordinate and resonance barium lines across different stellar\nevolutionary stages. This allows us to provide a reliable estimate of $v_{mic}$\nthat can be applied to accurately determine barium abundances and isotopic\nratios in stars ranging from the main sequence to the upper red giant branch.\nThe $v_{mic}$ scale adapted for barium subordinate lines is consistent with\nthat derived from 3D model atmospheres, and thus the $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$-log $g$\ndependent relations of the later can be used safely. The $v_{mic}$ for the\nresonance line at $\\lambda$4934 Angstrom -- for the determination of the\nisotopic ratio -- is higher, and depends on the equivalent width (EW). We\nprovide calibrated relations between $v_{mic}$ and EW for measuring isotopic\nratios.",

    "abstract": "Fault-tolerant (FT) preparation of diverse logical stabilizer states in\nquantum error-correcting (QEC) codes is essential for FT computation. Existing\nconstructions of these FT circuits are often constrained by classical\ncomputational resources or result in unnecessarily large quantum circuits. This\nwork introduces a modular construction for FT preparation circuits in CSS codes\nof arbitrary distance, yielding significantly more resource-efficient circuits\nthan previous approaches, especially for the largest codes studied. The key\ninsight is that in bipartite CX circuits used to prepare CSS states, $X$ errors\npropagate in one direction across the qubit partition, while $Z$ errors\npropagate in the opposite direction. By appending $X$-detecting flag gadgets to\nthe first partition and $Z$-detecting flag gadgets to the second, the circuit\nbecomes FT. To manage the associated overhead, we propose an algorithm that\ndiscovers optimal (or near-optimal) flag gadgets at any distance.

    "abstract": "This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental\ninterpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from\nstatic, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the\ntraining process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,\nincluding representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that\nenable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review\nexamines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on\nthe formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of\nknowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like\nin-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase\ntransitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive\nand linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for\nunderstanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental\nperspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive\nAI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by\nwhich models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand\nchallenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a\nresearch agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Traditional ranking systems rely on proxy loss functions that assume\nsimplistic user behavior, such as users preferring a rank list where items are\nsorted by hand-crafted relevance. However, real-world user interactions are\ninfluenced by complex behavioral biases, including position bias, brand\naffinity, decoy effects, and similarity aversion, which these objectives fail\nto capture. As a result, models trained on such losses often misalign with\nactual user utility, such as the probability of any click or purchase across\nthe ranked list. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for modeling\nuser behavior through counterfactual reward learning. Our method, RewardRank,\nfirst trains a deep utility model to estimate user engagement for entire item\npermutations using logged data. Then, a ranking policy is optimized to maximize\npredicted utility via differentiable soft permutation operators, enabling\nend-to-end training over the space of factual and counterfactual rankings. To\naddress the challenge of evaluation without ground-truth for unseen\npermutations, we introduce two automated protocols: (i) $\\textit{KD-Eval}$,\nusing a position-aware oracle for counterfactual reward estimation, and (ii)\n$\\textit{LLM-Eval}$, which simulates user preferences via large language\nmodels. Experiments on large-scale benchmarks, including Baidu-ULTR and the\nAmazon KDD Cup datasets, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling user behavior\ndynamics for utility-optimized ranking.

In this\nwork, we analyse public interferometric radio maps of AO 0235+164 at 15 and 43\nGHz, using the Cross Entropy global optimisation technique to determine the\nstructural parameters of its jet components. We identified 36 kinematically\ndistinct jet components across all sky quadrants, indicating a highly\nrelativistic parsec-scale jet with a minimum Lorentz factor of 34 +/- 7 and a\nmaximum viewing angle of 37 +/- 8 degree. The temporal evolution of these jet\ncomponents was modelled as a relativistic jet under a constant precession rate.\nThe optimal clockwise precession model has a precession period of 8.4 +\\- 0.2\nyears, consistent with the 8.13-year periodicity previously detected in optical\nlight curves, besides providing a time-variable Doppler boosting factor\ncorrelated with the most intense flares at gamma-ray energies. For the\ncounter-clockwise precession, a period of 6.0 +\\- 0.1 years is found,\ncompatible with the 5-6 year periodicities detected at radio and optical\nwavelengths. It is plausible that a supermassive black hole binary system in\nthe nucleus of AO 0235+164 drives the parsec-scale jet precession and induces\nnodding motions consistent with short-term continuum periodicities.\nNonetheless, alternative scenarios (e.g., intrinsic curved jet, warped\naccretion disc instabilities, Lense-Thirring/Bardeen-Petterson effects, dual\njets) cannot be ruled out as causes or optional explanations for the\nprecession.",

To achieve the\nspeed and noise capabilities required by such programs, the X-ray Astronomy and\nObservational Cosmology (XOC) Group at Stanford, in collaboration with the MIT\nKavli Institute (MKI) and MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL), is developing\nreadout systems that leverage the high speed, low noise, and low power\nconsumption of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices. Here, we\nreport the energy resolution and noise performance achieved using MIT-LL AXIS\nprototype charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors in conjunction with\nStanford-developed Multi-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC) ASICs. Additionally, we\npresent a new sampling method for simultaneous optimization of the output gate\n(OG), reset gate (RG), and reset drain (RD) biases which, in combination with\nnew integrated fast summing well (SW) and RG clock operation modes, enables the\ndata rates required of future X-ray telescopes.",

The reference values for ergodic quantum systems\nhave been obtained numerically from the spectra of large but finite-dimensional\nrandom matrices. This work introduces a weighted ratio of consecutive level\nspacings, having the propery that the average can be computed numerically for\nrandom matrices of infinite dimension. A Painlev\\'e differential equation is\nsolved numerically in order to determine this average for infinite-dimensional\northogonal random matrices, thereby providing a reference value for ergodic\nquantum systems obeying time-reversal symmetry. A Wigner surmise-inspired\nanalytical calculation is found to yield a qualitatively accurate picture for\nthe statistics of high-dimensional random matrices from each of the symmetry\nclasses.

    "abstract": "The first generation of Single electron Sensitive Read Out (SiSeRO)\namplifiers, employed as on-chip charge detectors for charge-coupled devices\n(CCDs) have demonstrated excellent noise and spectral performance: a\nresponsivity of around 800 pA per electron, an equivalent noise charge (ENC) of\n3.2 electrons root mean square (RMS), and a full width half maximum (FWHM)\nenergy resolution of 130 eV at 5.9 keV for a readout speed of 625 Kpixel/s.\nRepetitive Non Destructive Readout (RNDR) has also been demonstrated with these\ndevices, achieving an improved ENC performance of 0.36 electrons RMS after 200\nRNDR cycles. In order to mature this technology further, Stanford University,\nin collaboration with MIT Kavli Institute and MIT Lincoln Laboratory, are\ndeveloping new SiSeRO detectors with improved geometries that should enable\ngreater responsivity and improved noise performance. These include CCD devices\nemploying arrays of SiSeRO amplifiers to optimize high speed, low noise RNDR\nreadout and a proof-of-concept SiSeRO active pixel sensor (APS). To read out\nthese devices, our team has developed a compact, 8-channel, fast, low noise,\nlow power application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) denoted the\nMulti-Channel Readout Chip (MCRC) that includes an experimental drain current\nreadout mode intended for SiSeRO devices.

We present an extensive study of the Ly$\\alpha$ evolution from\ngalaxies at 4.5 $\\leq$ z $\\leq$ 11 in the UDS field, observed as part of the\nCAPERS survey, and complemented with spectra from the DAWN JWST Archive. The\ncombined sample includes 651 spectroscopically confirmed Ly$\\alpha$-break\ngalaxies, among which we find 73 S/N>3 LAEs in JWST-NIRSpec PRISM spectra. We\ntrace the redshift evolution of the Ly$\\alpha$ emitter fraction with EW$_0$ >25\nA (X$_{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}$) between z = 5 and z = 9, presenting the first such\nanalysis in the UDS field. At z = 5 and 6, the UDS results agree with the\naverage JWST X$_{\\mathrm{Ly\\alpha}}$ values from multiple fields. However, JWST\nmeasurements are consistently lower than ground-based results. To investigate\nthis, we compare JWST observations to a population of star-forming galaxies at\nz$\\sim$6 observed with VLT-FORS2. We find that a Ly$\\alpha$ slit-loss of 35\n$\\pm$ 10% in JWST spectra accounts for the offset, as the resonant Ly$\\alpha$\nemission is more spatially extended than the stellar continuum. From z = 6 to\n7, the UDS field shows a significant drop in Ly$\\alpha$ visibility, from which\nwe infer a neutral hydrogen fraction of X$_{\\mathrm{HI}}$ = 0.7--0.9.

Here, we find that a population of\nthese black holes would have dramatic implications for our understanding of\ntheir growth across cosmic time. We first show that the global black hole mass\ndensity at $z \\sim 5$ would be comparable to local values. This would not occur\nif these black holes occupy a small fraction of galaxies, though it would be\nexpected if these black holes radiate at high efficiencies (requiring that the\ncentral engines of AGN spin rapidly). We then show that the individual detected\n$z \\sim 5$ black holes would remain overmassive compared to the local relation\nif they grow according to the average rates of state-of-the-art models. These\nsystems must instead grow at least an order of magnitude more slowly than\nexpected if they are to fall within the observed scatter of the local black\nhole mass-stellar mass relation. Such slow growth is surprising in comparison\nto other estimates of the radiative efficiency of AGN, especially because\ngrowth must be rapid at $z > 5$ in order to build up such massive black holes\nquickly. Finally, we highlight the challenges that overmassive black holes have\non our understanding of the impact of quasar feedback on galaxies.",

    "abstract": "Envelope stripping, whether through single-star wind mass loss or binary mass\ntransfer, is a key evolutionary pathway for the formation of classical\nWolf-Rayet stars and lower-mass stripped helium (He) stars. However, to study\nthe evolution of these objects into black holes, neutron stars, and\nstripped-envelope supernovae, we need appropriate input models for the core-He\nburning phase without relying on the uncertain evolution into this evolved\nphase. Reliable mass-luminosity relations (MLRs) for He stars are needed for\nstellar wind and evolution studies, but the MLRs currently in literature are\neither for fully-stripped or chemically homogeneous stars, neither of which\nreflect the important and recently also observationally confirmed stage of\npartial stripping. We alleviate this drawback by computing sets of MESA\nsynthetic structure models with partially-stripped chemical profiles,\nconsisting of a pure-He core and a hydrogen (H)-depleted envelope with an H/He\nchemical gradient left behind from the receding convective core during the main\nsequence. As the H slope increases from 0 (full chemical homogeneity) to\n$\\infty$ (pure-He stars) in our synthetic models, we find the luminosity to\ninitially increase before eventually decreasing. The maximum luminosity for a\ngiven mass is reached for an intermediate H-profile slope corresponding to a\npartially-stripped structure, exceeding even the values documented for pure-He\nstars, primarily due to the H shell disproportionately dominating the total\nluminosity budget. We also provide convenient mass-luminosity fit relations to\npredict the minimum, maximum, and pure-He luminosities for a given mass -- and\nvice versa -- while accounting for structures achievable through partial\nstripping. We also explore the impact of the higher luminosity on the wind\nproperties of partially-stripped configurations using hydrodynamically\nconsistent atmosphere models.",

Despite this general understanding, existing\ntheoretical models have yet to match observational data. At the photosphere and\nthe uppermost convection zone, granular convection drives a multi-scale\nmagnetic field, forming a larger-scale filamentary structure while also\ngenerating turbulence-scale Alfv\\'{e}n wave turbulence.

A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population\nof active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly\nfound in the high-redshift Universe ($z\\gtrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse\nblack holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely\nmetal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the\nmost massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code\nA-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD\ndemographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH\npopulation against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models\nagree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties.\nFurthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to\nbe systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to\nreproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios -\nhigh dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed\nto explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington\naccretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on\nstellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be\nreproduced. We emphasize the importance of gas-metallicity observations as an\nadditional dimension besides the widely used SMBH-stellar mass ratios to\nfurther constrain the progenitors of LRDs.",

Here, we measure the mean plane of the non-resonant Kuiper belt across\nsemimajor axes 50 - 400 AU. We introduce a new method to measure the mean plane\nthat we demonstrate to be independent of observational bias. In particular, our\nresults are not biased by surveys that look only at limited areas on the\ncelestial sphere.

We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and\nQwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B\nbased on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,\ndemonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop\nautomation.

Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to\nhandle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in\ntemporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained\nsetting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both\nfine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more\ndetailed compositional changes in retrieved video content.

We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual\ninformation through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,\nenabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.\nThe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing\nmethods on all metrics.

To address these challenges, this study explores how Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) can integrate expert knowledge through in-context\nlearning for SA, providing a scalable solution for sophisticated health data\nanalysis. Specifically, we develop a structured codebook that systematically\nencodes expert interpretation guidelines, enabling LLMs to apply\ndomain-specific knowledge through targeted prompting rather than extensive\ntraining.

We also highlight existing\nrecommendations for biomedical researchers and propose priorities for future\nwork in this domain.",

    "abstract": "Data sharing is the fuel of the galloping artificial intelligence economy,\nproviding diverse datasets for training robust models. Trust between data\nproviders and data consumers is widely considered one of the most important\nfactors for enabling data sharing initiatives. Concerns about data sensitivity,\nprivacy breaches, and misuse contribute to reluctance in sharing data across\nvarious domains. In recent years, there has been a rise in technological and\nalgorithmic solutions to measure, capture and manage trust, trustworthiness,\nand reputation in what we collectively refer to as Trust and Reputation\nManagement Systems (TRMSs). Such approaches have been developed and applied to\ndifferent domains of computer science, such as autonomous vehicles, or IoT\nnetworks, but there have not been dedicated approaches to data sharing and its\nunique characteristics. In this survey, we examine TRMSs from a data-sharing\nperspective, analyzing how they assess the trustworthiness of both data and\nentities across different environments. We develop novel taxonomies for system\ndesigns, trust evaluation framework, and evaluation metrics for both data and\nentity, and we systematically analyze the applicability of existing TRMSs in\ndata sharing. Finally, we identify open challenges and propose future research\ndirections to enhance the explainability, comprehensiveness, and accuracy of\nTRMSs in large-scale data-sharing ecosystems.",

We find that when a limited\namount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD\noutperforms existing baselines by a significant margin.

Continual\nlearning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different\ndomains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring\nlarge datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied\nCONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that\nenables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,\nand modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes\nin isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.\nThrough careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically\nexpand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives\nwithout catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate\nour approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for\nclassification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved\nperformance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually\nincorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\\% improvement in Dice score compared to\nrespective baselines.

    "abstract": "We investigate the different meanings that the concept of Quantum Bounce\nacquires in various formalisms. The original idea refers to the phenomenology\nthat appears in the Klein-Gordon framework when homogeneous cosmologies are\nconsidered. In that case, the Quantum Bounce describes the quantum scattering\nbetween a collapsing and an expanding Universe branch, and therefore provides a\nquantum description of the semiclassical Big Bounce mechanism. Here, we show\nthat the proposal of the Quantum Big Bounce is well-grounded, thanks to the\ncomputation of the volume operator mean values and its standard deviation in\nthe Wheeler-DeWitt framework for the isotropic case. Then, we analyze the\nBianchi models in the Dirac approach, now showing that the Quantum Bounce\nconcept can be implemented to describe the Kasner transitions of the\nBelinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz map at a quantum level. In summary, the quantum\nscattering framework borrowed from particle physics can serve as a good model\nfor different cosmological scenarios, which can exhibit scalar-like or\nfermionic-like behaviours depending on how the anisotropies are described in\nthe dynamics.",

    "abstract": "In many fields including cosmology, statistical inference often relies on\nGaussian likelihoods whose covariance matrices are estimated from a finite\nnumber of simulations. This finite-sample estimation introduces noise into the\ncovariance, which propagates to parameter estimates, a phenomenon known as the\nDodelson-Schneider (DS) effect, leading to inflated uncertainties. While the\nMassively Optimized Parameter Estimation and Data compression (MOPED) algorithm\noffers lossless Fisher information-preserving compression, it does not mitigate\nthe DS effect when the compression matrix itself is derived from noisy\ncovariances. In this paper, we propose a modified compression scheme, powered\nMOPED ($p$-MOPED), which suppresses noise propagation by balancing information\nretention and covariance estimate noise reduction through a tunable power-law\ntransformation of the sample correlation matrix. We test $p$-MOPED against\nstandard and diagonal MOPED on toy models and on cosmological data from the\nSubaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Year 3 weak lensing survey. Our results demonstrate\nthat $p$-MOPED consistently outperforms other approaches, especially in regimes\nwith limited simulations, offering a robust compression strategy for\nhigh-dimensional data analyses under practical constraints.",

With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and\n$w_0=-1.39\\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\\%$ on the joint\n$S_8$-$w_0$ constraint.

Our new\nconstraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find\nthat with the inclusion of $\\langle M_{\\rm ap}^3\\rangle$ the existing tension\nbetween the data sets is at the level of $2.3\\sigma$. We show that the\nthird-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric\nredshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little\ndegradation in the figure of merit.

Our joint analysis yields a\nconstraint of $S_8=0.736\\pm0.020$, which is slightly lower than the\ntwo-point-only result and increases the tension with Planck 2018 to 3.2$\\sigma$\nin the $S_8$-$\\Omega_m$ plane. The two- and three-point statistics are found to\nbe internally consistent across redshift bins and angular scales, and we detect\nno significant intrinsic alignment signal. We also explore extensions to the\n$w$CDM model and find no evidence for deviations from a cosmological constant.\nThis work demonstrates the feasibility and scientific value of incorporating\nthird-order shear statistics into weak lensing cosmology and provides a\npractical pathway for similar analyses in future Stage-IV surveys such as LSST,\nEuclid, and Roman.",

Although the completeness of transcriptional\nnetworks for digital logic is well-established, *analog* computation plays a\ncrucial role in biological systems and offers significant potential for\nsynthetic biology applications. While transcriptional circuits typically rely\non cooperativity and highly non-linear behavior of transcription factors to\nregulate *production* of proteins, they are often modeled with simple linear\n*degradation* terms. In contrast, general analog dynamics require both\nnon-linear positive as well as negative terms, seemingly necessitating control\nover not just transcriptional (i.e., production) regulation but also the\ndegradation rates of transcription factors.\n  Surprisingly, we prove that controlling transcription factor production\n(i.e., transcription rate) without explicitly controlling degradation is\nmathematically complete for analog computation, achieving equivalent\ncapabilities to systems where both production and degradation are programmable.\nWe demonstrate our approach on several examples including oscillatory and\nchaotic dynamics, analog sorting, memory, PID controller, and analog extremum\nseeking. Our result provides a systematic methodology for engineering novel\nanalog dynamics using synthetic transcriptional networks without the added\ncomplexity of degradation control and informs our understanding of the\ncapabilities of natural transcriptional circuits.\n  We provide a compiler, in the form of a Python package that can take any\nsystem of polynomial ODEs and convert it to an equivalent transcriptional\nnetwork implementing the system *exactly*, under appropriate conditions.",

Previous studies have employed dense SLAM\ntechniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.\nHowever, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which\nare insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete\nreconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires\nincorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.\nHowever, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive\ntraining iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS\nmodeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By\nanalyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal\nnon-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and\nselected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse\nviewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework\nthat incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in\n3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process.

Although\nmultiwavelength observations offer critical diagnostics and have been widely\nconducted, only Galactic FRB~20200428D is associated with an X-ray burst from\nthe magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Here, we present multiwavelength follow-up\nobservations of the nearby bright FRB~20250316A, including the\nFive-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), Einstein Probe\n(EP) X-ray mission, Chandra X-ray Observatory, Wide Field Survey Telescope\n(WFST) and Space Variable Object Monitor/Visible Telescope (SVOM/VT). A\n13.08-hour FAST follow-up observational campaign suggests that this burst is\nlikely a one-off event. A prompt EP follow-up and multi-epoch observational\ncampaign totaling $>$ 100 ks led to the detection of an X-ray source within the\nangular resolution of its Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT, $10^{\\prime\\prime}$).\nA subsequent Chandra observation revealed this source to be offset by\n$7^{\\prime\\prime}$ from the FRB position, and established a 0.5-10 keV flux\nupper limit of $7.6\\times 10^{-15}$ $\\rm erg\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}$ at the FRB\nposition, corresponding to $\\sim 10^{39}$ $\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}$ at the 40 Mpc\ndistance of the host galaxy NGC~4141. These results set one of the most\nstringent limits on X-ray emission from a non-repeating FRB, disfavoring\nultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) as counterparts of apparently one-off FRBs\nand offering critical insights into afterglow models. Our study suggests that\nan arcsecond localization of both the FRB and its potential X-ray counterpart\nis essential for exploring the X-ray counterpart of an FRB.",

This phase is all\nbut negligible, yet it is still poorly understood what role it plays across the\nsolar cycle and what governs it.\n  Aims. We present a statistical analysis of ELP flares over four years between\nMay 2010 and May 2014 based on properties like eruptivity, magnetic\nconfiguration, and late-phase duration, delay and strength in order to\nunderstand what influences the likelihood of this class of flares and their\nbehavior on a general scale.\n  Methods. We primarily make use of data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's\n(SDO) Extreme-ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE), as well as\ncomplimentary spatial information provided by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly\n(AIA), to assess relationships between the various parameters and see if ELP\nflares differ from the general flare population. We quantify the criteria for\nELP flare definition and determine its characteristics.\n  Results. Our analysis shows that about 10% of all flares with a GOES class\ngreater than or equal to C3.0 experience an EUV late phase (179 out of 1803).\nThis percentage decreases from solar minimum to solar maximum. C-class flares\nare considerably less likely to be identified as ELP flares than their\nhigher-energetic counterparts, which is in line with previous investigations.\nThe majority of this type of flares is confined (67%), more so than in the\ngeneral flare population (greater than or equal to C5.0). There appears to be a\n(linear) relationship between the late-phase delay and its duration. The ratio\nof the emission peak of the late and main flare phase lies between 0.3 and 5.9,\nand exceeds 1 in 71.5% of cases, which is considerably higher than previously\nreported.",

Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100\nkm/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times\nthe 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning\nand braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend\nautonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,\nwhich need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia.

    "abstract": "We present a general method for simulating lattice gauge theories in low\ndimensions using infinite matrix product states (iMPS). A central challenge in\nHamiltonian formulations of gauge theories is the unbounded local Hilbert space\nassociated with gauge degrees of freedom. In one spatial dimension, Gauss's law\npermits these gauge fields to be integrated out, yielding an effective\nHamiltonian with long-range interactions among matter fields. We construct\nefficient matrix product operator (MPO) representations of these Hamiltonians\ndirectly in the thermodynamic limit. Our formulation naturally includes\nbackground fields and $\\theta$-terms, requiring no modifications to the\nstandard iDMRG algorithm. This provides a broadly applicable framework for 1+1D\ngauge theories and can be extended to quasi-two-dimensional geometries such as\ninfinite cylinders, where tensor-network methods remain tractable. As a\nbenchmark, we apply our construction to the Schwinger model, reproducing\nexpected features including confinement, string breaking, and the critical\nbehavior at finite mass. Because the method alters only the MPO structure, it\ncan be incorporated with little effort into a wide range of iMPS and\ninfinite-boundary-condition algorithms, opening the way to efficient studies of\nboth equilibrium and non-equilibrium gauge dynamics.",

Recent studies have explored fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwith synthetic data to enhance their long-context capabilities. However, the\neffectiveness of such approaches is often limited by the low diversity and\nfactual inconsistencies in the generated data. To address these challenges, we\npropose LongMab-PO, a novel framework that leverages a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)\nrollout strategy to identify the most informative chunks from the given long\ncontext for sampling high-quality and diverse responses and constructing\npreference data pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) training.\nSpecifically, we treat context chunks as arms of MAB, select chunks based on\ntheir expected reward scores to input into LLMs to generate responses, and\niteratively update these scores based on reward feedback. This exploration and\nexploitation process enables the model to focus on the most relevant context\nsegments, thereby generating and collecting high-quality and diverse responses.\nFinally, we collect these generated responses from the rollout process and\napply the DPO method to further optimize the LLM.

Consequently, AI agents must\ndemonstrate holistic audio understanding to qualify as generally intelligent.\nHowever, evaluating auditory intelligence comprehensively remains challenging.\nTo address this gap, we introduce MMAU-Pro, the most comprehensive and\nrigorously curated benchmark for assessing audio intelligence in AI systems.\nMMAU-Pro contains 5,305 instances, where each instance has one or more audios\npaired with human expert-generated question-answer pairs, spanning speech,\nsound, music, and their combinations. Unlike existing benchmarks, MMAU-Pro\nevaluates auditory intelligence across 49 unique skills and multiple complex\ndimensions, including long-form audio comprehension, spatial audio reasoning,\nmulti-audio understanding, among others. All questions are meticulously\ndesigned to require deliberate multi-hop reasoning, including both\nmultiple-choice and open-ended response formats. Importantly, audio data is\nsourced directly ``from the wild\" rather than from existing datasets with known\ndistributions. We evaluate 22 leading open-source and proprietary multimodal AI\nmodels, revealing significant limitations: even state-of-the-art models such as\nGemini 2.5 Flash and Audio Flamingo 3 achieve only 59.2% and 51.7% accuracy,\nrespectively, approaching random performance in multiple categories.

Abstractly, the optimal\nrecovery error is characterized by a `restricted' version of the Gelfand\nwidths, which we call the Fourier sampling numbers. Up to logarithmic factors,\nwe determine the correct asymptotics of the Fourier sampling numbers in the\nregime $s/d > 1 - 1/p$. We also give a description of nearly optimal Fourier\nmeasurements and recovery algorithms in each of these cases.

However, the TCR magnitude is typically below 5%/K near\n300 K for thermal imaging materials, such as vanadium oxide and amorphous\nsilicon. Inspired by the distinctive characteristic of feedback in electronic\ncircuits, we demonstrate a voltage-tunable TCR of up to 150%/K near 300 K in a\ntwo-terminal InGaAs/InP n-p-n transistor, enabled by an internal coherent\ncarrier feedback mechanism. In this device, current amplification arises from a\nsynergistic interplay between temperature-dependent transistor gain and\navalanche multiplication. Carriers amplified at the emitter-base junction via\nthe transistor effect are injected into the collector-base junction, where\navalanche multiplication generates additional carriers. These excess carriers\nare then fed back to the emitter-base junction, triggering further transistor\namplification. This regenerative positive feedback loop results in a high and\nbias-tunable temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR).

We apply this model to existing work, and\nwe discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers\nplan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights\nafter interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open\nresearch questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social\ncontexts of human-robot interactions.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new\ncombinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising\nscenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items\nsimultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key\nstructural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,\n(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)\nheterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with\nBackward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and\nprove that it achieves a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$\nepisodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the\nfact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a\nsecond algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning\n(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,\nuser scaling, with a regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate\nour theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical\neffectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.",

We analyze cluster mass, age, size,\nconcentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal\ndimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters.\nOur results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are\ngenerally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally\nconcentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in\nclusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal\nsubstructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly,\nmedian fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups\n(1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings\nindicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context\nsignificantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve\ntoward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less\nmassive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study\ndemonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with\nthe environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and\ndynamical state.",

While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major\nlimitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which\nrequires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically\napply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has\nalready been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and\nprevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.\n  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these\nlimitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline\nstage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific\ndemocratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of\nperspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector\nQuantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted\nrepresentation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these\naspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some\nof the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring\na more diverse set of candidates.\n  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off\nbetween personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline. It\nalso generates more novel, diverse, and serendipitous candidates while\neffectively taking into account aspects that strengthen democratic values.\nThese empirical results make it a promising approach for downstream\ndemocratized news recommendation systems.",

Then, we present a theorem\nthat precisely programs all excitation mobilities (fractons, lineons, or fully\nmobile anyons) directly from the HOCA rule, representing the first complete\ncharacterization of anyon mobility in SET phases. As a corollary, this theorem\nyields symmetry-enriched fusion rules which govern mobility transmutation\nduring fusion.

An example is collaborative\nlearning, which aims to train a global model based on data from individual\nagents. A major challenge in designing such systems is to guarantee safety and\nalignment with human values, particularly a fair distribution of rewards upon\nachieving the global goal. Cooperative game theory offers useful abstractions\nof cooperating agents via value functions, which assign value to each\ncoalition, and via reward functions. With these, the idea of fair allocation\ncan be formalized by specifying fairness axioms and designing concrete\nmechanisms. Classical cooperative game theory, exemplified by the Shapley\nvalue, does not fully capture scenarios like collaborative learning, as it\nassumes nonreplicable resources, whereas data and models can be replicated.\nInfinite replicability requires a generalized notion of fairness, formalized\nthrough new axioms and mechanisms. These must address imbalances in reciprocal\nbenefits among participants, which can lead to strategic exploitation and\nunfair allocations. The main contribution of this paper is a mechanism and a\nproof that it fulfills the property of mutual fairness, formalized by the\nBalanced Reciprocity Axiom.

Apart from device errors, other unexpected\nfactors could also affect the algorithm, such as careless human read-out error,\nor even a malicious hacker deliberately altering the measurement results. Thus,\nwe want our algorithm to work even in the worst case when things go against our\nfavor.\n  We consider the practical setting of single-copy measurements and propose the\n$\\gamma$-adversarial corruption model where an imaginary adversary can\narbitrarily change $\\gamma$-fraction of the measurement outcomes. This is\nstronger than the $\\gamma$-bounded SPAM noise model, where the post-measurement\nstate changes by at most $\\gamma$ in trace distance. Under our stronger model\nof corruption, we design an algorithm using non-adaptive measurements that can\nlearn an unknown rank-$r$ state up to $\\tilde{O}(\\gamma\\sqrt{r})$ in trace\ndistance, provided that the number of copies is sufficiently large. We further\nprove an information-theoretic lower bound of $\\Omega(\\gamma\\sqrt{r})$ for\nnon-adaptive measurements, demonstrating the optimality of our algorithm. Our\nupper and lower bounds also hold for quantum state testing, where the goal is\nto test whether an unknown state is equal to a given state or far from it.\n  Our results are intriguingly optimistic and pessimistic at the same time. For\ngeneral states, the error is dimension-dependent and $\\gamma\\sqrt{d}$ in the\nworst case, meaning that only corrupting a very small fraction ($1/\\sqrt{d}$)\nof the outcomes could totally destroy any non-adaptive learning algorithm.\nHowever, for constant-rank states that are useful in many quantum algorithms,\nit is possible to achieve dimension-independent error, even in the worst-case\nadversarial setting.",

The learnable quality token is concatenated\nwith the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via\nglobal self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information\nacross all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two\nheads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn\ndiscriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)\nthe quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face\nsample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several\nFR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that\nViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance.

This relativistic regime has been observed only in\ncrystalline iron-garnet ferrimagnets but is in general expected in many\nmagnetic materials. In particular, amorphous rare-earth -- transition metal\nferrimagnets should exhibit relativistic effects because of their ultrafast\nmagnetic dynamics. However, no evidence for these effects has been reported in\nthese technologically relevant materials. Here, we show that the relativistic\nregime can be attained in easy-to-engineer amorphous ferrimagnetic alloys. In\nGdFeCo we observe a saturation of the current-induced domain wall velocity that\nis indicative of a maximum spin-wave speed of the order of 2 km/s. Our\nobservations indicate that relativistic dynamics are not exclusive to\nferrimagnetic garnets but also exist in rare-earth -- transition-metal\nferrimagnets, which provide a robust material platform for future magnetic\ndevices operating at the ultimate speed limit.",

    "abstract": "In the digital era, user interactions with various resources such as\ndatabases, data warehouses, websites, and knowledge graphs (KGs) are\nincreasingly mediated through digital platforms. These interactions leave\nbehind digital traces, systematically captured in the form of logs. Logs, when\neffectively exploited, provide high value across industry and academia,\nsupporting critical services (e.g., recovery and security), user-centric\napplications (e.g., recommender systems), and quality-of-service improvements\n(e.g., performance optimization). Despite their importance, research on log\nusage remains fragmented across domains, and no comprehensive study currently\nconsolidates existing efforts. This paper presents a systematic survey of log\nusage, focusing on Database (DB), Data Warehouse (DW), Web, and KG logs. More\nthan 300 publications were analyzed to address three central questions: (1) do\ndifferent types of logs share common structural and functional characteristics?\n(2) are there standard pipelines for their usage? (3) which constraints and\nnon-functional requirements (NFRs) guide their exploitation?. The survey\nreveals a limited number of end-to-end approaches, the absence of\nstandardization across log usage pipelines, and the existence of shared\nstructural elements among different types of logs. By consolidating existing\nknowledge, identifying gaps, and highlighting opportunities, this survey\nprovides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of log\nusage and sheds light on promising directions for future research, particularly\nregarding the exploitation and democratization of KG logs.",

Sensitivity analysis is often employed to assess the\nrobustness of causal conclusions to unmeasured confounding, but existing\nmethods are predominantly designed for binary treatments. In this paper, we\nprovide natural extensions of two extensively used sensitivity frameworks --\nthe Rosenbaum and Marginal sensitivity models -- to the setting of continuous\nexposures. Our generalization replaces scalar sensitivity parameters with\nsensitivity functions that vary with exposure level, enabling richer modeling\nand sharper identification bounds. We develop a unified pseudo-outcome\nregression formulation for bounding the counterfactual dose-response curve\nunder both models, and propose corresponding nonparametric estimators which\nhave second order bias. These estimators accommodate modern machine learning\nmethods for obtaining nuisance parameter estimators, which are shown to achieve\n$L^2$- consistency, minimax rates of convergence under suitable conditions. Our\nresulting estimators of bounds for the counterfactual dose-response curve are\nshown to be consistent and asymptotic normal allowing for a user-specified\nbound on the degree of uncontrolled exposure endogeneity. We also offer a\ngeometric interpretation that relates the Rosenbaum and Marginal sensitivity\nmodel and guides their practical usage in global versus targeted sensitivity\nanalysis.

This paper investigates\nthese dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a\nsystem famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct\ncomputational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language\nModels (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate\ntheir behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the \"collaboration\nparadox\": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior\ncollaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)\nprinciples, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this\nparadox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving\nthe system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis\nof two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to\nestablish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution\nprotocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our\nfinal framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,\nevaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices.

Additionally, to address\ninconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot\nlabel space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another.\nMMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities\nto build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH\ngrand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for\nmedical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved\nthe best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for\nthe fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1\nfor the fluid detection task. Conclusion: The quantitative results highlight\nthe effectiveness of our proposed model due to the incorporation of Similarity\nFusion blocks into the network's backbone for supervision and similarity\nknowledge selection, and the use of a one-hot label space to address label\nclass inconsistencies and contradictions.",

KV-separated LSM-trees address write\namplification but introduce significant space amplification, a critical concern\nin cost-sensitive scenarios. Garbage collection (GC) can reduce space\namplification, but existing strategies are often inefficient and fail to\naccount for workload characteristics. Moreover, current key-value (KV)\nseparated LSM-trees overlook the space amplification caused by the index\nLSM-tree. In this paper, we systematically analyze the sources of space\namplification in KV-separated LSM-trees and propose Scavenger+, which achieves\na better performance-space trade-off. Scavenger+ introduces (1) an\nI/O-efficient garbage collection scheme to reduce I/O overhead, (2) a\nspace-aware compaction strategy based on compensated size to mitigate\nindex-induced space amplification, and (3) a dynamic GC scheduler that adapts\nto system load to make better use of CPU and storage resources.

With fluorescence telescope\nmeasurements of $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to\nimprove this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal\nshower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs.\nAlthough there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups\nfrom surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g.\n$X_{\\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study\nof a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass\n($\\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated\nextensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of\nsimulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A =\n1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves\na maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a\nresolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of\nnoise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19,\noutperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\\mu$\nalone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on\nsimulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not\nused in training, showing these features are robust against model choice.

    "abstract": "Solar photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms are easier to estimate than\nfull vector magnetograms since the line-of-sight component (Blos) can be\nobtained from total intensity and circular polarization signals, unlike the\nperpendicular component (Bperp), which depends on harder-to-measure linear\npolarization. Unfortunately, the line of sight component by itself is not\nphysically meaningful, as it is just one component of the underlying vector and\none whose relationship to gravity changes pixel-to-pixel. To produce an\nestimate of the radial component (Br) a common ``correction'' is often applied\nthat assumes the field is radial, which is nearly always false. This paper\ninvestigates recovering full vector field information from Blos by building on\nthe recent SuperSynthIA approach that was originally used with Stokes vectors\nas input for simultaneous inversion and disambiguation. As input, the method\naccepts one or more line-of-sight magnetograms and associated metadata; as\noutput, our method estimates full vector field in heliographic components,\nmeaning that the physically-relevant vector components are returned without\nneed for further disambiguation steps or component transforms. We demonstrate\nthe ability to produce good estimates of the full vector field on unseen\nexamples from both HMI and GONG, including examples that predate the Solar\nDynamics Observatory mission. Our results show that learning is not a\nreplacement for a dedicated vector-field observing facilities, but may serve to\nunlock information from past data and at the very least, provide more accurate\nBr maps from Blos than are created using the simple viewing angle assumption.",

    "abstract": "A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or\nstochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,\nlimiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many\npractical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates\nrobust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges\narising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic\nadaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control\ndomains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted\noptimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling\nprocess of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical\nPolicies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical\ndistribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the\nsampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable\ndiscrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based\noptimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the\nbehavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining\nfully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy\non a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through\nbetter exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform\nstandard Gaussian policies.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in\ntheir application to IoT and automation systems, particularly for facilitating\ndevice management through natural language instructions. However, existing\ncentralized approaches face significant scalability challenges when managing\nand coordinating the collaboration between IoT devices of diverse capabilities\nin large-scale heterogeneous IoT systems. This paper introduces LLMind 2.0, a\ndistributed IoT automation framework that addresses the scalability challenges\nthrough lightweight LLM-empowered device agents via natural language-based\nmachine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Unlike previous LLM-controlled\nautomation systems that rely on a centralized coordinator to generate\ndevice-specific code to be executed on individual devices, LLMind 2.0\ndistributes intelligence across individual devices through lightweight LLMs\nembedded in IoT devices. The central coordinator translates human instructions\ninto simple subtasks described in natural human language, which are then\nprocessed by device-specific agents to generate device-specific code locally at\nthe associated devices. This approach transcends device heterogeneity barriers\nby using natural language as a unified communication medium, enabling seamless\ncollaboration between devices from different manufacturers. The system\nincorporates several key innovations: a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmechanism for accurate subtask-to-API mapping, fine-tuned lightweight LLMs for\nreliable code generation, and a finite state machine-based task execution\nframework. Experimental validation in multi-robot warehouse scenarios and\nreal-world WiFi network deployments demonstrates significant improvements in\nscalability, reliability, and privacy protection compared to the centralized\napproach.",

However, existing defacing\nalgorithms often remove or distort Organs at Risk (OARs) and Planning Target\nVolumes (PTVs) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients, and ignore DICOM-RT\nStructure Set and Dose data. Therefore, we developed and validated a novel\nautomated defacing algorithm that preserves these critical structures while\nremoving identifiable features from HNC CTs and DICOM-RT data.\n  Methods: Eye contours were used as landmarks to automate the removal of CT\npixels above the inferior-most eye slice and anterior to the eye midpoint.\nPixels within PTVs were retained if they intersected with the removed region.\nThe body contour and dose map were reshaped to reflect the defaced image. We\nvalidated our approach on 829 HNC CTs from 622 patients. Privacy protection was\nevaluated by applying the FaceNet512 facial recognition algorithm before and\nafter defacing on 3D-rendered CT pairs from 70 patients. Research utility was\nassessed by examining the impact of defacing on autocontouring performance\nusing LimbusAI and analyzing PTV locations relative to the defaced regions.\n  Results: Before defacing, FaceNet512 matched 97% of patients' CTs. After\ndefacing, this rate dropped to 4%. LimbusAI effectively autocontoured organs in\nthe defaced CTs, with perfect Dice scores of 1 for OARs below the defaced\nregion, and excellent scores exceeding 0.95 for OARs on the same slices as the\ncrop. We found that 86% of PTVs were entirely below the cropped region, 9.1%\nwere on the same slice as the crop without overlap, and only 4.9% extended into\nthe cropped area.\n  Conclusions: We developed a novel defacing algorithm that anonymizes HNC CT\nscans and related DICOM-RT data while preserving essential structures, enabling\nthe sharing of HNC imaging datasets for Big Data and AI.",

They typically rely on\npre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics\nintegration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes\nor unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts\na 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,\nenabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We\nfirst establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction\nand probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically\nplausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics\nprediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nits simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation\nSampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the\ncomplex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the\ntraining, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,\nannotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates\nhigh-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute.

MAI systems\nencode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling\ncontext-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive\nsystems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent\nmanifolds, guided by persistent topological memory.

Furthermore, we\nestablish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:\nwhereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes\nbackward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient\ninference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI.

NeuSee system is adversarially trained\nend-to-end on 100K unique images to suppress the peak laser irradiance as high\nas $10^6$ times the sensor saturation threshold $I_{\\textrm{sat}}$, the point\nat which camera sensors may experience damage without the DOE. Our system\nleverages heterogeneous data and model parallelism for distributed computing,\nintegrating hyperspectral information and multiple neural networks for\nrealistic simulation and image restoration. NeuSee takes into account\nopen-world scenes with dynamically varying laser wavelengths, intensities, and\npositions, as well as lens flare effects, unknown ambient lighting conditions,\nand sensor noises. It outperforms other learned DOEs, achieving full-spectrum\nimaging and laser suppression for the first time, with a 10.1\\% improvement in\nrestored image quality.",

    "abstract": "Integer programming (IP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem\nthat is widely used to represent a diverse set of real-world problems spanning\nmultiple fields, such as finance, engineering, logistics, and operations\nresearch. It is a hard problem to solve using classical algorithms, as its\ncomplexity increases exponentially with problem size. Most quantum algorithms\nfor solving IP are highly resource inefficient because they encode integers\ninto qubits. In [1], the issue of resource inefficiency was addressed by\nmapping integer variables to qudits. However, [1] has limited practical value\ndue to a lack of scalability to multiple qudits to encode larger problems. In\nthis work, by extending upon the ideas of [1], a circuit-based scalable quantum\nalgorithm is presented using multiple interacting qudits for which we show a\nquantum speed-up. The quantum algorithm consists of a distillation function\nthat efficiently separates the feasible from the infeasible regions, a\nphase-amplitude encoding for the cost function, and a quantum phase estimation\ncoupled with a multi-controlled single-qubit rotation for optimization. We\nprove that the optimal solution has the maximum probability of being measured\nin our algorithm. The time complexity for the quantum algorithm is shown to be\n$O(d^{n/2} + m\\cdot n^2\\cdot \\log{d} + n/\\epsilon_{QPE})$ for a problem with\nthe number of variables $n$ taking $d$ integer values, satisfying $m$\nconstraints with a precision of $\\epsilon_{QPE}$.

Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can\nprovide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating\nuncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have\noffered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their\nreliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication\noutages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that\nenables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution\nintegrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,\ncompressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.\nMoreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for\noptimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy\nconsumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer\ndata, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical\nmeasurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ\nper inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly\nless energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE\n0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to\nalign model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low\nenergy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy.

    "abstract": "The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled\nhigh-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning\n(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among\nthem, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its\nconsistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice\ndue to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both\ntraining and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply\napplying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we\nrevisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow\nQ-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action\ngeneration during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary\nmodels, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates\nDQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While\nconventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step\ngeneration, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates\ndirect, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for\nmulti-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster\nand more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL\nbenchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based\nbaselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time\ncompared to DQL.",

Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources\nsuch as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns\nhave intensified these smog events.

Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and\nsynthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera\nsensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture\nchallenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL\nmethods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small\namount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual\ntraining on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to\nweak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse\ntasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing\ngeneralized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the\ntasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of\nthree steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the\ndomain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python\nprogram, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one\nstrategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the\nstrategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect\ngeneralized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in\nthe form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence\nallowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the\ngeneralized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase\nwith a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the\nobserved plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to\nproduce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on\n17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and\nnever deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,\nour best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the\nrespective instance generator.",

However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov\nDecision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world\nscenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such\nas multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a\npromising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence\nmodeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations\nstill remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,\nSymbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a\nneuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable\nmulti-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic\nplanner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic\nsubgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer\n(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot\nmanipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,\nand generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.\nWe evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including\nzero-shot and few-shot scenarios.

The setting is closely related to the Relative Dynamical\nManin-Mumford Conjecture, recently proposed by DeMarco and Mavraki, which\nconcerns a parametrized family of endomorphisms and varieties. Our result\nproves a weaker version of the conjecture where the endomorphism is a regular\npolynomial endomorphism on $\\mathbb{P}^2$ that remains fixed in the family, and\nthe family of curves contains a dense set of periodic curves. This result can\nalso be viewed as a Dynamical Manin-Mumford type statement on the moduli space\nof divisors, and it proves a special case of the Dynamical Manin-Mumford\nConjecture with a stronger assumption.\n  Moreover, our result specifically implies a uniform degree stabilization\nstatement for a generic set of curves in a family under the transformation of a\nregular polynomial endomorphism. We demonstrate that a more general degree\nstabilization statement for a family of positive dimension subvarieties in\n$\\mathbb{P}^K$ under the transformation of a family of endomorphisms is\npredicted by the Relative Dynamical Manin-Mumford Conjecture.

The\nseparating variety $\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is the subvariety of $V^2$ consisting of\npairs of points indistinguishable by invariant polynomials in $k[V]^G$. Its\ngeometry places restrictions on the existence of small separating sets, i.e.\nsets of invariants which distinguish the same points as the full algebra of\ninvariants. The purpose of this article is to study the separating variety in\nthe important special case where $G=\\mathrm{GL}_p(\\mathbb{C})$ acts on the set\n$V$ of $n$-tuples of $p \\times p$ matrices by simultaneous conjugation. We\ndefine a purely combinatorial poset, $\\mathcal{P}_{p,n}$, whose maximal\nelements are in 1-1 correspondence with the irreducible components of\n$\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$. We show that $\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$ is a variety of dimension\n$(n+1)p^2-1$, and determine its subdimension for all $n$ and $p$. In particular\nwe show the subdimension is $(n+1)p^2-p$ if $n \\geq 3$, or $n \\geq 2$ and $p\n\\geq 4$. In the case $n \\geq 3$, we give a formula for the number of components\nof given codimension in $\\mathcal{S}_{G,V}$.

To investigate the hydrogenation of these methylated PAHs,\nthe simplest, toluene ($\\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_5}$), was exposed to H-atoms. This\ndemonstrated how the presence of a methyl group changes the reactivity towards\natomic hydrogen as compared to benzene and other PAHs and how this may alter\nits chemistry in the ISM. Toluene was deposited onto a graphite surface in an\nultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber and then exposed to a H-atom beam. Temperature\nprogrammed desorption (TPD) measurements were used to investigate the reaction\nbetween H-atoms and toluene and the masses of hydrogenation products were\nmeasured with a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). H-atom exposure of toluene\nleads to superhydrogenation of toluene and the formation of methyl-cyclohexane\n($\\mathrm{CH_3C_6H_{11}}$) at long exposure times. The initial cross-section of\nH-addition is lower than that of other PAHs. Methyl-cyclohexane can be further\nhydrogenated, leading to the detachment of the methyl group and production of\ncyclohexane ($\\mathrm{C_6H_{12}}$) and methane ($\\mathrm{CH_4}$). Toluene may\nbe fully hydrogenated through its interaction with H-atoms, although it has a\nsmaller initial cross-section for H-atom addition compared to other PAHs. This\nlikely reflects it having a smaller geometric cross-section and the low\nflexibility of the benzene ring when undergoing sp$^3$ hybridization.

    "abstract": "WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is\nparticularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared\nby multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between\nparallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program\nregions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by\na remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number\nof accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention.\nBased on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory\nreferences that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region.\nAfterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the\nnumber of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks.\nWe demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be\nobtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing\nmethods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET\nestimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing\ncomputation overhead.",

    "abstract": "Conventional barocaloric materials typically exhibit limited operating\ntemperature ranges. In contrast, KPF$_6$ has recently been reported to achieve\nan exceptional all-temperature barocaloric effect (BCE) via pressure-driven\nphase transitions. Here, we elucidate the atomistic mechanisms underlying the\nphase transitions through first-principles calculations and machine-learning\npotential accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. We identify four distinct\nphases: the room-temperature cubic (C) plastic crystal characterized by strong\nfluorine orientational disorder (FOD) and anharmonicity, the\nintermediate-temperature monoclinic (M-II) phase with decreasing FOD, the\nlow-temperature monoclinic (M-I) phase with suppressed FOD, and the fully\nordered rhombohedral (R) phase under pressure. Phonon calculations confirm the\ndynamic stability of the M-II, M-I, and R phases at 0 K, whereas the C phase\nrequires thermal fluctuations for stabilization. Under pressure, all the C,\nM-II, and M-I phases transform to the R phase, which are driven by cooperative\nPF$_6$ octahedral rotations coupled with lattice modulations. These\npressure-induced phase transitions result in persistent isothermal entropy\nchanges across a wide temperature range, thereby explaining the experimentally\nobserved all-temperature BCE in this material. Hybrid functional calculations\nreveal wide-bandgap insulating behavior across all phases. This work deciphers\nthe interplay between FOD, anharmonicity, and phase transitions in KPF$_6$,\nproviding important insights for the design of BCE materials with broad\noperational temperature spans.",

The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland\n(RNO-G) aims to detect sporadic neutrino interactions in the Greenlandic ice\nsheet by means of electromagnetic signals in the radio frequency range, induced\nby the produced charged secondary particles. The low incoming neutrino flux\nforces the detector to set a low trigger threshold, leading to the measured\ndata being overwhelmed by thermal noise fluctuations.

A\nmulti-stage graph consists of nodes partitioned into $K$ disjoint sets (stages)\nstructured as a sequence of weighted bipartite graphs formed across adjacent\nstages. The goal is to assign node-disjoint paths to $n$ agents starting from\nthe first stage and ending in the last stage. We show that an efficient\nassignment that minimizes the overall sum of costs of all the agents' paths may\nbe highly unfair and lead to significant cost disparities (envy) among the\nagents. We further show that finding an envy-minimizing assignment on a\nmulti-stage graph is NP-hard. We propose the C-Balance algorithm, which\nguarantees envy that is bounded by $2M$ in the case of two agents, where $M$ is\nthe maximum edge weight. We demonstrate the algorithm's tightness by presenting\nan instance where the envy is $2M$. We further show that the cost of fairness\n($CoF$), defined as the ratio of the cost of the assignment given by the fair\nalgorithm to that of the minimum cost assignment, is bounded by $2$ for\nC-Balance. We then extend this approach to $n$ agents by proposing the\nDC-Balance algorithm that makes iterative calls to C-Balance. We show the\nconvergence of DC-Balance, resulting in envy that is arbitrarily close to $2M$.\nWe derive $CoF$ bounds for DC-Balance and provide insights about its dependency\non the instance-specific parameters and the desired degree of envy.

Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address\nsuch vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected\nmalicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.\nHowever, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,\napplying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging\nbecause their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This\nwork presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently\nmitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within\nthe attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on\nclients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify\nwhich connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due\nto overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this\nby carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge\nthe most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while\npreserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial\nthreat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full\nknowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,\nrobustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and\nNon-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it\nwith state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces\nmalicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a\nmodel retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data.

In the present article, we prove that this\nconvergence further extends to the critical case $\\beta = 2$, which corresponds\nto the limiting coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the Circular\nUnitary Ensemble.

However, quantifying opioid-sparing\neffects is challenging; even coming up with a policy-relevant estimand requires\ncare. We propose defining these effects in terms of add-on regimes. An add-on\nregime assigns NSAIDs over time based on the opioid and NSAID treatments a\npatient would naturally take without any intervention. The regime uses the\nphysician's decision to administer opioids as a clinically meaningful, and\npractically feasible, indication for NSAID administration. In contrast, static\nregimes assign NSAIDs at predefined time points, regardless of clinical\ncontext. When opioids are not administered, the add-on regime requires no\nintervention, thereby preserving the natural level of NSAIDs. This differs from\nconventional dynamic regimes, which define treatment decisions at every time\npoint during the treatment period. We identify the effect of add-on regimes\nunder assumptions that are easier to assess than those used in existing\nmethods. Finally, we apply the methods to estimate opioid-sparing effects of\nNSAIDs in a cohort of Norwegian trauma patients using national registry data.",

Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by\nrandomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a\nprobabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a\nparadigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population\nimpinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of\nintegrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent\nplasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We\nfirst analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single\nsynapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump\nprocess to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging\nnew analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations\nbetween pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations\nseen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this\nmicrodynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations\nare trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses\nconnecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By\nmapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the\nsingle-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural\nand synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation\nand the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case\nof sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which\nare strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are\nignored.

To\naddress these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce\nsearch framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and\ntheir combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a\nflexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive\nfusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations\nwhile handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training\nstrategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),\ncohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and\nadaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated\nmultimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search\nevaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently\noutperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning\nor zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial\nimprovements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image\nretrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to\nlarger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy\nUniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search\nscenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\\%) and\nRevenue (+8.33\\%).

To address this, we propose a movable antenna\n(MA)-aided CF-ISAC system that mitigates distortion and enhances robustness.\nThe PAs nonlinearities are modeled by a third-order memoryless polynomial,\nwhere the third-order distortion coefficients (3RDCs) vary across access points\n(APs) due to hardware differences, aging, and environmental conditions. We\ndesign a distributed distortion-aware worst-case robust optimization framework\nthat explicitly incorporates uncertainty in 3RDCs. First, we analyze the\nworst-case impact of PA distortion on both the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)\nand communication rate. Then, to address the resulting non-convexity, we apply\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) for estimating the 3RDCs.

    "abstract": "Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve\ncomputational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:\none-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and\niterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for\npotentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has\nhistorically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather\nthan rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and\ncomprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,\nbenchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying\ndifferent pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has\nspecific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning\nratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on\nthese findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid\napproach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,\nproviding valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy\ntailored to their goals and constraints.

Solar Cycle 24\nexhibited lower sunspot numbers compared to Solar Cycle 23, along with a\ndecrease in the heliospheric magnetic pressure. Consequently, a higher\nfrequency of weak CMEs was observed during Solar Cycle 24. Forecasting CMEs is\nvital, and various methods, primarily involving the study of the global\nmagnetic parameters using datasets like Space-weather Helioseismic and Magnetic\nImager Active Region Patches (SHARP), have been employed in earlier works. In\nthis study, we perform numerical simulations of CMEs within a\nmagnetohydrodynamics framework using Message Passing Interface - Adaptive Mesh\nRefinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC) in 2.5 dimensions. By\nemploying the breakout model for CME initiation, we introduce a multipolar\nmagnetic field configuration within a background bipolar magnetic field,\ninducing shear to trigger the CME eruption. Our investigation focuses on\nunderstanding the impact of the background global magnetic field on CME\neruptions. Furthermore, we analyze the evolution of various global magnetic\nparameters in distinct scenarios (failed eruption, single eruption, multiple\neruptions) resulting from varying amounts of helicity injection in the form of\nshear at the base of the magnetic arcade system. Our findings reveal that an\nincrease in the strength of the background poloidal magnetic field constrains\nCME eruptions.

We aim to find a finite set of defining equations for matroid\nvarieties and an irreducible decomposition for circuit varieties.\n  To solve the former problem, we use some classical techniques from algebraic\ngeometry, including the Grassmann-Cayley algebra and the liftability technique.\nFrom this, we can respectively derive the Grassmann-Cayley ideal, introduced by\nSidman, Traves and Wheeler, and the lifting ideal, introduced by Liwski,\nMohammadi, Clarke and Masiero. Since the circuit ideal, the Grassmann-Cayley\nideal and the lifting ideal are contained in the matroid ideal and explicit\ngenerators are known for them, it is a natural question to identify point-line\nconfigurations for which a generating set of the matroid ideal is formed by the\ncircuit polynomials, Grassmann-Cayley polynomials and lifting polynomials. For\nthese point-line configurations, we obtain an explicit and finite description\nof the matroid variety. In this thesis, we prove that the matroid ideal of\ncactus configurations, the Pascal configuration and the Pappus configuration\ncan be generated by these three types of polynomials.\n  To find an irreducible decomposition for the circuit varieties of point-line\nconfigurations, we use the decomposition strategy developed by Clarke, Grace,\nMohammadi and Motwani.

This paper treats IoT deployments in which IoT devices (IoTDs)\nrely solely on EH to sense and transmit information about events/alarms to a\nbase station (BS). The objective is to effectively manage the duty cycling of\nthe IoTDs to prolong battery life and maximize the relevant data sent to the\nBS. The BS can also wake up specific IoTDs if extra information about an event\nis needed upon initial detection. We propose a K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based\nduty cycling management to optimize energy efficiency and detection accuracy by\nconsidering spatial correlations among IoTDs' activity and their EH process. We\nevaluate machine learning approaches, including reinforcement learning (RL) and\ndecision transformers (DT), to maximize information captured from events while\nmanaging energy consumption. Significant improvements over the state-ofthe-art\napproaches are obtained in terms of energy saving by all three proposals, KNN,\nRL, and DT.

However, to fully\ncapitalize on the potential of CF-ISAC, accurate time synchronization (TS)\nbetween access points (APs) is critical. Due to the limitations of current\nsynchronization technologies, TS errors have become a significant challenge in\nthe development of the CF-ISAC system. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCF-ISAC architecture based on movable antennas (MAs), which exploits spatial\ndiversity to enhance communication rates, maintain sensing accuracy, and reduce\nthe impact of TS errors. We formulate a worst-case sensing accuracy\noptimization problem for TS errors to address this challenge, deriving the\nworst-case Cram\\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Subsequently, we develop a joint\noptimization framework for AP beamforming and MA positions to satisfy\ncommunication rate constraints while improving sensing accuracy. A robust\noptimization framework is designed for the highly complex and non-convex\nproblem. Specifically, we employ manifold optimization (MO) to solve the\nworst-case sensing accuracy optimization problem. Then, we propose an\nMA-enabled meta-reinforcement learning (MA-MetaRL) to design optimization\nvariables while satisfying constraints on MA positions, communication rate, and\ntransmit power, thereby improving sensing accuracy. The simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed robust optimization algorithm significantly\nimproves the accuracy of the detection and is strong against TS errors.\nMoreover, compared to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA) technologies,\nthe proposed MA-aided CF-ISAC architecture achieves higher system capacity,\nthus validating its effectiveness.",

Practical applications have driven the development of various\nautomatic evaluation metrics (AEM), designed to compare the model output with\nhuman-written references, generating a score which approximates human judgment.\nOver time, AEMs have evolved from simple lexical comparisons, to semantic\nsimilarity models and, more recently, to LLM-based evaluators.

This\npaper aims to show this by conducting a thorough examination of the\nmethodologies of existing metrics, their documented strengths and limitations,\nvalidation methods, and correlations with human judgment. We identify several\nkey challenges: metrics often capture only specific aspects of text quality,\ntheir effectiveness varies by task and dataset, validation practices remain\nunstructured, and correlations with human judgment are inconsistent.\nImportantly, we find that these challenges persist in the most recent type of\nmetric, LLM-as-a-Judge, as well as in the evaluation of Retrieval Augmented\nGeneration (RAG), an increasingly relevant task in academia and industry.

    "abstract": "Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo\nTheories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing\ninstantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,\nconflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This\npaper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from\nthese techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples\nfrom a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate\nnew, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations\nbut also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,\naiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.",

    "abstract": "A motion of a mechanism is a curve in its configuration space (c-space).\nSingularities of the c-space are kinematic singularities of the mechanism. Any\nmobility analysis of a particular mechanism amounts to investigating the\nc-space geometry at a given configuration. A higher-order analysis is necessary\nto determine the finite mobility. To this end, past research lead to approaches\nusing higher-order time derivatives of loop closure constraints assuming\n(implicitly) that all possible motions are smooth. This continuity assumption\nlimits the generality of these methods. In this paper an approach to the\nhigher-order local mobility analysis of lower pair multi-loop linkages is\npresented. This is based on a higher-order Taylor series expansion of the\ngeometric constraint mapping, for which a recursive algebraic expression in\nterms of joint screws is presented. An exhaustive local analysis includes\nanalysis of the set of constraint singularities (configurations where the\nconstraint Jacobian has certain corank). A local approximation of the set of\nconfigurations with certain rank is presented, along with an explicit\nexpression for the differentials of Jacobian minors in terms of instantaneous\njoint screws. The c-space and the set of points of certain corank are therewith\nlocally approximated by an algebraic variety determined algebraically from the\nmechanism's screw system. Results are shown for a simple planar 4-bar linkage,\nwhich exhibits a bifurcation singularity, and for a planar three-loop linkage\nexhibiting a cusp in c-space. The latter cannot be treated by the higher-order\nlocal analysis methods proposed in the literature.",

However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes\nin videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant\nviewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges\ninclude generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original\nvideo, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into\nrealistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a\nsketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local\nmanipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the\nchallenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate\nedited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining\nframes of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise\ngeometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also\nsupported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and\nmanipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a\ndense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the\ninput video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth\nmaps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them\neffectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited\ncontent with the original video while preserving the features of unedited\nregions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video\ndiffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:\nhttp://http://geometrylearning.com/Sketch3DVE/",

On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice\nscore of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and\nSwin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation\nquality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice\nscore and -31% in CIDEr.

Existing methods have attempted to infer the\nintrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two\nmajor challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive\npriors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other\nmodels intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited\ninterpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we\npropose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable\nexpressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,\nwe introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where\nLLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise\nconstitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially\nreduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a\nvision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual\nsimulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law\nand the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level\nevolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from\nvisual observations.

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions.

However, current agentic ecosystems remain\nfragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for\nAgentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an\nopen architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still\nfaces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value\nmeasurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from\ninherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale,\nheterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these\nchallenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic\nWeb (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not\nonly offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has\nthe potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data\nownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and\nthe monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the\nBetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap,\noutlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration\nand autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing\nproducts and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives.\nUltimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay\nthe foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized\ndigital ecosystem.

These blast holes need to\nbe inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and\nproperties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in\nmaterial handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow\nand expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological\nproperties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for\nthe development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - \"DIPPeR\". In\nthis paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a\nrobust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based\nnavigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first\nprocesses point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting\nthe cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D\ncone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D\ndomain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.\nWe then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while\nsuppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for\ndown-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable\nautonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection\nparameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity\nand hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This\nallows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal\npoint.

Under the dominant energy condition, we show that along the leaves of\nthe foliation, the Hawking energy is positive and converges to the ADM energy\nin the large-sphere limit; moreover, subject to an explicit integral\nconstraint, it is monotone along the foliation. Under weaker assumptions we\nconstruct an on-center family of Hawking surfaces that, while not necessarily a\nfoliation, still enjoys positivity and the large-sphere limit. Finally, we\nobtain a rigidity statement and verify that our hypotheses hold in a broad\nclass of data, initial data sets with harmonic or York asymptotics, thereby\ndemonstrating the robustness of Hawking surfaces as a quasi-local energy tool\nin dynamical spacetimes.",

In this work, we apply the Hartle-Thorne spacetimes to study the\nfrequencies of the precession for both geodesic and non-geodesic (fluid) flows.\nWe build on previous findings on the effect of the NS quadrupole moment, which\nrevealed the importance of the interplay between the relativistic and classical\nprecession. Because of this interplay, the widely used Lense-Thirring metric,\nlinear in the NS angular momentum, is insufficient to calculate the behaviour\nof the precession frequency across an astrophysically relevant range of NS\nangular momentum values. We find that even for a moderately oblate NSs, the\ndependencies of the precession frequency on the NS angular momentum at radii\nwithin the innermost accretion region have maxima that occur at relatively low\nvalues of the NS angular momentum. We conclude that very different groups of\naccreting NSs, slow and fast rotators, can display the same precession\nfrequencies. This may explain the lack of evidence for a correlation between\nthe frequencies of the observed low-frequency quasiperiodic oscillations and\nthe NS spin.

This obstacle arises from the way models\ninherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in\nspurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,\ncurrent methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required\nto isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end\nEnergy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\\textbf{ERIS}) framework\nto enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that\neffective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also\nsemantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key\nmechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an\nenergy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance\nfor the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a\nweight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between\ndomain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their\ninterference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances\nrobustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that\nERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy\nacross four benchmarks.",

Current\ndetectors for Machine-Generated Text (MGT) perform well when they are trained\nand tested in the same domain but generalize poorly to unseen domains, due to\ndomain shift between data from different sources. In this work, we propose\nMGT-Prism, an MGT detection method from the perspective of the frequency domain\nfor better domain generalization. Our key insight stems from analyzing text\nrepresentations in the frequency domain, where we observe consistent spectral\npatterns across diverse domains, while significant discrepancies in magnitude\nemerge between MGT and human-written texts (HWTs). The observation initiates\nthe design of a low frequency domain filtering module for filtering out the\ndocument-level features that are sensitive to domain shift, and a dynamic\nspectrum alignment strategy to extract the task-specific and domain-invariant\nfeatures for improving the detector's performance in domain generalization.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that MGT-Prism outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines by an average of 0.90% in accuracy and 0.92% in F1 score on 11 test\ndatasets across three domain-generalization scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Initial conditions in cosmological $N$-body simulations are typically\ngenerated by displacing particles from a regular cubic lattice using a\ncorrelated field derived from the linear power spectrum, often via the\nZel'dovich approximation. While this procedure reproduces the target two-point\nstatistics (e.g., the power spectrum or correlation function), it introduces\nsubtle anisotropies due to the underlying lattice structure. These\nanisotropies, invisible to angle-averaged diagnostics, become evident through\ndirectional measures such as the Angular Distribution of Pairwise Distances.\nAnalyzing two Cold Dark Matter simulations with varying resolutions, initial\nredshifts, and box sizes, we show that these anisotropies are not erased but\nare amplified by gravitational evolution. They seed filamentary structures that\npersist into the linear regime, remaining visible even at redshift $z = 0$. Our\nfindings demonstrate that such features are numerical artifacts -- emerging\nfrom the anisotropic coupling between the displacement field and the lattice --\nnot genuine predictions of an isotropic cosmological model.

This dissertation introduces a suite of novel\nprobes based on event-by-event multi-particle correlations allowing us to work\nbackward from final-state particles to constrain the collective evolution,\ntransport properties, and initial conditions of the QGP. The studies utilize\n$^{208}\\mathrm{Pb}+{}^{208}\\mathrm{Pb}$ and\n$^{129}\\mathrm{Xe}+{}^{129}\\mathrm{Xe}$ collisions recorded by ATLAS detector\nat the LHC. First, evidence for the collective nature of the QGP's radial\nexpansion is provided using a transverse momentum\n($p_{\\mathrm{T}}$)-differential observable, $v_0(p_{\\mathrm{T}})$. This\nobservable exhibits genuine long-range correlations and factorizes into a\nsingle-particle property. Its strong sensitivity to bulk viscosity providing\nmore direct constraints on this medium property than traditional measures.\nSecond, the sources of event-wise fluctuations in radial flow within the\ninitial state are disentangled by analyzing higher moments of the event-wise\nmean-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ distribution. The average of this distribution is shown\nto constrain the speed of sound in the QGP. Finally, nuclear deformations,\nwhich control overlap area geometry, are constrained by comparing correlations\nbetween the anisotropic flow, $v_{n}$ and mean-$p_{\\mathrm{T}}$ in spherical\nPb+Pb and deformed Xe+Xe collisions. This comparison provides the first\nexperimental evidence for triaxial deformation in $^{129}$Xe.

By leveraging advances in\ndata-driven sparse regression techniques, we develop the Multi-Dimensional\nBreakage Population Balance Equation Identification (mPBE ID) algorithm for\ndiscovering multi-dimensional breakage population balance equations (mPBEs)\ndirectly from data. Our mPBE-ID enables tractable identification of mPBEs by\nincorporating several key strategies, namely, a breakage-informed constrained\nsparse regression, targeted candidate library functions construction via\ninsights from Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and robust handling of\nnoisy/limited data through ensembling (bagging/bragging). Notably, we\ndemonstrate how the DMD is indispensable for distilling dominant breakage\ndynamics which can then be used to facilitate the systematic inclusion of\ncandidate library terms. We showcase the ability of the mPBE-ID to discover\ndifferent forms of mPBE (including those with discontinuous stoichiometric\nkernels) even when tested against noisy and limited data.

This method should ease the\nclinical workflow of preoperative planning.\n  Methods: Manual segmentation was performed on hepatobiliary phase MRI scans\nfrom 90 consecutive patients who underwent liver surgery between January 2020\nand October 2023. A deep learning network (nnU-Net v1) was trained on 72\npatients with an extra focus on thin structures and topography preservation.\nPerformance was evaluated on an 18-patient test set by comparing automated and\nmanual segmentations using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Following\nclinical integration, 10 segmentations (assessment dataset) were generated\nusing the network and manually refined for clinical use to quantify required\nadjustments using DSC.\n  Results: In the test set, DSCs were 0.97+/-0.01 for liver parenchyma,\n0.80+/-0.04 for hepatic vein, 0.79+/-0.07 for biliary tree, 0.77+/-0.17 for\ntumors, and 0.74+/-0.06 for portal vein. Average tumor detection rate was\n76.6+/-24.1%, with a median of one false-positive per patient. The assessment\ndataset showed minor adjustments were required for clinical use of the 3D\nmodels, with high DSCs for parenchyma (1.00+/-0.00), portal vein (0.98+/-0.01)\nand hepatic vein (0.95+/-0.07). Tumor segmentation exhibited greater\nvariability (DSC 0.80+/-0.27). During prospective clinical use, the model\ndetected three additional tumors initially missed by radiologists.\n  Conclusions: The proposed nnU-Net-based segmentation method enables accurate\nand automated delineation of hepatic anatomy. This enables 3D planning to be\napplied efficiently as a standard-of-care for every patient undergoing liver\nsurgery.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language\nmodels, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:\nDepth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances\nconsumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and\nreveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights\nsamples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances\nthat are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth\nneglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which\nre-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby\nincreasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,\nnaively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts\nPass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra\ninference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of\nexploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training\ndata can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch\nsize and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over\nmultiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.\nLarge-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued\nexploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which\naugments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K\nand Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across\ndepth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the\nreasoning power of RLVR.",

While recent advancements in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited\nby their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing\nto robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we\npropose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)\nframework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates\nin two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and\nadversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,\nwe use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for\ncapturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical\ndepartment categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the\nsubsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert\nagents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,\nwe employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence\nscores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial\nvalidation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on\nthree public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC\noutperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior\ndiagnostic performance.

To counter such attacks, the\nresearch community and practitioners have proposed a range of static and\ndynamic mechanisms, including process- and language-level sandboxing,\npermission systems, and taint tracking. Drawing on valuable insight from these\nworks, this paper studies a runtime protection mechanism for (the supply chain\nof) Node.js applications with the ambitious goals of compatibility, automation,\nminimal overhead, and policy conciseness.\n  Specifically, we design, implement and evaluate NodeShield, a protection\nmechanism for Node.js that enforces an application's dependency hierarchy and\ncontrols access to system resources at runtime. We leverage the up-and-coming\nSBOM standard as the source of truth for the dependency hierarchy of the\napplication, thus preventing components from stealthily abusing undeclared\ncomponents. We propose to enhance the SBOM with a notion of capabilities that\nrepresents a set of related system resources a component may access. Our\nproposed SBOM extension, the Capability Bill of Materials or CBOM, records the\nrequired capabilities of each component, providing valuable insight into the\npotential privileged behavior. NodeShield enforces the SBOM and CBOM at runtime\nvia code outlining (as opposed to inlining) with no modifications to the\noriginal code or Node.js runtime, thus preventing unexpected, potentially\nmalicious behavior. Our evaluation shows that NodeShield can prevent over 98%\nout of 67 known supply chain attacks while incurring minimal overhead on\nservers at less than 1ms per request.

This tendency is reinforced\nby preference-based alignment techniques that optimize for user satisfaction\nbut can undermine truthfulness. While relatively benign in casual dialogue,\nsycophancy poses serious risks in high-stakes settings such as scientific\nquestion answering (QA), where model outputs may shape collaborative reasoning,\ndecision-making, and knowledge formation. Despite its importance, this\nphenomenon remains underexamined in factual QA contexts.

The framework incorporates\nadversarial prompting setups and targeted metrics, such as misleading\nresistance and sycophancy resistance, that capture a model's ability to\nmaintain factual consistency under misleading cues. Systematic evaluations\nacross open-source and proprietary models reveal pervasive sycophantic\ntendencies, driven more by alignment strategy than by model size. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Pressure-Tune, a lightweight post-training method that\nfine-tunes models on synthetic adversarial dialogues paired with\nchain-of-thought rationales.

    "abstract": "White light emitting diodes (LEDs) have become the most widely used lighting\ndevices due to their high luminous efficiency, environmental friendliness, long\nlifespan, and energy-saving advantages. Currently, the production of white\nlight LEDs faces challenges such as a lack of cyan light emission, which\nresults in a low color rendering index (Ra), as well as issues related to poor\nthermal stability of the luminescent materials and difficulties in synthesis.\nThis paper employs a high-temperature solid-state method and cation\nsubstitution strategy to prepare a broadband blue phosphor Ca0.87-xSrxAl2Si2O8:\n0.13Eu2+ (x=0-0.87) with a feldspar structure. By varying the concentration of\nx, phase transitions are achieved, leading to the formation of two luminescent\ncenters. The luminescence intensity of Ca0.87Al2Si2O8:0.13Eu2+ is enhanced by 2\ntimes, and the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) increases by 24.8%. The\ninternal quantum efficiency of Ca0.27Sr0.60Al2Si2O8:0.13Eu2+ reaches as high as\n84.1%. The strongest emission peak is observed when the concentration of Sr2+\nreaches 0.6 mol, with a full width at half maximum of 91 nm. The experimental\nvalue of the optical band gap of the matrix is 5.74 eV, indicating that the\nluminescence intensity of the sample Ca0.27Sr0.60Al2Si2O8:0.13Eu2+ at\n150{\\deg}C is 92.2% of that at room temperature. Ca0.27Sr0.60Al2Si2O8:0.13Eu2+\nand commercial red phosphor (Ca,Sr)AlSiN3:Eu2+, as well as commercial green\nphosphor (Sr,Ba)2SiO4:Eu2+, have been successfully packaged into white light\nLED devices using a 365nm near-ultraviolet chip. The color rendering index (Ra)\nof this white light LED device is 94.3, with a color coordinate of (0.4094,\n0.4167) and a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 3611.4K.",

    "abstract": "Recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI),\nanalyzed together with supernova observations and CMB measurements, provide\nstatistically significant indications (at the 2-5$\\sigma$ level) of a\ntime-varying dark energy component alongwith a possible phantom-to-quintessence\ntransition in the recent past. In this letter, we investigate the evolution of\ndark energy using a model-independent cosmographic approach and explore the\npossibility of phantom barrier crossing. By mapping the differential equation\ndefining jerk parameter into an anharmonic oscillator, we derive an analytical\nexpression for the dark energy equation of state (EoS), which, remarkably,\ndepends on a single parameter. Using DESI-DR2 BAO data, supernova data, and a\ncompressed Planck likelihood, we constrain the cosmological parameters and find\ndeviations from a cosmological constant at late times. Unlike the CPL\nparametrization, our results show no phantom barrier crossing, highlighting the\npower of kinematic reconstructions in probing the nature of dark energy.\nFurthermore, using a dynamical system approach, we demonstrate that $w_{DE}=-1$\nacts as a bifurcation point with degenerate stable fixed points and therefore\nprevents solutions from crossing this barrier from either side.",

    "abstract": "Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying\nsecurity flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,\ncurrent methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target\ntext or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics\ninto a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering\nfine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its\nbackground. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a\ncritical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in\nVLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline\nwithin VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over\nadversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens\nrather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the\nQ-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,\nwithout LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and\ntransferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query\nAlignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more\ncontrolled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show\nthat our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both\nstandard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual\nquestion-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA\nsuccessfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and\nOpenAI GPT.",

    "abstract": "The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the\ntopological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary.\nRecently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating\nrealistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting\nvector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then\nconverting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and\nredundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector\ndata, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for\nboundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector\nspace. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that\nintegrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization\ntrajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This\nenables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of\nthe predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout\ndesign, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative\ncomparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual\nstudies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nDiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor\nplans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability\nto users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground\ntruths.",

This study aims to examine whether the seismic shaking induced\nby the impact could account for the observed spatial variations in space\nweathering and further constrain the internal structure of Itokawa. Assuming\nthat the Kamoi crater was formed by a recent impact, we conducted\nthree-dimensional seismic wave propagation simulations and applied a simplified\nlandslide model to estimate surface accelerations and boulder displacements.\nOur results show that even a low-energy case (1 % of the nominal seismic\nenergy) produces surface accelerations sufficient to destabilize the surface\nmaterials. The simulated boulder displacements are consistent with the observed\ndistribution of space weathering degrees even on the opposite hemisphere. We\nestimate the seismic diffusivity to be 1000-2000 m2 s-1 and the seismic\nefficiency to be in the range of 5.0 x 10-8 to 5.0 x 10-7, implying that\nItokawa's interior contains blocks tens of meters across and acts as a strongly\nscattering medium.",

Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to\nrealize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus\non utilizing nanodiamonds (NDs) as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND\ntogether with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time.\nThere is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting\nthis technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes) to highlight our\nplans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor,\nhoping this will support this growing community. Here, we present a theoretical\nstudy concerning the impact of rotations of the ND on the interferometric\ncontrast. We have previously shown that for a first-generation Stern-Gerlach\ninterferometer with an ND composed of 10^7 atoms, it is sufficient to cool the\ncenter of mass to milli-Kelvin temperatures. In this work, we similarly show\nthat rotation does not have to be cooled to the ground state, and cooling to\nhundreds of rotational phonons is good enough. We describe and simulate\nparametric feedback cooling of librational modes of a charged ND levitated in a\nPaul trap. The cooling is performed by modulating the electric field of the\ntrap. We examine the dependence of the efficiency of cooling on the electric\npotential and the shape of the object.

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source\nmodels-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative\ntasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded\ncausal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of\ncoordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge\nwith CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural\ncausal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is\nthe Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from\nagent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states\ninfluence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action\nselection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting\nthem accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when\nneeded. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,\nCausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without\nrequiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the\nOvercooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four\nLLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.\nExperimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions\nand improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming\nstrong reinforcement learning baselines.

In this paper, we\nfocus on Airy beams, which may exhibit several highly desirable properties in\nthe near-field region. Ideally, these beams follow self-accelerating (curved)\ntrajectories, demonstrate resilience to perturbations through self-healing, and\nmaintain a consistent intensity profile across all planes perpendicular to the\npropagation direction, making them effectively diffraction-free.

Firstly, from the data\nperspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with\nMamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network\nperspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could\nbenefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning\ndirections. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an\nuncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of\nfeature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly\noutperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,\nyielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%\nlabeled data.",

This has led to an\nintensified focus on the study of video steganography, which is a technique\nthat hides data within a video cover to avoid detection. The effectiveness of\nany steganography method depends on its ability to embed data without altering\nthe original video quality while maintaining high efficiency. This paper\nproposes a new method to video steganography, which involves utilizing a\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) for identifying the Region of Interest (ROI) in the\ncover video. The ROI is the area in the video that is the most suitable for\ndata embedding. The secret data is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption\nStandard (AES), which is a widely accepted encryption standard, before being\nembedded into the cover video, utilizing up to 10% of the cover video. This\nprocess ensures the security and confidentiality of the embedded data. The\nperformance metrics for assessing the proposed method are the Peak Signal to\nNoise Ratio (PSNR) and the encoding and decoding time. The results show that\nthe proposed method has a high embedding capacity and efficiency, with a PSNR\nranging between 64 and 75 dBs, which indicates that the embedded data is almost\nindistinguishable from the original video.

We aim to characterize the horizontal and vertical\nvariability of hydrocarbon absorption in Jupiter's auroral atmosphere using\nultraviolet data from the Juno-UVS spectrograph and to investigate potential\ndepartures from the expected structure. We constructed color ratio maps\nsensitive to CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions for perijoves (PJs) 6 and 10,\ntwo of Juno's close approaches to Jupiter, by integrating auroral H$_2$\nemission over hydrocarbon-sensitive spectral intervals. For CH$_4$, we\nredefined the absorbed spectral band, replacing the traditionally used 125-130\nnm interval with 135-140 nm, in order to mitigate higher-order calibration\nissues. In regions of intense auroral brightness, we developed a correction\nmethod to account for spectral distortion due to detector non-linearities at\nhigh fluxes. CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions generally follow the expected\nvertical distribution, with the CH$_4$ density extending to higher altitudes\nthan C$_2$H$_2$. However, several localized regions show unexpected spatial\ndistribution of the absorption. In PJ6, such anomalies are attributed to\ninstrumental non-linearities. After correction, the CR distributions become\nconsistent with standard hydrocarbon vertical distributions. In PJ10, however,\nsome anomalous patterns persist despite correction. Spectral modeling indicates\nthat these can be explained by modifying the relative abundances of CH$_4$ and\nC$_2$H$_2$, suggesting horizontal compositional variability and possible\ndeviations in homopause altitude between species. These findings underscore the\nimportance of accounting for local atmospheric composition when interpreting\nultraviolet auroral spectra and retrieving electron energy distributions.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a robust and efficient very high-order scheme for\ncompressible flow simulation, addressing critical limitations of existing\nhigh-order methods. The proposed scheme combines the compact gas-kinetic scheme\n(CGKS) with an adaptive stencil extension reconstruction with discontinuity\nfeedback factor (ASE-DFF), achieving significant improvements in both\nrobustness and computational efficiency. Traditional weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) schemes suffer from reduced robustness at higher order\nand require costly smoothness indicators for large stencils. Meanwhile, compact\nmethods based on Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and Flux Reconstruction (FR)\nstruggle with poor time-marching efficiency. In contrast, the ASE-DFF-CGKS\nintroduces two key innovations: (1) a unified framework enabling arbitrarily\nhigh-order compact gas-kinetic scheme without sacrificing large CFL number, and\n(2) a discontinuity feedback factor that eliminates the need for expensive\nsmoothness indicator calculations while essentially keeping first-order\nrobustness near discontinuities. The scheme's advantages are demonstrated\nthrough benchmark simulations. It maintains a CFL number above 0.5 for up to\n9th-order case, unlike conventional compact methods that restrict a CFL less\nthan 0.05. Also it delivers high-resolution results for flow involving strong\nshock and rarefaction wave. This work provides a practically impactful solution\nfor high-fidelity compressible flow simulation, balancing computational\nefficiency, high-order accuracy and robustness in challenging flow regimes.",

Adapting these robotic\nstrategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions,\nand user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated\nthe impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research\nhas examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research\naddresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and\nundistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware\npedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning\nrobots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by\nsmartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit\nsignificant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead,\nboth the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern\nsignificantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the\nsmaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset\nrectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral\nadaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to\ndifferences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial\ninsights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot\nin public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.",

We prove a variety of convexity results by means of a\nsimple general principle, which holds in the metric space setting, and which\ncrucially requires no knowledge of the structure of geodesics in the\nsubmanifold: If the EVI gradient flow of a functional exists and leaves the\nsubmanifold invariant, then the restriction of the functional to the\nsubmanifold is geodesically convex. This leads to short new proofs of several\nknown results, such as one of Carlen and Gangbo on strong convexity of entropy\non sphere-like submanifolds, and several new results, such as the\n$\\lambda$-convexity of entropy on the space of couplings of\n$\\lambda$-log-concave marginals. Along the way, we develop sufficient\nconditions for existence of geodesics in Wasserstein submanifolds. Submanifold\nconvexity results lead systematically to improvements of Talagrand and HWI\ninequalities which we speculate to be closely related to concentration of\nmeasure estimates for conditioned empirical measures, and we prove one rigorous\nresult in this direction in the Carlen-Gangbo setting.",

DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for\nneurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and\ncomputational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and\nemulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key\ncomponents. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic\nmodels and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural\nextension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of\nlogic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the\narchitecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated\nat the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as\ncomputational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a\nneurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate\nlevel of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog\nis implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing\nalgebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain\ndifferent neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying\nalgebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog\nneurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison\nbetween 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in\nthe architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based\nimplementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.",

In\nthe standard approach to PDV analysis, a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is\nused to generate a spectrogram from which the velocity history of the target is\ninferred. The user chooses the form, duration and separation of the window\nfunction. Here we present a Bayesian approach to infer the velocity directly\nfrom the PDV oscilloscope trace, without using the spectrogram for analysis.\nThis is clearly a difficult inference problem due to the highly-periodic nature\nof the data, but we find that with carefully chosen prior distributions for the\nmodel parameters we can accurately recover the injected velocity from synthetic\ndata. We validate this method using PDV data collected at the STAR two-stage\nlight gas gun at Sandia National Laboratories, recovering shock-front\nvelocities in quartz that are consistent with those inferred using the\nSTFT-based approach, and are interpolated across regions of low signal-to-noise\ndata. Although this method does not rely on the same user choices as the STFT,\nwe caution that it can be prone to misspecification if the chosen model is not\nsufficient to capture the velocity behavior. Analysis using posterior\npredictive checks can be used to establish if a better model is required,\nalthough more complex models come with additional computational cost, often\ntaking more than several hours to converge when sampling the Bayesian\nposterior. We therefore recommend it be viewed as a complementary method to\nthat of the STFT-based approach.",

While\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) signals have shown high discriminability, their\nintrusive sensing requirements and discontinuous acquisition limit\npracticality. Photoplethysmography (PPG), on the other hand, enables\ncontinuous, non-intrusive authentication with seamless integration into\nwrist-worn wearable devices. However, most prior work relies on high-frequency\nPPG (e.g., 75 - 500 Hz) and complex deep models, which incur significant energy\nand computational overhead, impeding deployment in power-constrained real-world\nsystems. In this paper, we present the first real-world implementation and\nevaluation of a continuous authentication system on a smartwatch, We-Be Band,\nusing low-frequency (25 Hz) multi-channel PPG signals. Our method employs a\nBi-LSTM with attention mechanism to extract identity-specific features from\nshort (4 s) windows of 4-channel PPG. Through extensive evaluations on both\npublic datasets (PTTPPG) and our We-Be Dataset (26 subjects), we demonstrate\nstrong classification performance with an average test accuracy of 88.11%,\nmacro F1-score of 0.88, False Acceptance Rate (FAR) of 0.48%, False Rejection\nRate (FRR) of 11.77%, and Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.76%.

Radial velocities revealed the presence of two\nadditional bodies: a candidate cold companion on an eccentric orbit with a\nminimum mass nearly half that of Jupiter (eccentricity $0.60^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$;\nsemi-major axis 8.6$^{+1.5}_{-1.6}$ au), and an innermost super-Earth (orbital\nperiod 10.6413$\\pm$0.0028 d; mass 4.1$\\pm$0.8 Me) for which we discovered\npreviously undetected transit events in K2 photometry. TESS revealed a second\ntransit of one of the two companions originally observed by K2. This allowed us\nto constrain its orbital period to a grid of values, the most likely being\n$\\sim$138 days, which would imply a mass less than 9 Me, at a 3$\\sigma$\nsignificance level. Given the level of precision of our measurements, we were\nable to constrain the internal structure and composition of the second-most\ndistant planet from the host star, a warm sub-Neptune with a bulk density of\n3.9$\\pm$0.5 g/cm$^{3}$. HD 224018 hosts three close-in transiting planets in\nthe super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune regime, and a candidate cold and eccentric\nmassive companion. Additional follow-up is needed to better characterise the\nphysical properties of the planets and their architecture.",

In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,\nenabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed\nnoises, have recently attracted significant attention\n\\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.\nHowever, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few\nexceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits\n(MABs) \\citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.\n  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed\nbandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the\nloss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus\nfunction, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm\nfor heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity\nassumption and achieves an $\\widetilde{O}(T^{\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}})$\nworst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\\widetilde{O}(\\log\nT)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime.

We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW\nregret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions\nare satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear\nloss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear\nbandits.",

In such cases, data\nscarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples\nthat deviate from the true data manifold.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer\nLearning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and\nstability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance\ntransfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances\nfrom a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target\ndomain.

Instead of generating random\nperturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the\nsource cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These\nare then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To\ndefine a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based\nencoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the\ncombined set based on their proximity to the target instance.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict users' subsequent interactions\nby modeling their sequential behaviors. Recent studies have explored frequency\ndomain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.\nHowever, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:\n(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns\nin a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency\nfiltering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their\ndistinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a\nnovel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg\n(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering\nmodule (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive\nbehavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively\nemphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other\nranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to\ngenerate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique\ncharacteristics. Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse\nuser behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum. Extensive\nexperiments show that MUFFIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\nfrequency-domain SR models over five benchmark datasets.

However, these visual aids do not\nseem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since\nthe code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these\nadditional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response\ntimes for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can\nreduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played\nby formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate\nthe impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through\nlarge-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four\nprogramming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\\#) and ten LLMs-including both\ncommercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and\nperformance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that\nLLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code,\nachieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\\% with negligible output\ntoken reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization\nstrategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both\nprompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to\n36.1\\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate\npractical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for\nformat processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM\ninference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.",

While it has been\nrobustly measured for millions of external galaxies, it remains poorly\nconstrained for the Milky Way because of the strong selection effect from our\ninside perspective. In this work, we reconstruct the intrinsic vertical mass\ndensity profile in the solar neighborhood and the radial mass density profile\nacross the entire Galaxy using data from the Gaia and APOGEE surveys, following\ncareful correction for the selection function. The local density profile\nexhibits strong north-south asymmetry in the geometric thick disk regime and\nincreases steeply toward the disk mid-plane, favoring an exponential model over\nthe sech$^2$ model. Integrating the local vertical density profile yields a\nsurface stellar mass density of 31.563$\\pm$2.813(syst.)$\\pm$0.024(stoch.)~${\\rm\nM_{\\odot}pc^{-2}}$, of which 25.074 and 6.489~${\\rm M_{\\odot}pc^{-2}}$\ncorrespond to living stars and stellar remnants, respectively. The radial\nsurface mass density profile {of the Milky Way} shares the same flat inner\ncomponent as observed in the brightness profile. With this mass density profile\n{and local mass density from Gaia}, we derive a new estimate of the total\nstellar mass of the Milky Way of 2.607$\\pm$0.353(syst.)$\\pm$0.085(stoch.)${\\rm\n\\times10^{10}M_{\\odot}}$, a factor of two lower than the previous results. This\ndiscrepancy arises primarily from the inner disk profile, which was previously\nunavailable and extrapolated from the outer disk profile.

These media are\ncharacterized by physical properties significantly distinct from those of a\nhomogeneous background. The quasi-Minnaert resonance is defined by two primary\nfeatures: boundary localization, where the $L^2$-norms of the internal total\nfield and the external scattered field exhibit pronounced concentration near\nthe boundary, and surface resonance, marked by highly oscillatory behavior of\nthe fields near the boundary. In contrast to classical Minnaert resonances,\nwhich are associated with a discrete spectral spectrum tied to physical\nparameters, quasi-Minnaert resonances exhibit analogous physical phenomena but\nwith a continuous spectral spectrum. Using layer potential theory and rigorous\nasymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the coupling between a high-contrast\nmaterial structure, particularly with radial geometries, and a carefully\ndesigned incident wave is critical for inducing quasi-Minnaert resonances.\nExtensive numerical experiments, involving radial geometries (e.g., unit disks\nand spheres) and general-shaped geometries (e.g., hearts, Cassini ovals, and\nclovers in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and spheres in $\\mathbb{R}^3$), validate the\noccurrence of these resonances.

    "abstract": "Human-AI romantic relationships have gained wide popularity among social\nmedia users in China. The technological impact on romantic relationships and\nits potential applications have long drawn research attention to topics such as\nrelationship preservation and negativity mitigation. Media and communication\nstudies also explore the practices in romantic para-social relationships.\nNonetheless, this emerging human-AI romantic relationship, whether the\nrelations fall into the category of para-social relationship together with its\nnavigation pattern, remains unexplored, particularly in the context of\nrelational stages and emotional attachment. This research thus seeks to fill\nthis gap by presenting a mixed-method approach on 1,766 posts and 60,925\ncomments from Xiaohongshu, as well as the semi-structured interviews with 23\nparticipants, of whom one of them developed her relationship with self-created\nAI for three years. The findings revealed that the users' willingness to\nself-disclose to AI companions led to increased positivity without social\nstigma. The results also unveiled the reciprocal nature of these interactions,\nthe dominance of 'self', and raised concerns about language misuse, bias, and\ndata security in AI communication.",

    "abstract": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale\ncarefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in\ntest time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling\nparadigm, Input-Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting\nresources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we utilize\nmeta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also\ndiscover a new phenomenon, train-test co-design. It requires us to apply query\nstrategies during training and testing as a whole. Only applying strategies on\ntraining or testing would seriously degrade the performance gained. We are also\nsurprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can perform better.\nWe can get the best performance even by adding irrelevant information to the\nqueries, with randomly selected 1k examples from a minimally filtered dataset.\nThese findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, \"garbage in, garbage\nout\". Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially\nlimit the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with\nsimilar quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, the intuition of simply scaling the\nsize should also be carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are\ncompatible with the Less is More phenomenon. 1K examples are enough to invoke\nhigh-level reasoning ability. With experiments on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, we are\nable to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and\nAIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with\na majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,\nthe result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate\nreproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our\ndatasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.",

At the middleware layer, we implement a fixed-priority,\nnon-preemptive scheduler to manage publishers of varying criticality. At the\nnetwork layer, we leverage the express data path (XDP) to route high-priority\ndata directly from the network interface driver into critical application\nmemory, bypassing the standard Linux network stack. At the hardware layer, we\ndedicate a network interface card (NIC) queue exclusively to real-time traffic.\nWe demonstrate how our architecture performs in a Data Distribution Service\n(DDS)-based system.

Furthermore, we find that the resonant bubble only plays a\nsignificant role in a certain region of parameter-space. However, when\nsignificant, it does lead to an approximately constant decay rate during the\nintermediate stage.

There are two\nprominent problems in the transient stability analysis of GFLC-LIS. The angular\ndynamic of LIS increases the complexity of transient stability analysis, and\nthe nonlinear, possibly negative damping of GFLC makes it difficult to\nguarantee the conservative of the traditional methods. These problems make the\ntraditional methods inapplicable. In this paper, the transient stability\nanalysis of GFLC LIS is investigated to provide an accurate estimation of the\nattraction boundary and critical clearance time (CCT). Firstly, a dynamic model\nof GFLC-LIS is constructed, considering the phase-locked loop (PLL)-based GFLC\ndynamics and swing equation-based LIS dynamics. The frequency mutation of PLL\nat fault occurrence and clearing time is also considered. Secondly, a Zubov\nbased transient stability analysis method is proposed, which can construct the\nenergy function in a way that is different from the traditional conservation of\nenergy perspective and can address the negative damping issue. Moreover, the\naccuracy of the CCT estimation is analyzed, and the influences of LIS\nparameters on transient stability are illustrated.

Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,\nneglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.\nRecent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:\n(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the\ndesired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and\nedges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how\nhumans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the\nValley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background\ndistractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes\nthe model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For\nthe issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired\napproach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight\ngradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution\nfollows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.\nConsequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to\nconcentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by\nV2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks\nScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro.

When extending to various types of objects, data curation is\nchallenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the\ncorresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged\npipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,\nportraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free\nlocalization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically\ndraw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask.

    "abstract": "Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even\nwithout billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample\ncomputational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy\nconstraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated\nLearning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared\nmodel by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it\nrequires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which\nneglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,\nand increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose\nFedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot\nsettings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter\nsharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange\nmodel prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces\ncommunication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full\nmodel weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model\narchitectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may\nbe biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth\nlabels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate\nthese issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that\niteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning\nreliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label\ngeneration and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates\ndiverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms\nexisting baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks\nwhere clients possess valuable private data but limited computational\nresources.",

It is a random curve\nin two dimensions to which a cluster interface in a critical lattice system is\nsupposed, or has been proved, to converge. The most archetypical setting for\nSLE is called chordal, where a random curve evolves in a simply-connected\ndomain from a boundary point to another, whereas in its variant called radial,\na random curve evolves from a boundary point to a distinguished interior point.\nMultiple SLE is a variant to another direction; it deals with multiple random\ncurves, and it is a natural direction as there are certainly multiple cluster\ninterfaces found in critical lattice systems. In this paper, we study multiple\nSLE in the radial setting, namely, radial multiple SLE.\n  We report two main results. One is regarding coupling between radial multiple\nSLE and Gaussian free field (GFF). Coupling between SLE and GFF has been\nextensively studied in the chordal setting, and serves as a foundation for many\nrecent developments. We show that coupling between radial multiple SLE and GFF\noccurs if and only if the radial multiple SLE is driven by the circular Dyson\nBrownian motions.\n  The circular Dyson Brownian motions are a typical example of stochastic\nlog-gases.

In this study, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft with\nself-locking gear (SLG) resonators is proposed, where a simple gear-shifting\nmechanism replaces complex tuning methods to achieve low-frequency torsional\nvibration suppression in tunable frequency ranges. First, as the key components\nof the SLG resonator, six inner curved beams are designed to provide precisely\ntunable torsional stiffness of the resonator through their deformed shapes\ncontrolled by shifting the gear teeth on the edge of the resonator. Also, based\non the gear-shifting mechanism, the SLG resonator achieves resonant frequency\nmodulation and opens tunable low-frequency torsional band gaps consistent with\ntheoretical predictions. Then, the SLG resonators are periodically attached to\na uniform shaft to construct a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft, whose dynamic\nresponse is obtained using numerical simulations to evaluate its torsional wave\nattenuation performance. Finally, a gear-shifting tunable meta-shaft prototype\nis fabricated and experiments are carried out to study the propagation\ncharacteristics of torsional waves therein.

Parameterized bisimilarity relates processes p and q with respect\nto an environment e if p and q behave bi-similarly while joining --\nrespectively the same -- transitions from e. The weakened variant relates\nprocesses p and q with respect to environment e if the join-interaction\nprocesses p & e and q & e of p and q with e are bisimilar. (Hereby join\ninteractions r & f facilitate a step with label a to r' & f' if and only if r\nand f permit a-steps to r' and f' , respectively.) Join-interaction\nparameterized (ji-parameterized) bisimilarity coincides with parameterized\nbisimilarity for deterministic environments, but that it is a coarser\nequivalence in general. We explain how Larsen's concept can be recovered from\nji-parameterized bisimilarity by 'determinizing' interactions. We show that by\nadaptation to simulatability (simulation preorder) the same concept arises:\nparameterized simulatability coincides with ji-parameterized simulatability.\nFor the discrimination preorder of (ji-)parameterized simulatability on\nenvironments we obtain the same result as Larsen did for parameterized\nbisimilarity. Also, we give a modal-logic characterization of\n(ji-)parameterized simulatability. Finally we gather open problems, and provide\nan outlook on our current related work.",

    "abstract": "Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured\nconfounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.\nPartial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on\nunverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives\nbounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its\ntheoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied\nwork, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of\npractical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically\ncomparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal\nscenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including\nsymbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a\ncommon evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a\nrecently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to\ncounterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency\n(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving\nboth discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method\nin terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to\nassumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a\npractical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning\nmodel to predict the best-performing method based on observable data\ncharacteristics.\n  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,\nCausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods\nthrough a unified interface.",

To\naddress this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and\ninter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship\nbetween anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called\nAdaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or\nfar from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further\naway from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis\nand the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.",

These repeaters are full-duplex relays with\nsmall form factors that receive and instantaneously retransmit signals. They\ncan be deployed in a plug-and-play manner at low cost, while being transparent\nto the network--conceptually they are active channel scatterers with\namplification capabilities. Two fundamental questions need to be addressed in\nrepeater deployments: (I) How can we prevent destructive effects of positive\nfeedback caused by inter-repeater interaction (i.e., each repeater receives and\namplifies signals from others)? (ii) How much performance improvement can be\nachieved given that repeaters also inject noise and may introduce more\ninterference? To answer these questions, we first derive a generalized Nyquist\nstability criterion for the repeater swarm system, and provide an easy-to-check\nstability condition. Then, we study the uplink performance and develop an\nefficient iterative algorithm that jointly optimizes the repeater gains, user\ntransmit powers, and receive combining weights to maximize the weighted sum\nrate while ensuring system stability. Numerical results corroborate our\ntheoretical findings and show that the repeaters can significantly improve the\nsystem performance, both in sub-6 GHz and millimeter-wave bands.

    "abstract": "We study two-dimensional turbulence in a square no-slip domain without bottom\ndrag using direct numerical simulations. The dynamics are shown to depend\nstrongly on the torque $M$ of the external forcing. When $M$ is relatively\nlarge, a long-lived coherent vortex forms at the domain center, establishing a\npersistent angular momentum. At lower torques, the angular momentum undergoes\nrandom sign reversals due to spontaneous switching of the central vortex\ncirculation, though it predominantly aligns with the torque direction. We\ninvestigate the transition between these regimes by smoothly varying $M$,\nobserving that the time-averaged angular momentum of the system follows\n$\\langle \\mathcal{L} \\rangle \\propto M^{1/3}$. A significant part of the energy\ndissipates near the domain boundaries, requiring a revision of scaling laws for\nhomogeneous systems. New scaling relations are proposed and they enable\nvelocity profiles in the boundary layers to collapse onto a universal curve for\nsimulations with varying fluid viscosities and forcing amplitudes. The velocity\nprofiles feature a linear viscous sublayer followed by a short logarithmic\nregion. The boundary layer thickness $\\delta$ scales with the large-scale\nReynolds number $Re$ as $\\delta \\sim L \\cdot Re^{-1/2}$, indicating that the\nfriction at no-slip walls is not sufficient to halt the inverse energy cascade\nbefore it reaches the system size $L$.

Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this\nchallenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate\nstructured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,\nhighlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward\nstructured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in\nSFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured\nReinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially\nbreaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,\ncontaining 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate\nsimplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art\nperformance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a\nplateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method\nleverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual\nand visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate\nfine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess\nstructural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an\nevaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training\nstability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,\nimproving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA\nbenchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced\nclosed-source models.",

We further compare multiple evaluation\nmetrics and find that correlations vary by task, with MAUVE showing weak\nagreement with BERTScore and ROUGE, as well as greater sensitivity to the\ndecoding strategy.

    "abstract": "Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)\nreasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical\npredictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform\non EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally\nstructured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid\nparadigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream\ndeep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's\nintrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of\nDL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework\ndesigned to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert\nattention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models\ntrained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise\nreasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to\neffectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the\npolicy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with\nclinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive\nexperiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the\nintrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also\nenhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen\nclinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL\nfor real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been\navailable at https://github.com/devilran6/EAG-RL.",

However, license plate areas in dash cam\nimages often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make\naccurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on\npretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently\nintroducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose\na novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,\nMF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and\naggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To\nachieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow\nestimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and\ncorrect erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal\nconsistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances\nboth image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential\ncontent of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR\n(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of\nlow-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth\nimages, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios.

By trading spatial and time resources, our approach achieves\ngenuine randomness with a bath of constant size that is independent of the\nsystem size. We quantify randomness with the frame potential and analyze its\ndynamics throughout the evolution. Given a total evolution time, as we increase\nthe number of mid-circuit measurements, the frame potential initially decreases\nexponentially with the number of measurements, due to the mechanism of\nholographic deep thermalization. Past a critical number of mid-circuit\nmeasurements, the frame potential rises again, signaling the onset of the\nquantum Zeno effect. We provide analytical results for the asymptotic behavior\nof the frame potential, which are in good agreement with the numerical\nsimulations.

To meet\nsuch requirements, existing methods \"inadvertently\" destroy two basic\nrequirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire\nsequence to keep the information as much as possible; R2) extract information\nfrom the most relevant behaviors to keep high relevance between learned\ninterests and current target items.

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition from speech is a challenging task that requires capturing\nboth linguistic and paralinguistic cues, with critical applications in\nhuman-computer interaction and mental health monitoring. Recent works have\nhighlighted the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform tasks\noutside of the sole natural language area. In particular, recent approaches\nhave investigated coupling LLMs with other data modalities by using pre-trained\nbackbones and different fusion mechanisms. This work proposes a novel approach\nthat fine-tunes an LLM with audio and text representations for emotion\nprediction. Our method first extracts audio features using an audio feature\nextractor, which are then mapped into the LLM's representation space via a\nlearnable interfacing module. The LLM takes as input (1) the transformed audio\nfeatures, (2) additional features in the form of natural language (e.g., the\ntranscript), and (3) a textual prompt describing the emotion prediction task.\nTo efficiently adapt the LLM to this multimodal task, we employ Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Experimental\nresults on standard emotion recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our model\noutperforms all but one existing Speech-Text LLMs in the literature, while\nrequiring less than half the parameters of competing approaches. This\nhighlights our approach's effectiveness in integrating multi-modal inputs for\nspeech-based emotion understanding while maintaining significant computational\nefficiency.",

    "abstract": "We present a machine learning-based anomaly detection strategy designed to\nidentify anomalous physics in events containing resonant Standard Model physics\nand demonstrate this method on the final state of a Higgs boson decaying to two\nphotons. The demonstration targets high-dimensional deviations in the region of\nphase space containing the Higgs mass peak in a fully signal-agnostic manner. A\nlatent-space embedding, learned from event kinematics, enables the use of a\nlarge set of potentially sensitive features. Backgrounds are estimated using a\nhybrid approach that combines machine learning-based generative modelling with\ntraditional simulation, and a discriminator is trained in the latent space to\ndistinguish data from background estimates. After applying a selection on the\nclassifier output, the invariant mass distribution of the diphoton system is\nexamined for localized excesses above the simulated Higgs peak. We benchmark\nthe sensitivity of this strategy using simplified simulated proton-proton\ncollisions corresponding to data recorded during Run 2 of the LHC, and show\nthat the method can provide significant improvements in sensitivity, even for\nsmall signal injections that could remain undetected in an inclusive analysis.\nThese results demonstrate that the proposed strategy is a promising and viable\napproach for future searches and should be applied to recorded collider data.",

    "abstract": "Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of\nintelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in\nInternet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature\nsemantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus\nthese solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT\napplications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,\nwhich necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to\nlearn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the\ndifferences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously\nlearns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature\nsemantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction\neffectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action\ndetection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the\nsuperiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely\nrecognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of\nour proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition.

The 2025 edition featured four tracks and saw a 17% increase in\nparticipation, with 245 teams from 15 countries registered on the evaluation\nserver. Public release of challenge datasets led to over 30,000 downloads to\ndate. Track 1 focused on multi-class 3D multi-camera tracking, involving\npeople, humanoids, autonomous mobile robots, and forklifts, using detailed\ncalibration and 3D bounding box annotations. Track 2 tackled video question\nanswering in traffic safety, with multi-camera incident understanding enriched\nby 3D gaze labels. Track 3 addressed fine-grained spatial reasoning in dynamic\nwarehouse environments, requiring AI systems to interpret RGB-D inputs and\nanswer spatial questions that combine perception, geometry, and language. Both\nTrack 1 and Track 3 datasets were generated in NVIDIA Omniverse. Track 4\nemphasized efficient road object detection from fisheye cameras, supporting\nlightweight, real-time deployment on edge devices. The evaluation framework\nenforced submission limits and used a partially held-out test set to ensure\nfair benchmarking. Final rankings were revealed after the competition\nconcluded, fostering reproducibility and mitigating overfitting. Several teams\nachieved top-tier results, setting new benchmarks in multiple tasks.",

    "abstract": "In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that\nsolves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its\nhigh computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains\nhave shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural\nnetworks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing\naccuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural\nframework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a\nsingle-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core\nchallenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable\neffective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs\ninitialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization\nacross diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric\nnormalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.\nLearnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in\npost-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and\nsimple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,\ngeneralizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic\nmanner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction.

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks (DNNs) directly on edge devices has attracted\nincreasing attention, as it offers promising solutions to challenges such as\ndomain adaptation and privacy preservation. However, conventional DNN training\ntypically requires large-scale datasets, which imposes prohibitive overhead on\nedge devices-particularly for emerging large language model (LLM) tasks. To\naddress this challenge, a DNN-free method (ie., dataset sampling without DNN),\nnamed NMS (Near-Memory Sampling), has been introduced. By first conducting\ndimensionality reduction of the dataset and then performing exemplar sampling\nin the reduced space, NMS avoids the architectural bias inherent in DNN-based\nmethods and thus achieves better generalization. However, The state-of-the-art,\nNMS, suffers from two limitations: (1) The mismatch between the search method\nand the non-monotonic property of the perplexity error function leads to the\nemergence of outliers in the reduced representation; (2) Key parameter (ie.,\ntarget perplexity) is selected empirically, introducing arbitrariness and\nleading to uneven sampling. These two issues lead to representative bias of\nexamplars, resulting in degraded accuracy. To address these issues, we propose\nAdapSNE, which integrates an efficient non-monotonic search method-namely, the\nFireworks Algorithm (FWA)-to suppress outliers, and employs entropy-guided\noptimization to enforce uniform sampling, thereby ensuring representative\ntraining samples and consequently boosting training accuracy. To cut the\nedge-side cost arising from the iterative computations of FWA search and\nentropy-guided optimization, we design an accelerator with custom dataflow and\ntime-multiplexing markedly reducing on-device training energy and area.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework,\nnamely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in\nunseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only\nemploying a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind\nDictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for\nunseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the\nnormal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,\nDictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) Dictionary Construction - to\nsimulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from normal\nreference images. (2) Dictionary Lookup - to retrieve queried region features\nfrom the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature cannot\nbe retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) Query Discrimination\nRegularization - to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features\nharder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query\nConstraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive\nexperiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that\nDictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.",

To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like\nEncoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational\nprinciples and functions of biological neurons.

Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron\nmodel demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively\nincreases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN\nperformance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles.

We thus propose\nquantile regression analysis methods for multinomial choice data based on joint\nquantile regression and multinomial probit models to compare relative utilities\nwith some quantiles. Using a joint quantile regression model allows us to\nconsider the conditional quantile points of relative utilities and explicitly\ndescribe the correlation structure in the latent variables. We derive the full\nconditional distribution under several prior distributions and estimate the\nmodel's parameters from the posterior distribution by Gibbs sampling. The\nability to calculate by Gibbs sampling is not only computationally less\nexpensive than the Metropolis--Hastings method, but also easier to implement.\nWe also apply the proposed model to several datasets.

Specifically, the transmitter and the\nlegitimate receiver are assumed to have either causal or non-causal knowledge\nof the \\ac{CSI} for both the legitimate and the warden channels, while the\nwarden only knows the statistical distribution of the \\ac{CSI}. Two problem\nformulations are considered in this work: (a) Power allocation: maximizing the\nsum covert rate subject to a maximum power constraint, and (b) Rate allocation:\nminimizing the power consumption subject to a minimum covert rate constraint.\nBoth problems are formulated based on recent information theoretical results on\ncovert communication over state-dependent channels. When the \\ac{CSI} of each\nfading block is known non-causally, we propose a novel three-step method to\nsolve both the power and rate allocation problems.

Because most rare variants on the genome\nhave not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease\nprediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction\nstrategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are\nproposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk\nprediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an\nextension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional\nprocedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the\nuse of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the\nGenetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction\nmodel built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on\ncommon variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two\napproaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.\nWe found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when\nthe number of common variants in the data decreased.

    "abstract": "Standard finite difference (SFD) schemes often suffer from limited stability\nregions, especially when applied in explicit setup to partial differential\nequations. To address this challenge, this study investigates the efficacy of\nnonstandard finite difference (NSFD) schemes in enhancing stability of explicit\nSFD schemes for 1D and 2D Caputo-type time-fractional diffusion equations\n(TFDEs). A nonstandard L1approximation is proposed for the Caputo fractional\nderivative, and its local truncation error is derived analytically. This\nnonstandard L1 formulation is used to construct the NSFD scheme for a\nCaputo-type time-fractional initial value problem. The absolute stability of\nthe resulting scheme is rigorously examined using the boundary locus method,\nand its performance is validated through numerical simulations on test examples\nfor various choices of denominator functions. Based on this framework, two\nexplicit NSFD schemes are developed for 1D and 2D cases of the Caputo-type\nTFDE. Their stability is further assessed through the discrete energy method,\nwith particular focus on the expansion of stability region relative to SFD\nschemes. The convergence of the proposed NSFD schemes is also established.\nFinally, a comprehensive set of numerical experiments is conducted to\ndemonstrate the accuracy and stability advantages of proposed methods, with\nresults presented through tables and graphical illustrations.",

Transformer-based models show promise in improving medical image\nanalysis, but their application to extremity fractures is limited. This study\naddresses this gap by applying object detection transformers to wrist and hand\nX-rays.\n  Methods: We fine-tuned the RT-DETR and Co-DETR models, pre-trained on COCO,\nusing over 26,000 annotated X-rays from a proprietary clinical dataset. Each\nimage was labeled for fracture presence with bounding boxes. A ResNet-50\nclassifier was trained on cropped regions to refine abnormality classification.\nSupervised contrastive learning was used to enhance embedding quality.\nPerformance was evaluated using AP@50, precision, and recall metrics, with\nadditional testing on real-world X-rays.\n  Results: RT-DETR showed moderate results (AP@50 = 0.39), while Co-DETR\noutperformed it with an AP@50 of 0.615 and faster convergence. The integrated\npipeline achieved 83.1% accuracy, 85.1% precision, and 96.4% recall on\nreal-world X-rays, demonstrating strong generalization across 13 fracture\ntypes. Visual inspection confirmed accurate localization.\n  Conclusion: Our Co-DETR-based pipeline demonstrated high accuracy and\nclinical relevance in wrist and hand fracture detection, offering reliable\nlocalization and differentiation of fracture types.

    "abstract": "We consider a classically conformal extension of the Standard Model (SM) with\na hidden $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, where the $U(1)$ symmetry is radiatively broken\nvia the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This radiative breaking then induces\nelectroweak (EW) symmetry breaking through a negative mixed quartic coupling\nbetween the hidden sector Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet. Due to the\nmixed quartic coupling, the original two Higgs fields mix with a small angle\n$\\theta$ to form two mass eigenstates, $h_1$ (SM-like Higgs) and $h_2$ (SM\nsinglet-like Higgs). Setting their masses as $M_{h_1} > 2 M_{h_2}$ to allow the\ndecay process, $h_1 \\to h_2 h_2$, we find a remarkable prediction of the\nconformal Higgs potential: the corresponding decay width is strongly suppressed\nin contrast to the one in the conventional Higgs potential. This anomalous\nbehavior provides a striking experimental signature testable at the\nInternational Linear Collider (ILC) and other future high-energy lepton\ncolliders. In this work, we investigate further experimental signatures of the\nmodel which are complementary to the Higgs physics at the colliders. First, we\nstudy the hidden $U(1)$ gauge boson as a cold dark matter (DM) candidate. While\nwe find parameter regions consistent with both the observed relic abundance and\ncollider sensitivities, these regions are excluded by current direct DM\ndetection limits. Second, we consider a strong first-order phase transition\nassociated with hidden $U(1)$ breaking in the early universe and compute the\nresulting gravitational wave (GW) spectrum. We find that for parameter regions\ncomplementary to Higgs precision measurements at the ILC, the predicted GW\nsignals lie well above the projected sensitivities of future GW observatories.",

    "abstract": "Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a fundamental component of modern\npublic-key cryptosystems that enable efficient and secure digital signatures,\nkey exchanges, and encryption. Its core operation, scalar multiplication,\ndenoted as $k \\cdot P$, where $P$ is a base point and $k$ is a private scalar,\nrelies heavily on the secrecy and unpredictability of $k$. Conventionally, $k$\nis selected using user input or pseudorandom number generators. However, in\nresource-constrained environments with weak entropy sources, these approaches\nmay yield low-entropy or biased scalars, increasing susceptibility to\nside-channel and key recovery attacks. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we\nintroduce an optimization-driven scalar generation method that explicitly\nmaximizes bit-level entropy. Our approach uses differential evolution (DE), a\npopulation-based metaheuristic algorithm, to search for scalars whose binary\nrepresentations exhibit maximal entropy, defined by an even and statistically\nuniform distribution of ones and zeros. This reformulation of scalar selection\nas an entropy-optimization problem enhances resistance to entropy-based\ncryptanalytic techniques and improves overall unpredictability. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that DE-optimized scalars achieve entropy significantly\nhigher than conventionally generated scalars.

    "abstract": "Automatic music transcription (AMT) has achieved remarkable progress for\ninstruments such as the piano, largely due to the availability of large-scale,\nhigh-quality datasets. In contrast, violin AMT remains underexplored due to\nlimited annotated data. A common approach is to fine-tune pretrained models for\nother downstream tasks, but the effectiveness of such transfer remains unclear\nin the presence of timbral and articulatory differences. In this work, we\ninvestigate whether training from scratch on a medium-scale violin dataset can\nmatch the performance of fine-tuned piano-pretrained models. We adopt a piano\ntranscription architecture without modification and train it on the MOSA\ndataset, which contains about 30 hours of aligned violin recordings. Our\nexperiments on URMP and Bach10 show that models trained from scratch achieved\ncompetitive or even superior performance compared to fine-tuned counterparts.\nThese findings suggest that strong violin AMT is possible without relying on\npretrained piano representations, highlighting the importance of\ninstrument-specific data collection and augmentation strategies.",

    "abstract": "The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it\ndetermines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact\nrepresentations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN\nprimarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting\ngeometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored\nhow to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a\nnew framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer\nparadigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D\nGaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our\napproach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such\nas VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their\npatch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes\nimage latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and\nspatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as\nposition, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the\ndensity of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in\nreconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token\nefficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves\nstrong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by\nincreasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a\nsignificant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art\nreconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially\noutperforming existing methods.

    "abstract": "Interactive medical questioning is essential in real-world clinical\nconsultations, where physicians must actively gather information from patients.\nWhile medical Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities\nin static medical question answering, they predominantly operate under a\nreactive paradigm: generating answers directly without seeking additional\ninformation, which risks incorrect diagnoses in such interactive settings. To\naddress this limitation, we propose ProMed, a reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework that transitions medical LLMs toward a proactive paradigm, equipping\nthem with the ability to ask clinically valuable questions before\ndecision-making. At the core of ProMed is the Shapley Information Gain (SIG)\nreward, which quantifies the clinical utility of each question by combining the\namount of newly acquired information with its contextual importance, estimated\nvia Shapley values. We integrate SIG into a two-stage training pipeline: (1)\nSIG-Guided Model Initialization uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to\nconstruct high-reward interaction trajectories to supervise the model, and (2)\nSIG-Augmented Policy Optimization, which integrates SIG and enhances RL with a\nnovel SIG-guided Reward Distribution Mechanism that assigns higher rewards to\ninformative questions for targeted optimization. Extensive experiments on two\nnewly curated partial-information medical benchmarks demonstrate that ProMed\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.29% and\ndelivers a 54.45% gain over the reactive paradigm, while also generalizing\nrobustly to out-of-domain cases.",

The H-MPC divides the control process into\ntwo levels: a high-level MPC and a low-level MPC. The high-level MPC predicts\nfuture states and provides trajectory information, while the low-level MPC\nrefines control actions by updating the predictive model based on this\nhigh-level information. This hierarchical structure allows for the integration\nof kinematic constraints and ensures smooth joint-space trajectories, even near\nsingular configurations. Moreover, the low-level MPC incorporates secondary\nlinearization by leveraging predictive information from the high-level MPC,\neffectively capturing the second-order Taylor expansion information of the\nkinematic model while still maintaining a linearized model formulation. This\napproach not only preserves the simplicity of a linear control model but also\nenhances the accuracy of the kinematic representation, thereby improving\noverall control precision and reliability.

When A is\npositive definite, the solution x can be interpreted as the steady-state\nsolution of linear ODEs. This ODE can be solved by using the LCHS method in\n[1], which serves as the continuous implementation of the Fourier transform in\nthe Schr\\\"odingerization method from [2,3] Schr\\\"odingerization transforms\nlinear PDEs and ODEs with non-unitary dynamics into Schr\\\"odinger-type systems\nvia the warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher\ndimension. Compared to the LCHS method, Schr\\\"odingerization may be more\nappealing to the PDE community, as it is better suited for leveraging\nestablished computational PDE techniques to develop quantum algorithms. When A\nis a general Hermitian matrix, the inverse matrix can still be represented in\nthe LCHS form in [1], but with a kernel function based on the Fourier approach\nin [4]. Although this LCHS form provides the steady-state solution of linear\nODEs associated with the least-squares equation, applying Schr\\\"odingerization\nto this least-squares is not appropriate, as it results in a much larger\ncondition number. We demonstrate that in both cases, the solution x can be\nexpressed as the LCHS of Schr\\\"odingerization-form problems, or equivalently,\nas the steady-state solution to a Schr\\\"odingerization-form problem. This\nhighlights the potential of Schr\\\"odingerization in quantum scientific\ncomputation.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic\nrepresentation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,\nexisting linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely\non sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich\ntextual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of\nLLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous\nknowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase\noptimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item\ncorrelation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns\nan item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling\nsemantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is\noptimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and\ncomputational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three\nbenchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/jaewan7599/L3AE_CIKM2025.",

Methods: PACG patients with >5 reliable VF\ntests over >5 years were included. Progression was assessed in Zeiss Forum,\nwith baseline VF within six months of OCT. Fast progression was VFI decline\n<-2.0% per year; slow progression >-2.0% per year. OCT volumes were\nAI-segmented to extract 31 ONH parameters.

The Random Forest model combining structural and functional\nfeatures achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.87, 2000 Monte Carlo\niterations).

Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms\ninfinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent\nspace, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear\ninteractions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the\nLocal-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in\nturbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details\nand nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in\nexisting neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a\ndynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate\nlinear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical\nsystems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that\nDyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing\nprediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up\nto 86.7\\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.",

However, a falsely\ndetected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive\nenvironments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.\nTherefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false\npositive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly\nfocus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge\nof the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory.

This trajectory\nis then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the\ntrajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to\ndetermine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and\nreal-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify\nits robustness and efficiency.

While INRs\nachieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number\nrepresentation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware\noverhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight\nquantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of\nactivation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of\nquantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization\nscheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows\nthat the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from\nthose in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer\ndiffer significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing\nquantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize\nthese diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both\nempirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard\nquantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present\nan FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.\nExperiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms\nprevious quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\\%, energy consumption\nby 40.1\\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\\% compared to full-precision\ncounterparts.",

This effect allows for perfect rectification of\nsupercurrent, and has received considerable research interest. We report the\nobservation of the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in nanowire-based Andreev\nmolecules, where the time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries of a\nJosephson junction (JJ) can be nonlocally broken by coherently coupling to\nanother JJ. The JDE can be controlled using both non-local phase and gate\nvoltages. Notably, the non-local phase can induce a sign reversal of the diode\nefficiency, a manifestation of regulating the probabilities of double elastic\ncotunneling and double-crossed Andreev reflection. Additionally, the diode\nefficiency can be further modulated by local and non-local gate voltages,\nexhibiting a central-peak feature in the gate-voltage space. Our theoretical\ncalculations of the energy spectrum and the Josephson currents align well with\nthe experimental results. These results demonstrate the non-local regulation of\nthe JDE in Andreev molecules, offering significant implications for the control\nof multi-JJ devices and the development of advanced superconducting devices.",

CCOR-1 is on board the Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite -U (GOES-U, now GOES-19/GOES-East). GOES-U was launched from Kennedy\nSpace Flight Center, Florida, on 25 June 2024. CCOR-2 is on board the Space\nWeather Follow On at Lagrange point 1 (SWFO-L1). SWFO-L1 is scheduled to launch\nin the fall of 2025. SWFO will be renamed SOLAR-1 once it reaches L1. The CCORs\nare white-light coronagraphs that have a field of view and performance similar\nto the SOHO LASCO C3 coronagraph. CCOR-1 FOV spans from 4 to 22 Rsun, while\nCCOR-2 spans from 3.5 to 26 Rsun. The spatial resolution is 39 arcsec for\nCCOR-1 and 65 arcsec for CCOR-2. They both operate in a band-pass of 470 - 740\nnm. The synoptic cadence is 15 min and the latency from image capture to the\nforecaster on the ground is less than 30 min. Compared to past generation\ncoronagraphs such as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO),\nCCOR uses a compact design; all the solar occultation is done with a single\nmulti-disk external occulter. No internal occulter is used. This allowed a\nsubstantial reduction in size and mass compared to SECCHI COR-2, for example,\nbut with slightly lower signal-to-noise ratio.

In this work, we identify a significant gap\nbetween LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they\noften answer \"Yes\" to queries like \"Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?\",\nthey will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or\neven directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To\nsystematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation\nframework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)\ntheir knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify\ncorresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to\navoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical\nperformance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:\nwhile agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\\%$ pass rates), they\nfail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with\nperformance dropping by $>23\\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\\%$\npass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in\nspecialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling\nmodel capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety\nconcerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk\nverifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an\nabstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract\ndescriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall\nsystem achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\\%$\nover vanilla-prompted agents.",

    "abstract": "The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet\nunsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and\ndelivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to\nnavigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g.,\ndoorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space\nwith other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social\nMini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not\nperform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG\nsolvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different\nassumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication,\ncooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus\nliveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or\ndescribed informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate\nbaselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for\npractitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such\nad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers\nwanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its\nown taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research\nmoving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a\nwell-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.\nIt also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs\nare and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and\nhighlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems.\nThe survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges\nin the field.

The plumes may\npotentially play an important role in the mass supply and thermodynamic\nevolution of prominences, but their nature and generation mechanism are\nelusive. Here we use the high-resolution H-alpha observations obtained by the\nNew Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) to investigate a quiescent prominence with\nbubbles and plumes on 8 November 2022. Within an interval of about two hours,\nenhanced spicular activity disturb the prominence-bubble interface, producing\nbursts of small-scale plumes rising through the prominence.

We hence\nconjecture that the enhanced spicular activity may drive shock waves, which\ntrigger the magnetic Richtmyer-Meshkov instability at the prominence-bubble\ninterface, leading to the formation of small-scale plumes.

We tested these algorithms using two\nground truth datasets: a biophysically realistic simulated dataset, and\nexperimental data combining patch-clamp and Neuropixels probes. We\nsystematically evaluate the accuracy, robustness, and runtime of these\nalgorithms in ideal conditions and long-term recording conditions with\nelectrode decay. Our findings highlight significant performance differences;\nwhile more complex and physically realistic models perform better in ideal\nsituations, simple heuristics demonstrate superior robustness to noise and\nelectrode degradation in experimental datasets, making them more suitable for\nlong-term neural recordings. This work provides a framework for assessing\nlocalization algorithms and developing robust, biologically grounded algorithms\nto advance the development of brain-machine interfaces.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between the team-optimal solution\nand the Nash equilibrium (NE) to assess the impact of self-interested decisions\non team performance. In classical team decision problems, team members\ntypically act cooperatively towards a common objective to achieve a\nteam-optimal solution. However, in practice, members may behave selfishly by\nprioritizing their goals, resulting in an NE under a non-cooperative game. To\nstudy this misalignment, we develop a parameterized model for team and game\nproblems, where game parameters represent each individual's deviation from the\nteam objective. The study begins by exploring the consistency and deviation\nbetween the NE and the team-optimal solution under fixed game parameters. We\nprovide a necessary and sufficient condition for any NE to be a team optimum,\nalong with establishing an upper bound to measure their difference when the\nconsistency condition fails. The exploration then focuses on aligning NE\nstrategies towards the team-optimal solution through the adjustment of game\nparameters, resulting in a non-convex and non-smooth bi-level optimization\nproblem. We propose a hypergradient-based algorithm for this problem, and\nestablish its convergence to the critical points. Finally, we validate our\ntheoretical findings through extensive simulation studies.",

    "abstract": "Consumer agency in the digital age is increasingly constrained by systemic\nbarriers and algorithmic manipulation, raising concerns about the authenticity\nof consumption choices. Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external\npressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable\nwork schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like\nhidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like\npersonalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work\nschedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how\nthese factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models\ngrounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We\nconstruct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments,\nalgorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to\ntemporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational,\nutility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is\nlimited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how\ndiminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central\nargument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given)\nrequiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection\nbetween our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that\nlimitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be\nrigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This\nconnection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value,\nby anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior. As\nsolutions, we study systemic interventions and consumer education to support\nvalue deliberation and informed choices. We formally demonstrate how these\nmeasures strengthen agency.",

    "abstract": "Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in\nreal-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often\nstruggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural\npatterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering\nmechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel\nframework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware\ngraph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value\nembeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical\nspectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables\nlearnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral\nkernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection\nbases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to\nmodel multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through\nattention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during\nfeature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks\ndemonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and\ndirection-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new\nparadigm for learning representations on directed graphs.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy\nand transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with\nevents in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural\nlanguage-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains\nlargely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,\nresulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling\nfine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is\nchallenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained\nsynchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous\ntime series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual\nsemantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and\nmulti-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges\nby introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),\nan autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series\nwith textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses\nautoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced\ntemporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching\ntimesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The\nunderlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that\nefficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.\nExtensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF\noutperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series\nforecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher\nforecasting accuracy and $1.13\\times$ faster training efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous trading strategies have been a subject of research within the\nfield of artificial intelligence (AI) for aconsiderable period. Various AI\ntechniques have been explored to develop autonomous agents capable of trading\nfinancial assets. These approaches encompass traditional methods such as neural\nnetworks, fuzzy logic, and reinforcement learning, as well as more recent\nadvancements, including deep neural networks and deep reinforcement learning.\nMany developers report success in creating strategies that exhibit strong\nperformance during simulations using historical price data, a process commonly\nreferred to as backtesting. However, when these strategies are deployed in real\nmarkets, their performance often deteriorates, particularly in terms of\nrisk-adjusted returns. In this study, we propose an AI-based strategy inspired\nby a classical investment paradigm: Value Investing. Financial AI models are\nhighly susceptible to lookahead bias and other forms of bias that can\nsignificantly inflate performance in backtesting compared to live trading\nconditions. To address this issue, we conducted a series of computational\nsimulations while controlling for these biases, thereby reducing the risk of\noverfitting. Our results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms major\nBrazilian market benchmarks. Moreover, the strategy, named AlphaX, demonstrated\nsuperior performance relative to widely used technical indicators such as the\nRelative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI), with statistically\nsignificant results. Finally, we discuss several open challenges and highlight\nemerging technologies in qualitative analysis that may contribute to the\ndevelopment of a comprehensive AI-based Value Investing framework in the future",

Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in\nvisual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the\nvisual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut\nfor VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To\nfix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates\nhard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer.

On these\nEOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)\nsettings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,\nproviding a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability.

However, measuring the effect of these\ninterventions is complicated by time-varying confounding: public health\ninterventions are causal consequences of prior outcomes and interventions, as\nwell as causes of future outcomes and interventions. Researchers have shown\nrepeatedly that neglecting time-varying confounding for individual-level\nlongitudinal interventions can result in profoundly biased estimates of causal\neffects. However, the issue with time-varying confounding bias has often been\noverlooked in population-level epidemic intervention evaluations.

This paper generalizes the\nresults derived in Chaoubi et al.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by\naccelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to\nmaterials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial\nhuman oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing\ndomain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge\nacross disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of\nmore general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a\ndomain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific\nworkflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript\npreparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological\nstudies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,\nexecuted one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed\nanalysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced\ncompleted manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific\ndiscovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning\nand methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with\nlimitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step\ntoward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,\naccelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space\nthat human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.\nIt raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and\nthe attribution of scientific credit.",

The internal magnetic field first\ndiffuses to the crust surrounding the liquid core and then erupts from the\nsurface, taking a significant amount of crustal material with it. The eruption\ninvolves magnetic reconnection, generating a giant gamma-ray flare. A\nsignificant fraction of the eruption energy is carried by the neutron-rich\ncrustal material, which must go through a phase of decompression and nuclear\nheating. The massive ejecta should produce additional emission components after\nthe giant flare, including radioactively powered gamma-rays, optical emission,\nand much later a radio afterglow. The predicted eruptions may rarely happen in\nobserved magnetars in our galaxy, which are relatively old and rarely produce\ngiant flares. The model can, however, explain the extremely powerful flare from\nSGR 1806-20 in December 2004, its ejecta mass, and afterglow. More active,\nyounger magnetars may produce frequent crustal eruptions and form unusual\nnebulae.

The increased radiation due to these decay products (Pb-214 and\nBi-214) has been studied for many decades in applications such as atmospheric\nscience and radiation protection. For those applications radon progeny\nsignatures are the signal of interest, while in the fields of radiological and\nnuclear security and aerial radiological mapping they are a nuisance.

This manuscript describes an effort to analyze and model\ngamma-ray spectra measured during rainfall by a NaI(Tl) detector located\noutdoors in order to derive accurate source terms for Pb-214 and Bi-214 at a\nhigh frequency (less than 1 minute). All known sources of background were\nquantitatively modeled across the full gamma-ray spectrum, so that the Pb-214\nand Bi-214 activity concentrations on the ground could be inferred from a\nlinear model fit to each spectrum. A physically motivated model was applied to\nthe data to further smooth the fits, which had the benefit of yielding\ninformation about the concentrations of the progeny in rainwater and their\napparent age, making this the first time full-spectrum modeling has been used\nfor continuous measurements of radon progeny.

We establish convergence, up to a\nsubsequence, of the numerical approximations generated by this scheme to a\nLeray-Hopf weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, without any additional\nregularity assumptions beyond square-integrable initial data.
