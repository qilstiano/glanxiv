Recently, the limiting\nhigher moments of the two-dimensional mollified SHE have been established.\nHowever, this problem in high dimensions remains unexplored to date. The main\ntheorems of this article aim to answer this question and prove some related\nproperties: (1) Our first main result, based on the spectral theorem for the\nunbounded operator, proves the divergence of the higher moments of the\nhigh-dimensional mollified SHE even when the system is strictly inside the\n$L^{2}$-regime. This phenomenon is completely opposite to its two-dimensional\ncounterpart; (2) To further differentiate the nature of the high-dimensional\ncase from the case in two dimensions, our second main result proves the\nunboundedness of the sub-limiting higher moments of the three-dimensional\nmollified SHE at the $L^{2}$-criticality. Here, the sub-limiting higher moment\nis a natural limit of the higher moment of the three-dimensional mollified SHE\nat the $L^{2}$-criticality; (3) As an application, we provide partial results\nfor the conjecture about the high-order critical regimes of the continuous\ndirected polymer.

This increase necessitates\nenhanced space domain awareness (SDA) capabilities that include state\nestimation for targets of interest. Both Earth surface-based and space-based\nobservation platforms in geosynchronous orbit or below face challenges such as\nrange, exclusion, and occlusion that hinder observation. Motivated by the need\nto place space-based observers in the cislunar space regime to overcome these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a cislunar SDA constellation design and\nanalysis framework that integrates state estimation into an optimization\nproblem for determining the placement of observers for optimal state estimation\nperformance on a set of targets. The proposed multi-observer placement\noptimization problem samples from a range of possible target orbits. Upon\nconvergence, the optimized constellation is validated against a broader set of\ntargets to assess its effectiveness. Two comparative analyses are presented to\nevaluate the effects of changes in the sensor tasking procedure and sensor\nfidelity on the optimized constellation, comparing these to a single observer\nbaseline case. The results demonstrate that the optimized constellations can\nprovide accurate state estimation for various orbit families.",

They operate by maintaining a set of vectors -- often referred to\nas the codebook -- and quantizing each encoder output to the nearest vector in\nthe codebook. However, as vector quantization is non-differentiable, the\ngradient to the encoder flows around the vector quantization layer rather than\nthrough it in a straight-through approximation. This approximation may be\nundesirable as all information from the vector quantization operation is lost.\nIn this work, we propose a way to propagate gradients through the vector\nquantization layer of VQ-VAEs. We smoothly transform each encoder output into\nits corresponding codebook vector via a rotation and rescaling linear\ntransformation that is treated as a constant during backpropagation. As a\nresult, the relative magnitude and angle between encoder output and codebook\nvector becomes encoded into the gradient as it propagates through the vector\nquantization layer and back to the encoder. Across 11 different VQ-VAE training\nparadigms, we find this restructuring improves reconstruction metrics, codebook\nutilization, and quantization error.

Capacity\nretention is a vital performance measure that is frequently utilized to assess\nwhether these batteries have approached their end-of-life. Machine learning\n(ML) offers a powerful tool for predicting capacity degradation based on past\ndata, and, potentially, prior physical knowledge, but the degree to which an ML\nprediction can be trusted is of significant practical importance in situations\nwhere consequential decisions must be made based on battery state of health.\nThis study explores the efficacy of fully Bayesian machine learning in\nforecasting battery health with the quantification of uncertainty in its\npredictions. Specifically, we implemented three probabilistic ML approaches and\nevaluated the accuracy of their predictions and uncertainty estimates: a\nstandard Gaussian process (GP), a structured Gaussian process (sGP), and a\nfully Bayesian neural network (BNN). In typical applications of GP and sGP,\ntheir hyperparameters are learned from a single sample while, in contrast, BNNs\nare typically pre-trained on an existing dataset to learn the weight\ndistributions before being used for inference. This difference in methodology\ngives the BNN an advantage in learning global trends in a dataset and makes\nBNNs a good choice when training data is available. However, we show that\npre-training can also be leveraged for GP and sGP approaches to learn the prior\ndistributions of the hyperparameters and that in the case of the pre-trained\nsGP, similar accuracy and improved uncertainty estimation compared to the BNN\ncan be achieved.

While bias in models are well-documented, less is\nknown about how these biases influence human decisions. This paper presents two\ninteractive experiments investigating the effects of partisan bias in LLMs on\npolitical opinions and decision-making. Participants interacted freely with\neither a biased liberal, biased conservative, or unbiased control model while\ncompleting these tasks. We found that participants exposed to partisan biased\nmodels were significantly more likely to adopt opinions and make decisions\nwhich matched the LLM's bias.

Structures like\nbuildings or large dense forests create interference, requiring GNSS\nreplacements for global positioning estimates. The true difficulty lies in\nreconciling the perspective difference between the ground and air images for\nacceptable localization. Taking inspiration from the autonomous driving\ncommunity, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing a birds-eye-view (BEV)\nscene representation to match and localize against an aerial map in off-road\nenvironments. We leverage contrastive learning with domain specific hard\nnegative mining to train a network to learn similar representations between the\nsynthesized BEV and the aerial map. During inference, BEVLoc guides the\nidentification of the most probable locations within the aerial map through a\ncoarse-to-fine matching strategy. Our results demonstrate promising initial\noutcomes in extremely difficult forest environments with limited semantic\ndiversity. We analyze our model's performance for coarse and fine matching,\nassessing both the raw matching capability of our model and its performance as\na GNSS replacement.

In its\noriginal framing, an ARC task requires solving a program synthesis problem over\nsmall 2D images using a few input-output training pairs. In this work, we adopt\nthe recently popular data-driven approach to the ARC and ask whether a Vision\nTransformer (ViT) can learn the implicit mapping, from input image to output\nimage, that underlies the task. We show that a ViT -- otherwise a\nstate-of-the-art model for images -- fails dramatically on most ARC tasks even\nwhen trained on one million examples per task. This points to an inherent\nrepresentational deficiency of the ViT architecture that makes it incapable of\nuncovering the simple structured mappings underlying the ARC tasks. Building on\nthese insights, we propose ViTARC, a ViT-style architecture that unlocks some\nof the visual reasoning capabilities required by the ARC. Specifically, we use\na pixel-level input representation, design a spatially-aware tokenization\nscheme, and introduce a novel object-based positional encoding that leverages\nautomatic segmentation, among other enhancements. Our task-specific ViTARC\nmodels achieve a test solve rate close to 100% on more than half of the 400\npublic ARC tasks strictly through supervised learning from input-output grids.\nThis calls attention to the importance of imbuing the powerful (Vision)\nTransformer with the correct inductive biases for abstract visual reasoning\nthat are critical even when the training data is plentiful and the mapping is\nnoise-free.

    "abstract": "Pedestrian heading tracking enables applications in pedestrian navigation,\ntraffic safety, and accessibility. Previous works, using inertial sensor fusion\nor machine learning, are limited in that they assume the phone is fixed in\nspecific orientations, hindering their generalizability. We propose a new\nheading tracking algorithm, the Orientation-Heading Alignment (OHA), which\nleverages a key insight: people tend to carry smartphones in certain ways due\nto habits, such as swinging them while walking. For each smartphone attitude\nduring this motion, OHA maps the smartphone orientation to the pedestrian\nheading and learns such mappings efficiently from coarse headings and\nsmartphone orientations. To anchor our algorithm in a practical scenario, we\napply OHA to a challenging task: predicting when pedestrians are about to cross\nthe road to improve road user safety. In particular, using 755 hours of walking\ndata collected since 2020 from 60 individuals, we develop a lightweight model\nthat operates in real-time on commodity devices to predict road crossings. Our\nevaluation shows that OHA achieves 3.4 times smaller heading errors across nine\nscenarios than existing methods. Furthermore, OHA enables the early and\naccurate detection of pedestrian crossing behavior, issuing crossing alerts\n0.35 seconds, on average, before pedestrians enter the road range.",

We performed\nvisible multicolor photometry of 2001 QJ142 using the TriCCS on the Seimei 3.8\nm telescope in February 2024. We also revisited the images taken with the\nSuprime-Cam on the Subaru 8.2 m telescope in August 2012. Results. Visible\ncolor indices of 2001 QJ142 indicate that 2001 QJ142 is a C- or X-complex\nasteroid. We detect a possible fast rotation with a period of about 10 min,\nwhich is consistent with a previous report. The geometric albedo of 2001 QJ142\nis derived to be about 0.3 from a slope of its photometric phase curve, which\nis consistent with an albedo derived from thermal observations with updated\nphysical quantities. A straightforward interpretation is that 2001 QJ142 is\neither an E- or M-type asteroid, although surface properties of such tiny\nfast-rotating asteroids are not well understood. Conclusions.

    "abstract": "Digital twinning offers a capability of effective real-time monitoring and\ncontrol, which are vital for cost-intensive experimental facilities,\nparticularly the ones where extreme conditions exist. Sparse experimental\nmeasurements collected by various diagnostic sensors are usually the only\nsource of information available during the course of a physical experiment.\nConsequently, in order to enable monitoring and control of the experiment\n(digital twinning), the ability to perform inverse analysis, facilitating the\nfull field solution reconstruction from the sparse experimental data in real\ntime, is crucial. This paper shows for the first time that it is possible to\ndirectly solve inverse problems, such as solution reconstruction, where some or\nall boundary conditions (BCs) are unknown, by purely using a finite-element\n(FE) approach, without needing to employ any traditional inverse analysis\ntechniques or any machine learning models, as is normally done in the field.\nThis novel and efficient FE-based inverse analysis framework employs a\nconventional FE discretisation, splits the loading vector into two parts\ncorresponding to the known and unknown BCs, and then defines a loss function\nbased on that split. In spite of the loading vector split, the loss function\npreserves the element connectivity. This function is minimised using a\ngradient-based optimisation. Furthermore, this paper presents a novel\nmodification of this approach, which allows it to generate a range of different\nsolutions satisfying given requirements in a controlled manner. Controlled\nmultiple solution generation in the context of inverse problems and their\nintrinsic ill-posedness is a novel notion, which has not been explored before.\nThis is done in order to potentially introduce the capability of\nsemi-autonomous system control with intermittent human intervention to the\nworkflow.",

    "abstract": "Background: Many open-source skin cancer image datasets are the result of\nclinical trials conducted in countries with lighter skin tones. Due to this\ntone imbalance, machine learning models derived from these datasets can perform\nwell at detecting skin cancer for lighter skin tones. Any tone bias in these\nmodels could introduce fairness concerns and reduce public trust in the\nartificial intelligence health field.\n  Methods: We examine a subset of images from the International Skin Imaging\nCollaboration (ISIC) archive that provide tone information. The subset has a\nsignificant tone imbalance. These imbalances could explain a model's tone bias.\nTo address this, we train models using the imbalanced dataset and a balanced\ndataset to compare against. The datasets are used to train a deep convolutional\nneural network model to classify the images as malignant or benign. We then\nevaluate the models' disparate impact, based on selection rate, relative to\ndark or light skin tone.\n  Results: Using the imbalanced dataset, we found that the model is\nsignificantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter tone resulting in\na disparate impact of 0.577. Using the balanced dataset, we found that the\nmodel is also significantly better at detecting malignant images in lighter\nversus darker tones with a disparate impact of 0.684. Using the imbalanced or\nbalanced dataset to train the model still results in a disparate impact well\nbelow the standard threshold of 0.80 which suggests the model is biased with\nrespect to skin tone.\n  Conclusion: The results show that typical skin cancer machine learning models\ncan be tone biased. These results provide evidence that diagnosis or tone\nimbalance is not the cause of the bias. Other techniques will be necessary to\nidentify and address the bias in these models, an area of future investigation.",

    "abstract": "Chemputation is the process of programming chemical robots to do experiments\nusing a universal symbolic language, but the literature can be error prone and\nhard to read due to ambiguities. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nremarkable capabilities in various domains, including natural language\nprocessing, robotic control, and more recently, chemistry. Despite significant\nadvancements in standardizing the reporting and collection of synthetic\nchemistry data, the automatic reproduction of reported syntheses remains a\nlabour-intensive task. In this work, we introduce an LLM-based chemical\nresearch agent workflow designed for the automatic validation of synthetic\nliterature procedures. Our workflow can autonomously extract synthetic\nprocedures and analytical data from extensive documents, translate these\nprocedures into universal XDL code, simulate the execution of the procedure in\na hardware-specific setup, and ultimately execute the procedure on an\nXDL-controlled robotic system for synthetic chemistry. This demonstrates the\npotential of LLM-based workflows for autonomous chemical synthesis with\nChemputers. Due to the abstraction of XDL this approach is safe, secure, and\nscalable since hallucinations will not be chemputable and the XDL can be both\nverified and encrypted. Unlike previous efforts, which either addressed only a\nlimited portion of the workflow, relied on inflexible hard-coded rules, or\nlacked validation in physical systems, our approach provides four realistic\nexamples of syntheses directly executed from synthetic literature. We\nanticipate that our workflow will significantly enhance automation in\nrobotically driven synthetic chemistry research, streamline data extraction,\nimprove the reproducibility, scalability, and safety of synthetic and\nexperimental chemistry.",

The goal is to select a cost-efficient set of templates that is\nrobust with respect to uncertainty in the work to be performed in the\noperational phase. A set of templates is deemed robust when few excess duties\nare required to cover all work in the operational planning phase.

In such a\nglobal system, in order to separately characterize the photon inside and\noutside cavity, we demonstrate a first-principle derivation of a coherent\ncavity-reservoir coupling function for cavities with mirrors consisting of a\nstack of dielectric layers. In particular, we show that due to the effects\ninduced by the multilayer nature of the cavity mirror, even in the standardly\ndefined high-finesse cavity regime, the cavity-reservoir system description\nmight differ from the one where the structure of the mirror is neglected. Based\non this, we define a generalized cavity response function and a\ncavity-reservoir coupling function, which account for the longitudinal\ngeometric structure of the cavity mirror. This allows us to define an effective\nreflectivity for the cavity with a multilayer mirror as if it was sitting in a\nwell-defined effective mirror plane. We estimate the error of such a definition\nby considering cavities of different lengths and mirror structures.

For the\nfirst algorithm, under a uniform sampling with replacement model for the\nobserved distance entries, we demonstrate that, with high probability, a\nRiemannian gradient-like algorithm on the manifold of rank-$r$ matrices\nconverges linearly to the true solution, given initialization via a one-step\nhard thresholding.

In contrast, the BPNN model exhibited faster training times and higher\ncomputational efficiency on smaller datasets, though it performed less\neffectively on larger datasets.

    "abstract": "Indoor navigation is challenging due to the absence of satellite positioning.\nThis challenge is manifold greater for Visually Impaired People (VIPs) who lack\nthe ability to get information from wayfinding signage. Other sensor signals\n(e.g., Bluetooth and LiDAR) can be used to create turn-by-turn navigation\nsolutions with position updates for users. Unfortunately, these solutions\nrequire tags to be installed all around the environment or the use of fairly\nexpensive hardware. Moreover, these solutions require a high degree of manual\ninvolvement that raises costs, thus hampering scalability. We propose an image\ndataset and associated image-centric solution called NaVIP towards visual\nintelligence that is infrastructure-free and task-scalable, and can assist VIPs\nin understanding their surroundings. Specifically, we start by curating\nlarge-scale phone camera data in a four-floor research building, with 300K\nimages, to lay the foundation for creating an image-centric indoor navigation\nand exploration solution for inclusiveness. Every image is labelled with\nprecise 6DoF camera poses, details of indoor PoIs, and descriptive captions to\nassist VIPs. We benchmark on two main aspects: 1) positioning system and 2)\nexploration support, prioritizing training scalability and real-time inference,\nto validate the prospect of image-based solution towards indoor navigation.

    "abstract": "Cooperative mission planning for heterogeneous teams of mobile robots\npresents a unique set of challenges, particularly when operating under\ncommunication constraints and limited computational resources. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Cooperative and Asynchronous Transformer-based\nMission Planning (CATMiP) framework, which leverages multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) to coordinate distributed decision making among agents with\ndiverse sensing, motion, and actuation capabilities, operating under sporadic\nad hoc communication. A Class-based Macro-Action Decentralized Partially\nObservable Markov Decision Process (CMacDec-POMDP) is also formulated to\neffectively model asynchronous decision-making for heterogeneous teams of\nagents. The framework utilizes an asynchronous centralized training and\ndistributed execution scheme, enabled by the proposed Asynchronous Multi-Agent\nTransformer (AMAT) architecture. This design allows a single trained model to\ngeneralize to larger environments and accommodate varying team sizes and\ncompositions. We evaluate CATMiP in a 2D grid-world simulation environment and\ncompare its performance against planning-based exploration methods. Results\ndemonstrate CATMiP's superior efficiency, scalability, and robustness to\ncommunication dropouts and input noise, highlighting its potential for\nreal-world heterogeneous mobile robot systems.

To this end, this work\nintroduces algorithms tailored for communication-efficient Federated Group\nDistributionally Robust Optimization (FGDRO).

Error tolerance is a persistent\nchallenge for implementing such tests: we need a test that not only can be\npassed by an efficient quantum prover, but one that can be passed by a prover\nthat exhibits a certain amount of computational error. (Brakerski et al. 2018)\nintroduced an innovative two-round proof of quantumness based on the Learning\nWith Errors (LWE) assumption. However, one of the steps in their protocol (the\npre-image test) has low tolerance for error. In this work we present a proof of\nquantumness which maintains the same circuit structure as (Brakerski et al.\n2018) while improving the robustness for noise. Our protocol is based on\ncryptographically hiding an extended Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state\nwithin a sequence of classical bits. Asymptotically, our protocol allows the\ntotal probability of error within the circuit to be as high as $1 - O (\n\\lambda^{-C} )$, where $\\lambda$ is the security parameter and $C$ is a\nconstant that can be made arbitrarily large. As part of the proof of this\nresult, we also prove an uncertainty principle over finite abelian groups which\nmay be of independent interest.",

We investigate how the allocation\nof antennas-to-base stations (BSs) affects cooperative sensing and cooperative\ncommunication performance.

Regarding\nsensing performance, we investigate three localization methods:\nangle-of-arrival (AOA)-based, time-of-flight (TOF)-based, and a hybrid approach\ncombining both AOA and TOF measurements, for critically appraising their\neffects on ISAC network performance. Our analysis shows that in networks having\nN ISAC nodes following a Poisson point process, the localization accuracy of\nTOF-based methods follows a \\ln^2 N scaling law (explicitly, the Cramer-Rao\nlower bound (CRLB) reduces with \\ln^2 N). The AOA-based methods follow a \\ln N\nscaling law, while the hybrid methods scale as a\\ln^2 N + b\\ln N, where a and b\nrepresent parameters related to TOF and AOA measurements, respectively. The\ndifference between these scaling laws arises from the distinct ways in which\nmeasurement results are converted into the target location.

The Neutron star Interior\nComposition ExploreR (NICER) tracks X-ray hotspots on rotating NSs and is able\nto infer precise information about the compactness of the star. Gravitational\nwaves carry information about the tidal deformability (related to the tidal\nLove number) of neutron stars, which has been measured by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA\ncollaboration. These two observables enjoy an approximately universal property\nbetween each other that is insensitive to the equations of state (the\n\"universal Love-C relation\"). In this paper, we focus on deriving two analytic\nexpressions for the Love-C relations that are ready-to-use and improve upon\nprevious analytic expressions. The first model is inspired by a Newtonian\npolytrope, whose perturbation to the gravitational potential can be found\nanalytically. We extend this Newtonian model to the relativistic regime by\nproviding a quadratic fit to the gravitational potential perturbation against\nstellar compactness. The second model makes use of the Tolman VII model and\nadopts a spectral expansion with Chebyshev polynomials, which converges faster\nthan the Taylor expansions used in previous work. We find that the first model\nprovides a more accurate description of the Love-C relation for realistic\nneutron stars than the second model, and it provides the best expression among\nall other analytic relations studied here in terms of describing the averaged\nnumerical Love-C relation. These new models are not only useful in practice,\nbut they also show the power and importance of analytic modeling of neutron\nstars.",

(2022)\nwe tested this scenario by quantifying the fraction of recently and rapidly\nquenched post-starbursts (PSBs) in a sample of post-merger galaxies identified\nin the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS). With our\nrecent development of the Multi-Model Merger Identifier (MUMMI) neural network\nensemble (Ferreira et al. 2024a,b), we are now additionally able to predict the\ntime since coalescence (T_PM) for the UNIONS post-merger galaxies up to T_PM =\n1.8 Gyr, allowing us to further dissect the merger sequence and measure more\nprecisely when quenching occurs. Based on a sample of 5927 z<0.3 post-mergers\nidentified in UNIONS, we find that the post-coalescence population evolves from\none dominated by star-forming (and starbursting) galaxies at 0 < T_PM < 0.16\nGyr, through to a population that is dominated by quenched galaxies by T_PM ~\n1.5 Gyr. We find a PSB excess throughout the post-merger regime, but with a\nclear peak at 0.16 < T_PM < 0.48 Gyr. In this post-merger time range PSBs are\nmore common than in control galaxies by factors of 30-100, an excess that drops\nsharply at longer times since merger. We also quantify the fraction of PSBs\nthat are mergers and find that the majority (75%) of classically selected E+A\nare identified as mergers, with a lower merger fraction (60%) amongst PCA\nselected PSBs. Our results demonstrate that 1) galaxy-galaxy interactions can\nlead to rapid post-merger quenching within 0.5 Gyr of coalescence, 2) the\nmajority of (but not all) PSBs at low z are linked to mergers and 3) quenching\npathways are diverse, with different PSB selection techniques likely\nidentifying galaxies quenched by different physical processes with an\nadditional dependence on stellar mass.",

Current approaches\nprimarily apply graph-based networks to extract framewise, whole-body-level\nmotion representations, and use one-hot encoded labels for model optimization.\nHowever, whole-body motion representations do not capture fine-grained\npart-level motion representations and the one-hot encoded labels neglect the\nintrinsic semantic relationships within the language-based action definitions.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel method named Language-assisted\nHuman Part Motion Representation Learning (LPL), which contains a Disentangled\nPart Motion Encoder (DPE) to extract dual-level (i.e., part and whole-body)\nmotion representations and a Language-assisted Distribution Alignment (LDA)\nstrategy for optimizing spatial relations within representations. Specifically,\nafter part-aware skeleton encoding via DPE, LDA generates dual-level action\ndescriptions to construct a textual embedding space with the help of a\nlarge-scale language model. Then, LDA motivates the alignment of the embedding\nspace between text descriptions and motions. This alignment allows LDA not only\nto enhance intra-class compactness but also to transfer the language-encoded\nsemantic correlations among actions to skeleton-based motion learning.\nMoreover, we propose a simple yet efficient Semantic Offset Adapter to smooth\nthe cross-domain misalignment. Our experiments indicate that LPL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various datasets (e.g., +4.4\\% Accuracy,\n+5.6\\% F1 on the PKU-MMD dataset).

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have gained attention for enhancing\ninterpretability by mapping inputs to intermediate concepts before making final\npredictions. However, CBMs often suffer from information leakage, where\nadditional input data, not captured by the concepts, is used to improve task\nperformance, complicating the interpretation of downstream predictions. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel approach for training both joint and sequential\nCBMs that allows us to identify and control leakage using decision trees. Our\nmethod quantifies leakage by comparing the decision paths of hard CBMs with\ntheir soft, leaky counterparts. Specifically, we show that soft leaky CBMs\nextend the decision paths of hard CBMs, particularly in cases where concept\ninformation is incomplete. Using this insight, we develop a technique to better\ninspect and manage leakage, isolating the subsets of data most affected by\nthis.

At Meta's\nscale, the responsibility appropriately and necessarily falls back on the\nengineer writing and reviewing the code. To address this challenge, we\ndeveloped models of diff risk scores (DRS) to determine how likely a diff is to\ncause a SEV, i.e., a severe fault that impacts end-users. Assuming that SEVs\nare only caused by diffs, a naive model could randomly gate X% of diffs from\nlanding, which would automatically catch X% of SEVs on average. However, we\naimed to build a model that can capture Y% of SEVs by gating X% of diffs, where\nY >> X. By training the model on historical data on diffs that have caused SEVs\nin the past, we can predict the riskiness of an outgoing diff to cause a SEV.\nDiffs that are beyond a particular threshold of risk can then be gated. We have\nfour types of gating: no gating (green), weekend gating (weekend), medium\nimpact on end-users (yellow), and high impact on end-users (red). The input\nparameter for our models is the level of gating, and the outcome measure is the\nnumber of captured SEVs. Our research approaches include a logistic regression\nmodel, a BERT-based model, and generative LLMs. Our baseline regression model\ncaptures 18.7%, 27.9%, and 84.6% of SEVs while respectively gating the top 5%\n(weekend), 10% (yellow), and 50% (red) of risky diffs. The BERT-based model,\nStarBERT, only captures 0.61x, 0.85x, and 0.81x as many SEVs as the logistic\nregression for the weekend, yellow, and red gating zones, respectively. The\ngenerative LLMs, iCodeLlama-34B and iDiffLlama-13B, when risk-aligned, capture\nmore SEVs than the logistic regression model in production: 1.40x, 1.52x,\n1.05x, respectively.",

However, several key challenges hinder its broader application. First,\nmany RL methods rely on online learning, which requires either real-world\nhardware or advanced simulation environments--both of which can be costly,\ntime-consuming, and impractical. Offline reinforcement learning offers a\nsolution, enabling models to be trained without ongoing access to physical\nrobots or simulations.\n  A second challenge is learning multi-goal tasks, where robots must achieve\nmultiple objectives simultaneously. This adds complexity to the training\nprocess, as the model must generalize across different goals. At the same time,\ntransformer architectures have gained significant popularity across various\ndomains, including reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "At Levels 2 and 3 of autonomous driving defined by the Society of Auto-motive\nEngineers, drivers must take on certain driving responsibilities, and automated\ndriving must sometimes yield to human control. This situation can occur in real\ntime due to uncertainties in sensor measurements caused by environmental\nfactors like fog or smoke. To address this challenge, we propose a method to\nmanage real-time sensor uncertainties in autonomous vehicles by monitoring\nsensor conflicts and dynamically adjusting control authority to maintain safe\noperation. However, to achieve this, we have introduced a novel metric called\nthe Degree of Conflicts (DoC), which quantifies the conflict between real-time\nsensor data by measuring the differences between data from multiple sensors.\nOur approach aims to demonstrate the importance of selecting an appropriate DoC\nthreshold for transferring control between the automation agent and the human\ndriver. The results have shown that choosing the correct DoC threshold can\nenhance safety by promptly handing over the driving control from the automation\nsystem to the human driver in challenging conditions.",

However, despite advancements in spaceborne LiDAR technology,\ndata for northern high latitudes remain limited due to orbital and sampling\nconstraints. This study introduces a methodology for generating spatially\ncontinuous, high-resolution canopy height and uncertainty estimates using Deep\nLearning Regression models. We integrate multi-source, multi-seasonal satellite\ndata from Sentinel-1, Landsat, and ALOS-PALSAR-2, with spaceborne GEDI LiDAR as\nreference data. Our approach was tested in Ontario, Canada, and validated with\nairborne LiDAR, demonstrating strong performance. The best results were\nachieved by incorporating seasonal Sentinel-1 and Landsat features alongside\nPALSAR data, yielding an R-square of 0.72, RMSE of 3.43 m, and bias of 2.44 m.\nUsing seasonal data instead of summer-only data improved variability by 10%,\nreduced error by 0.45 m, and decreased bias by 1 m. The deep learning model's\nweighting strategy notably reduced errors in tall canopy height estimates\ncompared to a recent global model, though it overestimated lower canopy\nheights. Uncertainty maps highlighted greater uncertainty near forest edges,\nwhere GEDI measurements are prone to errors and SAR data may encounter\nbackscatter issues like foreshortening, layover, and shadow. This study\nenhances canopy height estimation techniques in areas lacking spaceborne LiDAR\ncoverage, providing essential tools for forestry, environmental monitoring, and\ncarbon stock estimation.",

    "abstract": "Recent research into buffet in the transonic flow regime has been focused on\na limited number of proprietary airfoil geometries and has mainly considered\nparametric variations in Mach number and angle of attack. In contrast,\nrelatively little is known about the sensitivity of buffet frequencies and\namplitudes to geometric properties of airfoils. In the present contribution, an\nairfoil geometry construction method based on a small number of parameters is\ndeveloped. The resulting airfoils and computational grids are high-order\ncontinuous everywhere except at the trailing edge corners. The effects of four\nkey geometric parameters, defined by local extrema of coordinates on the\nairfoil at the design condition and denoted as 'crest' points, are studied\nusing large-eddy simulation, considering both free-transitional and tripped\nboundary layers. For both states of the boundary layer, buffet amplitude and\nfrequency are found to be highly sensitive to the axial and vertical position\nof the suction-side crest point, while the vertical crest position on the\npressure side affects the mean lift. The present work confirms that buffet can\nappear for free-transitional (laminar buffet) and tripped conditions (turbulent\nbuffet) with similar sensitivities. For test cases near onset conditions\nintermediate-frequency phenomena have been observed, which were linked to\nunsteadiness of separation bubbles. Frequencies scaling based on mean-flow\nproperties of the separation bubble were shown to be in good agreement with\nprevious findings on different airfoil geometries in Zauner et al.

To enhance efficiency and privacy, we propose a low-rank\ncommunication scheme for algorithms like FedGCN that require pre-training\ncommunication, accelerating both the pre-training and training phases.\nExtensive experiments benchmark FGL algorithms on three major graph learning\ntasks and demonstrate FedGraph as the first efficient FGL framework to support\nencrypted low-rank communication and scale to graphs with 100 million nodes.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Network (DNN) based classifiers have recently been used for the\nmodulation classification of RF signals. These classifiers have shown\nimpressive performance gains relative to conventional methods, however, they\nare vulnerable to imperceptible (low-power) adversarial attacks. Some of the\nprominent defense approaches include adversarial training (AT) and randomized\nsmoothing (RS). While AT increases robustness in general, it fails to provide\nresilience against previously unseen adaptive attacks. Other approaches, such\nas Randomized Smoothing (RS), which injects noise into the input, address this\nshortcoming by providing provable certified guarantees against arbitrary\nattacks, however, they tend to sacrifice accuracy.\n  In this paper, we study the problem of designing robust DNN-based modulation\nclassifiers that can provide provable defense against arbitrary attacks without\nsignificantly sacrificing accuracy. To this end, we first analyze the spectral\ncontent of commonly studied attacks on modulation classifiers for the benchmark\nRadioML dataset. We observe that spectral signatures of un-perturbed RF signals\nare highly localized, whereas attack signals tend to be spread out in\nfrequency. To exploit this spectral heterogeneity, we propose Filtered\nRandomized Smoothing (FRS), a novel defense which combines spectral filtering\ntogether with randomized smoothing. FRS can be viewed as a strengthening of RS\nby leveraging the specificity (spectral Heterogeneity) inherent to the\nmodulation classification problem. In addition to providing an approach to\ncompute the certified accuracy of FRS, we also provide a comprehensive set of\nsimulations on the RadioML dataset to show the effectiveness of FRS and show\nthat it significantly outperforms existing defenses including AT and RS in\nterms of accuracy on both attacked and benign signals.",

    "abstract": "Batched Bayesian optimization (BO) can accelerate molecular design by\nefficiently identifying top-performing compounds from a large chemical library.\nExisting acquisition strategies for batch design in BO aim to balance\nexploration and exploitation. This often involves optimizing non-additive batch\nacquisition functions, necessitating approximation via myopic construction\nand/or diversity heuristics. In this work, we propose an acquisition strategy\nfor discrete optimization that is motivated by pure exploitation, qPO\n(multipoint Probability of Optimality). qPO maximizes the probability that the\nbatch includes the true optimum, which is expressible as the sum over\nindividual acquisition scores and thereby circumvents the combinatorial\nchallenge of optimizing a batch acquisition function. We differentiate the\nproposed strategy from parallel Thompson sampling and discuss how it implicitly\ncaptures diversity. Finally, we apply our method to the model-guided\nexploration of large chemical libraries and provide empirical evidence that it\nis competitive with and complements other state-of-the-art methods in batched\nBayesian optimization.",

This distinction explains the poor performance of current\nmethods in multi-hop queries, as they primarily focus on editing shallow layers\nwith single-hop edit prompts, leaving deeper layers unchanged. To address this,\nwe propose IFMET, a novel locate-then-edit KE approach designed to edit both\nshallow and deep MLP layers. Beyond single-hop editing prompts, IFMET further\nincorporates multi-hop editing prompts to locate and modify knowledge across\ndifferent stages of reasoning.

    "abstract": "Gaussian graphical models (GGMs) are widely used for recovering the\nconditional independence structure among random variables.

For example, in\nco-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, both the mean expression\nlevel of genes as well as their pairwise conditional independence structure may\nbe adjusted by genetic variants local to those genes. Existing methods to\nestimate covariate-adjusted GGMs either allow only the mean to depend on\ncovariates or suffer from poor scaling assumptions due to the inherent\nnon-convexity of simultaneously estimating the mean and precision matrix. In\nthis paper, we propose a convex formulation that jointly estimates the\ncovariate-adjusted mean and precision matrix by utilizing the natural\nparametrization of the multivariate Gaussian likelihood. This convexity yields\ntheoretically better performance as the sparsity and dimension of the\ncovariates grow large relative to the number of samples.

We analyze the phase diagram of the system varying\nthe temperature $T>0$, the chemical potentials, as well as interparticle and\nspin-orbit interaction couplings. Our results indicate that, for Rashba- and\nWeyl-type spin-orbit couplings, condensates featuring ordering wavevector\n$\\vec{Q}\\neq \\vec{0}$ are fragile with respect to thermal fluctuations and, at\n$T>0$, the only stable thermodynamic phases involving the Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) are those of uniform type with $\\vec{Q}=\\vec{0}$. On the other\nhand, presence of the spin-orbit coupling stabilizes the $\\vec{Q}=\\vec{0}$ BEC\nstate at any dimensionality $d>1$ and modifies either the order or the\nuniversality class of the corresponding phase transition. We emphasize the\nsingular nature of the limit of vanishing spin-orbit interaction coupling $v$,\nsizable shifts of the phase boundaries upon varying $v$, as well as the role of\nthe relative magnitudes of the interparticle interaction couplings for the\ncharacter of the condensation transition.",

Standard PSF subtraction methods use techniques\nbased on a low-rank approximation to separate the rotating planet signal from\nthe quasi-static speckles, and rely on signal-to-noise ratio maps to detect the\nplanet. These steps do not interact or feed each other, leading to potential\nlimitations in the accuracy and efficiency of exoplanet detection. We aim to\ndevelop a novel approach that iteratively finds the flux of the planet and the\nlow-rank approximation of quasi-static signals, in an attempt to improve upon\ncurrent PSF subtraction techniques. In this study, we extend the standard L2\nnorm minimization paradigm to an L1 norm minimization framework to better\naccount for noise statistics in the high contrast images. Then, we propose a\nnew method, referred to as Alternating Minimization Algorithm with Trajectory,\nthat makes a more advanced use of estimating the low-rank approximation of the\nspeckle field and the planet flux by alternating between them and utilizing\nboth L1 and L2 norms. For the L1 norm minimization, we propose using L1 norm\nlow-rank approximation, a low-rank approximation computed using an exact\nblock-cyclic coordinate descent method, while we use randomized singular value\ndecomposition for the L2 norm minimization. Additionally, we enhance the\nvisibility of the planet signal using a likelihood ratio as a postprocessing\nstep. Numerical experiments performed on a VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS dataset show the\npotential of AMAT to improve upon the existing approaches in terms of higher\nS/N, sensitivity limits, and ROC curves. Moreover, for a systematic comparison,\nwe used datasets from the exoplanet data challenge to compare our algorithm to\nother algorithms in the challenge, and AMAT with likelihood ratio map performs\nbetter than most algorithms tested on the exoplanet data challenge.",

In fact, each model was\ntrained with early stopping, suitable in case of overfitting, and the higher\nnumber of epochs in the proposed method demonstrates that early stopping did\nnot detect overfitting, and consequently, the learning was optimal.",

Existing approaches primarily detect the presence of\nhallucinations but lack a nuanced understanding of their types and\nmanifestations. In this paper, we first introduce a comprehensive taxonomy that\ncategorizes the common hallucinations in mathematical reasoning task into six\ntypes: fabrication, factual inconsistency, context inconsistency, instruction\ninconsistency, logical inconsistency, and logical error. We then propose FG-PRM\n(Fine-Grained Process Reward Model), an augmented model designed to detect and\nmitigate hallucinations in a fine-grained, step-level manner. To address the\nlimitations of manually labeling training data, we propose an automated method\nfor generating fine-grained hallucination data using LLMs. By injecting\nhallucinations into reasoning steps of correct solutions, we create a diverse\nand balanced synthetic dataset for training FG-PRM, which consists of six\nspecialized Process Reward Models (PRMs), each tailored to detect a specific\nhallucination type. Our FG-PRM demonstrates superior performance across two key\ntasks: 1) Fine-grained hallucination detection: classifying hallucination types\nfor each reasoning step; and 2) Verification: ranking multiple LLM-generated\noutputs to select the most accurate solution, mitigating reasoning\nhallucinations. Our experiments show that FG-PRM outperforms ChatGPT-3.5 and\nClaude-3 on fine-grained hallucination detection and substantially boosts the\nperformance of LLMs on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks.",

It overcomes the stability and efficiency issues of two-step\napproaches, which typically involve first estimating the reward function and\nthen optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization (PPO). Since RLHF\nis essentially an optimization problem, and it is well-known that momentum\ntechniques can accelerate optimization both theoretically and empirically, a\nnatural question arises: Can RLHF be accelerated by momentum? This paper\nanswers this question in the affirmative. In detail, we first show that the\niterative preference optimization method can be viewed as a proximal point\nmethod. Based on this observation, we propose a general Accelerated Preference\nOptimization (APO) framework, which unifies many existing preference\noptimization algorithms and employs Nesterov's momentum technique to speed up\nthe alignment of LLMs. Theoretically, we demonstrate that APO can achieve a\nfaster convergence rate than the standard iterative preference optimization\nmethods, including DPO and Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPPO).\nEmpirically, we show the superiority of APO over DPO, iterative DPO, and other\nstrong baselines for RLHF on the AlpacaEval 2.0 benchmark.",

Thin (10 nm) and\nthick (60 nm) films of pristine BST and indium-doped BST\n(In0.14(Bi0.3Sb0.7)1.86Te3) were synthesized using pulsed laser deposition. The\nelectronic properties were characterized through low-frequency noise\nspectroscopy and temperature-dependent resistance (R-T) measurements. For the\n10 nm films, R-T analysis revealed that indium doping shifts the thermal\nactivation energy by approximately 100 meV. This doping also suppresses a\nshallow impurity band at 72 meV, a finding corroborated by 1/f noise\nmeasurements. In the 60 nm films, noise spectroscopy was used to probe deep\ndefect states, where indium doping was found to increase the activation energy\nfrom 292.3 meV to 392 meV -- a consistent shift of 100 meV. These findings\ndemonstrate that indium doping is an effective method for systematically\nmodifying both shallow and deep defect states, enhancing the insulating\nproperties and offering a mechanism to engineer the electronic behavior of\ntopological insulators for advanced electronic applications where noise\nreduction is crucial.",

It\nhas been shown that this is indeed the case for the energy shear tensor of the\nvast majority of protohaloes. At generic positions in a Gaussian random field,\nthe trace and traceless parts of the tensor are independent of one another.\nHere we show that, on the contrary, in positive definite matrices they\ncorrelate strongly, and these correlations are very similar to those exhibited\nby protohaloes. Moreover, while positive-definiteness ensures that an object\nwill collapse, it does not specify when. Previous work has shown that the trace\nof the energy tensor -- the energy overdensity -- exhibits significant scatter\nin its values, but must lie above a critical `threshold' value for the halo to\ncollapse by today. We show that suitable combinations of the eigenvalues of the\ntraceless part are able to explain a substantial part of the scatter of the\ntrace. These variables provide an efficient way to parameterise the initial\nvalue of the energy overdensity, allowing us to formulate an educated guess for\nthe threshold of collapse. We validate our ansatz by measuring the distribution\nof several secondary properties of protohaloes, finding good agreement with our\nanalytical predictions.",

In particular, at temperature zero, we prove that if a repeating\n(cyclic) token sequence is observed at the output beyond the context size, then\nthe LLM does not halt.\n  We demonstrate non-halting queries in many experiments performed in base\nunaligned models where repeating prompts immediately lead to a non-halting\ncyclic behavior as predicted by the analysis. Further, we develop a simple\nrecipe that takes the same fixed points observed in the base model and creates\na prompt structure to target aligned models. We demonstrate the recipe's\nsuccess in sending every major model released over the past year into a\nnon-halting state with the same simple prompt even over higher temperatures.\nFurther, we devise an experiment with 100 randomly selected tokens and show\nthat the recipe to create non-halting queries succeeds with high success rates\nranging from 97% for GPT-4o to 19% for Gemini Pro 1.5. These results show that\nthe proposed adversarial recipe succeeds in bypassing alignment at one to two\norders of magnitude higher rates compared to earlier reports.\n  We also study gradient-based direct inversion using ARCA to craft new short\nprompts to induce the non-halting state.

The phenomenon has been observed as widely detrimental in hydraulic\nand marine applications like propellers and pumps, while also accelerating the\nsub-processes involved for bio-diesel production. Modelling cavitating flows\nhas been extremely challenging owing to the resulting flow unsteadiness, phase\ntransition and the cavitation-turbulence interaction. Standard methods to model\nturbulence like Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS) and hybrid\nRANS-Large Eddy Simulations (LES) models are unable to reproduce the local\nturbulence dynamics observed in cavitating flow experiments. In an effort to\nfacilitate the development of accurate RANS modelling procedures for cavitating\nflows, a data-driven approach devised by integrating Gene-Expression\nProgramming (GEP) into a traditional RANS approach, without continuous RANS\nmodel feedback is proposed. The GEP algorithm is employed to obtain an\nadditional corrective term, composed of flow variables derived directly from a\nbaseline URANS cavitating flow calculation to be fit directly in the Boussinesq\napproximation. In addition, an optimizer based on the BFGS algorithm is\nemployed on top of the GEP algorithm to ensure the solution is independent of\nthe uncertainties associated with GEP. To evaluate the complexity of the model,\nwe compare the approach with a more elementary linear regression technique. The\nGEP-CFD method is then used to train two expressions, for the Reynolds shear\nstress and the Turbulent Kinetic Energy simultaneously.

This\npaper shows how to leverage the fundamental theorem of the calculus of\nvariations to design deep neural networks to solve functional optimization\nwithout requiring training data (e.g., ground-truth optimal solutions). Our\napproach is particularly crucial when the solution is a function defined over\nan unknown interval or support\\textemdash such as in minimum-time control\nproblems. By incorporating the necessary conditions satisfied by the optimal\nfunction solution, as derived from the calculus of variation, in the design of\nthe deep architecture, CalVNet leverages overparameterized neural networks to\nlearn these optimal functions directly. We validate CalVNet by showing that,\nwithout relying on ground-truth data and simply incorporating first principles,\nit successfully derives the Kalman filter for linear filtering, the bang-bang\noptimal control for minimum-time problems, and finds geodesics on manifolds.\nOur results demonstrate that CalVNet can be trained in an unsupervised manner,\nwithout relying on ground-truth data, establishing a promising framework for\naddressing general, potentially unsolved functional optimization problems that\nstill lack analytical solutions.",

In this\nwork, we introduce a Compositional Generalization Challenge for Graph-based\nCommonsense Reasoning (CGGC) that goes beyond previous evaluations that are\nbased on sequences or tree structures - and instead involves a reasoning graph:\nIt requires models to generate a natural sentence based on given concepts and a\ncorresponding reasoning graph, where the presented graph involves a previously\nunseen combination of relation types. To master this challenge, models need to\nlearn how to reason over relation tupels within the graph, and how to compose\nthem when conceptualizing a verbalization. We evaluate seven well-known LLMs\nusing in-context learning and find that performant LLMs still struggle in\ncompositional generalization. We investigate potential causes of this gap by\nanalyzing the structures of reasoning graphs, and find that different\nstructures present varying levels of difficulty for compositional\ngeneralization. Arranging the order of demonstrations according to the\nstructures' difficulty shows that organizing samples in an easy-to-hard schema\nenhances the compositional generalization ability of LLMs.",

Motivated by these issues, we\ninvestigate the MoE-LLMs and make two key observations: a) different experts\nexhibit varying behaviors on activation reconstruction error, routing scores,\nand activated frequencies, highlighting their differing importance, and b) not\nall tokens are equally important -- only a small subset is critical. Building\non these insights, we propose MC, a training-free Mixture-Compressor for\nMoE-LLMs, which leverages the significance of both experts and tokens to\nachieve an extreme compression. First, to mitigate storage and loading\noverheads, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization, which\nformulates the adaptive bit-width allocation as a Linear Programming problem,\nwhere the objective function balances multi-factors reflecting the importance\nof each expert. Additionally, we develop Online Dynamic Pruning, which\nidentifies important tokens to retain and dynamically select activated experts\nfor other tokens during inference to optimize efficiency while maintaining\nperformance. Our MC integrates static quantization and dynamic pruning to\ncollaboratively achieve extreme compression for MoE-LLMs with less accuracy\nloss, ensuring an optimal trade-off between performance and efficiency.\nExtensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach. For instance,\nat 2.54 bits, MC compresses 76.6% of the model, with only a 3.8% average\naccuracy loss. During dynamic inference, we further reduce activated parameters\nby 15%, with a performance drop of less than 0.6%.",

    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion has achieved state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nor approaching autoregressive models on standard benchmarks. In this work, we\nintroduce Discrete Diffusion with Planned Denoising (DDPD), a novel framework\nthat separates the generation process into two models: a planner and a\ndenoiser. At inference time, the planner selects which positions to denoise\nnext by identifying the most corrupted positions in need of denoising,\nincluding both initially corrupted and those requiring additional refinement.\nThis plan-and-denoise approach enables more efficient reconstruction during\ngeneration by iteratively identifying and denoising corruptions in the optimal\norder. DDPD outperforms traditional denoiser-only mask diffusion methods,\nachieving superior results on language modeling benchmarks such as text8,\nOpenWebText, and token-based image generation on ImageNet $256 \\times 256$.\nNotably, in language modeling, DDPD significantly reduces the performance gap\nbetween diffusion-based and autoregressive methods in terms of generative\nperplexity.

    "abstract": "While humans can successfully navigate using abstractions, ignoring details\nthat are irrelevant to the task at hand, most existing robotic applications\nrequire the maintenance of a detailed environment representation which consumes\na significant amount of sensing, computing, and storage. These issues are\nparticularly important in a resource-constrained setting with limited power\nbudget. Deep learning methods can learn from prior experience to abstract\nknowledge of unknown environments, and use it to execute tasks (e.g., frontier\nexploration, object search, or scene understanding) more efficiently. We\npropose BoxMap, a Detection-Transformer-based architecture that takes advantage\nof the structure of the sensed partial environment to update a topological\ngraph of the environment as a set of semantic entities (e.g. rooms and doors)\nand their relations (e.g. connectivity). These predictions from low-level\nmeasurements can then be leveraged to achieve high-level goals with lower\ncomputational costs than methods based on detailed representations. As an\nexample application, we consider a robot equipped with a 2-D laser scanner\ntasked with exploring a residential building. Our BoxMap representation scales\nquadratically with the number of rooms (with a small constant), resulting in\nsignificant savings over a full geometric map. Moreover, our high-level\ntopological representation results in 30.9% shorter trajectories in the\nexploration task with respect to a standard method.",

Despite extensive study of their\ncharacteristic V-shaped SEDs, the nature of LRDs remains unknown. We present a\nnew analysis of the NIRSpec/PRISM spectrum of A2744-QSO1, a triply imaged LRD\nat $z=7.04$ from the UNCOVER survey. The spectrum shows a strong Balmer break\nand broad Balmer emission lines, both of which are difficult to explain with\nmodels invoking exclusively AGN or stellar contributions. Our fiducial model\ndecomposes the spectrum into a post-starburst galaxy dominating the UV-optical\ncontinuum and a reddened AGN being sub-dominant at all wavelength and\ncontributing at $\\sim20\\%$ level. However, our most credible model infers a\nstellar mass of $M_\\star\\approx 4\\times10^9\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ within a radius\nof $r_\\mathrm{e}<30\\,$pc, driving its central density to the highest among\nobservations to date. This high central density could be explained if\nA2744-QSO-1 is the early-forming core of a modern-day massive elliptical galaxy\nthat later puffed up via the inside-out growth channel. The models also\nnecessitate an unusually steep dust law to preserve the strong break strength,\nthough this steepness may be explained by a deficit of large dust grains. It is\nalso probable that these challenges reflect our ignorance of A2744-QSO1's true\nnature. Future variability and reverberation mapping studies could help\ndisentangle the galaxy and AGN contribution to the continuum, and deeper redder\nobservations could also unveil the dust properties in LRDs.",

Here we report on a sample of 55 massive runaway stars ejected\nfrom the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Astrometric analysis\nwith Gaia reveals two channels of dynamically ejected runaways. The first\nchannel ejects massive stars in all directions and is consistent with dynamical\ninteractions during and after the birth of R136. The second channel launches\nstars in a preferred direction and may be related to a cluster interaction. We\nfind that 23-33% of the most luminous stars initially born in R136 are\nrunaways. Model predictions have significantly underestimated the dynamical\nescape fraction of massive stars.

This comparison shows that gaseous counter-rotation correlates with\nweak rotation in the stellar component, high central concentration of star\nforming regions, if present, and a higher fraction of central low ionization\nemission regions (cLIER) galaxies. The light distributions of the stellar\ncomponents, dust and HI content (both low), and overall suppressed star\nformation rates are similar for both samples and seem typical for the\nmorphological class. We claim that elliptical and about half of the lenticular\ncounterrotators, those with weak rotation in the stellar component in the\noutskirts and central regions, likely have a major merger origin for the gas\nacquisition, and the other half of lenticulars, with stronger stellar rotation,\nmay have a minor merger or pure gas accretion origin.",

To clarify some of the aspect of this process, we report\nthe results of long-term (\\ie $\\sim~110\\,{\\rm ms}$) state-of-the-art\ngeneral-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the inspiral and\nmerger of a BNS system of magnetized stars. We find that after $\\sim~50\\,{\\rm\nms}$ from the merger, an $\\alpha$-$\\Omega$~dynamo driven by the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI) sets-in in the densest regions of the disk\nand leads to the breakout of the magnetic-field lines from the accretion disk\naround the remnant. The breakout, which can be associated with the violation of\nthe Parker-stability criterion, is responsible for the generation of a\ncollimated, magnetically-driven outflow with only mildly relativistic\nvelocities that is responsible for a violent eruption of electromagnetic\nenergy. We provide evidence that this outflow is partly collimated via a\nBlandford-Payne mechanism driven by the open field lines anchored in the inner\ndisk regions. Finally, by including or not the radiative transport via\nneutrinos, we determine the role they play in the launching of the collimated\nwind. In this way, we conclude that the mechanism of magnetic-field breakout we\nobserve is robust and takes place even without neutrinos. Contrary to previous\nexpectations, the inclusion of neutrinos absorption and emission leads to a\nsmaller baryon pollution in polar regions, and hence accelerates the occurrence\nof the breakout, yielding a larger electromagnetic luminosity. Given the mildly\nrelativistic nature of these disk-driven breakout outflows, it is difficult to\nconsider them responsible for the jet phenomenology observed in short gamma-ray\nbursts.",

To characterize the statistical significance of the biases, we compute\nthe Bayes factor between the ppE and GR models, and the fitting factor of the\nppE model. For highly-precessing, edge-on signals, we find that mismodeling the\nsignal leads to a significant systematic bias in the recovery of the ppE\nparameters, even at an SNR of 30. However, these biased inferences are\ncharacterized by a significant loss of SNR and a weak preference for the ppE\nmodel. At a higher SNR, the biased inferences display a strong preference for\nthe ppE model and a significant loss of SNR. For edge-on signals containing\nasymmetric masses, at an SNR of 30, we find that excluding higher modes does\nnot impact the ppE tests as much as excluding spin precession. Our analysis,\ntherefore, identifies the spin-precessing and mass-asymmetric systems for which\nparametrized tests of GR are robust. With a toy model and using the linear\nsignal approximation, we illustrate these regimes of bias and characterize them\nby obtaining bounds on the ratio of systematic to statistical error and the\neffective cycles incurred due to mismodeling. As a by-product of our analysis,\nwe connect various measures and techniques commonly used to estimate systematic\nerrors -- linear-signal approximation, Laplace approximation, fitting factor,\neffective cycles, and Bayes factor -- that apply to all studies of systematic\nuncertainties in gravitational wave parameter estimation.",

    "abstract": "Observations of the Galactic bulge revealed an excess of short-timescale\ngravitational microlensing events that are generally attributed to a large\npopulation of free-floating or wide-orbit exoplanets. However, in recent years,\nsome authors suggested that planetary-mass primordial black holes (PBHs)\ncomprising a substantial fraction (1%-10%) of the dark matter in the Milky Way\nmay be responsible for these events. If that was the case, a large number of\nshort-timescale microlensing events should also be seen toward the Magellanic\nClouds. Here, we report the results of a high-cadence survey of the Magellanic\nClouds carried out from 2022 October through 2024 May as part of the Optical\nGravitational Lensing Experiment. We observed almost 35 million source stars\nlocated in the central regions of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds and\nfound only one long-timescale microlensing event candidate. No short-timescale\nevents were detected despite high sensitivity to such events. That allows us to\ninfer the strongest available limits on the frequency of planetary-mass PBHs in\ndark matter. We find that PBHs and other compact objects with masses from $1.4\n\\times 10^{-8}\\,M_{\\odot}$ (half of the Moon mass) to $0.013\\,M_{\\odot}$\n(planet/brown dwarf boundary) may comprise at most 1% of dark matter. That\nrules out the PBH origin hypothesis for the short-timescale events detected\ntoward the Galactic bulge and indicates they are caused by the population of\nfree-floating or wide-orbit planets.",

We report rotation-based\nages for 23,813 stars (harboring 795 known planets) for which our method is\napplicable. We find that our rotational ages recover the ages of stars in open\nclusters spanning 0.04-2.5 Gyr; they also agree with over 90% of the\nindependent lithium ages. The resulting yield includes 63 planets younger than\n1 Gyr at 2$\\sigma$, and 109 with median ages below 1 Gyr. This is about half\nthe number expected under the classic assumption of a uniform star formation\nhistory. The age distribution that we observe, rather than being uniform, shows\nthat the youngest stars in the Kepler field are 3-5 times rarer than stars 3\nGyr old. This trend holds for both known planet hosts and for the parent\nstellar sample. We attribute this \"demographic cliff\" to a combination of\nkinematic heating and a declining star formation rate in the Galaxy's thin\ndisk, and highlight its impact on the age distribution of known transiting\nexoplanets.",

This implies that the orbital\nperiod of the binary at the onset of the first mass transfer phase must have\nbeen $\\lesssim 3-5$ d. This prediction in turn suggests that most of these\nbinaries should have tertiary companions since $\\approx 90$ per cent of\nsolar-type main-sequence binaries in that period range are inner binaries of\nhierarchical triples. Until recently, only precursors of this type of binaries\nhave been observed in the form of EL CVn binaries, which are also known for\nhaving tertiary companions. Here, we present high-angular-resolution images of\nTYC 6992-827-1, an ELM WD with a sub-giant (SG) companion, confirming the\npresence of a tertiary companion. Furthermore, we show that TYC 6992-827-1,\nalong with its sibling TYC 8394-1331-1 (whose triple companion was detected via\nradial velocity variations), are in fact descendants of EL CVn binaries. Both\nTYC 6992-827-1 and TYC 8394-1331-1 will evolve through a common envelope phase,\nwhich depending on the ejection efficiency of the envelope, might lead to a\nsingle WD or a tight double WD binary, which would likely merge into a WD\nwithin a few Gyr due to gravitational wave emission. The former triple\nconfiguration will be reduced to a wide binary composed of a WD (the merger\nproduct) and the current tertiary companion.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D scenes from multiple viewpoints is a fundamental task in\nstereo vision. Recently, advances in generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting have\nenabled high-quality novel view synthesis for unseen scenes from sparse input\nviews by feed-forward predicting per-pixel Gaussian parameters without extra\noptimization. However, existing methods typically generate single-scale 3D\nGaussians, which lack representation of both large-scale structure and texture\ndetails, resulting in mislocation and artefacts. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework, HiSplat, which introduces a hierarchical manner in\ngeneralizable 3D Gaussian Splatting to construct hierarchical 3D Gaussians via\na coarse-to-fine strategy. Specifically, HiSplat generates large coarse-grained\nGaussians to capture large-scale structures, followed by fine-grained Gaussians\nto enhance delicate texture details. To promote inter-scale interactions, we\npropose an Error Aware Module for Gaussian compensation and a Modulating Fusion\nModule for Gaussian repair. Our method achieves joint optimization of\nhierarchical representations, allowing for novel view synthesis using only\ntwo-view reference images. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets\ndemonstrate that HiSplat significantly enhances reconstruction quality and\ncross-dataset generalization compared to prior single-scale methods. The\ncorresponding ablation study and analysis of different-scale 3D Gaussians\nreveal the mechanism behind the effectiveness. Project website:\nhttps://open3dvlab.github.io/HiSplat/",

However, maintaining\nsemantic consistency, generating high-quality fine-grained interactions, and\nensuring computational feasibility remain challenging, especially in long story\nvisualization (i.e., up to 100 frames). In this work, we propose a\ntraining-free and computationally efficient framework, termed Story-Adapter, to\nenhance the generative capability of long stories. Specifically, we propose an\niterative paradigm to refine each generated image, leveraging both the text\nprompt and all generated images from the previous iteration. Central to our\nframework is a training-free global reference cross-attention module, which\naggregates all generated images from the previous iteration to preserve\nsemantic consistency across the entire story, while minimizing computational\ncosts with global embeddings. This iterative process progressively optimizes\nimage generation by repeatedly incorporating text constraints, resulting in\nmore precise and fine-grained interactions. Extensive experiments validate the\nsuperiority of Story-Adapter in improving both semantic consistency and\ngenerative capability for fine-grained interactions, particularly in long story\nscenarios.

    "abstract": "Enabling robots to autonomously navigate unknown, complex, dynamic\nenvironments and perform diverse tasks remains a fundamental challenge in\ndeveloping robust autonomous physical agents. These agents must effectively\nperceive their surroundings while leveraging world knowledge for\ndecision-making. Although recent approaches utilize vision-language and large\nlanguage models for scene understanding and planning, they often rely on\noffline processing, offboard compute, make simplifying assumptions about the\nenvironment and perception, limiting real-world applicability. We present a\nnovel framework for real-time onboard autonomous navigation in unknown\nenvironments that change over time by integrating multi-level abstraction in\nboth perception and planning pipelines. Our system fuses data from multiple\nonboard sensors for localization and mapping and integrates it with\nopen-vocabulary semantics to generate hierarchical scene graphs from\ncontinuously updated semantic object map. The LLM-based planner uses these\ngraphs to create multi-step plans that guide low-level controllers in executing\nnavigation tasks specified in natural language. The system's real-time\noperation enables the LLM to adjust its plans based on updates to the scene\ngraph and task execution status, ensuring continuous adaptation to new\nsituations or when the current plan cannot accomplish the task, a key advantage\nover static or rule-based systems. We demonstrate our system's efficacy on a\nquadruped navigating dynamic environments, showcasing its adaptability and\nrobustness in diverse scenarios.",

In this\nwork, we measure LLMs' (in)ability to make optimal decisions in bandits, a\nstate-less reinforcement learning setting relevant to many applications. We\ndevelop a comprehensive suite of environments, including both context-free and\ncontextual bandits with varying task difficulties, to benchmark LLMs'\nperformance. Motivated by the existence of optimal exploration algorithms, we\npropose efficient ways to integrate this algorithmic knowledge into LLMs: by\nproviding explicit algorithm-guided support during inference; and through\nalgorithm distillation via in-context demonstrations and fine-tuning, using\nsynthetic data generated from these algorithms. Impressively, these techniques\nallow us to achieve superior exploration performance with smaller models,\nsurpassing larger models on various tasks. We conducted an extensive ablation\nstudy to shed light on various factors, such as task difficulty and data\nrepresentation, that influence the efficiency of LLM exploration.

    "abstract": "Low-resolution quantized imagery, such as pixel art, is seeing a revival in\nmodern applications ranging from video game graphics to digital design and\nfabrication, where creativity is often bound by a limited palette of elemental\nunits. Despite their growing popularity, the automated generation of quantized\nimages from raw inputs remains a significant challenge, often necessitating\nintensive manual input. We introduce SD-$\\pi$XL, an approach for producing\nquantized images that employs score distillation sampling in conjunction with a\ndifferentiable image generator. Our method enables users to input a prompt and\noptionally an image for spatial conditioning, set any desired output size $H\n\\times W$, and choose a palette of $n$ colors or elements. Each color\ncorresponds to a distinct class for our generator, which operates on an $H\n\\times W \\times n$ tensor. We adopt a softmax approach, computing a convex sum\nof elements, thus rendering the process differentiable and amenable to\nbackpropagation. We show that employing Gumbel-softmax reparameterization\nallows for crisp pixel art effects. Unique to our method is the ability to\ntransform input images into low-resolution, quantized versions while retaining\ntheir key semantic features. Our experiments validate SD-$\\pi$XL's performance\nin creating visually pleasing and faithful representations, consistently\noutperforming the current state-of-the-art.

    "abstract": "As artificial intelligence (AI) systems advance, we move towards broad AI:\nsystems capable of performing well on diverse tasks, understanding context, and\nadapting rapidly to new scenarios. A central challenge for broad AI systems is\nto generalize over tasks in related domains and being robust to distribution\nshifts. Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI bridges the gap between symbolic and\nsub-symbolic paradigms to address these challenges, enabling adaptable,\ngeneralizable, and more interpretable systems. The development of broad AI\nrequires advancements in domain adaptation (DA), enabling models trained on\nsource domains to effectively generalize to unseen target domains. Traditional\napproaches often rely on parameter optimization and fine-tuning, which can be\nimpractical due to high costs and risks of catastrophic forgetting. NeSy AI\nsystems use multiple models and methods to generalize to unseen domains and\nmaintain performance across varying conditions. We analyze common DA and NeSy\napproaches with a focus on deep domain-invariant learning, extending to\nreal-world challenges such as adapting to continuously changing domains and\nhandling large domain gaps. We showcase state-of-the-art model-selection\nmethods for scenarios with limited samples and introduce domain-specific\nadaptations without gradient-based updates for cases where model tuning is\ninfeasible.

In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired\nnetworks -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise their\nrepresentation of source variables (sources). We derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons\nin an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory\napplies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical\nindependence studied in previous work. Rather we show that sources modularise\nif their support is ``sufficiently spread''. From this theory, we extract and\nvalidate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution\naffects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks\ntrained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas\nto neuroscience data, showing that range independence can be used to understand\nthe mixing or modularising of spatial and reward information in entorhinal\nrecordings in seemingly conflicting experiments. Further, we use these results\nto suggest alternate origins of mixed-selectivity, beyond the predominant\ntheory of flexible nonlinear classification.

Our study employed quasi-3D simulations to delve into the impact of\nCoriolis acceleration on the balance of span-wise vorticity within the region\nof separate flow along the upper surface of wind turbine blade sections. Our\nresults allowed the identification of two different mechanisms of rotational\naugmentation, one associated to the height reduction of the region of separate\nflow and the other associated to the stabilization of the LEV. The former\noccurred when a trailing-edge separation was observed and the later when the\nflow featured a leading-edge separation. Within the range of conditions\nconsidered, the Coriolis acceleration neutralized up to about 40% of the\nspan-wise vorticity flowing in from the boundary layer to feed the LEV.",

    "abstract": "Next generation cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarimetry experiments aim\nto deploy order 500,000 detectors, requiring repeatable and reliable\nfabrication process with stable and uniform transition edge sensor (TES)\nbolometer performance. We present a hafnium (Hf)-based TES bolometer for CMB\nexperiments. We employ a novel heated sputter deposition of the Hf films\nenabling us to finely tune the critical temperature (Tc) between 140 mK - 210\nmK. We found elevated deposition temperatures result in films with lower\nstress, larger crystal sizes, and a smaller relative abundance of the m-plane\nto c-plane $\\alpha$ phase, all contributing to the empirical linear dependence\nof critical temperature on deposition temperature. Crucially, the heated\nsputter deposition simultaneously ensures that the critical temperature does\nnot drift despite exposure to heat throughout ongoing fab processes (sometimes\nreaching 350C) as long as the initial deposition temperature is not exceeded.\nTcs lower than 170 mK require deposition temperature greater than 400C, far in\nexcess of typical temperatures the wafer may experience. This ample thermal\nbudget allows us to relax the stringent thermal management that conventional\naluminum manganese (AlMn) TES bolometers require, for which temperatures as low\nas 200C - 250C are used to anneal the AlMn in an effort to adjust the Tc. Hf\nadditionally exhibits an intrinsic steep superconducting transition (we measure\n$\\alpha >$ 200) and a corresponding high loop gain (exceeding $\\mathcal{L}>10$\ndeep in the transition). We precisely design the normal resistance of the TES\nto range between 10 milli-Ohm and 1 Ohm through an interdigitated geometry,\nmaking these TES bolometers compatible with both TDM, FDM, and $\\mu$-mux\nreadout systems. We report on bolometer parameters including critical\ntemperature, normal resistance, saturation power, time constant, and loop gain.",

In this paper, we present noise reduction in the Virgo\ndetector using DeepClean, serving as a preliminary step toward integrating\nVirgo into the online noise reduction pipeline for the O5 observing run. Our\nresults demonstrate the applicability of DeepClean in Virgo O3b data, where\nnoise was reconstructed from a total of 225 auxiliary witness channels. These\nchannels were divided into 13 subsets, each corresponding to a specific\nfrequency band, with training and subtraction performed layer-wise in a\nsequential manner. We observe that the subtraction improves the binary neutron\nstar inspiral range by up to 1.3 Mpc, representing an approximately 2.5%\nincrease. To ensure robust validation, we conduct an injection study with\nbinary black hole waveforms. Matched-filter analyses of the injections showed\nan average improvement of 1.7% in the recovered signal-to-noise ratio, while\nparameter estimation confirmed that DeepClean introduces no bias in the\nrecovered parameters.

Approaches using LLMs as annotators reduce human\neffort, but still require humans to interpret feedback from evaluations and\ncontrol the LLM to produce data the student needs. Automating this\nlabor-intensive process by creating autonomous data generation agents - or\nteachers - is desirable, but requires environments that can simulate the\nfeedback-driven, iterative, closed loop of data creation. To enable rapid,\nscalable testing for such agents and their modules, we introduce DataEnvGym, a\ntestbed of teacher environments for data generation agents. DataEnvGym frames\ndata generation as a sequential decision-making task, involving an agent\nconsisting of a data generation policy (which generates a plan for creating\ntraining data) and a data generation engine (which transforms the plan into\ndata), inside an environment that provides student feedback. The agent's goal\nis to improve student performance. Students are iteratively trained and\nevaluated on generated data, and their feedback (in the form of errors or weak\nskills) is reported to the agent after each iteration. DataEnvGym includes\nmultiple teacher environment instantiations across 3 levels of structure in the\nstate representation and action space. More structured environments are based\non inferred skills and offer more interpretability and curriculum control. We\nsupport 4 domains (math, code, VQA, and tool-use) and test multiple students\nand teachers.

When RL policies\nwould devolve into undesired behavior, a common countermeasure is KL\nregularization to a trusted policy (\"Don't do anything I wouldn't do\"). All\ncurrent cutting-edge language models are RL agents that are KL-regularized to a\n\"base policy\" that is purely predictive. Unfortunately, we demonstrate that\nwhen this base policy is a Bayesian predictive model of a trusted policy, the\nKL constraint is no longer reliable for controlling the behavior of an advanced\nRL agent. We demonstrate this theoretically using algorithmic information\ntheory, and while systems today are too weak to exhibit this theorized failure\nprecisely, we RL-finetune a language model and find evidence that our formal\nresults are plausibly relevant in practice. We also propose a theoretical\nalternative that avoids this problem by replacing the \"Don't do anything I\nwouldn't do\" principle with \"Don't do anything I mightn't do\".",

    "abstract": "Designing control policies whose performance level is guaranteed to remain\nabove a given threshold in a span of environments is a critical feature for the\nadoption of reinforcement learning (RL) in real-world applications. The search\nfor such robust policies is a notoriously difficult problem, related to the\nso-called dynamic model of transition function uncertainty, where the\nenvironment dynamics are allowed to change at each time step. But in practical\ncases, one is rather interested in robustness to a span of static transition\nmodels throughout interaction episodes. The static model is known to be harder\nto solve than the dynamic one, and seminal algorithms, such as robust value\niteration, as well as most recent works on deep robust RL, build upon the\ndynamic model. In this work, we propose to revisit the static model. We suggest\nan analysis of why solving the static model under some mild hypotheses is a\nreasonable endeavor, based on an equivalence with the dynamic model, and\nformalize the general intuition that robust MDPs can be solved by tackling a\nseries of static problems. We introduce a generic meta-algorithm called IWOCS,\nwhich incrementally identifies worst-case transition models so as to guide the\nsearch for a robust policy. Discussion on IWOCS sheds light on new ways to\ndecouple policy optimization and adversarial transition functions and opens new\nperspectives for analysis. We derive a deep RL version of IWOCS and demonstrate\nit is competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on classical benchmarks.",

LeanAgent introduces\nseveral key innovations, including a curriculum learning strategy that\noptimizes the learning trajectory in terms of mathematical difficulty, a\ndynamic database for efficient management of evolving mathematical knowledge,\nand progressive training to balance stability and plasticity. LeanAgent\nsuccessfully generates formal proofs for 155 theorems across 23 diverse Lean\nrepositories where formal proofs were previously missing, many from advanced\nmathematics. It performs significantly better than the static LLM baseline,\nproving challenging theorems in domains like abstract algebra and algebraic\ntopology while showcasing a clear progression of learning from basic concepts\nto advanced topics. In addition, we analyze LeanAgent's superior performance on\nkey lifelong learning metrics.

Both MST and EVE attempt to wiretap information from the\nsignals transmitted to the SCUs. The deployment of the IRS not only enhances\nPLS by directing a strong beam towards the SCUs, but also improves the\nlocalization information for the target without disclosing information about\nthe SCUs. To further strengthen PLS, we employ joint artificial noise (AN) and\ndedicated sensing signal (DSS), in addition to wiretap coding. To evaluate\nsensing accuracy, we derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the\ndirection of arrival (DoA), and to assess the PLS level of the ISASC system, we\ndetermine a closed-form expression for the semantic secrecy rate (SSR). To\nachieve an optimal trade-off between these two competing objectives, we\nformulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) for the joint design of\nthe BS's beamforming (BF) vectors and the IRS's phase shift vector. To tackle\nthis MOOP problem, the $\\epsilon$-constraint method is employed, followed by an\nalternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm that leverages the classical\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)\ntechniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms\nthe baseline schemes, achieving a superior trade-off between SSR and CRB.\nSpecifically, our proposed approach improves the sensing accuracy by 5 dB\ncompared to the commonly adopted maximal ratio transmission (MRT) approach.",

We introduce a method for inverting\nsurvey systematic effects through a Monte Carlo subsampling technique where\ngalaxies are assigned probabilities based on their galaxy weight and survey\nselection functions.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the timing and spectral characteristics of X-ray\nbursts from the neutron star system EXO 0748-676 using the NuSTAR observatory's\nFPMA and FPMB instruments in the 3-79 keV range. We identify Type I X-ray\nbursts driven by thermonuclear explosions on the neutron star's surface,\nnotably a significant burst at \\(X = 18,479.97\\), indicating rapid energy\nrelease, followed by a recoil burst at \\(X = 19,463.97\\), reflecting\nstabilization. The correlation between burst timing and the neutron star's\noptical period suggests modulation by its rotation and periodic accretion\ndynamics. Spectral modeling reveals a photon index of \\( \\Gamma = 1.24 \\pm\n0.014 \\) and a cutoff energy of \\( E_C = 36.20 \\pm 1.04 \\; \\text{keV} \\),\nindicating a hot corona around the neutron star. The measured flux of\napproximately \\( (381.17 \\pm 0.014) \\times 10^{-12} \\; \\text{erg cm}^{-2}\n\\text{s}^{-1} \\) underscores the dynamic nature of accretion-driven systems.\nCalculated luminosities derived from distance estimates range from \\( (3.86 \\pm\n0.239) \\times 10^{36} \\; \\text{erg/s} \\) to \\( (2.3 \\pm 0.177) \\times 10^{36}\n\\; \\text{erg/s} \\). Comparative analysis with prior observations from the\nIBIS/ISGRI instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite shows variability in emission\ncharacteristics, including softer photon indices and higher cutoff energies in\n2003 and 2004. Our examination of smaller energy gaps (3-7 keV, 7-12 keV, etc.)\nreveals energy-dependent behavior in burst characteristics, enhancing our\nunderstanding of nuclear burning phases. Overall, these findings validate\nmodels describing Type I X-ray bursts and lay the groundwork for future\ninvestigations into similar astrophysical systems and stellar evolution\nprocesses in extreme environments.",

    "abstract": "Radiation from the \"plunging region\" (the space between the innermost stable\ncircular orbit (ISCO) and the black-hole (BH) surface) of an accretion flow\nonto a BH is supposed to add a small but significant contribution to the X-ray\nspectra of X-ray binary systems. The plunging region and its electromagnetic\nemission has been recently described by numerical and analytic calculations\nwhich lead to the conclusion that in the plunging region radiation is generated\nby the energy release through the action of a \"leftover\" stress in the vicinity\nof the ISCO and that the amount of this leftover can be chosen as a free\nparameter of the accretion-flow description. The present article aims to\ndemonstrate that this is not true because the stress in the whole accretion\nflow onto a black hole is determined by its global transonic character enforced\nby the space-time structure of the accreting black hole. We use the slim-disc\napproximation (SDA) to illustrate this point. In our article we compare models\nobtained with the SDA with results of numerical simulations and of analytical\nmodels based on the assumption that accreting matter flows along geodesics. We\nshow that the latter cannot describe adequately the physics of astrophysical\naccretion onto a BH because 1. particles on geodesics cannot emit\nelectromagnetic radiation, 2. they ignore the global transonic character of the\naccretion flow imposed by the presence of a stationary horizon in the BH\nspacetime; a presence that fixes a unique value of the angular momentum at the\nBH surface for a solution to exist. Therefore the fact that geodesics-based\nmodels reproduce the trans-ISCO behaviour of GRRMHD simulations proves the\nphysical reality of neither. We show also that the claimed detection of\nplunging-region emission in the spectrum of an X-ray binary is unsubstantiated.",

By combining photoluminescence, transient absorption\nmeasurements and density functional theory calculations, we explicate that the\nanomalous nonlinear saturable absorption is caused by the transient picosecond\ntimescale polaronic state formed by strong carrier exciton phonon coupling\neffect. The bandgap fluctuation can be further tuned through exciton phonon\ncoupling of perovskites with different Young's modulus. This suggests that we\ncan design targeted soft lattice lead halide perovskite with a specific\nstructure to effectively manipulate exciton phonon coupling and exciton polaron\nformation.

This\nresults in a gravitational decoupling into a system $ \\mathcal{A} $ with\nequations of motion of order $ \\alpha^0 $ and a system $ \\mathcal{B} $, related\nto the so-called Quasi-Einstein equations of order $ \\alpha $.

DCA was\noriginally conceived to reduce degeneracy in set partitioning problems by\nutilizing an aggregated restricted master problem obtained from a partition of\nthe set partitioning constraints into disjoint clusters. In this work, we\nexplore the use of DCA within a CG algorithm for MSSC exact solution.

Thus it can be used\nprior to training as a rough estimate of the final privacy leakage. We also\nprobe the limitations of our heuristic by providing some artificial\ncounterexamples where it underestimates the privacy leakage.\n  The standard composition-based privacy analysis of DP-SGD effectively assumes\nthat the adversary has access to all intermediate iterates, which is often\nunrealistic. However, this analysis remains the state of the art in practice.\nWhile our heuristic does not replace a rigorous privacy analysis, it\nillustrates the large gap between the best theoretical upper bounds and the\nprivacy auditing lower bounds and sets a target for further work to improve the\ntheoretical privacy analyses. We also empirically support our heuristic and\nshow existing privacy auditing attacks are bounded by our heuristic analysis in\nboth vision and language tasks.",

However, this increased sophistication introduces\nsignificant safety concerns. In this paper, we present the first evaluation and\nanalysis of a novel safety challenge termed Multimodal Situational Safety,\nwhich explores how safety considerations vary based on the specific situation\nin which the user or agent is engaged. We argue that for an MLLM to respond\nsafely, whether through language or action, it often needs to assess the safety\nimplications of a language query within its corresponding visual context. To\nevaluate this capability, we develop the Multimodal Situational Safety\nbenchmark (MSSBench) to assess the situational safety performance of current\nMLLMs. The dataset comprises 1,820 language query-image pairs, half of which\nthe image context is safe, and the other half is unsafe. We also develop an\nevaluation framework that analyzes key safety aspects, including explicit\nsafety reasoning, visual understanding, and, crucially, situational safety\nreasoning. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle with this nuanced\nsafety problem in the instruction-following setting and struggle to tackle\nthese situational safety challenges all at once, highlighting a key area for\nfuture research. Furthermore, we develop multi-agent pipelines to coordinately\nsolve safety challenges, which shows consistent improvement in safety over the\noriginal MLLM response.

    "abstract": "Recent work developed convolutional deep kernel machines, achieving 92.7%\ntest accuracy on CIFAR-10 using a ResNet-inspired architecture, which is SOTA\nfor kernel methods. However, this still lags behind neural networks, which\neasily achieve over 94% test accuracy with similar architectures. In this work\nwe introduce several modifications to improve the convolutional deep kernel\nmachine's generalisation, including stochastic kernel regularisation, which\nadds noise to the learned Gram matrices during training. The resulting model\nachieves 94.5% test accuracy on CIFAR-10. This finding has important\ntheoretical and practical implications, as it demonstrates that the ability to\nperform well on complex tasks like image classification is not unique to neural\nnetworks. Instead, other approaches including deep kernel methods can achieve\nexcellent performance on such tasks, as long as they have the capacity to learn\nrepresentations from data.",

While previous research attributed this\nlimitation to the ineffective temporal encoding of visual inputs, our\ndiagnostic study reveals that video representations contain sufficient\ninformation for even small probing classifiers to achieve perfect accuracy.\nSurprisingly, we find that the key bottleneck in Video LLMs' temporal reasoning\ncapability stems from the underlying LLM's inherent difficulty with temporal\nconcepts, as evidenced by poor performance on textual temporal\nquestion-answering tasks. Building on this discovery, we introduce the Textual\nTemporal reasoning Transfer (T3). T3 synthesizes diverse temporal reasoning\ntasks in pure text format from existing image-text datasets, addressing the\nscarcity of video samples with complex temporal scenarios. Remarkably, without\nusing any video data, T3 enhances LongVA-7B's temporal understanding, yielding\na 5.3 absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging TempCompass benchmark,\nwhich enables our model to outperform ShareGPT4Video-8B trained on 28,000 video\nsamples. Additionally, the enhanced LongVA-7B model achieves competitive\nperformance on comprehensive video benchmarks. For example, it achieves a 49.7\naccuracy on the Temporal Reasoning task of Video-MME, surpassing powerful\nlarge-scale models such as InternVL-Chat-V1.5-20B and VILA1.5-40B.

    "abstract": "Long-range ensemble forecasts are typically verified as anomalies with\nrespect to a lead-time dependent climatological mean to remove the influence of\nsystematic biases. However, common methods for calculating anomalies result in\nstatistical inconsistencies between forecast and verification anomalies, even\nfor a perfectly reliable ensemble. It is important to account for these\nsystematic effects when evaluating ensemble forecast systems, particularly when\ntuning a model to improve the reliability of forecast anomalies or when\ncomparing spread-error diagnostics between systems with different reforecast\nperiods. Here, we show that unbiased variances and spread-error ratios can be\nrecovered by deriving estimators that are consistent with the values that would\nbe achieved when calculating anomalies relative to the true, but unknown,\nclimatological mean. An elegant alternative is to construct forecast\nclimatologies separately for each member, which ensures that forecast and\nverification anomalies are defined relative to reference climatological means\nwith the same sampling uncertainty. This alternative approach has no impact on\nforecast ensemble means but systematically modifies the total variance and\nensemble spread of forecast anomalies in such a way that anomaly-based\nspread-error ratios are unbiased without any explicit correction for\nclimatology sample size. Furthermore, the improved statistical consistency of\nforecast and verification anomalies means that probabilistic forecast skill is\noptimised when the underlying forecast is also perfectly reliable. Alternative\nmethods for anomaly calculation can thus impact probabilistic forecast skill,\nespecially when anomalies are defined relative to climatologies with a small\nsample size. Finally, we demonstrate the equivalence of anomalies calculated\nusing different methods after applying an unbiased statistical calibration.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has emerged as a promising technology for achieving Android\nmalware detection. To further unleash its detection potentials, software\nvisualization can be integrated for analyzing the details of app behaviors\nclearly. However, facing increasingly sophisticated malware, existing\nvisualization-based methods, analyzing from one or randomly-selected few views,\ncan only detect limited attack types. We propose and implement LensDroid, a\nnovel technique that detects Android malware by visualizing app behaviors from\nmultiple complementary views. Our goal is to harness the power of combining\ndeep learning and software visualization to automatically capture and aggregate\nhigh-level features that are not inherently linked, thereby revealing hidden\nmaliciousness of Android app behaviors. To thoroughly comprehend the details of\napps, we visualize app behaviors from three related but distinct views of\nbehavioral sensitivities, operational contexts and supported environments. We\nthen extract high-order semantics based on the views accordingly. To exploit\nsemantic complementarity of the views, we design a deep neural network based\nmodel for fusing the visualized features from local to global based on their\ncontributions to downstream tasks. A comprehensive comparison with five\nbaseline techniques is performed on datasets of more than 51K apps in three\nreal-world typical scenarios, including overall threats, app evolution and\nzero-day malware. The experimental results show that the overall performance of\nLensDroid is better than the baseline techniques. We also validate the\ncomplementarity of the views and demonstrate that the multi-view fusion in\nLensDroid enhances Android malware detection.",

    "abstract": "We call a family of $s$ sets $\\{F_1, \\ldots, F_s\\}$ a \\textit{sunflower with\n$s$ petals} if, for any distinct $i, j \\in [s]$, one has $F_i \\cap F_j =\n\\cap_{u = 1}^s F_u$. The set $C = \\cap_{u = 1}^s F_u$ is called the {\\it core}\nof the sunflower. It is a classical result of Erd\\H os and Rado that there is a\nfunction $\\phi(s,k)$ such that any family of $k$-element sets contains a\nsunflower with $s$ petals. In 1977, Duke and Erd\\H os asked for the size of the\nlargest family $\\mathcal{F}\\subset{[n]\\choose k}$ that contains no sunflower\nwith $s$ petals and core of size $t-1$. In 1987, Frankl and F\\\" uredi\nasymptotically solved this problem for $k\\ge 2t+1$ and $n>n_0(s,k)$. This paper\nis one of the pinnacles of the so-called Delta-system method.\n  In this paper, we extend the result of Frankl and F\\\"uredi to a much broader\nrange of parameters: $n>f_0(s,t) k$ with $f_0(s,t)$ polynomial in $s$ and $t$.\nWe also extend this result to other domains, such as $[n]^k$ and ${n\\choose\nk/w}^w$ and obtain even stronger and more general results for forbidden\nsunflowers with core at most $t-1$ (including results for families of\npermutations and subfamilies of the $k$-th layer in a simplicial complex).\n  The methods of the paper, among other things, combine the spread\napproximation technique, introduced by Zakharov and the first author, with the\nDelta-system approach of Frankl and F\\\"uredi and the hypercontractivity\napproach for global functions, developed by Keller, Lifshitz and coauthors.\nPrevious works in extremal set theory relied on at most one of these methods.\nCreating such a unified approach was one of the goals for the paper.",

We used observed correlations among\nrelative abundances combining a total of 17 metals in diverse galactic\nenvironments, including the Milky Way (MW), Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC), and damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) towards\nquasars and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We only considered the relative abundances\nof metals that qualify as tracers of dust and we used all available dust\ntracers. We find linear correlations among all studied dust tracers in a\nmultidimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to an individual dust\ntracer. The fit to the linear correlations among the dust tracers describes the\ntendencies of different elements when depleting into dust grains. We determined\nthe overall strength of dust depletion, $\\Delta$, along individual lines of\nsight, based on the correlations among different dust tracers. We avoided any\npreference for specific dust tracers or any other assumptions by including all\navailable dust tracers in this multidimensional space. We also determined the\ndust depletion of Kr, C, O, Cl, P, Zn, Ge, Mg, Cu, Si, Fe, Ni, and Ti. Finally,\nwe offer simple guidelines for the application of the method to the study of\nthe observed patterns of abundances and relative abundances. This has allowed\nfor a straightforward determination of the overall strength of depletion and\nthe dust depletion of individual elements. We also obtained an estimate for the\ngas-phase metallicity and identified any additional deviations due to the\nnucleosynthesis of specific stellar populations. Thus, we have established a\nunified methodology for characterizing dust depletion across cosmic time and\ndiverse galactic environments, offering a valuable new approach to the study of\ndust depletion in studies of the chemical evolution of galaxies.",

GLOV prompts an LLM with the downstream task\ndescription, querying it for suitable VLM prompts (e.g., for zero-shot\nclassification with CLIP). These prompts are ranked according to their fitness\nfor the downstream vision task. In each respective optimization step, the\nranked prompts are fed as in-context examples (with their accuracies) to equip\nthe LLM with the knowledge of the type of prompts preferred by the downstream\nVLM. Furthermore, we explicitly guide the LLM's generation at each optimization\nstep by adding an offset vector -- calculated from the embedding differences\nbetween previous positive and negative solutions -- to the intermediate layer\nof the network for the next generation. This offset vector biases the LLM\ngeneration toward the type of language the downstream VLM prefers, resulting in\nenhanced performance on the downstream vision tasks. We comprehensively\nevaluate our GLOV on two tasks: object recognition and the critical task of\nenhancing VLM safety. Our GLOV shows performance improvement by up to 15.0% and\n57.5% for dual-encoder (e.g., CLIP) and encoder-decoder (e.g., LlaVA) models\nfor object recognition and reduces the attack success rate (ASR) on\nstate-of-the-art VLMs by up to $60.7\\%$.",

In this paper, we introduce a new\nresearch problem: Modularized LLM Agent Search (MoLAS). We propose a modular\ndesign space that abstracts existing LLM agent designs into four fundamental\nmodules with uniform IO interface: Planning, Reasoning, Tool Use, and Memory.\nBuilding on this design space, we present a novel LLM agent search framework\ncalled AgentSquare, which introduces two core mechanisms, i.e., module\nevolution and recombination, to efficiently search for optimized LLM agents. To\nfurther accelerate the process, we design a performance predictor that uses\nin-context surrogate models to skip unpromising agent designs. Extensive\nexperiments across six benchmarks, covering the diverse scenarios of web,\nembodied, tool use and game applications, show that AgentSquare substantially\noutperforms hand-crafted agents, achieving an average performance gain of 17.2%\nagainst best-known human designs. Moreover, AgentSquare can generate\ninterpretable design insights, enabling a deeper understanding of agentic\narchitecture and its impact on task performance.

After acquiring information, the agents have\nuncertainty about the environment in which they play and about their opponents'\nhigher-order beliefs. A mechanism admits a coarse beliefs equilibrium if agents\ncan play best responses even with this uncertainty. Focusing on\nmultidimensional scoring auctions, I fully characterize a property that allows\nan auction format to admit coarse beliefs equilibria. The main result\nclassifies auctions into two sets: those in which agents learn relatively\nlittle about their setting versus those in which they must fully learn a type\ndistribution to form equilibrium strategies.

    "abstract": "Traditional image codecs emphasize signal fidelity and human perception,\noften at the expense of machine vision tasks. Deep learning methods have\ndemonstrated promising coding performance by utilizing rich semantic embeddings\noptimized for both human and machine vision. However, these compact embeddings\nstruggle to capture fine details such as contours and textures, resulting in\nimperfect reconstructions. Furthermore, existing learning-based codecs lack\nscalability. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a\ncontent-adaptive diffusion model for scalable image compression. The proposed\nmethod encodes fine textures through a diffusion process, enhancing perceptual\nquality while preserving essential features for machine vision tasks. The\napproach employs a Markov palette diffusion model combined with widely used\nfeature extractors and image generators, enabling efficient data compression.\nBy leveraging collaborative texture-semantic feature extraction and\npseudo-label generation, the method accurately captures texture information. A\ncontent-adaptive Markov palette diffusion model is then applied to represent\nboth low-level textures and high-level semantic content in a scalable manner.\nThis framework offers flexible control over compression ratios by selecting\nintermediate diffusion states, eliminating the need for retraining deep\nlearning models at different operating points. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both image\nreconstruction and downstream machine vision tasks such as object detection,\nsegmentation, and facial landmark detection, achieving superior perceptual\nquality compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

Here, we probe the electronic\nstructure with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in a kagome magnet\nthin film FeSn synthesized using molecular beam epitaxy. We identify the\nexchange-split kagome flat bands, whose splitting persists above the magnetic\nordering temperature, indicative of a local moment picture. Such local moments\nin the presence of the topological flat band are consistent with the compact\nmolecular orbitals predicted in theory. We further observe a large spin-orbital\nselective band renormalization in the Fe d_xy+d_(x^2-y^2 ) spin majority\nchannel reminiscent of the orbital selective correlation effects in the\niron-based superconductors.

We interpret\nthe relative abundance of (genetic) variants of the pathogen as a\ntime-dependent probability distribution and consider clusterings that keep the\nFisher information (approximately) invariant, in order to ensure that they\ncapture the dynamics of the pandemic. By first studying analytic models, we\nshow that this condition groups variants together that interact in a similar\nfashion with the population and show comparable adaptation to the\nepidemiological situation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same clustering\ncan be achieved by grouping variants together according to the time-derivative\nof their information, which is defined as a function of the probabilities\nalone. A computationally simple clustering based on the probability\ndistribution therefore allows us to probe interactions of different variants of\nthe pathogen with its environment. To validate these findings, we consider data\nof 551.459 amino acid sequences of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in France\nover the course of almost 4 years.

We focus on cold starts\nand provide a comprehensive examination of the underlying factors influencing\nthe number and duration of cold starts. These factors include trigger types,\nrequest synchronicity, runtime languages, and function resource allocations. We\ninvestigate components of cold starts, including pod allocation time, code and\ndependency deployment time, and scheduling delays, and examine their\nrelationships with runtime languages, trigger types, and resource allocation.\nWe introduce pod utility ratio to measure the pod's useful lifetime relative to\nits cold start time, giving a more complete picture of cold starts, and see\nthat some pods with long cold start times have longer useful lifetimes. Our\nfindings reveal the complexity and multifaceted origins of the number,\nduration, and characteristics of cold starts, driven by differences in trigger\ntypes, runtime languages, and function resource allocations. For example, cold\nstarts in Region 1 take up to 7 seconds, dominated by dependency deployment\ntime and scheduling. In Region 2, cold starts take up to 3 seconds and are\ndominated by pod allocation time. Based on this, we identify opportunities to\nreduce the number and duration of cold starts using strategies for multi-region\nscheduling.

    "abstract": "The long-term solar magnetic activity and its cyclical behaviour, which is\nmaintained by a dynamo mechanism, are both still challenging for the\nastrophysics. In particular, an atypical event occurred between 1645 and 1715\nwhen the solar activity was remarkably decreased and the number of sunspots got\nextremely reduced. However, it is still unclear what happened to the solar\ncycle. The discovery of longer activity minima in cool stars may shed light on\nthe nature of the complex mechanisms involved in the long-term behaviour of the\nsolar-stellar dynamo. Our aim is to explore if the G5V solar-like star HD 4915,\nwhich showed a striking chromospheric activity pattern in a previous study\nperformed with HIRES data, could be considered a bona fide Maunder Minimum\n(hereafter MM) candidate. We have analyzed over 380 spectra acquired between\n2003 and 2022 using HARPS and HIRES spectrographs. We carried out a detailed\nsearch of activity signatures in HD 4915 by using the Mount Wilson and the\nBalmer H$_{\\alpha}$ activity indexes. This task was performed by means of the\nGLS periodogram. The new HARPS data show that the chromospheric activity of HD\n4915 is not decreasing. In fact, the rise of the activity after the broad\nminimum in three years gets to the level of activity before that phase,\nsuggesting that it is not entering into a MM phase. HD 4915 shows a distinctive\nactivity behaviour initially attributed to a possible and incipient MM phase.\nThe additional HARPS data allow us to discard a MM in the star. Our analysis\nshows that the complex activity pattern of HD 4915 could be ruled by a multiple\nactivity cycle, being a shorter cycle of 4.8-yr modulated by a potential longer\none. More activity surveys with extensive records and suitable cadence are\ncrucial for accurate identification of stars in Magnetic Grand Minima.",

    "abstract": "High redshift observations of 10$^9$ M$_\\odot$ supermassive black holes\n(SMBHs) at $z \\sim7$ and `Little Red Dots' that may host overmassive black\nholes at $z>4$ suggests the existence of so-called heavy seeds (>1000\nM$_\\odot$) in the early Universe. Recent work has suggested that the rapid\nassembly of halos may be the key to forming heavy seeds early enough in the\nUniverse to match such observations without the need for extreme radiation\nfields or dark matter streaming velocities. We perform simulations of BH seed\nformation in 4 distinct idealised halo collapse scenarios; an isolated 10$^6$\nM$_\\odot$ minihalo, an isolated 10$^7$ M$_\\odot$ atomic halo, the direct\ncollision of two 10$^7$ M$_\\odot$ halos and a fly-by collision of two 10$^7$\nM$_\\odot$ halos. We have shown that halo collisions create a central\nenvironment of enhanced density, inside which BH seeds can accrete at enhanced\nrates. For direct collisions, the gas density peaks are disrupted by the\ninteraction, as the collisionless DM peaks pass through each other while the\ncolliding gas is left in the center, removing the sink particle from its\naccretion source. When the central density peaks instead experience a fly-by\ninteraction, the sink particle remains embedded in the dense gas and maintains\nenhanced accretion rates throughout the simulated period when compared to the\nisolated halo cases. Here the final mass of the sink particle achieved a factor\nof 2 greater in mass than in the isolated atomic halo case, and a factor of 3\ngreater than the minihalo case, reaching 10$^4$ M$_\\odot$ via its 0.03 pc\naccretion radius. As the maximum halo mass before collapse is determined by the\natomic cooling limit of a few times 10$^7$ M$_{\\odot}$, the ability of\nhalo-halo mergers to further boost accretion rates onto the central object may\nplay a crucial role in growing SMBH seeds.",

    "abstract": "The light curve of the TeV emission in GRB 221009A displays a smooth\ntransition from an initial rapid rise to a slower rise and eventually a decay\nphase. The smooth temporal profile of the TeV emission suggests that it mainly\nresults from an external shock. The temporal overlap between the prompt KeV-MeV\nemission and the early TeV afterglow indicates that external inverse Compton\nscattering (EIC) between the prompt KeV-MeV photons and the afterglow electrons\nis inevitable. Since the energy density of the prompt emission is much higher\nthan that of the afterglow during the early phase, the EIC process dominates\nthe cooling of afterglow electrons. The EIC scattering rate is influenced by\nthe anisotropy of the seed photon field, which depends on the radii of the\ninternal dissipation ($R_{\\rm dis}$), where the prompt emission is produced,\nand that of the external shock ($R_{\\rm ext}$), where the afterglow emission is\nproduced. We investigate the EIC process for different values of $R_{\\rm\ndis}/R_{\\rm ext}$. We find that, for varying \\( R_{\\rm dis}/R_{\\rm ext} \\), the\nEIC scattering rate can differ by a factor of $\\sim 2$. For GRB 221009A, the\nEIC emission is dominated during the early rising phase of the TeV afterglow.\nIt then transitions to a phase dominated by the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC)\nemission as the intensity of the prompt emission decreases. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the effect of $\\gamma \\gamma$ absorption in the TeV afterglow\ncaused by prompt MeV photons and find that it is insufficient to explain the\nearly rapid rise in the TeV afterglow, even in the case of $R_{\\rm dis}/R_{\\rm\next} \\sim 1$.",

The EDFT\nmapping can now be carried out even when the target molecule possesses multiple\nlow energy potential curves, significantly transcending previous applications.\nSecondly, it implements a method to extract the rest of the full lab-frame\nscattering matrix, i.e. the columns and rows describing input and/or output\ndissociation channels.

A main\nchallenge within is the unavailable of samples from the unknown classes in the\ntraining process, and an effective strategy is to improve the performance for\nknown classes. Using beneficial strategies such as data augmentation and longer\ntraining is thus a way to improve OOD detection. However, label smoothing, an\neffective method for classifying known classes, degrades the performance of OOD\ndetection, and this phenomenon is under exploration. In this paper, we first\nanalyze that the limited and predefined learning target in label smoothing\nresults in the smaller maximal probability and logit, which further leads to\nworse OOD detection performance. To mitigate this issue, we then propose a\nnovel regularization method, called adaptive label smoothing (ALS), and the\ncore is to push the non-true classes to have same probabilities whereas the\nmaximal probability is neither fixed nor limited. Extensive experimental\nresults in six datasets with two backbones suggest that ALS contributes to\nclassifying known samples and discerning unknown samples with clear margins.\nOur code will be available to the public.",

To achieve accurate parsing\nof the eye-region, we first leverage the pretrained foundation model Segment\nAnything (SAM) in an automatic way to refine the eye indications. Then, the\nlearning process is designed in an end-to-end manner following progressive and\nprior-aware principle.

    "abstract": "Halo assembly bias is a phenomenon whereby the clustering of dark matter\nhalos is dependent on halo properties, such as age, at fixed mass.\nUnderstanding the origin of assembly bias is important for interpreting the\nclustering of galaxies and constraining cosmological models. One proposed\nexplanation for the origin of assembly bias is the truncation of mass accretion\nin low-mass halos in the presence of more massive halos, called 'arrested\ndevelopment.' Halos undergoing arrested development would have older measured\nages and exhibit stronger clustering than equal mass halos that have not\nundergone arrested development. We propose a new method to test the validity of\nthis explanation for assembly bias, and correct for it in cosmological N-body\nsimulations. The method is based on the idea that the early mass accretion\nhistory of a halo, before arrested development takes effect, can be used to\npredict the late-time evolution of the halo in the absence of arrested\ndevelopment. We implement this idea by fitting a model to the early portion of\nhalo accretion histories and extrapolating to late times. We then calculate\n'corrected' masses and ages for halos based on this extrapolation and\ninvestigate how this impacts the assembly bias signal. We find that correcting\nfor arrested development this way leads to a factor of two reduction in the\nstrength of the assembly bias signal across a range of low halo masses. This\nresult provides new evidence that arrested development is a cause of assembly\nbias and validates our approach to mitigating the effect.",

The first stage, Model Feature Assessment, systematically\nevaluates the detectability of forgery-related features for the MLLM,\ngenerating a prioritized ranking of features based on their intrinsic\nimportance to the model. The second stage, Explainable Dataset Construction,\nconsists of two key modules: Strong Feature Strengthening, which is designed to\nenhance the model's existing detection and explanation capabilities by\nreinforcing its well-learned features, and Weak Feature Supplementing, which\naddresses gaps by integrating specific feature detectors (e.g., low-level\nartifact analyzers) to compensate for the MLLM's limitations. The third stage,\nFine-tuning and Inference, involves fine-tuning the MLLM on the constructed\ndataset and deploying it for final detection and explanation. By integrating\nthese three stages, our approach enhances the MLLM's strengths while\nsupplementing its weaknesses, ultimately improving both the detectability and\nexplainability. Extensive experiments and ablations, followed by a\ncomprehensive human study, validate the improved performance of our approach\ncompared to the original MLLMs. More encouragingly, our framework is designed\nto be plug-and-play, allowing it to seamlessly integrate with future more\nadvanced MLLMs and specific feature detectors, leading to continual improvement\nand extension to face the challenges of rapidly evolving deepfakes.",

Attention to the complex dynamics of\nhyperbolic orbits and to fractional calculus can be, respectively, traced back\nto Poincar\\'es attack on the three-body problem a century ago and to the early\ndays of calculus three centuries ago. Nowadays, fractional calculus has been\nwidely applied in modeling dynamic problems across various fields due to its\nadvantages in describing problems with non-locality. Some of these models have\nalso been confirmed to exhibit hyperbolic orbit dynamics, and recently, they\nhave been extensively studied based on Melnikov method, an analytical approach\nfor homoclinic and heteroclinic orbit dynamics. Despite its decade-long\napplication in fractional dynamics, there is a universal problem in these\napplications that remains to be clarified, i.e., defining fractional-order\nsystems within finite memory boundaries leads to the neglect of perturbation\ncalculation for parts of the stable and unstable manifolds in Melnikov\nanalysis. After clarifying and redefining the problem, a rigorous analytical\ncase is provided for reference. Unlike existing results, the Melnikov criterion\nhere is derived in a globally closed form, which was previously considered\nunobtainable due to difficulties in the analysis of fractional-order\nperturbations characterized by convolution integrals with power-law type\nsingular kernels.

In response to the\nannouncement of OpenAI's groundbreaking O1 model, we embark on a transparent,\nreal-time exploration to replicate its capabilities while reimagining the\nprocess of conducting and communicating AI research. Our methodology addresses\ncritical challenges in modern AI research, including the insularity of\nprolonged team-based projects, delayed information sharing, and the lack of\nrecognition for diverse contributions. By providing comprehensive, real-time\ndocumentation of our replication efforts, including both successes and\nfailures, we aim to foster open science, accelerate collective advancement, and\nlay the groundwork for AI-driven scientific discovery. Our research progress\nreport diverges significantly from traditional research papers, offering\ncontinuous updates, full process transparency, and active community engagement\nthroughout the research journey. Technologically, we proposed the journey\nlearning paradigm, which encourages models to learn not just shortcuts, but the\ncomplete exploration process, including trial and error, reflection, and\nbacktracking. With only 327 training samples and without any additional tricks,\njourney learning outperformed conventional supervised learning by over 8\\% on\nthe MATH dataset, demonstrating its extremely powerful potential.

    "abstract": "To satisfy the increasing demands for transmission rates of wireless\ncommunications, it is necessary to use spatial resources of electromagnetic\n(EM) waves. In this context, EM information theory (EIT) has become a hot topic\nby integrating the theoretical framework of deterministic mathematics and\nstochastic statistics to explore the transmission mechanisms of continuous EM\nwaves. However, the previous studies were primarily focused on frame analysis,\nwith limited exploration of practical applications and a comprehensive\nunderstanding of its essential physical characteristics. In this paper, we\npresent a three-dimensional (3-D) line-of-sight channel capacity formula that\ncaptures the vector EM physics and accommodates both near- and far-field\nscenes. Based on the rigorous mathematical equation and the physical mechanism\nof fast multipole expansion, a channel model is established, and the finite\nangular spectral bandwidth feature of scattered waves is revealed. To adapt to\nthe feature of the channel, an optimization problem is formulated for\ndetermining the mode currents on the transmitter, aiming to obtain the optimal\ndesign of the precoder and combiner. We make comprehensive analyses to\ninvestigate the relationship among the spatial degree of freedom, noise, and\ntransmitted power, thereby establishing a rigorous upper bound of channel\ncapacity. A series of simulations are conducted to validate the theoretical\nmodel and numerical method.

Currently, L4S employs per-flow queue selection, i.e. all\npackets of a flow are marked the same way and thus use the same queues, even\nthough each packet is marked separately. However, this may hurt tail latency\nand latency-sensitive applications because transient congestion and queue\nbuildups may only affect a fraction of packets in a flow.\n  We present SwiftQueue, a new L4S queue-selection strategy in which a sender\nuses a novel per-packet latency predictor to pinpoint which packets likely have\nlatency spikes or drops. The insight is that many packet-level latency\nvariations result from complex interactions among recent packets at shared\nrouter queues. Yet, these intricate packet-level latency patterns are hard to\nlearn efficiently by traditional models. Instead, SwiftQueue uses a custom\nTransformer, which is well-studied for its expressiveness on sequential\npatterns, to predict the next packet's latency based on the latencies of\nrecently received ACKs. Based on the predicted latency of each outgoing packet,\nSwiftQueue's sender dynamically marks the L4S packet header to assign packets\nto potentially different queues, even within the same flow. Using real network\ntraces, we show that SwiftQueue is 45-65% more accurate in predicting latency\nand its variations than state-of-art methods. Based on its latency prediction,\nSwiftQueue reduces the tail latency for L4S-enabled flows by 36-45%, compared\nwith the existing L4S queue-selection method.",

    "abstract": "Massive stars experience strong mass-loss, producing a dense, H-rich\ncircumstellar medium (CSM). After the explosion, the collision and continued\ninteraction of the supernova (SN) ejecta with the CSM power the light curve\nthrough the conversion of kinetic energy into radiation. When the interaction\nis strong, the light curve shows a broad peak and high luminosity lasting for a\nrelatively long time. Also the spectral evolution is slower, compared to\nnon-interacting SNe. Energetic shocks between the ejecta and the CSM create the\nideal conditions for particle acceleration and production of high-energy (HE)\nneutrinos above 1 TeV. In this paper, we study four strongly-interacting Type\nIIn SNe: 2021acya, 2021adxl, 2022qml, and 2022wed to highlight their peculiar\ncharacteristics, derive the kinetic energy of the explosion and the\ncharacteristics of the CSM, infer clues on the possible progenitors and their\nenvironment and relate them to the production of HE neutrinos. The SNe analysed\nin this sample exploded in dwarf, star-forming galaxies and they are consistent\nwith energetic explosions and strong interaction with the surrounding CSM. For\nSNe 2021acya and 2022wed, we find high CSM masses and mass-loss rates, linking\nthem to very massive progenitors. For SN 2021adxl, the spectral analysis and\nless extreme CSM mass suggest a stripped-envelope massive star as possible\nprogenitor. SN 2022qml is marginally consistent with being a Type Ia\nthermonuclear explosion embedded in a dense CSM. The mass-loss rates for all\nSNe are consistent with the expulsion of several solar masses of material\nduring eruptive episodes in the last few decades before the explosion. Finally,\nwe find that the SNe in our sample are marginally consistent with HE neutrino\nproduction.",

    "abstract": "In StyleGAN, convolution kernels are shaped by both static parameters shared\nacross images and dynamic modulation factors $w^+\\in\\mathcal{W}^+$ specific to\neach image. Therefore, $\\mathcal{W}^+$ space is often used for image inversion\nand editing. However, pre-trained model struggles with synthesizing\nout-of-domain images due to the limited capabilities of $\\mathcal{W}^+$ and its\nresultant kernels, necessitating full fine-tuning or adaptation through a\ncomplex hypernetwork. This paper proposes an efficient refining strategy for\ndynamic kernels. The key idea is to modify kernels by low-rank residuals,\nlearned from input image or domain guidance. These residuals are generated by\nmatrix multiplication between two sets of tokens with the same number, which\ncontrols the complexity. We validate the refining scheme in image inversion and\ndomain adaptation. In the former task, we design grouped transformer blocks to\nlearn these token sets by one- or two-stage training. In the latter task, token\nsets are directly optimized to support synthesis in the target domain while\npreserving original content. Extensive experiments show that our method\nachieves low distortions for image inversion and high quality for out-of-domain\nediting.",

However, prevailing\nRL fine-tuning methods predominantly rely on PPO and its variants. Though these\nalgorithms are effective in general RL settings, they often exhibit suboptimal\nperformance and vulnerability to distribution collapse when applied to the\nfine-tuning of LLMs. In this paper, we propose CORY, extending the RL\nfine-tuning of LLMs to a sequential cooperative multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning framework, to leverage the inherent coevolution and emergent\ncapabilities of multi-agent systems. In CORY, the LLM to be fine-tuned is\ninitially duplicated into two autonomous agents: a pioneer and an observer. The\npioneer generates responses based on queries, while the observer generates\nresponses using both the queries and the pioneer's responses. The two agents\nare trained together. During training, the agents exchange roles periodically,\nfostering cooperation and coevolution between them. Experiments evaluate CORY's\nperformance by fine-tuning GPT-2 and Llama-2 under subjective and objective\nreward functions on the IMDB Review and GSM8K datasets, respectively.

It is commonly observed that mechanical deformation\nprior to or during precipitation leads to microstructure with excess defects,\nwhich allows for enhanced precipitate nucleation and growth rates\n\\cite{Weiss1979,Okaguchi1992,Deschamps2003}. To investigate this phenomenon, we\nemploy a two-dimensional phase-field crystal alloy model endowed with a\ntemperature dependent mobility, making it capable of recovering isothermal\ntransformation (TTT) diagrams with a characteristic inflection point (nose)\nabout a critical temperature. We examine the variation in the time-scale of\nprecipitation and its connection to the time-scale of the applied deformation,\nfocusing on the roles of atomic defects in the processes involved. Our results\nindicate that precipitation is initially delayed through application of a\ndeformation until a critical strain is achieved, beyond which precipitation\nproceeds more rapidly, assisted by plastic deformation such as grain boundary\nserration or dislocation nucleation. We show that the evolution of the\nprecipitated fraction, $f(t)$, departs from classical Avrami behaviour.\nSpecifically, $df/dt$ develops two peaks indicative of a ``plateau\"-like\ninflection in $f(t)$, signalling the transition to defect assisted precipitate\nnucleation. We analyze these plateaus as a function of the deformation rate and\ndemonstrate that the they exhibit a discontinuous bifurcation as the time-scale\nof applied deformation is increased.

Some philosophical justification is provided by a classical\ntheorem of Babai, Erd\\H{o}s and Selkow: an extremely simple polynomial-time\ncombinatorial algorithm (variously known as \"na\\\"ive refinement\", \"na\\\"ive\nvertex classification\", \"colour refinement\" or the \"1-dimensional\nWeisfeiler-Leman algorithm\") yields a so-called canonical labelling scheme for\n\"almost all graphs\". More precisely, for a typical outcome of a random graph\n$G(n,1/2)$, this simple combinatorial algorithm assigns labels to vertices in a\nway that easily permits isomorphism-testing against any other graph.\n  We improve the Babai-Erd\\H{o}s-Selkow theorem in two directions. First, we\nconsider randomly perturbed graphs, in accordance with the smoothed analysis\nphilosophy of Spielman and Teng: for any graph $G$, na\\\"ive refinement becomes\neffective after a tiny random perturbation to $G$ (specifically, the addition\nand removal of $O(n\\log n)$ random edges). Actually, with a twist on na\\\"ive\nrefinement, we show that $O(n)$ random additions and removals suffice. These\nresults significantly improve on previous work of Gaudio-R\\'acz-Sridhar, and\nare in certain senses best-possible.\n  Second, we complete a long line of research on canonical labelling of random\ngraphs: for any $p$ (possibly depending on $n$), we prove that a random graph\n$G(n,p)$ can typically be canonically labelled in polynomial time. This is most\ninteresting in the extremely sparse regime where $p$ has order of magnitude\n$c/n$; denser regimes were previously handled by Bollob\\'as,\nCzajka-Pandurangan, and Linial-Mosheiff. Our proof also provides a description\nof the automorphism group of a typical outcome of $G(n,p_n)$ (slightly\ncorrecting a prediction of Linial-Mosheiff).",

We calculate nuclear properties, Coulomb energy, and photon\nenergy within white dwarfs in a unified framework. By carefully calibrating the\nmodel parameters to align with nuclear matter properties, we successfully\nreproduce the structures of several elements in white dwarfs, such as the\nisotopes of $\\rm C$ and $^{16}\\rm O$, except for the unnaturally deeply bound\nstate $^4$He. Furthermore, we predict the characteristics of white dwarfs\ncomposed of atom-like units and the gravitational waves stemming from binary\nwhite dwarf inspirals incorporating tidal deformability contributions up to the\n2.5 post-Newtonian order. These results shed light on the structure of white\ndwarfs and provide valuable information for future gravitational wave\ndetection. This methodological advancement allows for a cohesive analysis of\nwhite dwarfs, neutron stars, and the nuclear pasta within a unified theoretical\nframework.",

Our main conclusion is that the GDPR's data breach rules are\nlikely to contribute to the goals.

However, CFG doubles inference cost while limiting originality\nand diversity across generated contents. In this paper, we introduce\ndiversity-rewarded CFG distillation, a novel finetuning procedure that distills\nthe strengths of CFG while addressing its limitations. Our approach optimises\ntwo training objectives: (1) a distillation objective, encouraging the model\nalone (without CFG) to imitate the CFG-augmented predictions, and (2) an RL\nobjective with a diversity reward, promoting the generation of diverse outputs\nfor a given prompt. By finetuning, we learn model weights with the ability to\ngenerate high-quality and diverse outputs, without any inference overhead. This\nalso unlocks the potential of weight-based model merging strategies: by\ninterpolating between the weights of two models (the first focusing on quality,\nthe second on diversity), we can control the quality-diversity trade-off at\ndeployment time, and even further boost performance. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on the MusicLM (Agostinelli et al., 2023) text-to-music generative\nmodel, where our approach surpasses CFG in terms of quality-diversity Pareto\noptimality.

    "abstract": "This paper considers a scenario within the field of mechanism design without\nmoney where a mechanism designer is interested in selecting items with maximum\ntotal value under a knapsack constraint. The items, however, are controlled by\nstrategic agents who aim to maximize the total value of their items in the\nknapsack. This is a natural setting, e.g., when agencies select projects for\nfunding, companies select products for sale in their shops, or hospitals\nschedule MRI scans for the day. A mechanism governing the packing of the\nknapsack is strategyproof if no agent can benefit from hiding items controlled\nby them to the mechanism. We are interested in mechanisms that are\nstrategyproof and $\\alpha$-approximate in the sense that they always\napproximate the maximum value of the knapsack by a factor of $\\alpha \\in\n[0,1]$. First, we give a deterministic mechanism that is\n$\\frac{1}{3}$-approximate. For the special case where all items have unit\ndensity, we design a $\\frac{1}{\\phi}$-approximate mechanism where $1/\\phi\n\\approx 0.618$ is the inverse of the golden ratio. This result is tight as we\nshow that no deterministic strategyproof mechanism with a better approximation\nexists. We further give randomized mechanisms with approximation guarantees of\n$1/2$ for the general case and $2/3$ for the case of unit densities. For both\ncases, no strategyproof mechanism can achieve an approximation guarantee better\nthan $1/(5\\phi -7)\\approx 0.917$.",

However, the potential\nmisuse of LLMs has raised significant concerns, underscoring the urgent need\nfor reliable detection of LLM-generated texts. Conventional training-based\ndetectors often struggle with generalization, particularly in cross-domain and\ncross-model scenarios. In contrast, training-free methods, which focus on\ninherent discrepancies through carefully designed statistical features, offer\nimproved generalization and interpretability. Despite this, existing\ntraining-free detection methods typically rely on global text sequence\nstatistics, neglecting the modeling of local discriminative features, thereby\nlimiting their detection efficacy. In this work, we introduce a novel\ntraining-free detector, termed \\textbf{Lastde} that synergizes local and global\nstatistics for enhanced detection. For the first time, we introduce time series\nanalysis to LLM-generated text detection, capturing the temporal dynamics of\ntoken probability sequences. By integrating these local statistics with global\nones, our detector reveals significant disparities between human and\nLLM-generated texts. We also propose an efficient alternative,\n\\textbf{Lastde++} to enable real-time detection. Extensive experiments on six\ndatasets involving cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-lingual detection\nscenarios, under both white-box and black-box settings, demonstrated that our\nmethod consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We exploit the recently released Natural Scenes Dataset (Allen et al.,\n2022) as organized for the Algonauts Project (Gifford et al., 2023), which\ncontains the high-resolution fMRI responses of eight subjects to tens of\nthousands of naturalistic images. We show that CL fine-tuning creates feature\nextraction models that enable higher encoding accuracy in early visual ROIs as\ncompared to both the pretrained network and a baseline approach that uses a\nregression loss at the output of the network to tune it for fMRI response\nencoding. We investigate inter-subject transfer of the CL fine-tuned models,\nincluding subjects from another, lower-resolution dataset (Gong et al., 2023).\nWe also pool subjects for fine-tuning to further improve the encoding\nperformance.

For short evolution\ntimes, this quasiclassical approach yields the same result as the Wigner-Moyal\nformalism, i.e., OTOCs are classically described via the square of the Poisson\nbracket between the two involved observables, thus giving rise to an\nexponential growth in a chaotic regime. For long times, for which the\nsemiclassical framework is, in principle, still valid, the diagonal\napproximation yields an asymptotic saturation value for the quasiclassical OTOC\nunder the assumption of fully developed classical chaos. However, numerical\nsimulations, carried out within chaotic few-site Bose-Hubbard systems in the\nabsence and presence of periodic driving, demonstrate that this saturation\nvalue strongly underestimates the actual threshold value of the quantum OTOC,\nwhich is normally attained after the Ehrenfest time.

While the information on class affiliations can\nstem in principle from any source, we demonstrate how classes can reproducibly\nbe defined based on mixture data alone by agglomerative clustering. The\ninformation from this clustering step is then used as an informed prior for\nfitting the individual data. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach by\napplying it in connection with a matrix completion method (MCM) for predicting\nisothermal activity coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. Using\nclustering leads to significantly improved predictions compared to an MCM\nwithout clustering. Furthermore, the chemical classes learned from the\nclustering give exciting insights into what matters on the molecular level for\nmodeling given mixture properties.",

Based on the mutual information\nspectrum analysis, the maximum achievable rate of ReRAM channel with\nindependent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) binary inputs is derived as an\nexplicit function of channel parameters such as the distribution of cell\nselector failures and channel noise level. Due to the randomness of cell\nselector failures, the ReRAM channel demonstrates multi-status characteristic.\nFor each status, it is shown that as the array size is large, the fraction of\ncells affected by sneak paths approaches a constant value. Therefore, the\nmutual information spectrum of the ReRAM channel is formulated as a mixture of\nmultiple stationary channels. Maximum achievable rates of the ReRAM channel\nwith different settings, such as single- and across-array codings, with and\nwithout data shaping, and optimal and treating-interference-as-noise (TIN)\ndecodings, are compared. These results provide valuable insights on the code\ndesign for ReRAM.",

The lifetime contrast enables an\nultra-strong valley selection rule: only one valley can survive in the\nlong-time limit regardless of the excitation, lattice shape and other details.\nThis property leads to an effective parity anomaly with a single Dirac cone and\noffers a simple way to generate vortex states. Additionally, extending\nnon-Hermitian features to boundaries generates valley kink states with\nvalley-locked lifetimes, making them effectively unidirectional and more\nresistant against inter-valley scattering. All these phenomena are\nexperimentally demonstrated in a non-Hermitian electric circuit lattice.",

    "abstract": "Real-world systems are shaped by both their complex internal interactions and\nthe changes in their noisy environments. In this work, we study how a shared\nactive bath affects the statistical dependencies between two interacting\nBrownian particles by evaluating their mutual information. We decompose the\nmutual information into three terms: information stemming from the internal\ninteractions between the particles; information induced by the shared bath,\nwhich encodes environmental changes; a term describing information interference\nthat quantifies how the combined presence of both internal interactions and\nenvironment either masks (destructive interference) or boosts (constructive\ninterference) information. By studying exactly the case of linear interactions,\nwe find that the sign of information interference depends solely on that of the\ninternal coupling. However, when internal interactions are described by a\nnonlinear activation function, we show that both constructive and destructive\ninterference appear depending on the interplay between the timescale of the\nactive environment, the internal interactions, and the environmental coupling.\nFinally, we show that our results generalize to hierarchical systems where\nasymmetric couplings to the environment mimic the scenario where the active\nbath is only partially accessible to one particle. This setting allows us to\nquantify how this asymmetry drives information interference.

    "abstract": "Latent diffusion models (LDMs), such as Stable Diffusion, often experience\nsignificant structural distortions when directly generating high-resolution\n(HR) images that exceed their original training resolutions. A straightforward\nand cost-effective solution is to adapt pre-trained LDMs for HR image\ngeneration; however, existing methods often suffer from poor image quality and\nlong inference time. In this paper, we propose an Attentive and Progressive LDM\n(AP-LDM), a novel, training-free framework aimed at enhancing HR image quality\nwhile accelerating the generation process. AP-LDM decomposes the denoising\nprocess of LDMs into two stages: (i) attentive training-resolution denoising,\nand (ii) progressive high-resolution denoising. The first stage generates a\nlatent representation of a higher-quality training-resolution image through the\nproposed attentive guidance, which utilizes a novel parameter-free\nself-attention mechanism to enhance the structural consistency. The second\nstage progressively performs upsampling in pixel space, alleviating the severe\nartifacts caused by latent space upsampling. Leveraging the effective\ninitialization from the first stage enables denoising at higher resolutions\nwith significantly fewer steps, enhancing overall efficiency. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate that AP-LDM significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, delivering up to a 5x speedup in HR image generation,\nthereby highlighting its substantial advantages for real-world applications.\nCode is available at https://github.com/kmittle/AP-LDM.",

We experience-prototyped DSTs\nreflecting each angle of the Diversity Triangle to enhance decision-making\naround diversity. We find that notions of diversity are highly diverse; efforts\nto design DSTs for diversity should start by working with organisations to\ndistil 'diversity' into definitions and design requirements.",

The tiling of\ndifferent geometric units such as triangles and squares in two-dimensional\nspace can result in a great variety of quasicrystals that could be realized by\nthe self-assembly of liquid crystalline molecules. In this study, we introduce\nthree self-similar dodecagonal tilings, including a novel\nDiamond-Square-Triangle pattern, composed of triangular and quadrangular tiles\nand examine their thermodynamic stability by using the self-consistent field\ntheory applied to T-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. Specifically, we\ndetail the inflation rules for the construction of these dodecagonal tilings\nand analyze their self-similarity, and show that these tilings can be viewed as\nprojections of higher-dimensional periodic lattice points with projection\nwindows. Using these dodecagonal tilings as initial configurations of the SCFT\nresults in solutions corresponding to quasicrystals that could form from the\nT-shaped liquid crystalline molecules. The relative stability of these\naperiodic phases is analyzed to obtain design rules that could stabilize\nquasicrystals.

Despite advances\nin this field, existing detection approaches often struggle to accurately\nidentify synthesized images generated by different generative models. In this\nwork, we introduce a novel and generalizable detection framework termed\nHyperDet, which innovatively captures and integrates shared knowledge from a\ncollection of functionally distinct and lightweight expert detectors. HyperDet\nleverages a large pretrained vision model to extract general detection features\nwhile simultaneously capturing and enhancing task-specific features. To achieve\nthis, HyperDet first groups SRM filters into five distinct groups to\nefficiently capture varying levels of pixel artifacts based on their different\nfunctionality and complexity. Then, HyperDet utilizes a hypernetwork to\ngenerate LoRA model weights with distinct embedding parameters. Finally, we\nmerge the LoRA networks to form an efficient model ensemble. Also, we propose a\nnovel objective function that balances the pixel and semantic artifacts\neffectively. Extensive experiments on the UnivFD and Fake2M datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance.

However, pretrained\nLLMs such as ChatGPT are periodically evolved, i.e., model parameters are\nfrequently updated), making it challenging for downstream users with limited\nresources to keep up with fine-tuning the newest LLMs for their domain\napplication. Even though fine-tuning costs have nowadays been reduced thanks to\nthe innovations of parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA, not all\ndownstream users have adequate computing for frequent personalization.\nMoreover, access to fine-tuning datasets, particularly in sensitive domains\nsuch as healthcare, could be time-restrictive, making it crucial to retain the\nknowledge encoded in earlier fine-tuned rounds for future adaptation. In this\npaper, we present PortLLM, a training-free framework that (i) creates an\ninitial lightweight model update patch to capture domain-specific knowledge,\nand (ii) allows a subsequent seamless plugging for the continual\npersonalization of evolved LLM at minimal cost. Our extensive experiments cover\nseven representative datasets, from easier question-answering tasks {BoolQ,\nSST2} to harder reasoning tasks {WinoGrande, GSM8K}, and models including\n{Mistral-7B, Llama2, Llama3.1, and Gemma2}, validating the portability of our\ndesigned model patches and showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed\nframework.

The combination of quantization and\nlow-rank approximation is now popular in both adapter-based,\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoftQ and low-precision\ninference techniques including ZeroQuant-V2. Usually, the low-rank terms are\ncalculated via the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the weight\nquantization error, minimizing the Frobenius and spectral norms of the weight\napproximation error. Recent methods like LQ-LoRA and LQER introduced\nhand-crafted heuristics to minimize errors in layer outputs (activations)\nrather than weights, resulting improved quantization results.

The proposed\nhyperbolic/parabolic divergence cleaning, ensures that the velocity divergence,\n$div(\\mathbf{u})$, is minimised throughout the simulation. The divergence\nequation is coupled with the momentum conservation equation through a scalar\nfield $\\psi$. A parabolic term is added to the time-evolving divergence\nequation, resulting in a hyperbolic/parabolic form, dissipating acoustic waves\nwith a speed of sound proportional to the local Mach number in order to\nmaximise dissipation of the velocity divergence, preventing unwanted diffusion\nof the pressure field. The $div(\\mathbf{u})$-SPH algorithm is implemented in\nthe open-source weakly compressible SPH solver DualSPHysics. The new\nformulation is validated against a range of challenging 2-D test cases\nincluding the Taylor-Green vortices, patch impact test, jet impinging on a\nsurface, and wave impact in a sloshing tank. The results show that the new\nformulation reduces the divergence in the velocity field by at least one order\nof magnitude which prevents spurious numerical noise and the formation of\nunphysical voids. The temporal evolution of the impact pressures shows that the\n$div(\\mathbf{u})$-SPH formulation virtually eliminates unwanted acoustic\npressure oscillations.

    "abstract": "In both animal and cell populations, the presence of leaders often underlies\nthe success of collective migration processes, which we characterise by a group\nmaintaining a cohesive configuration that consistently moves toward a target.\nWe extend a recent non-local hyperbolic model for follower-leader systems to\ninvestigate different degrees of leadership. Specifically, we consider three\nlevels of leadership: indifferent leaders, who do not alter their movement\naccording to followers; observant leaders, who attempt to remain connected with\nthe followers, but do not allow followers to affect their desired alignment;\nand persuadable leaders, who integrate their attempt to reach some target with\nthe alignment of all neighbours, both followers and leaders. A combination of\nanalysis and numerical simulations is used to investigate under which\nconditions each degree of leadership allows successful collective movement to a\ndestination. We find that the indifferent leaders' strategy can result in a\ncohesive and target-directed migration only for short times. Observant and\npersuadable leaders instead provide robust guidance, showing that the optimal\nleader behavior depends on the connection between the migrating individuals: if\nalignment is low, greater follower influence on leaders is beneficial for\nsuccessful guidance; otherwise, it can be detrimental and may generate various\nunsuccessful swarming dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Resilience is needed to make infrastructures fit for the future, but its\noperationalization is still lively discussed. Here, we identify three\nunderstandings of resilience from the existing literature: resilience as a\nprocess, an outcome, and a capacity. We show that all three understandings have\ntheir justification, as each plays its part in the core business of resilience,\nthat is, dealing with disruptive events. But, we also find that the trio\ndiffers considerably in terms of the implications for the operationalization of\nresilience. Most importantly, only the understanding of resilience as a\ncapacity allows for a continuous resilience monitoring and a management which\nis agnostic to the type of disruptive event. We therefore advocate to\nunderstand and assess resilience as a capacity. While this understanding is in\nline with popular opinion, it is often not reflected in the assessment\napproaches applied. This dissonance shows, for example, in the use of single\nperformance curves to assess resilience. We argue that in order to assess\nresilience as a capacity, we need to consider multiple performance curves,\notherwise we will capture the system's ability to deal with one specific event\ninstead of its ability to deal with any surprises that come its way.",

We assume Pal 14 was born in a now detached/disrupted dwarf\ngalaxy with a strong tidal field. Pal 14 evolved there until the slope of the\nstellar mass function (MF) became close to the measured value which is observed\nto be significantly shallower than in most GCs. After about 2-3 Gyr, Pal 14 was\nthen captured by the Milky Way (MW). Although the physical size of such a\ncluster is indistinguishable from a cluster that has lived its entire life in\nthe MW, other parameters like its mass and the MF-slope, strongly depend on the\ntime the cluster is taken from the dwarf galaxy. After being captured by the MW\non a new orbit, the cluster expands and eventually reaches the appropriate mass\nand size of Pal 14 after 11.5 Gyr while reproducing the observed MF. These\nsimulations thus suggest that Pal 14 may have formed in a dwarf galaxy with a\npost-gas-expulsion initial half-mass radius and mass of $r_h=7$ pc and\n$8<M/10^4<10 $ M$_{\\odot}$, respectively, with a high degree of primordial mass\nsegregation.",

In the\nliterature, many datasets have been created to train DL models for this\npurpose. However, these datasets suffer from several issues that will lead to\nlow detection accuracy of DL models. In this paper, we define three critical\nissues (i.e., data imbalance, low vulnerability coverage, biased vulnerability\ndistribution) that can significantly affect the model performance and three\nsecondary issues (i.e., errors in source code, mislabeling, noisy historical\ndata) that also affect the performance but can be addressed through a dedicated\npre-processing procedure. In addition, we conduct a study of 14 papers along\nwith 54 datasets for vulnerability detection to confirm these defined issues.\nFurthermore, we discuss good practices to use existing datasets and to create\nnew ones.",

We focus in this work on two\nissues that arise when deploying these models: a lack of diversity when\nprompting images, and a tendency to recreate images from the training set. To\nsolve both problems, we propose a method that coaxes the sampled trajectories\nof pretrained diffusion models to land on images that fall outside of a\nreference set. We achieve this by adding repellency terms to the diffusion SDE\nthroughout the generation trajectory, which are triggered whenever the path is\nexpected to land too closely to an image in the shielded reference set. Our\nmethod is sparse in the sense that these repellency terms are zero and inactive\nmost of the time, and even more so towards the end of the generation\ntrajectory. Our method, named SPELL for sparse repellency, can be used either\nwith a static reference set that contains protected images, or dynamically, by\nupdating the set at each timestep with the expected images concurrently\ngenerated within a batch, and with the images of previously generated batches.\nWe show that adding SPELL to popular diffusion models improves their diversity\nwhile impacting their FID only marginally, and performs comparatively better\nthan other recent training-free diversity methods. We also demonstrate how\nSPELL can ensure a shielded generation away from a very large set of protected\nimages by considering all 1.2M images from ImageNet as the protected set.",

This paper investigates whether language models efficiently use\nindirect data (indirect evidence), from which they infer sentence\nacceptability. In contrast, humans use indirect evidence efficiently, which is\nconsidered one of the inductive biases contributing to efficient language\nacquisition. To explore this question, we introduce the Wug InDirect Evidence\nTest (WIDET), a dataset consisting of training instances inserted into the\npre-training data and evaluation instances. We inject synthetic instances with\nnewly coined wug words into pretraining data and explore the model's behavior\non evaluation data that assesses grammatical acceptability regarding those\nwords. We prepare the injected instances by varying their levels of\nindirectness and quantity. Our experiments surprisingly show that language\nmodels do not induce grammatical knowledge even after repeated exposure to\ninstances with the same structure but differing only in lexical items from\nevaluation instances in certain language phenomena. Our findings suggest a\npotential direction for future research: developing models that use latent\nindirect evidence to induce grammatical knowledge.",

We\nprovide both an analytical perspective and empirical evidence demonstrating\nthat quantization inherently encourages flatter minima, leading to better\ngeneralization across domains.

These disruptions affect access to resources, employment, and\nhousing, amplifying existing vulnerabilities within communities. Understanding\nthe interplay between climate change, wildfires, evacuation patterns, and\nsocioeconomic factors is crucial for developing effective mitigation and\nadaptation strategies. To contribute to this challenge, we use high-definition\nmobile phone records to analyse evacuation patterns during the wildfires in\nValpara\\'iso, Chile, that took place between February 2-3, 2024. This data\nallows us to track the movements of individuals in the disaster area, providing\ninsight into how people respond to large-scale evacuations in the context of\nsevere wildfires. We apply a causal inference approach that combines regression\ndiscontinuity and difference-in-differences methodologies to observe evacuation\nbehaviours during wildfires, with a focus on socioeconomic stratification. This\napproach allows us to isolate the impact of the wildfires on different\nsocioeconomic groups by comparing the evacuation patterns of affected\npopulations before and after the event, while accounting for underlying trends\nand discontinuities at the threshold of the disaster. We find that many people\nspent nights away from home, with those in the lowest socioeconomic segment\nstayed away the longest. In general, people reduced their travel distance\nduring the evacuation, and the lowest socioeconomic group moved the least.\nInitially, movements became more random, as people sought refuge in a rush, but\neventually gravitated towards areas with similar socioeconomic status. Our\nresults show that socioeconomic differences play a role in evacuation dynamics,\nproviding useful insights for response planning.",

    "abstract": "Background. In the last decades, several life science resources have\nstructured data using the same framework and made these accessible using the\nsame query language to facilitate interoperability. Knowledge graphs have seen\nincreased adoption in bioinformatics due to their advantages for representing\ndata in a generic graph format. For example, yummydata.org catalogs more than\n60 knowledge graphs accessible through SPARQL, a technical query language.\nAlthough SPARQL allows powerful, expressive queries, even across physically\ndistributed knowledge graphs, formulating such queries is a challenge for most\nusers. Therefore, to guide users in retrieving the relevant data, many of these\nresources provide representative examples. These examples can also be an\nimportant source of information for machine learning, if a sufficiently large\nnumber of examples are provided and published in a common, machine-readable and\nstandardized format across different resources.\n  Findings. We introduce a large collection of human-written natural language\nquestions and their corresponding SPARQL queries over federated bioinformatics\nknowledge graphs (KGs) collected for several years across different research\ngroups at the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. The collection comprises\nmore than 1000 example questions and queries, including 65 federated queries.\nWe propose a methodology to uniformly represent the examples with minimal\nmetadata, based on existing standards. Furthermore, we introduce an extensive\nset of open-source applications, including query graph visualizations and smart\nquery editors, easily reusable by KG maintainers who adopt the proposed\nmethodology.\n  Conclusions. We encourage the community to adopt and extend the proposed\nmethodology, towards richer KG metadata and improved Semantic Web services.",

    "abstract": "Motion forecasting for agents in autonomous driving is highly challenging due\nto the numerous possibilities for each agent's next action and their complex\ninteractions in space and time. In real applications, motion forecasting takes\nplace repeatedly and continuously as the self-driving car moves. However,\nexisting forecasting methods typically process each driving scene within a\ncertain range independently, totally ignoring the situational and contextual\nrelationships between successive driving scenes. This significantly simplifies\nthe forecasting task, making the solutions suboptimal and inefficient to use in\npractice. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a novel motion\nforecasting framework for continuous driving, named RealMotion. It comprises\ntwo integral streams both at the scene level: (1) The scene context stream\nprogressively accumulates historical scene information until the present\nmoment, capturing temporal interactive relationships among scene elements. (2)\nThe agent trajectory stream optimizes current forecasting by sequentially\nrelaying past predictions. Besides, a data reorganization strategy is\nintroduced to narrow the gap between existing benchmarks and real-world\napplications, consistent with our network. These approaches enable exploiting\nmore broadly the situational and progressive insights of dynamic motion across\nspace and time. Extensive experiments on Argoverse series with different\nsettings demonstrate that our RealMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nalong with the advantage of efficient real-world inference.

First, we examine the localization in the linear\ncondensate and find that the SO coupling can lead to a transition of the\nlocalized state from the \"basin-like\" to the \"void\" region of the potential.\nFor a weak random potential upon an increase in the SO coupling, we find a\nre-entrant transition from a broad to narrow localized state and back at a\nhigher SO coupling.

    "abstract": "An important line of research in the field of explainability is to extract a\nsmall subset of crucial rationales from the full input. The most widely used\ncriterion for rationale extraction is the maximum mutual information (MMI)\ncriterion. However, in certain datasets, there are spurious features\nnon-causally correlated with the label and also get high mutual information,\ncomplicating the loss landscape of MMI. Although some penalty-based methods\nhave been developed to penalize the spurious features (e.g., invariance\npenalty, intervention penalty, etc) to help MMI work better, these are merely\nremedial measures. In the optimization objectives of these methods, spurious\nfeatures are still distinguished from plain noise, which hinders the discovery\nof causal rationales. This paper aims to develop a new criterion that treats\nspurious features as plain noise, allowing the model to work on datasets rich\nin spurious features as if it were working on clean datasets, thereby making\nrationale extraction easier. We theoretically observe that removing either\nplain noise or spurious features from the input does not alter the conditional\ndistribution of the remaining components relative to the task label. However,\nsignificant changes in the conditional distribution occur only when causal\nfeatures are eliminated. Based on this discovery, the paper proposes a\ncriterion for \\textbf{M}aximizing the \\textbf{R}emaining \\textbf{D}iscrepancy\n(MRD). Experiments on six widely used datasets show that our MRD criterion\nimproves rationale quality (measured by the overlap with human-annotated\nrationales) by up to $10.4\\%$ as compared to several recent competitive MMI\nvariants.

We test our\nframework against a benchmark of an anatomic region of brain tissue and a\nvasculature of the human liver. In all cases, the total tree energy is improved\nsignificantly compared to local approaches.

However, the\ndiversity of interaction modes, keyboard sizes, and visual feedback in these\nenvironments introduces divergent word-gesture trajectory data patterns, thus\nleading to complexity in decoding trajectories into text. Template-matching\ndecoding methods, such as SHARK^2, are commonly used for these WGK systems\nbecause they are easy to implement and configure. However, these methods are\nsusceptible to decoding inaccuracies for noisy trajectories. While conventional\nneural-network-based decoders (neural decoders) trained on word-gesture\ntrajectory data have been proposed to improve accuracy, they have their own\nlimitations: they require extensive data for training and deep-learning\nexpertise for implementation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nsolution that combines ease of implementation with high decoding accuracy: a\ngeneralizable neural decoder enabled by pre-training on large-scale coarsely\ndiscretized word-gesture trajectories. This approach produces a ready-to-use\nWGK decoder that is generalizable across mid-air and on-surface WGK systems in\naugmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which is evident by a robust\naverage Top-4 accuracy of 90.4% on four diverse datasets. It significantly\noutperforms SHARK^2 with a 37.2% enhancement and surpasses the conventional\nneural decoder by 7.4%.

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models have fueled progress in image captioning.\nThese models, fine-tuned on vast image datasets, exhibit a deep understanding\nof semantic concepts. In this work, we show that this ability can be\nre-purposed for audio captioning, where the joint image-language decoder can be\nleveraged to describe auditory content associated with image sequences within\nvideos featuring audiovisual content. This can be achieved via multimodal\nalignment. Yet, this multimodal alignment task is non-trivial due to the\ninherent disparity between audible and visible elements in real-world videos.\nMoreover, multimodal representation learning often relies on contrastive\nlearning, facing the challenge of the so-called modality gap which hinders\nsmooth integration between modalities. In this work, we introduce a novel\nmethodology for bridging the audiovisual modality gap by matching the\ndistributions of tokens produced by an audio backbone and those of an image\ncaptioner. Our approach aligns the audio token distribution with that of the\nimage tokens, enabling the model to perform zero-shot audio captioning in an\nunsupervised fashion while keeping the initial image captioning component\nunaltered. This alignment allows for the use of either audio or audiovisual\ninput by combining or substituting the image encoder with the aligned audio\nencoder. Our method achieves significantly improved performances in zero-shot\naudio captioning, compared to existing approaches.",

In such a scenario, an\nimportant challenge to be overcome is to consider entanglement between two or\nmore quantum particles in different inertial frames, potentially experiencing\nrelativistic effects affecting quantum correlations. In this paper, we present\na consistent framework that overcomes this challenge. To this end, we establish\nthe notion of factorizable and entangled multi-time trajectories and derive a\nclass of Euler--Lagrange equations under the constraint of a non-entangling\nbehavior. Comparing this restricted evolution to the solutions of the\nunrestricted equations of motion allows one to investigate the trajectory-based\nentanglement of general systems.

We create\na comprehensive benchmark dataset using publicly available data and evaluate\nthe performance of various recommender system models on the NNBR task.\n  Our findings reveal that predicting novel items in mutual fund portfolios is\ninherently more challenging than predicting the entire portfolio or only\nrepeated items. While state-of-the-art NBR models are outperformed by simple\nheuristics when considering both novel and repeated items together,\nautoencoder-based approaches demonstrate superior performance in predicting\nonly new items.\n  The insights gained from this study highlight the importance of considering\ndomain-specific characteristics when applying recommender systems to mutual\nfund portfolio prediction.

In this article, using\ngenuine equivariant homotopy structure on Hochschild homology as in [ABG+18,\nBHM22], we give an equivariant description of Kaledin's polynomial periodic\ncyclic homology. This leads to Morita invariance without any Noetherianness\nassumption as in [Kal18], and the comparison to derived de Rham cohomology\nbecomes transparent. Moreover, this description adapts directly to\n\"topological\" analogues, which gives rise to a de-Nygaard-completion of the\ntopological periodic cyclic homology, which admits an extension to linear\ncategories over truncated Brown--Peterson spectra.

To address these issues, we focus on the latest technology,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which enables LLMs to reference reliable\nexternal knowledge (REK). Specifically, this study examines the utility and\nreliability of a recently released RAG-equipped LLM (RAG-LLM), NotebookLM, for\nstaging lung cancer.\n  Materials and methods: We summarized the current lung cancer staging\nguideline in Japan and provided this as REK to NotebookLM. We then tasked\nNotebookLM with staging 100 fictional lung cancer cases based on CT findings\nand evaluated its accuracy. For comparison, we performed the same task using a\ngold-standard LLM, GPT-4 Omni (GPT-4o), both with and without the REK.\n  Results: NotebookLM achieved 86% diagnostic accuracy in the lung cancer\nstaging experiment, outperforming GPT-4o, which recorded 39% accuracy with the\nREK and 25% without it. Moreover, NotebookLM demonstrated 95% accuracy in\nsearching reference locations within the REK.\n  Conclusion: NotebookLM successfully performed lung cancer staging by\nutilizing the REK, demonstrating superior performance compared to GPT-4o.\nAdditionally, it provided highly accurate reference locations within the REK,\nallowing radiologists to efficiently evaluate the reliability of NotebookLM's\nresponses and detect possible hallucinations.

    "abstract": "The increasing size of deep learning models has made distributed training\nacross multiple devices essential. However, current methods such as distributed\ndata-parallel training suffer from large communication and synchronization\noverheads when training across devices, leading to longer training times as a\nresult of suboptimal hardware utilization. Asynchronous stochastic gradient\ndescent (ASGD) methods can improve training speed, but are sensitive to delays\ndue to both communication and differences throughput. Moreover, the\nbackpropagation algorithm used within ASGD workers is bottlenecked by the\ninterlocking between its forward and backward passes. Current methods also do\nnot take advantage of the large differences in the computation required for the\nforward and backward passes. Therefore, we propose an extension to ASGD called\nPartial Decoupled ASGD (PD-ASGD) that addresses these issues. PD-ASGD uses\nseparate threads for the forward and backward passes, decoupling the updates\nand allowing for a higher ratio of forward to backward threads than the usual\n1:1 ratio, leading to higher throughput. PD-ASGD also performs layer-wise\n(partial) model updates concurrently across multiple threads. This reduces\nparameter staleness and consequently improves robustness to delays. Our\napproach yields close to state-of-the-art results while running up to\n$5.95\\times$ faster than synchronous data parallelism in the presence of\ndelays, and up to $2.14\\times$ times faster than comparable ASGD algorithms by\nachieving higher model flops utilization. We mathematically describe the\ngradient bias introduced by our method, establish an upper bound, and prove\nconvergence.",

The increasing capacity of LLMs to process\nlonger input sequences opens up avenues for providing more retrieved\ninformation, to potentially enhance the quality of generated outputs. It is\nplausible to assume that a larger retrieval set would contain more relevant\ninformation (higher recall), that might result in improved performance.\nHowever, our empirical findings demonstrate that for many long-context LLMs,\nthe quality of generated output initially improves first, but then subsequently\ndeclines as the number of retrieved passages increases.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes new methods for analyzing dynamic images registered by\nmultichannel, highly sensitive detectors with low spatial but high temporal\nresolution. The principal characteristic of the approach is the absence of\nfactorization of different types of information within the data set. For a\nnumber of rapidly changing (transient) phenomena in the Earth's atmosphere, a\nprobabilistic model can be formulated, and the parameters of this model can be\nreconstructed using probabilistic programming methods (Bayesian inference based\non Markov chain Monte Carlo). This paper demonstrates the aforementioned\napproach on a number of examples, both simulated and actually registered by the\ndetectors of the SINP MSU.\n  In the case of submillisecond ELVES events registered by the orbital\nMini-EUSO detector on board the ISS, the probabilistic model includes the\ncoordinates and orientation of the lightning discharge that generated the glow,\nas well as the height of the ionized layer in which the glow is registered,\namong its parameters. Bayesian inference, implemented by means of the PyMC\nlibrary, allows us to calculate posterior distributions for these parameters\nbased on the times of signal peaks in individual detector channels.\n  In addition to studying different types of aurora, the circumpolar system of\nground-based multichannel PAIPS detectors also serves as a test-bench for\nprobabilistic reconstruction algorithms. A wide class of track events is used\nfor this purpose - meteors, satellite and aircraft passes, and the movement of\nstars across the sky. The Bayesian model includes both the parameters of the\ntrack event itself and the peculiarities of its registration. These methods can\nbe generalized to stereo events (track registration by two detectors with\noverlapping fields of view) or applied to the reconstruction of extremely high\nenergy cosmic rays in orbital fluorescence detectors.",

It is implicitly assumed in\nthe method that the selected stars are carbon-rich AGB stars. However, as the\nsample selected to determine M_J is purely colour based there can also be\ncontamination by oxygen-rich AGB stars. As the ratio of C to O-rich stars is\nknown to depend on metallicity and initial mass, the star formation history and\nage-metallicity relation in a galaxy should influence the value of M_J.\n  The aim of this paper is to look at mixed samples of O- and C-rich stars for\nthe LMC, the SMC and Milky Way (MW), using the Gaia catalogue of long period\nvariables as basis. We report the mean and median magnitudes and the results of\nfitting Gaussian and Lorentzian profiles to the luminosity function (LF) using\ndifferent colour and magnitudes cuts.\n  For the SMC and LMC we confirm the previous results in the literature. The\nLFs of the SMC and LMC JAGB stars are clearly different, yet the mean magnitude\ninside a selection box can be argued to agree at the 0.02~mag level.\n  The analysis of the MW sample is less straightforward. The contamination by\nO-rich stars is substantial for a classical lower limit of (J-Ks)0= 1.3, and\nbecomes less than 10% only for (J-Ks)0= 1.5.\n  The sample of AGB stars is much smaller than for the MCs for two reasons.\nNearby AGB stars tend to be absent as they saturate in the 2MASS catalogue, and\nthe parallax errors of AGB stars tend to be larger compared to non-AGB stars.\nThe mean and median magnitudes are fainter than for the MC samples by about\n0.4~mag which is not predicted by theory.

Their definition is always a compromise, as\nstatic ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and temporal reconfigurations of the\nbrain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally\nhomogeneous regions, which can explain the low functional homogeneity values\nobserved for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity\nassumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines, which can cause\nserious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the\nnode-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with\nboundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In\nthis representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer\nlinks depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer links\nquantify the overlap between ROIs on different layers. The ROI optimization\napproach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold\nincrease in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs\nfrom the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at\nshort time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The\namount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer\nhubness: ROIs with intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger\nintralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs.

We address the issue of\nwhether this is a suitable approximation or not and its degree of validity by\nusing rigorous mathematical methods and direct numerical simulations. More\nspecifically, we show that, as the vortex core thickness goes to zero, the\nvortex core moves (at leading order and for long periods of time) with a\nvelocity proportional to its local curvature and the binormal vector to the\ncurve. The main idea of our analysis lies in a reformulation of the\nGross-Pitaevski equation in terms of associated velocity and vorticity fields\nthat resemble the Euler system written in terms of vorticity in its weak form.\nWe also present full numerical simulations aimed to compare Gross-Pitaevski and\nbinormal flow in various physical situations of interest such as the periodic\nevolution of deformed vortex rings and the reconnection of vortex filaments.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal document understanding is a challenging task to process and\ncomprehend large amounts of textual and visual information. Recent advances in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved the performance of\nthis task. However, existing methods typically focus on either plain text or a\nlimited number of document images, struggling to handle long PDF documents with\ninterleaved text and images, especially for academic papers. In this paper, we\nintroduce PDF-WuKong, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) which is\ndesigned to enhance multimodal question-answering (QA) for long PDF documents.\nPDF-WuKong incorporates a sparse sampler that operates on both text and image\nrepresentations, significantly improving the efficiency and capability of the\nMLLM. The sparse sampler is integrated with the MLLM's image encoder and\nselects the paragraphs or diagrams most pertinent to user queries for\nprocessing by the language model. To effectively train and evaluate our model,\nwe construct PaperPDF, a dataset consisting of a broad collection of English\nand Chinese academic papers. Multiple strategies are proposed to automatically\ngenerate 1.1 million QA pairs along with their corresponding evidence sources.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority and high efficiency of our\napproach over other models on the task of long multimodal document\nunderstanding, surpassing proprietary products by an average of 8.6% on F1.

    "abstract": "Existing perception models achieve great success by learning from large\namounts of labeled data, but they still struggle with open-world scenarios. To\nalleviate this issue, researchers introduce open-set perception tasks to detect\nor segment unseen objects in the training set. However, these models require\npredefined object categories as inputs during inference, which are not\navailable in real-world scenarios. Recently, researchers pose a new and more\npractical problem, \\textit{i.e.}, open-ended object detection, which discovers\nunseen objects without any object categories as inputs. In this paper, we\npresent VL-SAM, a training-free framework that combines the generalized object\nrecognition model (\\textit{i.e.,} Vision-Language Model) with the generalized\nobject localization model (\\textit{i.e.,} Segment-Anything Model), to address\nthe open-ended object detection and segmentation task. Without additional\ntraining, we connect these two generalized models with attention maps as the\nprompts. Specifically, we design an attention map generation module by\nemploying head aggregation and a regularized attention flow to aggregate and\npropagate attention maps across all heads and layers in VLM, yielding\nhigh-quality attention maps. Then, we iteratively sample positive and negative\npoints from the attention maps with a prompt generation module and send the\nsampled points to SAM to segment corresponding objects. Experimental results on\nthe long-tail instance segmentation dataset (LVIS) show that our method\nsurpasses the previous open-ended method on the object detection task and can\nprovide additional instance segmentation masks. Besides, VL-SAM achieves\nfavorable performance on the corner case object detection dataset (CODA),\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of VL-SAM in real-world applications. Moreover,\nVL-SAM exhibits good model generalization that can incorporate various VLMs and\nSAMs.",

The Dirac fermion zero modes in topological insulators, which are\nsymmetry-protected doubling of MZMs under fermion number conservation, offer an\nalternative approach to explore non-Abelian anyons. However, a unified model\nthat elucidates the braiding statistics of these types of topological zero\nmodes remains absent. We show that the minimal Kitaev chain model beyond\nfine-tuning regime provides a unified characterization of the non-Abelian\nstatistics of both MZMs and Dirac fermion zero modes in different parameter\nregimes. In particular, we introduce a minimal tri-junction setting based on\nthe minimal Kitaev chain model and show it facilitates the unified scheme of\nbraiding Dirac fermion zero modes, as well as the MZMs in the assistance of a\nDirac mode. This unified minimal model provides deeper insights into\nnon-Abelian statistics, demonstrating that the non-Abelian braiding of MZMs can\nbe continuously extended to encompass Dirac fermion zero modes.

Our extension, which demonstrates novel nontrivial phases with\nnon-Abelian MZM pairs and Dirac zero modes emerging in the broader parameter\nregimes without fine-tuning, expands the accessible experimental parameter\nspace and enhances the feasibility of observing non-Abelian statistics in the\nminimal Kitaev chain model.",

    "abstract": "The slowing down of Moore's law has driven the development of\napplication-specific processors for deep learning. Analog photonic processors\noffer a promising solution for accelerating matrix-vector multiplications\n(MVMs) in deep learning by leveraging parallel computations in the optical\ndomain. Intensity-based photonic MVM processors, which do not utilize the phase\ninformation of light, are appealing due to their simplified operations.\nHowever, existing intensity-based schemes for such processors often employ\nwavelength multiplexing or mode multiplexing, both of which have limited\nscalability due to high insertion loss or wavelength crosstalk. In this work,\nwe present a scalable intensity-based photonic MVM processor based on the\nconcept of waveguide multiplexing. This scheme employs multiport photodetectors\n(PDs) to sum the intensities of multiple optical signals, eliminating the need\nfor multiple wavelengths or modes. A 16-port Ge PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of\n11.8 GHz at a bias voltage of -3 V is demonstrated, and it can be further\nscaled up to handle 250 ports while maintaining a 6.1 GHz operation bandwidth.\nA 4 $\\times$ 4 circuit fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform is used\nto perform MVMs in a 3-layer neural network designed for classifying Iris\nflowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Furthermore, the\nperformance of large-scale circuits in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for\nFashion-MNIST is simulated, resulting in a classification accuracy of 90.53%.\nThis work provides a simplified and scalable approach to photonic MVM, laying a\nfoundation for large-scale and multi-dimensional photonic matrix-matrix\nmultiplication in optical neural networks.",

Over\nthe past decade, numerous examples have shown the extent to which nation-states\nbecome vulnerable if they do not focus on building their cyber capacities.\nAdding to the inherent complexity of cyberwar scenarios, a state is usually a\nmember of one or more alliances. Alliance policies and internal struggles could\nshape the individual actions of member states; intuitively, this also holds for\nthe cyber domain.\n  In this paper, we define and study a simple Cyber Alliance Game with the\nobjective of understanding the fundamental influence of alliances on cyber\nconflicts between nation-states. Specifically, we focus on the decision of\nwhether to exploit a newly found vulnerability individually or share it with\nthe alliance. First, we characterize the impact of vulnerability-sharing\nrewards on the resulting equilibrium. Second, we study the implications of the\ninternal power structure of alliances on cyberwar outcomes and infer the\nexpected behavior of Dictator, Veto, and Dummy players. Finally, we investigate\nhow alliances can nudge their members via rewards and punishments to adhere to\ntheir defensive or offensive cyber policy.

Recent approaches propose robust fine-tuning methods, such\nas adversarial tuning of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) in large vision models, but\nthey still struggle to match the accuracy of full parameter adversarial\nfine-tuning. The integration of various defense mechanisms offers a promising\napproach to enhancing the robustness of large vision models, yet this paradigm\nremains underexplored. To address this, we propose hyper adversarial tuning\n(HyperAT), which leverages shared defensive knowledge among different methods\nto improve model robustness efficiently and effectively simultaneously.\nSpecifically, adversarial tuning of each defense method is formulated as a\nlearning task, and a hypernetwork generates LoRA specific to this defense.\nThen, a random sampling and tuning strategy is proposed to extract and\nfacilitate the defensive knowledge transfer between different defenses.\nFinally, diverse LoRAs are merged to enhance the adversarial robustness.\nExperiments on various datasets and model architectures demonstrate that\nHyperAT significantly enhances the adversarial robustness of pretrained large\nvision models without excessive computational overhead, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art benchmark.",

Within a narrow band of temperature above the\ntransition temperature Tc, the coexistence of SFs-mediated positive MR and\nWL-led negative MR in different range of magnetic field, as well as a crossover\nfrom positive to negative MR with increasing temperature are reported here. The\ncrossover temperature coincides with a characteristic temperature (Tmax) at\nwhich a resistance peak appears in the zero-field R(T).

By introducing individual coefficients to both\nSFs and WL contributions, the dominance of one over the other is monitored with\nrespect to temperature.

For the first time, we study the collapse of a spherically\nsymmetric star with uniform dust density in this setting. We assume that the\ninterior geometry respects the symmetries of the matter configuration, i.e.,\nhomogeneity and isotropy, thus it is insensitive to the Weyl-squared term and\nthe interior dynamics is fully determined by $R$ and $R^2$. As our main result,\nwe find that the collapse leads to the formation of a horizon, implying that\nthe endpoint of a uniform dust collapse with a homogeneous and isotropic\ninterior is not a horizonless spacetime. We also show that the\ncurvature-squared contribution is responsible for making the collapse into a\nsingularity faster than the standard Oppenheimer-Snyder scenario. Furthermore,\nthe junction conditions connecting spacetime inside and outside the matter\ndistribution are found to be significantly more constraining than their\ncounterparts in General Relativity and we discuss key properties of any\nexterior solution matching to the spacetime inside the collapsing star.\nFinally, we comment on the potentially non-generic behavior entailed by our\nassumptions.",

Camera specifics, hand self-occlusion, and\nrapid movements of both head and fingers introduce considerable uncertainty\nabout the exact location of touch events. Existing methods have thus not been\ncapable of achieving the performance needed for robust interaction. In this\npaper, we present a real-time pipeline that detects touch input from all ten\nfingers on any physical surface, purely based on egocentric hand tracking. Our\nmethod TouchInsight comprises a neural network to predict the moment of a touch\nevent, the finger making contact, and the touch location. TouchInsight\nrepresents locations through a bivariate Gaussian distribution to account for\nuncertainties due to sensing inaccuracies, which we resolve through contextual\npriors to accurately infer intended user input. We first evaluated our method\noffline and found that it locates input events with a mean error of 6.3 mm, and\naccurately detects touch events (F1=0.99) and identifies the finger used\n(F1=0.96).

However, LLM performance in\nrecommendation scenarios remains limited due to the mismatch between their\npretraining objectives and recommendation tasks, as well as the lack of\nrecommendation-specific data during pretraining. To address these challenges,\nwe propose DPO4Rec, a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO) into LLM-enhanced recommendation systems.

Extensive experiments are conducted across a variety of\nmulti-modal benchmarks.

The rising global\npopularity of Japanese manga has made the object detection of character faces\nincreasingly important, with potential applications such as automatic\ncolorization. However, obtaining sufficient data for training conventional\nobject detectors is challenging due to copyright restrictions. Additionally,\nnew characters appear every time a new volume of manga is released, making it\nimpractical to re-train object detectors each time to detect these new\ncharacters. Therefore, one-shot object detection, where only a single query\n(reference) image is required to detect a new character, is an essential task\nin the manga industry. One challenge with one-shot object detection in manga is\nthe large variation in the poses and facial expressions of characters in target\nimages, despite having only one query image as a reference. Another challenge\nis that the frequency of character appearances follows a long-tail\ndistribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a data augmentation\nmethod in feature space to increase the variation of the query. The proposed\nmethod augments the feature from the query by adding Gaussian noise, with the\nnoise variance at each channel learned during training. The experimental\nresults show that the proposed method improves the performance for both seen\nand unseen classes, surpassing data augmentation methods in image space.",

    "abstract": "The Lie algebra of vector fields on $S^1$ integrates to the Lie group of\ndiffeomorphisms of $S^1$. It is well known since the work of Segal and Neretin\nthat there is no Lie group whose Lie algebra is the complexification of vector\nfields on $S^1$. A substitute for that non-existent group is provided by the\ncomplex semigroup whose elements are annuli: genus zero Riemann surfaces with\ntwo boundary circles parametrized by $S^1$. The group $\\mathrm{Diff}(S^1)$ sits\nat the boundary of that semigroup, and can be thought of as annuli which are\ncompletely thin, i.e. with empty interior.\n  In this paper, we consider an enlargement of the semigroup of annuli, denoted\n$\\mathrm{Ann}$, where the annuli are allowed to be partially thin: their two\nboundary circles are allowed to touch each other along an arbitrary closed\nsubset. We prove that every (partially thin) annulus $A\\in \\mathrm{Ann}$ is the\ntime-ordered exponential of a path with values in the cone of inward pointing\ncomplexified vector fields on $S^1$, and use that fact to construct a central\nextension \\[ 0\\to \\mathbb{C} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\to \\tilde{\\mathrm{Ann}} \\to\n\\mathrm{Ann} \\to 0 \\] that integrates the universal (Virasoro) central\nextension of the Lie algebra of vector fields on $S^1$.\n  In later work, we will prove that every unitary positive energy\nrepresentations of the Virasoro algebra integrates to a holomorphic\nrepresentation of $\\tilde{\\mathrm{Ann}}$ by bounded operators on a Hilbert\nspace.",

We\ninvestigate various configurations (bubble sizes, bubble position, existence of\nprotrusion) on a cylinder-to-cylinder setup that emulates a specific SST module\n(from SSTAR Horizon Europe project) under transient overvoltage as well as in\nits design operational conditions (VRMS = 66 kV, AC excitation of 50 Hz). Our\nresults on electrical characteristics and plasma dynamics leading to the PD\nignition, indicate that under transient overvoltage and for mm size bubbles\n(diameter 1 -4.5 mm), the smaller the bubble the less the inception voltage,\nwhile the peak inception voltage is higher than 70 kV. The existence of\nmetallic protrusion can affect the inception voltage of a remote floating\nbubble only slightly and when this is close to the sharp tip. The extreme\nscenario of a protrusion in contact (inside) a gas bubble severely affects the\ninsulation properties and drops the PD inception voltage remarkably. The larger\nthe bubble and the sharper the tip of the protrusion the lower the inception\npeak voltage, that can reach values well below 40 kV. On the contrary and under\ndesign operation, larger bubbles increase the severity and probability of PD\nevents, leading to lower instantaneous inception voltages.

In\nthis paper, we propose a general continual instruction tuning framework to\naddress the challenge.

Meanwhile, individual differences could potentially bias the\nunderstanding of these sex differences. To address these challenges, we propose\na consensus rank-based method to quantify sex differences in four node\ncentrality ranking within the functional brain network. This method aggregates\nindividuals' nodal centrality rankings into a consensus or \"average\" ranking,\nminimizing the impact of outliers and enhancing the robustness of the findings.\nBy analyzing resting-state functional MRI data from 1,948 healthy young adults\n(aged 18-27 years, 1,163 females), we find significant sex differences in the\ntopology of functional brain network, primarily attributed to biological sex\nrather than individual differences. Particularly, sex accounts for\napproximately 10% of the differences in nodal centrality consensus rankings.\nUsing a rank difference index (RDI), we identify eight critical brain regions\nwith the greatest rank differences, including the insula, supramarginal gyrus,\nand dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus. females show higher rankings in\nregions with stronger intra-system connections, whereas males dominate in areas\nwith stronger inter-system connections.

We successfully reproduce their results, but find that\ntheir method is limited to only one single type of periodic orbits.

We compare the properties of test particles in the Portai et al.\n(2017) MW potential model (P17) with the observed SiO maser stars from the\nBulge Asymmetries and Dynamical Evolution (BAaDE) survey. We find that the l-v\nenvelope generated by the bar potential demonstrates reasonable agreement with\nthe observational data, albeit with slight discrepancies near the Galactic\ncenter. The inconsistencies suggest that the P17 potential yields a lower\ncentral rotation curve, a slightly larger quadrupole strength, or a possibly\nunderestimated pattern speed. We also adopt an updated version of the P17\npotential with a modified central mass component (CMC) proposed by Hunter et\nal. (2024) (H24). The fitting of the l-v envelope suggests that the H24\npotential does not completely address the existing challenges and may hint at a\npossible underestimation of the central bar mass.

This paper presents a detailed quantitative evaluation of performance of\n16 GMPEs against recorded ground motion data in two target regions,\ncharacterized by distinct seismo-tectonic, geophysical and geotectonical\nnature. The data set comprises of 465 three-component spectral accelerograms\ncorresponding to 122 earthquake events. The suitability of a GMPE is tested by\ntwo widely accepted data-driven statistical methods, namely, likelihood (LH)\nand log-likelihood (LLH) method. Different suites of GMPEs are shown suitable\nfor different periods of interest. The results will be useful to scientists and\nengineers for microzonation and estimation of seismic design parameters for the\ndesign of earthquake-resistant structures in these regions.",

    "abstract": "A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an\ninteracting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are\nhandled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when\nquantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in\nscenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where\nadditional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these\nlimitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light\nand matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and\nnonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we\nintroduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical\nelectromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From\nthis formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover\nclassical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in\nthe corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb\ninteraction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic\nexchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock\npotential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces\nbut also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate\nconditions.",

Initially, Recurrent\nNeural Networks (RNNs) were employed for this task; however, their error\naccumulation issues led to the adoption of Transformers, leveraging attention\nmechanisms to mitigate these problems. Concurrently, the promising results of\ndiffusion models in capturing original distributions have positioned them at\nthe forefront of current research, often in conjunction with Transformers. In\nthis paper, we propose replacing time-oriented Transformers with State-Space\nModels (SSM), which are better suited for temporal data modeling. Specifically,\nwe utilize the latest SSM variant, S6, which incorporates attention-like\nmechanisms. By embedding S6 within Mamba blocks, we develop a model that\nintegrates SSM, Graph Neural Networks, and node-oriented Transformers to\nachieve enhanced spatiotemporal representations. Implementing these\narchitectural modifications, previously unexplored in this field, we present\nTime series Imputation with Bi-directional mamba blocks and diffusion models\n(TIMBA). TIMBA achieves superior performance in almost all benchmark scenarios\nand performs comparably in others across a diverse range of missing value\nsituations and three real-world datasets.

However,\nfrequent MA position adjustments based on instantaneous channel state\ninformation (CSI) incur high operational complexity, making real-time CSI\nacquisition impractical, especially in fast-fading channels. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a two-timescale transmission framework for MA-enabled\nmultiuser multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In the large\ntimescale, statistical CSI is exploited to optimize MA positions for long-term\nergodic performance, whereas, in the small timescale, beamforming vectors are\ndesigned using instantaneous CSI to handle short-term channel fluctuations.\nWithin this new framework, we analyze the ergodic sum rate and develop\nefficient MA position optimization algorithms for both\nmaximum-ratio-transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming schemes.\nThese algorithms employ alternating optimization (AO), successive convex\napproximation (SCA), and majorization-minimization (MM) techniques, iteratively\noptimizing antenna positions and refining surrogate functions that approximate\nthe ergodic sum rate. Numerical results show significant ergodic sum rate gains\nwith the proposed two-timescale MA design over conventional FPA systems,\nparticularly under moderate to strong line-of-sight (LoS) conditions. Notably,\nMA with ZF beamforming consistently outperforms MA with MRT, highlighting the\nsynergy between beamforming and MAs for superior interference management in\nenvironments with moderate Rician factors and high user density, while MA with\nMRT can offer a simplified alternative to complex beamforming designs in strong\nLoS conditions.",

As the\nscope of tasks and modalities expands, it becomes increasingly important to\ngenerate and strategically position task- and modal-specific priors within the\nuniversal model. However, existing universal models often overlook the\ncorrelations between different priors, and the optimal placement and frequency\nof these priors remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MedUniSeg, a\nprompt-driven universal segmentation model designed for 2D and 3D multi-task\nsegmentation across diverse modalities and domains. MedUniSeg employs multiple\nmodal-specific prompts alongside a universal task prompt to accurately\ncharacterize the modalities and tasks. To generate the related priors, we\npropose the modal map (MMap) and the fusion and selection (FUSE) modules, which\ntransform modal and task prompts into corresponding priors. These modal and\ntask priors are systematically introduced at the start and end of the encoding\nprocess. We evaluate MedUniSeg on a comprehensive multi-modal upstream dataset\nconsisting of 17 sub-datasets. The results demonstrate that MedUniSeg achieves\nsuperior multi-task segmentation performance, attaining a 1.2% improvement in\nthe mean Dice score across the 17 upstream tasks compared to nnUNet baselines,\nwhile using less than 1/10 of the parameters. For tasks that underperform\nduring the initial multi-task joint training, we freeze MedUniSeg and introduce\nnew modules to re-learn these tasks. This approach yields an enhanced version,\nMedUniSeg*, which consistently outperforms MedUniSeg across all tasks.\nMoreover, MedUniSeg surpasses advanced self-supervised and supervised\npre-trained models on six downstream tasks, establishing itself as a\nhigh-quality, highly generalizable pre-trained segmentation model.",

An\nimportant concern is how the scheme modifies the solution through the notions\nof numerical diffusion and dispersion. The analysis of these artifacts is well\nknown for finite volume schemes, but it becomes more complex in the DG case. In\nparticular, as far as we know, no analysis of this type has been considered for\nimplicit integration with DG space discretization. The first part of this work\nintends to fill this gap, showing that the choice of the implicit Runge-Kutta\nscheme impacts deeply on the quality of the solution. We analyze\ndispersion-diffusion properties to select the best combination of the\nspace-time discretization for high Courant numbers.\n  In the second part of this work, we apply our findings to the integration of\nstiff hyperbolic systems with DG schemes. Implicit time-integration schemes\nleverage superior stability properties enabling the selection of time-steps\nbased solely on accuracy requirements, thereby bypassing the need for minute\ntime-steps. High-order schemes require the introduction of local space limiters\nwhich make the whole implicit scheme highly nonlinear. To mitigate the\nnumerical complexity of these schemes, we propose to use appropriate space\nlimiters that can be precomputed on a first-order prediction of the solution.\nThis approach follows the methodology proposed by Puppo et al.

In\nthis study, we introduce the Artsy, inspired by the activation mechanisms of\nsilent synapses via spike-timing-dependent plasticity observed in mature\nbrains, to enhance the continual learning capabilities of pre-trained models.\nThe Artsy integrates two key components: During training, the Artsy mimics\nmature brain dynamics by maintaining memory stability for previously learned\nknowledge within the pre-trained network while simultaneously promoting\nlearning plasticity in task-specific sub-networks. During inference, artificial\nsilent and functional synapses are utilized to establish precise connections\nbetween the pre-synaptic neurons in the pre-trained network and the\npost-synaptic neurons in the sub-networks, facilitated through synaptic\nconsolidation, thereby enabling effective extraction of relevant information\nfrom test samples.

Most current methods\nrestrict their analysis to datasets that are assumed to have pure linear or\nnonlinear relations, which is often not reflective of real-world datasets that\ncontain a combination of both. This paper presents CaPS, an ordering-based\ncausal discovery algorithm that effectively handles linear and nonlinear\nrelations. CaPS introduces a novel identification criterion for topological\nordering and incorporates the concept of \"parent score\" during the\npost-processing optimization stage. These scores quantify the strength of the\naverage causal effect, helping to accelerate the pruning process and correct\ninaccurate predictions in the pruning step. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our proposed solutions outperform state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic\ndata with varying ratios of linear and nonlinear relations.

However, existing posterior\nCramer-Rao Lower Bounds (PCRLBs) rarely investigate the fundamental impact of\nT2R geometry on target measurement uncertainty and eventually on mean square\nerror (MSE) of state estimate, inevitably resulting in over-conservative lower\nbound. To address this issue, this paper firstly derives the generalized model\nof target measurement error covariance for bistatic radar with moving receiver\nand transmitter illuminating any type of signal, along with its approximated\nsolution to specify the impact of T2R geometry on error covariance. Based upon\nformulated TMU model, an improved PCRLB (IPCRLB) fully accounting for both\nmeasurement origin uncertainty and geometry-dependent TMU is then re-derived,\nboth detection probability and measurement error covariance are treated as\nstate-dependent parameters when differentiating log-likelihood with respect to\ntarget state. Compared to existing PCRLBs that partially or completely ignore\nthe dependence of target measurement uncertainty on T2R geometry, proposed\nIPCRLB provides a much accurate (less-conservative) lower bound for radar\ntracking in clutter with geometry-dependent TMU. The new bound is then applied\nto radar trajectory control to effectively optimize T2R geometry and exhibits\nleast uncertainty of acquired target measurement and more accurate state\nestimate for bistatic radar tracking in clutter, compared to state-of-the-art\ntrajectory control methods.",

This work addresses future frame prediction in chest dynamic MRI\nsequences to compensate for that delay using RNNs trained with online learning\nalgorithms. The latter enable networks to mitigate irregular movements, as they\nupdate synaptic weights with each new training example. Experiments were\nconducted using four publicly available 2D thoracic cine-MRI sequences. PCA\ndecomposes the time-varying deformation vector field (DVF), computed with the\nLucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm, into static deformation fields and\nlow-dimensional time-dependent weights. We compare various algorithms to\nforecast the latter: linear regression, least mean squares (LMS), and RNNs\ntrained with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), unbiased online recurrent\noptimization, decoupled neural interfaces and sparse 1-step approximation\n(SnAp-1). That enables estimating the future DVFs and, in turn, the next frames\nby warping the initial image. Linear regression led to the lowest mean DVF\nerror at a horizon h = 0.32s (the time interval in advance for which the\nprediction is made), equal to 1.30mm, followed by SnAp-1 and RTRL, whose error\nincreased from 1.37mm to 1.44mm as h increased from 0.62s to 2.20s. Similarly,\nthe structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of LMS decreased from 0.904 to\n0.898 as h increased from 0.31s to 1.57s and was the highest among the\nalgorithms compared for the latter horizons. SnAp-1 attained the highest SSIM\nfor h $\\geq$ 1.88s, with values of less than 0.898.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a new form of exponential quantum advantage in the\ncontext of sensing correlated noise. Specifically, we focus on the problem of\nestimating parameters associated with Lindblad dephasing dynamics, and show\nthat entanglement can lead to an exponential enhancement in the sensitivity (as\nquantified via quantum Fisher information of the sensor state) for estimating a\nsmall parameter characterizing the deviation of system Lindbladians from a\nclass of maximally correlated dephasing dynamics. This result stands in stark\ncontrast with previously studied scenarios of sensing uncorrelated dephasing\nnoise, where one can prove that entanglement does not lead to an advantage in\nthe signal-to-noise ratio. Our work thus opens a novel pathway towards\nachieving entanglement-based sensing advantage, which may find applications in\ncharacterizing decoherence dynamics of near-term quantum devices. Further, our\napproach provides a potential quantum-enhanced probe of many-body correlated\nphases by measuring noise generated by a sensing target. We also discuss\nrealization of our protocol using near-term quantum hardware.",

Since professional medical knowledge is\nrequired for annotation, exploiting a large corpus of ECGs to develop accurate\nsupervised learning-based atrial fibrillation algorithms remains challenging.\nSelf-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising recipe for generalized ECG\nrepresentation learning, eliminating the dependence on expensive labeling.\nHowever, without well-designed incorporations of knowledge related to atrial\nfibrillation, existing SSL approaches typically suffer from unsatisfactory\ncapture of robust ECG representations.

We addressed discrepancies in the size\nevolution rates of SFGs, which may be caused by variations in sample selection\nand methods for size measurements. To check these factors, we traced the\nevolution of individual galaxies by identifying their progenitors using stellar\nmass growth histories (SMGHs), integrating along the star-forming main sequence\nand from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Comparison between the structural\nparameters estimated from the mass- and light-based profiles shows that\nmass-weighted size evolves at a slower pace compared to light-based ones,\nhighlighting the need to consider the mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) gradients.\nAdditionally, we observed mass-dependent growth in stellar mass profiles:\nmassive galaxies ($\\log(M_{\\ast,0}/M_{\\odot})\\gtrsim10.8$) formed central\nregions at $z\\gtrsim1.5$ and grew faster in outer regions, suggesting\ninside-out growth, while intermediate and less massive SFGs followed a\nrelatively self-similar mass buildup since $z\\sim2$.

    "abstract": "Video recommender systems (RSs) have gained increasing attention in recent\nyears. Existing mainstream RSs focus on optimizing the matching function\nbetween users and items. However, we noticed that users frequently encounter\nplayback issues such as slow loading or stuttering while browsing the videos,\nespecially in weak network conditions, which will lead to a subpar browsing\nexperience, and may cause users to leave, even when the video content and\nrecommendations are superior. It is quite a serious issue, yet easily\noverlooked. To tackle this issue, we propose an on-device Gating and Ranking\nFramework (GRF) that cooperates with server-side RS. Specifically, we utilize a\ngate model to identify videos that may have playback issues in real-time, and\nthen we employ a ranking model to select the optimal result from a\nlocally-cached pool to replace the stuttering videos. Our solution has been\nfully deployed on Kwai, a large-scale short video platform with hundreds of\nmillions of users globally. Moreover, it significantly enhances video playback\nperformance and improves overall user experience and retention rates.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the potential of deliberation to create consensus among\nfully-informed citizens. Our approach relies on two cognitive assumptions: i.\ncitizens need a thinking frame (or perspective) to consider an issue; and ii.\ncitizens cannot consider all relevant perspectives simultaneously: they are\nincompatible in the mind. These assumptions imply that opinions are\nintrinsically contextual. Formally, we capture contextuality in a simple\nquantum-like cognitive model. We consider a binary voting problem, in which two\ncitizens with incompatible thinking frames and initially opposite voting\nintentions deliberate under the guidance of a benevolent facilitator. We find\nthat when citizens consider alternative perspectives, their opinion may change.\nWhen the citizens' perspectives are two-dimensional and maximally uncorrelated,\nthe probability for consensus after two rounds of deliberation reaches 75%; and\nthis probability increases proportionally with the dimensionality (namely, the\nrichness) of the perspectives. When dealing with a population of citizens, we\nalso elaborate a novel rationale for working in subgroups. The contextuality\napproach delivers a number of insights. First, the diversity of perspectives is\nbeneficial and even necessary for deliberations to overcome initial\ndisagreement. Second, successful deliberation demand the active participation\nof citizens in terms of \"putting themselves in the other's shoes\". Third,\nwell-designed procedures managed by a facilitator are necessary to secure\nincreased probability for consensus. A last insight is that the richness of\ncitizens' thinking frames is beneficial, while the optimal strategy entails\nfocusing deliberation on a properly reduced problem.",

To address this\nissue, we propose a novel approach which combines image decomposition and\nspectral energy distribution (SED) decomposition to constrain properties of AGN\nhost galaxies. Image decomposition allows us to disentangle optical flux into\nAGN and stellar components, thereby providing additional constraints on the SED\nmodels to derive more refined stellar mass. To test the viability of this\napproach, we obtained a sample of 24 X-ray selected type-I AGNs with redshifts\nranging from 0.73 to 2.47. We estimated the stellar masses for our sample and\nfound that our results are generally consistent with earlier estimates based on\ndifferent methods.

With the derived stellar\nmasses, we further studied the MBH-M* relation of our sample, finding a higher\nintrinsic scatter in the correlation for our entire sample compared to the\nlocal quiescent correlation, which could be caused by a few black hole monsters\nin our sample.

Further potential for error arises if researchers wish to\nmake comparisons between the energetic content of nectars containing different\nratios of sucrose, fructose and glucose.

Increasing costs may lead to fewer independently\noperated nodes in the network, which poses risks to decentralization (and hence\nnetwork security), but also pushes decentralized app developers towards\ncentrally hosted API services.\n  This paper introduces a new protocol that allows validator nodes to\nparticipate in a blockchain network without the need to store the full state of\nthe network on each node. The key idea is to use the blockchain network as both\na replicated state machine and as a distributed storage system. By distributing\nstates across nodes and enabling efficient data retrieval through a\nKademlia-inspired routing protocol, we reduce storage costs for validators.\nCryptographic proofs (such as Merkle proofs) are used to allow nodes to verify\ndata stored by other nodes without having to trust those nodes directly. While\nthe protocol trades off data storage for increased network bandwidth, we show\nhow gossiping and caching can minimize the increased bandwidth needs.\n  To validate our state sharing protocol, we conduct an extensive quantitative\nanalysis of Ethereum's data storage and data access patterns. Our findings\nindicate that while our protocol significantly lowers storage needs, it comes\nwith an increased bandwidth usage ranging from 1.5 MB to 5 MB per block,\ntranslating to an additional monthly bandwidth of 319 GB to 1,065 GB. Despite\nthis, the size remains small enough such that it can be passed to all nodes and\nvalidated within Ethereum's 12-second block validation window. Further analysis\nshows that Merkle proofs are the most significant contributor to the additional\nbandwidth. To address this concern, we also analyze the impact of switching to\nthe more space-efficient Verkle Proofs.",

    "abstract": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) exhibit remarkable multi-tasking ability by\nlearning mixed instruction datasets. However, novel tasks would be encountered\nsequentially in dynamic world, which urges for equipping LMMs with multimodal\ncontinual instruction learning (MCIT) ability especially for diverse and\nchallenging generative tasks. Existing MCIT methods do not fully exploit the\nunique attribute of LMMs and often gain performance at the expense of\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework for\nMCIT to effectively alleviate forgetting of previous knowledge while managing\ncomputational complexity with natural image-text supervision. Concretely, we\nlearn prompts for each task and exploit efficient prompt fusion for knowledge\ntransfer and prompt selection for complexity management with dual-modality\nguidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nsubstantial +14.26% performance gain on MCIT benchmarks with remarkable\n$\\times$ 1.42 inference speed free from growing computation.

    "abstract": "Privacy is a major concern when computing-as-a-service (CaaS) platforms,\ne.g., cloud-computing platforms, are utilized for building automation, as CaaS\nplatforms can infer sensitive information, such as occupancy, using the sensor\nmeasurements of a building. Although the existing encrypted model-based control\nalgorithms can ensure the security and privacy of sensor measurements, they are\nhighly complex to implement and require high computational resources, which\nresult in a high cost of using CaaS platforms. To address these issues, in this\npaper, we propose an encrypted fully model-free event-triggered cloud-based\nHVAC control framework that ensures the privacy of occupancy information and\nminimizes the communication and computation overhead associated with encrypted\nHVAC control. To this end, we first develop a model-free controller for\nregulating indoor temperature and CO2 levels. We then design a model-free\nevent-triggering unit which reduces the communication and computation costs of\nencrypted HVAC control using an optimal triggering policy. Finally, we evaluate\nthe performance of the proposed encrypted fully model-free event-triggered\ncloud-based HVAC control framework using the TRNSYS simulator, comparing it to\nan encrypted model-based event-triggered control framework, which uses model\npredictive control to regulate the indoor climate. Our numerical results\ndemonstrate that, compared to the encrypted model-based method, the proposed\nfully model-free framework improves the control performance while reducing the\ncommunication and computation costs. More specifically, it reduces the\ncommunication between the system and the CaaS platform by 64% amount, and its\ncomputation time is 75% less than that of the model-based control.",

While techniques like $\\mu$P (Yang et al., 2022)\nprovide scaling rules for optimal $\\eta$ transfer in the infinite model size\nlimit, the optimal scaling behavior in the infinite data size limit remains\nunknown. We fill in this gap by observing for the first time an intricate\ndependence of optimal $\\eta$ scaling on the pretraining token budget $T$, $B$\nand its relation to the critical batch size $B_\\mathrm{crit}$, which we measure\nto evolve as $B_\\mathrm{crit} \\propto T$.

Complementing\noptimality, we examine the sensitivity of loss to changes in learning rate,\nwhere we find the sensitivity to decrease with increase of $T$ and to remain\nconstant with $\\mu$P model scaling.

Such an estimate is biased and complicates the use of the\nLangevin method. Here, we propose a noise-corrected version of the Langevin\nalgorithm, where the bias due to noisy data is removed, at least regarding\nfirst-order terms.

In this work, we propose a new approach\nfor the creation of multidomain connected geometries that are designed to work\nwith automatic differentiation. We introduce the concept of differentiable\nConnected Geometries (dCG), discussing its theoretical aspects and illustrating\nits application through a simple toy examples and a more sophisticated photonic\noptimization task. Since these geometries are built upon the principles of\nautomatic differentiation, they are compatible with existing deep learning\nframeworks, a feature we demonstrate via the application examples.

Nevertheless, a recent body of numerical and experimental evidence\nhas shown that inhomogeneities in the ambient density distribution lead to much\nfaster flows than arise in classical Rayleigh streaming. The emergence of these\nunusually strong flows creates new opportunities to enhance heat transfer in\nsystems in which convective cooling cannot otherwise be easily achieved. To\nassess this possibility, a theoretical study of acoustic streaming in an ideal\ngas confined in a rectangular channel with top and bottom walls maintained at\nfixed but differing temperatures is performed. A two time scale system of\nequations is utilized to efficiently capture the coupling between the fast\nacoustic waves and the slowly evolving streaming flow, enabling strongly\nnonlinear regimes to be accessed. A large suite of numerical simulations is\ncarried out to probe the streaming dynamics, to highlight the critical role\nplayed by baroclinically generated wave vorticity and to quantify the\nadditional heat flux induced by the standing acoustic wave. Proper treatment of\nthe two-way coupling between the waves and mean flow is found to be essential\nfor convergence to a self-consistent steady state, and the variation of the\nresulting acoustically enhanced steady-state heat flux with both the amplitude\nof the acoustic wave and the O(1) aspect ratio of the channel is documented.\nFor certain parameters, heat fluxes almost two orders of magnitude larger than\nthose realizable by conduction alone can be attained.",

In this review we address the collective behavior of\nsystems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which\ncan be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at\ncriticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines\nthe phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase\ntransitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature\nHiggs phases. However, additional crucial features determine the universal\nproperties of the critical behavior at continuous transitions. Specifically,\ntheir nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality.\nEffective (Abelian or non-Abelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge when gauge\nmodes develop critical correlations. On the other hand, a more standard\ncritical behavior, which admits an effective description in terms of\nLandau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\\Phi^4$ theories, occurs when gauge-field modes are\nshort ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent\nnon-gauge invariant correlation functions from becoming critical.

However, many LLM-based dialog\nsystems fall short in planning towards an overarching dialog goal and therefore\ncannot steer the conversation appropriately. Furthermore, these models struggle\nwith hallucination, making them unsuitable for information access in sensitive\ndomains, such as legal or medical domains, where correctness of information\ngiven to users is critical. The recently introduced task Conversational Tree\nSearch (CTS) proposes the use of dialog graphs to avoid hallucination in\nsensitive domains, however, state-of-the-art agents are Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) based and require long training times, despite excelling at dialog\nstrategy.

The method\nuses analytical solutions of the HDM phase space perturbations in various\nlimits and constructs from them a modification factor to the gravitational\npotential that tricks the cold particles into trajectories as if HDM particles\nwere present in the simulation box. The modification factor is algebraic in the\ncosmological parameters and requires no fitting. Implementing the method in a\nParticle-Mesh simulation code and testing it on HDM cosmologies up to the\nequivalent effect of $\\sum m_\\nu = 0.315$ eV-mass neutrinos, we find that the\ngeneralised SuperEasy approach is able to predict the total matter and cold\nmatter power spectra to $\\lesssim 0.1\\%$ relative to other linear response\nmethods and to $\\lesssim 0.25\\%$ relative to particle HDM simulations. Applying\nthe method to cosmologies with mixed neutrinos\\Plus{}thermal QCD axions and\nneutrinos\\Plus{}generic thermal bosons, we find that non-standard HDM\ncosmologies have no intrinsically different non-linear signature in the total\nmatter power spectrum from standard neutrino cosmologies.

    "abstract": "Soft robots - due to their intrinsic flexibility of the body - can adaptively\nnavigate unstructured environments. One of the most popular locomotion gaits\nthat has been implemented in soft robots is undulation. The undulation motion\nin soft robots resembles the locomotion gait of stringy creatures such as\nsnakes, eels, and C. Elegans. Typically, the implementation of undulation\nlocomotion on a soft robot requires many actuators to control each segment of\nthe stringy body. The added weight of multiple actuators limits the navigating\nperformance of soft-bodied robots. In this paper, we propose a simple\ntendon-driven flexible beam with only one actuator (a DC motor) that can\ngenerate a mechanical traveling wave along the beam to support the undulation\nlocomotion of soft robots. The beam will be precompressed along its axis by\nshortening the length of the two tendons to form an S-shape, thus pretensioning\nthe tendons. The motor will wind and unwind the tendons to deform the flexible\nbeam and generate traveling waves along the body of the robot. We experiment\nwith different pre-tension to characterize the relationship between tendon\npre-tension forces and the DC-motor winding/unwinding. Our proposal enables a\nsimple implementation of undulation motion to support the locomotion of\nsoft-bodied robots.",

A zero-shot blur\nkernel estimation mechanism and an auto-scale denoise guidance strategy are\nintroduced to adapt the unconditional DDPM to any blurriness modes varying from\ndatasets and lead times in precipitation nowcasting. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on 7 precipitation radar datasets, demonstrating the generality and\nsuperiority of our method.",

    "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems offer significant\npotential to enhance wireless communication performance, yet accurate and\ntimely channel state information (CSI) acquisition remains a key challenge.\nExisting works on CSI estimation and radio map applications typically rely on\nstationary CSI statistics and accurate location labels. However, the CSI\nprocess can be discontinuous due to user mobility and environmental variations,\nand inaccurate location data can degrade the performance. By contrast, this\npaper studies radio-map-embedded CSI tracking and radio map construction\nwithout the assumptions of stationary CSI statistics and precise location\nlabels. Using radio maps as the prior information, this paper develops a\nradio-map-embedded switching Kalman filter (SKF) framework that jointly tracks\nthe location and the CSI with adaptive beamforming for sparse CSI observations\nunder reduced pilots. For radio map construction without precise location\nlabels, the location sequence and the channel covariance matrices are jointly\nestimated based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An unbiased estimator on the\nchannel covariance matrix is found. Numerical results on ray-traced MIMO\nchannel datasets demonstrate that using 1 pilot in every 10 milliseconds, an\naverage of over 97% of capacity over that of perfect CSI can be achieved, while\na conventional Kalman filter (KF) can only achieve 76%. Furthermore, the\nproposed radio-map-embedded CSI model can reduce the localization error from 30\nmeters from the prior to 6 meters for radio map construction.",

    "abstract": "During the pretraining phase, large language models (LLMs) acquire vast\namounts of knowledge from extensive text corpora. Nevertheless, in later stages\nsuch as fine-tuning and inference, the model may encounter knowledge not\ncovered in the initial training, which can lead to hallucinations and degraded\nperformance. This issue has a profound impact on the model's capabilities, as\nit will inevitably face out-of-scope knowledge after pretraining. Furthermore,\nfine-tuning is often required to adapt LLMs to domain-specific tasks. However,\nthis phenomenon limits the model's ability to learn and integrate new\ninformation during fine-tuning. The effectiveness of fine-tuning largely\ndepends on the type of knowledge involved. Existing research suggests that\nfine-tuning the model on partially mastered knowledge-for instance,\nquestion-answer pairs where the model has a chance of providing correct\nresponses under non-greedy decoding-can enable the model to acquire new\nknowledge while mitigating hallucination. Notably, this approach can still lead\nto the forgetting of fully mastered knowledge, constraining the fine-tuning\ndataset to a narrower range and limiting the model's overall potential for\nimprovement. Given the model's intrinsic reasoning abilities and the\ninterconnectedness of different knowledge areas, it is likely that as the\nmodel's capacity to utilize existing knowledge improves during fine-tuning,\npreviously unmastered knowledge may become more understandable. To explore this\nhypothesis, we conducted experiments and, based on the results, proposed a\ntwo-stage fine-tuning strategy. This approach not only improves the model's\noverall test accuracy and knowledge retention but also preserves its accuracy\non previously mastered content. When fine-tuning on the WikiQA dataset, our\nmethod increases the amount of knowledge acquired by the model in this stage by\n24%.",

To\nrelax that assumption, we present the concept of Data-driven Connectivity\nBarrier Certificates, which utilize Control Barrier Functions (CBF) and\nGaussian Processes (GP) to characterize the admissible control space for\npairwise robots based on communication performance observed online. This allows\nrobots to maintain a satisfying level of pairwise communication quality\n(measured by the received signal strength) while in motion.

To capture natural performances, we designed a\nmarkerless setup in which motions are reconstructed from multi-view videos\nusing state-of-the-art pose estimation models. The motion data is further\nrefined via inverse kinematics using the high-resolution MIDI key-pressing data\nobtained from sensors in a specialized Yamaha Disklavier piano. Leveraging the\ncollected dataset, we developed a pipeline that can synthesize\nphysically-plausible hand motions for musical scores outside of the dataset.\nOur approach employs a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement\nlearning to obtain policies for physics-based bimanual control involving the\ninteraction between hands and piano keys. To solve the sampling efficiency\nproblem with the large motion dataset, we use a diffusion model to generate\nnatural reference motions, which provide high-level trajectory and fingering\n(finger order and placement) information. However, the generated reference\nmotion alone does not provide sufficient accuracy for piano performance\nmodeling. We then further augmented the data by using musical similarity to\nretrieve similar motions from the captured dataset to boost the precision of\nthe RL policy.

    "abstract": "Grasping a variety of objects remains a key challenge in the development of\nversatile robotic systems. The human hand is remarkably dexterous, capable of\ngrasping and manipulating objects with diverse shapes, mechanical properties,\nand textures. Inspired by how humans use two fingers to pick up thin and large\nobjects such as fabric or sheets of paper, we aim to develop a gripper\noptimized for grasping such deformable objects. Observing how the soft and\nflexible fingertip joints of the hand approach and grasp thin materials, a\nhybrid gripper design that incorporates both soft and rigid components was\nproposed. The gripper utilizes a soft pneumatic ring wrapped around a rigid\nrevolute joint to create a flexible two-fingered gripper. Experiments were\nconducted to characterize and evaluate the gripper performance in handling\nsheets of paper and other objects. Compared to rigid grippers, the proposed\ndesign improves grasping efficiency and reduces the gripping distance by up to\neightfold.",

EF-GBTSVM employs the coarse granularity of\ngranular balls (GBs) as input rather than individual data samples. The GBs are\nmapped to the feature space of the hidden layer using random projection\nfollowed by the utilization of a non-linear activation function. The\nconcatenation of original and hidden features derived from the centers of GBs\ngives rise to an enhanced feature space, commonly referred to as the random\nvector functional link (RVFL) space. This space encapsulates nuanced feature\ninformation to GBs. Further, we employ twin support vector machine (TSVM) in\nthe RVFL space for classification. TSVM generates the two non-parallel\nhyperplanes in the enhanced feature space, which improves the generalization\nperformance of the proposed EF-GBTSVM model. Moreover, the coarser granularity\nof the GBs enables the proposed EF-GBTSVM model to exhibit robustness to\nresampling, showcasing reduced susceptibility to the impact of noise and\noutliers. We undertake a thorough evaluation of the proposed EF-GBTSVM model on\nbenchmark UCI and KEEL datasets. This evaluation encompasses scenarios with and\nwithout the inclusion of label noise.

To tackle this issue, we consider a framework where a\nhuman labeler can provide additional feedback in the form of corrective\nactions, which expresses the labeler's action preferences although this\nfeedback may possibly be imperfect as well. In this setting, to obtain a\nbetter-aligned policy guided by both learning signals, we propose a novel\nvalue-based deep RL algorithm called Iterative learning from Corrective actions\nand Proxy rewards (ICoPro), which cycles through three phases: (1) Solicit\nsparse corrective actions from a human labeler on the agent's demonstrated\ntrajectories; (2) Incorporate these corrective actions into the Q-function\nusing a margin loss to enforce adherence to labeler's preferences; (3) Train\nthe agent with standard RL losses regularized with a margin loss to learn from\nproxy rewards and propagate the Q-values learned from human feedback. Moreover,\nanother novel design in our approach is to integrate pseudo-labels from the\ntarget Q-network to reduce human labor and further stabilize training. We\nexperimentally validate our proposition on a variety of tasks (Atari games and\nautonomous driving on highway). On the one hand, using proxy rewards with\ndifferent levels of imperfection, our method can better align with human\npreferences and is more sample-efficient than baseline methods. On the other\nhand, facing corrective actions with different types of imperfection, our\nmethod can overcome the non-optimality of this feedback thanks to the guidance\nfrom proxy reward.",

In this paper we\npropose two ways to enhance the efficiency of quanvolutional models. First, we\npropose a flexible data quantization approach with memoization, applicable to\nany encoding method.

In this letter,\nwe apply the PCS model to a prosthesis deformation, which can calculate\nflexible deformation with low computational cost and handle kinematics and\ndynamics. In addition, we propose an inverse kinematics calculation method that\nis consistent with the material properties of the prosthesis by considering the\nminimization of elastic energy. Furthermore, we propose a method to estimate\nthe viscoelasticity by solving a quadratic programming based on the measured\nmotion capture data. The calculated strains are more reasonable than the\nresults obtained by conventional inverse kinematics calculation. From the\nresult of the viscoelasticity estimation, we simulate the prosthetic motion by\nforward dynamics calculation and confirm that this result corresponds to the\nmeasured motion. These results indicate that our approach adequately models the\ndynamic phenomena, including the viscoelasticity of the prosthesis.",

    "abstract": "Our world is full of varied actions and moves across specialized domains that\nwe, as humans, strive to identify and understand. Within any single domain,\nactions can often appear quite similar, making it challenging for deep models\nto distinguish them accurately. To evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal\nfoundation models in helping us recognize such actions, we present ActionAtlas\nv1.0, a multiple-choice video question answering benchmark featuring short\nvideos across various sports. Each video in the dataset is paired with a\nquestion and four or five choices. The question pinpoints specific individuals,\nasking which choice \"best\" describes their action within a certain temporal\ncontext. Overall, the dataset includes 934 videos showcasing 580 unique actions\nacross 56 sports, with a total of 1896 actions within choices. Unlike most\nexisting video question answering benchmarks that only cover simplistic\nactions, often identifiable from a single frame, ActionAtlas focuses on\nintricate movements and rigorously tests the model's capability to discern\nsubtle differences between moves that look similar within each domain. We\nevaluate open and proprietary foundation models on this benchmark, finding that\nthe best model, GPT-4o, achieves a maximum accuracy of 45.52%. Meanwhile,\nNon-expert crowd workers, provided with action description for each choice,\nachieve 61.64% accuracy, where random chance is approximately 21%. Our findings\nwith state-of-the-art models indicate that having a high frame sampling rate is\nimportant for accurately recognizing actions in ActionAtlas, a feature that\nsome leading proprietary video models, such as Gemini, do not include in their\ndefault configuration.",

    "abstract": "With the improvement in the quantity and quality of remote sensing images,\ncontent-based remote sensing object retrieval (CBRSOR) has become an\nincreasingly important topic. However, existing CBRSOR methods neglect the\nutilization of global statistical information during both training and test\nstages, which leads to the overfitting of neural networks to simple sample\npairs of samples during training and suboptimal metric performance. Inspired by\nthe Neyman-Pearson theorem, we propose a generalized likelihood ratio\ntest-based metric learning (GLRTML) approach, which can estimate the relative\ndifficulty of sample pairs by incorporating global data distribution\ninformation during training and test phases. This guides the network to focus\nmore on difficult samples during the training process, thereby encourages the\nnetwork to learn more discriminative feature embeddings. In addition, GLRT is a\nmore effective than traditional metric space due to the utilization of global\ndata distribution information. Accurately estimating the distribution of\nembeddings is critical for GLRTML. However, in real-world applications, there\nis often a distribution shift between the training and target domains, which\ndiminishes the effectiveness of directly using the distribution estimated on\ntraining data. To address this issue, we propose the clustering\npseudo-labels-based fast parameter adaptation (CPLFPA) method. CPLFPA\nefficiently estimates the distribution of embeddings in the target domain by\nclustering target domain instances and re-estimating the distribution\nparameters for GLRTML. We reorganize datasets for CBRSOR tasks based on\nfine-grained ship remote sensing image slices (FGSRSI-23) and military aircraft\nrecognition (MAR20) datasets. Extensive experiments on these datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed GLRTML and CPLFPA.",

Close-Range Photogrammetry (CRP) is\ncommonly used for reconstructing forest scenes but faces challenges like low\nefficiency and poor quality. Recently, Novel View Synthesis (NVS) technologies,\nincluding Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have\nshown promise for 3D plant reconstruction with limited images. However,\nexisting research mainly focuses on small plants in orchards or individual\ntrees, leaving uncertainty regarding their application in larger, complex\nforest stands. In this study, we collected sequential images of forest plots\nwith varying complexity and performed dense reconstruction using NeRF and 3DGS.\nThe resulting point clouds were compared with those from photogrammetry and\nlaser scanning. Results indicate that NVS methods significantly enhance\nreconstruction efficiency. Photogrammetry struggles with complex stands,\nleading to point clouds with excessive canopy noise and incorrectly\nreconstructed trees, such as duplicated trunks. NeRF, while better for canopy\nregions, may produce errors in ground areas with limited views. The 3DGS method\ngenerates sparser point clouds, particularly in trunk areas, affecting diameter\nat breast height (DBH) accuracy. All three methods can extract tree height\ninformation, with NeRF yielding the highest accuracy; however, photogrammetry\nremains superior for DBH accuracy.

While a\nsegment of current research leans heavily on large-scale pretrained\nvisual-language models and often overlooks temporal dynamics, another delves\ndeep into spatial-temporal relationships within videos but demands intricate\nobject trajectory pre-extractions and sidelines dialog temporal dynamics. This\npaper introduces the Dual Temporal Grounding-enhanced Video Dialog model\n(DTGVD), strategically designed to merge the strengths of both dominant\napproaches. It emphasizes dual temporal relationships by predicting dialog\nturn-specific temporal regions, filtering video content accordingly, and\ngrounding responses in both video and dialog contexts. One standout feature of\nDTGVD is its heightened attention to chronological interplay. By recognizing\nand acting upon the dependencies between different dialog turns, it captures\nmore nuanced conversational dynamics. To further bolster the alignment between\nvideo and dialog temporal dynamics, we've implemented a list-wise contrastive\nlearning strategy. Within this framework, accurately grounded turn-clip\npairings are designated as positive samples, while less precise pairings are\ncategorized as negative.

The age differences between thin and thick disks are small (about\n2~Gyr), however, and the thick disks are younger than previously observed in\nmore massive and more quiescent galaxies. The thin and thick disks both show\nmostly sub-solar metallicities, and the vertical metallicity gradient is milder\nthan previously observed in similar studies. The [Mg/Fe] differences between\nthick and thin disks are not sharp. The star formation histories of thick disks\nextend to recent times, although most of the mass in young stars was formed in\nthin disks. Our findings show thick disks that are different from the old\nquiescent thick disks that were previously observed in galaxies with different\nmorphologies and/or masses. We propose that the thick disks in these galaxies\ndid not form quickly at high redshift, but formed slowly over an extended time.\nThe thin disks also formed slowly, but a larger mass fraction was created at\nvery recent times.",

A 3-dimensional disordered system was constructed from spherical\nballs of varying radii that were chosen randomly from a log-normal\ndistribution. The growth of micro-cracks with increasing compressive strain was\nmonitored till the limit of the percolation crack. The two parameters varied\nwere the bond stiffness constant and the bond strength of the material. Two\ndistinct regimes of cracking rates were observed across a critical strain\n$\\epsilon_{knee}$ that manifested as a knee in the cumulative crack-strain\nplot. The critical strain $\\epsilon_{knee}$ and the strain at the percolation\npoint $\\epsilon_{perc}$ showed a power law dependence on the elastic property\nof the bond material. Individual micro-cracks were observed to grow sharply to\na maximum value $N^{k_{b}}_{max}$, after which the number of new micro-cracks\ndecreased, showing a long tail. The maximum $N^{k_{b}}_{max}$ was found to\ncorrespond to the strain $\\epsilon_{knee}$, thus indicating that\npre-$N^{k_{b}}_{max}$ cracking brittle, followed by ductile cracking behaviour\nof system.

However, this specialization leads to a fragmented\necosystem where models lack the adaptability for broader applications. To\novercome this, we introduce AutoFusion, an innovative framework that fuses\ndistinct model parameters(with the same architecture) for multi-task learning\nwithout pre-trained checkpoints. Using an unsupervised, end-to-end approach,\nAutoFusion dynamically permutes model parameters at each layer, optimizing the\ncombination through a loss-minimization process that does not require labeled\ndata. We validate AutoFusion's effectiveness through experiments on commonly\nused benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance over established\nmethods like Weight Interpolation, Git Re-Basin, and ZipIt. Our framework\noffers a scalable and flexible solution for model integration, positioning it\nas a powerful tool for future research and practical applications.",

However, the difficulty in eliminating global low-frequency errors\nsignificantly limits their convergence speed. In recent years, neural networks\nhave emerged as a novel approach for solving PDEs, with studies revealing that\nthey exhibit faster convergence for low-frequency components. Building on this\ncomplementary frequency convergence characteristics of iterative methods and\nneural networks, we draw inspiration from multigrid methods and propose a\nhybrid solving framework that combining iterative methods and neural\nnetwork-based solvers, termed PINN-MG (PMG). In this framework, the iterative\nmethod is responsible for eliminating local high-frequency oscillation errors,\nwhile Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are employed to correct global\nlow-frequency errors. Throughout the solving process, high- and low-frequency\ncomponents alternately dominate the error, with each being addressed by the\niterative method and PINNs respectively, thereby accelerating the convergence.\nWe tested the proposed PMG framework on the linear Poisson equation and the\nnonlinear Helmholtz equation, and the results demonstrated significant\nacceleration of the PMG when built on Gauss-Seidel, pseudo-time, and GMRES\nmethods. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the convergence process further\nvalidates the rationality of the framework.

    "abstract": "Atmospheric compositions preserve the history of planet formation processes.\nJupiter has the remarkable feature of being uniformly enriched in various\nelements compared to the Sun, including highly volatile elements such as\nnitrogen and noble gases. Radial transport of volatile species by amorphous ice\nin the solar nebula is one mechanism that explains Jupiter's volatile\nenrichment, but the low entrapment efficiency of nitrogen into amorphous ice is\nan issue. We propose an alternative mechanism of delivering nitrogen to\nJupiter: radial transport of semi-volatile ammonium salts in the solar nebula.\nAmmonium salts have been identified in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and can\npotentially compensate for the comet's nitrogen depletion compared to the Sun.\nWe simulate the radial transport and dissociation of ammonium salts carried by\ndust in a protoplanetary disk, followed by the accretion of the gas and NH$_3$\nvapor by a protoplanet, as well as the delivery of nitrogen to the planetary\natmosphere from the salt-containing planetary core that undergoes dilution. We\nfind that when the dust contains 10-30 wt% ammonium salts, the production of\nNH$_3$ vapor in the inner disk (~ 3 au) by dissociated salts and the\nincorporation of the salt-derived NH$_3$ through core formation and subsequent\ngas accretion by the protoplanet result in a planetary nitrogen enrichment\nconsistent with the observations of Jupiter. Ammonium salts may thus play a\nvital role in developing the atmospheric composition of planets forming in the\ninner disk. Combining our model with future observations of the bulk\ncompositions and isotopes of comets and other primordial bodies will help to\nfurther elucidate the elemental transport to the gas giants and ice giants in\nthe solar system.",

However, Southern European economies exhibit a notable divergence\nfrom these cycles in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Building on this\nevidence, we demonstrate that monetary policy is homogeneously propagated to\nmember countries via the common cycles. In contrast, country-specific\ntransmission channels lead to heterogeneous country responses to monetary\npolicy shocks.

Conventional vehicle controllers\nstruggle to manage this scenario, necessitating the use of a drifting\ncontroller. However, the large sideslip angle in drift conditions introduces\nmodel mismatch, which in turn affects control precision. To address this issue,\nwe propose a model correction drift controller that integrates Model Predictive\nControl (MPC) with Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). GPR is employed to\ncorrect vehicle model mismatches during both drift equilibrium solving and the\nMPC optimization process. Additionally, the variance from GPR is utilized to\nactively explore different cornering drifting velocities, aiming to minimize\ntrajectory tracking errors. The proposed algorithm is validated through\nsimulations on the Simulink-Carsim platform and experiments with a 1:10 scale\nRC vehicle. In the simulation, the average lateral error with GPR is reduced by\n52.8% compared to the non-GPR case. Incorporating exploration further decreases\nthis error by 27.1%. The velocity tracking Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) also\ndecreases by 10.6% with exploration. In the RC car experiment, the average\nlateral error with GPR is 36.7% lower, and exploration further leads to a 29.0%\nreduction. Moreover, the velocity tracking RMSE decreases by 7.2% with the\ninclusion of exploration.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose an end-to-end Thrust Microstepping and Decoupled\nControl (TMDC) of quadrotors. TMDC focuses on precise off-centered aerial\ngrasping of payloads dynamically, which are attached rigidly to the UAV body\nvia a gripper contrary to the swinging payload. The dynamic payload grasping\nquickly changes UAV's mass, inertia etc, causing instability while performing a\ngrasping operation in-air. We identify that to handle unknown payload grasping,\nthe role of thrust controller is crucial. Hence, we focus on thrust control\nwithout involving system parameters such as mass etc. TMDC is based on our\nnovel Thrust Microstepping via Acceleration Feedback (TMAF) thrust controller\nand Decoupled Motion Control (DMC). TMAF precisely estimates the desired thrust\neven at smaller loop rates while DMC decouples the horizontal and vertical\nmotion to counteract disturbances in the case of dynamic payloads. We prove the\ncontroller's efficacy via exhaustive experiments in practically interesting and\nadverse real-world cases, such as fully onboard state estimation without any\npositioning sensor, narrow and indoor flying workspaces with intense wind\nturbulence, heavy payloads, non-uniform loop rates, etc. Our TMDC outperforms\nrecent direct acceleration feedback thrust controller (DA) and geometric\ntracking control (GT) in flying stably for aerial grasping and achieves RMSE\nbelow 0.04m in contrast to 0.15m of DA and 0.16m of GT.",

    "abstract": "Panoramic images provide comprehensive scene information and are suitable for\nVR applications. Obtaining corresponding depth maps is essential for achieving\nimmersive and interactive experiences. However, panoramic depth estimation\npresents significant challenges due to the severe distortion caused by\nequirectangular projection (ERP) and the limited availability of panoramic\nRGB-D datasets. Inspired by the recent success of neural rendering, we propose\na novel method, named $\\mathbf{CUBE360}$, that learns a cubic field composed of\nmultiple MPIs from a single panoramic image for $\\mathbf{continuous}$ depth\nestimation at any view direction. Our CUBE360 employs cubemap projection to\ntransform an ERP image into six faces and extract the MPIs for each, thereby\nreducing the memory consumption required for MPI processing of high-resolution\ndata. Additionally, this approach avoids the computational complexity of\nhandling the uneven pixel distribution inherent to equirectangular projectio.\nAn attention-based blending module is then employed to learn correlations among\nthe MPIs of cubic faces, constructing a cubic field representation with color\nand density information at various depth levels. Furthermore, a novel sampling\nstrategy is introduced for rendering novel views from the cubic field at both\ncubic and planar scales. The entire pipeline is trained using photometric loss\ncalculated from rendered views within a self-supervised learning approach,\nenabling training on 360 videos without depth annotations. Experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of\nCUBE360 compared to prior SSL methods. We also highlight its effectiveness in\ndownstream applications, such as VR roaming and visual effects, underscoring\nCUBE360's potential to enhance immersive experiences.",

    "abstract": "The piecewise-stationary bandit problem is an important variant of the\nmulti-armed bandit problem that further considers abrupt changes in the reward\ndistributions. The main theme of the problem is the trade-off between\nexploration for detecting environment changes and exploitation of traditional\nbandit algorithms. While this problem has been extensively investigated,\nexisting works either assume knowledge about the number of change points $M$ or\nrequire extremely high computational complexity. In this work, we revisit the\npiecewise-stationary bandit problem from a minimalist perspective. We propose a\nnovel and generic exploration mechanism, called diminishing exploration, which\neliminates the need for knowledge about $M$ and can be used in conjunction with\nan existing change detection-based algorithm to achieve near-optimal regret\nscaling. Simulation results show that despite oblivious of $M$, equipping\nexisting algorithms with the proposed diminishing exploration generally\nachieves better empirical regret than the traditional uniform exploration.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) faces two primary challenges: the risk of privacy\nleakage due to parameter sharing and communication inefficiencies. To address\nthese challenges, we propose DPSFL, a federated learning method that utilizes\ndifferentially private sketches. DPSFL compresses the local gradients of each\nclient using a count sketch, thereby improving communication efficiency, while\nadding noise to the sketches to ensure differential privacy (DP). We provide a\ntheoretical analysis of privacy and convergence for the proposed method.\nGradient clipping is essential in DP learning to limit sensitivity and\nconstrain the addition of noise. However, clipping introduces bias into the\ngradients, negatively impacting FL performance. To mitigate the impact of\nclipping, we propose an enhanced method, DPSFL-AC, which employs an adaptive\nclipping strategy. Experimental comparisons with existing techniques\ndemonstrate the superiority of our methods concerning privacy preservation,\ncommunication efficiency, and model accuracy.",

In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of neutrino\nflavor states within the framework of three-flavor neutrino oscillation using\ntwo major entanglement measures: entanglement of formation (EOF) and\nconcurrence, utilizing the DUNE experimental setup. Our findings indicate that\nthe maximally entangled state appears between $\\nu_{\\mu}$ and $\\nu_{\\tau}$\nwhereas, $\\nu_{e}$ behaves as a nearly separable state. To further explore the\nnature of bipartite entanglement, we introduce the concept of the monogamy of\nentanglement, which allows us to investigate the distinction between genuine\nthree-flavor entanglement and bipartite entanglement. Our analysis confirms\nthat the three-flavor neutrino system forms a bipartite entanglement structure,\nadhering to the Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequality. Additionally, we\nimplement a minimization procedure to find the best-fit values of the\noscillation parameters that correspond to the concurrence minima at the two\nspecific energy points where the concurrence reaches its lowest values. Using\nthese best-fit values, we probe three fundamental unknowns in neutrino\noscillation: CP violation sensitivity, neutrino mass hierarchy, and the octant\nissue of $\\theta_{23}$, across two distinct energy points. Our results manifest\nthat while the best-fit values obtained through concurrence minimization show\nslightly reduced sensitivity to CP violation compared to current best-fit\nvalues, they exhibit greater sensitivity to the mass hierarchy.

In OFDM, high peak-power levels\noccur when the subcarriers align in phase and constructively interfere with\neach other. The research proposes a peak-power-assisted channel estimation\nscheme that accurately selects peak-power carriers at the transmitter of an\nOFDM system and uses them as reliable carriers for the DACE scheme. By\nincorporating these reliable carriers with known pilot symbols as additional\npilot signals, channel estimation accuracy significantly improves in MIMO-OFDM\nsystems. This eliminates the need to determine reliable data symbols at the\nreceiver, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity of the\nsystem. However, high peak-powers are considered a major drawback in OFDM. In\nthis work, we incorporate a companding technique to mitigate this issue and\nprovide sufficient margin for the DACE scheme. The performance of the proposed\nDACE scheme is evaluated using both least square (LS) and linear minimum mean\nsquare error (LMMSE) channel estimators. In this regard, the proposed technique\nnot only improves channel estimation accuracy but also enhances the spectral\nefficiency of the wireless system. It outperforms traditional channel\nestimators in terms of system mean square error (MSE) and bit-error-rate (BER)\nperformance. It also reduces the pilot overhead by 50$\\%$ compared to\ntraditional channel estimators and provides bandwidth optimization for\nMIMO-OFDM systems.

This will dramatically increase the GW/GRB co-detection rate,\nand enable prompt arcminute localization of a neutron star merger. We simulate\nthe full Swift response to a GW early warning alert, including input sky maps\nproduced at different warning times, a complete model of Swift's attitude\ncontrol system, and a full accounting of the latency between the GW detectors\nand the spacecraft. 60 s of early warning doubles the rate of prompt GRB\ndetections with arcminute position, and 140 s guarantees observation anywhere\non the unocculted sky, even with localization areas >> 1000 deg$^2$. While 140\ns is beyond current gravitational wave detector sensitivities, 30-70 s is\nachievable today.

    "abstract": "Assessing data informativity, determining whether the measured data contains\nsufficient information for a specific control objective, is a fundamental\nchallenge in data-driven control. In noisy scenarios, existing studies deal\nwith system noise and measurement noise separately, using quadratic matrix\ninequalities. Moreover, the analysis of measurement noise requires restrictive\nassumptions on noise properties. To provide a unified framework without any\nrestrictions, this study introduces data perturbation, a novel notion that\nencompasses both existing noise models. It is observed that the admissible\nsystem set with data perturbation does not meet preconditions necessary for\napplying the key lemma in the matrix S-procedure. Our analysis overcomes this\nlimitation by developing an extended version of this lemma, making it\napplicable to data perturbation. Our results unify the existing analyses while\neliminating the need for restrictive assumptions made in the measurement noise\nscenario.",

In such platforms, low latency is critical to enhance user\nexperiences. However, conventional session-based approaches struggle with high\nlatency due to the demands of modeling sequential user behavior for each\nrecommendation process. Additionally, given the reciprocal nature of the\nplatform, where users act as items for each other, training recommendation\nmodels on large-scale datasets is computationally prohibitive using\nconventional methods. To address these challenges, CUPID decouples the\ntime-intensive user session modeling from the real-time user matching process\nto reduce inference time. Furthermore, CUPID employs a two-phase training\nstrategy that separates the training of embedding and prediction layers,\nsignificantly reducing the computational burden by decreasing the number of\nsequential model inferences by several hundredfold. Extensive experiments on\nlarge-scale Azar datasets demonstrate CUPID's effectiveness in a real-world\nproduction environment. Notably, CUPID reduces response latency by more than\n76% compared to non-asynchronous systems, while significantly improving user\nengagement.",

Recently, a series of studies attempt to explain the mechanisms\nunderlying CoT, aiming to deepen the understanding of its efficacy.\nNevertheless, the existing research faces two major challenges: (1) a lack of\nquantitative metrics to assess CoT capabilities and (2) a dearth of guidance on\noptimizing CoT performance. Motivated by this, in this work, we introduce a\nnovel reasoning boundary framework (RBF) to address these challenges. To solve\nthe lack of quantification, we first define a reasoning boundary (RB) to\nquantify the upper-bound of CoT and establish a combination law for RB,\nenabling a practical quantitative approach applicable to various real-world CoT\ntasks. To address the lack of optimization, we propose three categories of RBs.\nWe further optimize these categories with combination laws focused on RB\npromotion and reasoning path optimization for CoT improvement. Through\nextensive experiments on 27 models and 5 tasks, the study validates the\nexistence and rationality of the proposed framework. Furthermore, it explains\nthe effectiveness of 10 CoT strategies and guides optimization from two\nperspectives.

However, traditional methods, relying on keyword searches and basic\nNLP techniques, often fail to uncover valuable insights not explicitly stated\nin article titles or keywords. These approaches are unable to perform semantic\nsearches and contextual understanding, limiting their effectiveness in\nclassifying topics and characterizing studies. In this paper, we address these\nlimitations by leveraging Generative AI models, specifically transformers and\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to automate and enhance bibliometric\nanalysis. We developed a technical workflow that integrates a vector database,\nSentence Transformers, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Retrieval Agent, and\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to enable contextual search, topic ranking, and\ncharacterization of research using customized prompt templates. A pilot study\nanalyzing 223 urban science-related articles published in Nature Communications\nover the past decade highlights the effectiveness of our approach in generating\ninsightful summary statistics on the quality, scope, and characteristics of\npapers in high-impact journals. This study introduces a new paradigm for\nenhancing bibliometric analysis and knowledge retrieval in urban research,\npositioning an AI agent as a powerful tool for advancing research evaluation\nand understanding.",

Although the Zen of Python states\nthat \"Simple is better than complex,\" we hypothesize that more elegant and\nproficient code might be harder for the developer to maintain. To study this\nrelationship between the understanding of code maintainability and code\nproficiency, we present an exploratory study into the complexity of Python code\non three Python libraries. Specifically, we investigate the risk level of\nproficient code inside a file. As a starting point, we mined and collected the\nproficiency of code from three PyPI libraries totaling 3,003 files. We\nidentified several instances of high proficient code that was also high risk,\nwith examples being simple list comprehensions, 'enumerate' calls, generator\nexpressions, simple dictionary comprehensions, and the 'super' function. Our\nearly examples revealed that most code-proficient development presented a low\nmaintainability risk, yet there are some cases where proficient code is also\nrisky to maintenance.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of learning a Nash equilibrium (NE) in Markov games\nwhich is a cornerstone in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). In\nparticular, we focus on infinite-horizon adversarial team Markov games (ATMGs)\nin which agents that share a common reward function compete against a single\nopponent, the adversary. These games unify two-player zero-sum Markov games and\nMarkov potential games, resulting in a setting that encompasses both\ncollaboration and competition. Kalogiannis et al. (2023a) provided an efficient\nequilibrium computation algorithm for ATMGs which presumes knowledge of the\nreward and transition functions and has no sample complexity guarantees. We\ncontribute a learning algorithm that utilizes MARL policy gradient methods with\niteration and sample complexity that is polynomial in the approximation error\n$\\epsilon$ and the natural parameters of the ATMG, resolving the main caveats\nof the solution by (Kalogiannis et al., 2023a). It is worth noting that\npreviously, the existence of learning algorithms for NE was known for Markov\ntwo-player zero-sum and potential games but not for ATMGs.\n  Seen through the lens of min-max optimization, computing a NE in these games\nconsists a nonconvex-nonconcave saddle-point problem. Min-max optimization has\nreceived extensive study. Nevertheless, the case of nonconvex-nonconcave\nlandscapes remains elusive: in full generality, finding saddle-points is\ncomputationally intractable (Daskalakis et al., 2021). We circumvent the\naforementioned intractability by developing techniques that exploit the hidden\nstructure of the objective function via a nonconvex-concave reformulation.\nHowever, this introduces the challenge of a feasibility set with coupled\nconstraints. We tackle these challenges by establishing novel techniques for\noptimizing weakly-smooth nonconvex functions, extending the framework of\n(Devolder et al., 2014).",

The genetic causes for comorbidity often trace back to mutations\noccurred either in the same gene associated with two diseases or in different\ngenes associated with different diseases respectively but coming into\nconnection via protein-protein interactions. Therefore, human interactome has\nbeen used in more sophisticated study of disease comorbidity. Human\ninteractome, as a large incomplete graph, presents its own challenges to\nextracting useful features for comorbidity prediction. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel approach named Biologically Supervised Graph Embedding (BSE)\nto allow for selecting most relevant features to enhance the prediction\naccuracy of comorbid disease pairs. Our investigation into BSE's impact on both\ncentered and uncentered embedding methods showcases its consistent superiority\nover the state-of-the-art techniques and its adeptness in selecting dimensions\nenriched with vital biological insights, thereby improving prediction\nperformance significantly, up to 50% when measured by ROC for some variations.\nFurther analysis indicates that BSE consistently and substantially improves the\nratio of disease associations to gene connectivity, affirming its potential in\nuncovering latent biological factors affecting comorbidity.

Among them, NbSe2Br2 was\nverified by first principles calculations, achieving ZTmax value of 1.35 at\n1000K, which is currently the highest value among flexible inorganic\nthermoelectric materials. And the power factor value of 8.1 {\\mu}Wcm-1K-2 at\n300K also surpassed most organic and inorganic flexible thermoelectric\nmaterials. Its high deformability mainly attributed to the small slipping\nenergy that allows interlayer slip and the small in-plane modulus that allows\ndeformation before failure. The high ZTmax is mainly contributed by the\nextremely low thermal conductivity and the high Seebeck coefficient along the\nout-of-plane direction at high temperature. The high power factor at room\ntemperature is mainly comes from the high conductivity in the in-plane\ndirection. This study is expected to accelerate the development and application\nof flexible thermoelectric devices based on inorganic semiconductor materials.",

The proofs are all based on using\nGirsanov's theorem to reduce enhanced dissipation to a quantitative control\nproblem that can be solved by leveraging the shearing across streamlines.

However, current image-to-video diffusion models, while\npowerful in generating videos from a single conditioning frame, need adaptation\nfor two-frame (start & end) conditioned generation, which is essential for\neffective bounded interpolation. Unfortunately, existing approaches that fuse\ntemporally forward and backward paths in parallel often suffer from\noff-manifold issues, leading to artifacts or requiring multiple iterative\nre-noising steps. In this work, we introduce a novel, bidirectional sampling\nstrategy to address these off-manifold issues without requiring extensive\nre-noising or fine-tuning. Our method employs sequential sampling along both\nforward and backward paths, conditioned on the start and end frames,\nrespectively, ensuring more coherent and on-manifold generation of intermediate\nframes. Additionally, we incorporate advanced guidance techniques, CFG++ and\nDDS, to further enhance the interpolation process. By integrating these, our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance, efficiently generating\nhigh-quality, smooth videos between keyframes. On a single 3090 GPU, our method\ncan interpolate 25 frames at 1024 x 576 resolution in just 195 seconds,\nestablishing it as a leading solution for keyframe interpolation.",

Existing OVD methods mainly rely on the powerful open-vocabulary\nimage-text alignment capability of Vision-Language Pretrained Models (VLM) such\nas CLIP. However, CLIP is trained on image-text pairs and lacks the perceptual\nability for local regions within an image, resulting in the gap between image\nand region representations. Directly using CLIP for OVD causes inaccurate\nregion classification.

SIA-OVD learns a set of feature adapters for regions with different\nshapes and designs a new adapter allocation mechanism to select the optimal\nadapter for each region.

In this letter, we first propose a quantized\nchannel model of ReRAM, based on which we design both the one-bit and multi-bit\nchannel quantizers by maximizing the mutual information of the channel. A key\nchannel parameter that affects the quantizer design is the sneak path\noccurrence probability (SPOP) of the memory cell. We first use the average SPOP\ncalculated statistically to design the quantizer, which leads to the same\nchannel detector for different memory arrays. We then adopt the SPOP estimated\nseparately for each memory array for the quantizer design, which is generated\nby an effective channel estimator and through an iterative detection and\ndecoding scheme for the ReRAM channel. This results in an array-level SPI-aware\nadaptive detection and decoding approach. Moreover, since there is a strong\ncorrelation of the SPI that affects memory cells in the same rows/columns than\nthat affecting cells in different rows/columns, we further derive a\ncolumn-level scheme which outperforms the array-level scheme.

    "abstract": "Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) is a crucial capability for video\nunderstanding models and plays a vital role in downstream tasks such as video\nbrowsing and editing. To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and\nenable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs\nfor VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on\nnatural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure\ninherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks.\nTo address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event\nmodeling framework, which represents video LLM outputs as sequences of events,\nand predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural\ninstructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient\nscores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video\nLLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework\nin practice. The TRACE process visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and\ntext as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each.\nTask tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal\nevent modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG\ntasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to\nstate-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at\nhttps://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of neural policies in control systems, ensuring their\nsafety and reliability has become a critical software engineering task. One\nprevalent approach to ensuring the safety of neural policies is to deploy\nprogrammatic runtime shields alongside them to correct their unsafe commands.\nHowever, the programmatic runtime shields synthesized by existing methods are\neither computationally expensive or insufficiently permissive, resulting in\nhigh overhead and unnecessary interventions on the system. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Aegis, a novel framework that synthesizes lightweight\nand permissive programmatic runtime shields for neural policies. Aegis achieves\nthis by formulating the seeking of a runtime shield as a sketch-based program\nsynthesis problem and proposing a novel method that leverages\ncounterexample-guided inductive synthesis and Bayesian optimization to solve\nit. To evaluate Aegis and its synthesized shields, we use eight representative\ncontrol systems and compare Aegis with the current state-of-the-art. Our\nresults show that the programmatic runtime shields synthesized by Aegis can\ncorrect all unsafe commands from neural policies, ensuring that the systems do\nnot violate any desired safety properties at all times. Compared to the current\nstate-of-the-art, Aegis's shields exhibit a 2.2$\\times$ reduction in time\noverhead and a 3.9$\\times$ reduction in memory usage, suggesting that they are\nmuch more lightweight. Moreover, Aegis's shields incur an average of\n1.5$\\times$ fewer interventions than other shields, showing better\npermissiveness.",

In this\npaper, we introduce DecorateLM, a data engineering method designed to refine\nthe pretraining corpus through data rating, tagging and editing. Specifically,\nDecorateLM rates texts against quality criteria, tags texts with hierarchical\nlabels, and edits texts into a more formalized format. Due to the massive size\nof the pretraining corpus, adopting an LLM for decorating the entire corpus is\nless efficient. Therefore, to balance performance with efficiency, we curate a\nmeticulously annotated training corpus for DecorateLM using a large language\nmodel and distill data engineering expertise into a compact 1.2 billion\nparameter small language model (SLM). We then apply DecorateLM to enhance 100\nbillion tokens of the training corpus, selecting 45 billion tokens that\nexemplify high quality and diversity for the further training of another 1.2\nbillion parameter LLM.

This study\npresents a computationally efficient time series classification approach that\nuses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) of the Reconstructed Phase Spaces (RPSs) to\nidentify supraglacial lakes based on their seasonal evolution: 1) those that\nrefreeze at the end of the melt season, 2) those that drain during the melt\nseason, and 3) those that become buried, remaining liquid insulated a few\nmeters beneath the surface. Our approach uses time series data from the\nSentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites, which utilize microwave and visible\nradiation, respectively. Evaluated on a GrIS-wide dataset, the RPS-GMM model,\ntrained on a single representative sample per class, achieves 85.46% accuracy\nwith Sentinel-1 data alone and 89.70% with combined Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2\ndata.

Traditionally, the development of MPPs has\nrelied on a trial-and-error design approach. Although simple optimization-based\nmethods have recently begun to be employed, these designs often overlook\npractical considerations, such as the increased costs associated with adding\nmore MPP layers, which presents a gap to achieve the practical feasibility of\nMPP deployment. To address this, the study aims to develop an inverse\nmulti-objective optimization-empowered framework for MPP design to enhance\nlow-frequency noise mitigation while minimizing fabrication costs.\nSpecifically, a finite element (FE) model is established to conduct the\nacoustic analysis of MPPs, followed by thorough experimental validation. A\nnovel multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) is then\ndeveloped to cope with mixed-type design variables with interrelations inherent\nto the MPP architecture. Using the high-fidelity FE model as a cornerstone, the\nMOPSO guides the inverse optimization analysis to yield multiple non-dominant\nsolutions. These solutions not only avoid the trap of local optima, but also\nallow for continuous screening to ensure the engineering viability based on\nempirical judgment. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed methodology. The MPPs designed in this study show great potential for\nmitigating indoor noise in buildings, addressing noise issues arising from\nrapid urbanization and transportation development.

    "abstract": "Aiming to incrementally learn new classes with only few samples while\npreserving the knowledge of base (old) classes, few-shot class-incremental\nlearning (FSCIL) faces several challenges, such as overfitting and catastrophic\nforgetting. Such a challenging problem is often tackled by fixing a feature\nextractor trained on base classes to reduce the adverse effects of overfitting\nand forgetting. Under such formulation, our primary focus is representation\nlearning on base classes to tackle the unique challenge of FSCIL:\nsimultaneously achieving the transferability and the discriminability of the\nlearned representation. Building upon the recent efforts for enhancing\ntransferability, such as promoting the spread of features, we find that trying\nto secure the spread of features within a more confined feature space enables\nthe learned representation to strike a better balance between transferability\nand discriminability. Thus, in stark contrast to prior beliefs that the\ninter-class distance should be maximized, we claim that the closer different\nclasses are, the better for FSCIL. The empirical results and analysis from the\nperspective of information bottleneck theory justify our simple yet seemingly\ncounter-intuitive representation learning method, raising research questions\nand suggesting alternative research directions.

    "abstract": "This paper aims to discuss the impact of random initialization of neural\nnetworks in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory, which is ignored by most\nrecent works in the NTK theory. It is well known that as the network's width\ntends to infinity, the neural network with random initialization converges to a\nGaussian process $f^{\\mathrm{GP}}$, which takes values in $L^{2}(\\mathcal{X})$,\nwhere $\\mathcal{X}$ is the domain of the data. In contrast, to adopt the\ntraditional theory of kernel regression, most recent works introduced a special\nmirrored architecture and a mirrored (random) initialization to ensure the\nnetwork's output is identically zero at initialization. Therefore, it remains a\nquestion whether the conventional setting and mirrored initialization would\nmake wide neural networks exhibit different generalization capabilities. In\nthis paper, we first show that the training dynamics of the gradient flow of\nneural networks with random initialization converge uniformly to that of the\ncorresponding NTK regression with random initialization $f^{\\mathrm{GP}}$. We\nthen show that $\\mathbf{P}(f^{\\mathrm{GP}} \\in [\\mathcal{H}^{\\mathrm{NT}}]^{s})\n= 1$ for any $s < \\frac{3}{d+1}$ and $\\mathbf{P}(f^{\\mathrm{GP}} \\in\n[\\mathcal{H}^{\\mathrm{NT}}]^{s}) = 0$ for any $s \\geq \\frac{3}{d+1}$, where\n$[\\mathcal{H}^{\\mathrm{NT}}]^{s}$ is the real interpolation space of the RKHS\n$\\mathcal{H}^{\\mathrm{NT}}$ associated with the NTK. Consequently, the\ngeneralization error of the wide neural network trained by gradient descent is\n$\\Omega(n^{-\\frac{3}{d+3}})$, and it still suffers from the curse of\ndimensionality. On one hand, the result highlights the benefits of mirror\ninitialization. On the other hand, it implies that NTK theory may not fully\nexplain the superior performance of neural networks.",

The inherent robustness of time crystalline order to perturbations in\nthe drive protocol makes DTCs promising for applications in quantum\ntechnologies. We exploit the susceptibility of PDTC order to deviations in its\norder parameter to devise highly frequency-selective quantum sensors for\ntime-varying (AC) magnetic fields in a system of strongly-driven,\ndipolar-coupled 13C nuclear spins in diamond. Integrating a time-varying AC\nfield into the PDTC allows us to exponentially increase its lifetime, measuring\nimprovement of up to three orders of magnitude (44,204 cycles), and results in\na strong resonant response in the time crystalline order parameter. The\nlinewidth of our sensor is limited by the PDTC lifetime alone, as strong\ninterspin interactions help stabilize DTC order. The sensor operates in the\n0.5-50 kHz range - a blind spot for sensors based on atomic vapor or electronic\nspins - and attains a competitive sensitivity. PDTC sensors are resilient to\nerrors in the drive protocol and sample inhomogeneities, and are agnostic to\nthe macroscopic details of the physical platform: the underlying physical\nprinciple applies equally to superconducting qubits, neutral atoms, and trapped\nions.",

Although segmentation\nalgorithms based on CNNs and Transformers achieve significant progress in\nperformance, balancing segmentation accuracy and computational complexity\nremains challenging, limiting their wide application in practical tasks. To\naddress this, this paper introduces state space model (SSM) and proposes a\nnovel hybrid semantic segmentation network based on vision Mamba (CVMH-UNet).\nThis method designs a cross-scanning visual state space block (CVSSBlock) that\nuses cross 2D scanning (CS2D) to fully capture global information from multiple\ndirections, while by incorporating convolutional neural network branches to\novercome the constraints of Vision Mamba (VMamba) in acquiring local\ninformation, this approach facilitates a comprehensive analysis of both global\nand local features. Furthermore, to address the issue of limited discriminative\npower and the difficulty in achieving detailed fusion with direct skip\nconnections, a multi-frequency multi-scale feature fusion block (MFMSBlock) is\ndesigned. This module introduces multi-frequency information through 2D\ndiscrete cosine transform (2D DCT) to enhance information utilization and\nprovides additional scale local detail information through point-wise\nconvolution branches. Finally, it aggregates multi-scale information along the\nchannel dimension, achieving refined feature fusion.

We use the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG\nsimulations to study a group of MWAs defined by their stellar mass (SM) and\nstar formation rate (SFR). We trace these galaxies back along their evolution\nto investigate the star forming and mass assembly tracks taken by a galaxy to\nbecome a MWA today in light of these chosen parameters.

To address these challenges, we\npropose CodeDPO, a framework that integrates preference learning into code\ngeneration to improve two key code preference factors: code correctness and\nefficiency. CodeDPO employs a novel dataset construction method, utilizing a\nself-generation-and-validation mechanism that simultaneously generates and\nevaluates code and test cases.

CodeDPO is flexible\nand scalable, generating diverse preference optimization data without depending\non external resources. Through comprehensive evaluations of five widely used\nbenchmarks, CodeDPO demonstrates significant improvements in correctness and\nefficiency compared to existing methods.

    "abstract": "Classically, the splitting principle says how to pull back a vector bundle in\nsuch a way that it splits into line bundles and the pullback map induces an\ninjection on $K$-theory. Here we categorify the splitting principle and\ngeneralize it to the context of 2-rigs. A 2-rig is a kind of categorified \"ring\nwithout negatives\", such as a category of vector bundles with $\\oplus$ as\naddition and $\\otimes$ as multiplication. Technically, we define a 2-rig to be\na Cauchy complete $k$-linear symmetric monoidal category where $k$ has\ncharacteristic zero. We conjecture that for any suitably finite-dimensional\nobject $r$ of a 2-rig $\\mathsf{R}$, there is a 2-rig map $E \\colon \\mathsf{R}\n\\to \\mathsf{R'}$ such that $E(r)$ splits as a direct sum of finitely many\n\"subline objects\" and $E$ has various good properties: it is faithful,\nconservative, essentially injective, and the induced map of Grothendieck rings\n$K(E) \\colon K(\\mathsf{R}) \\to K(\\mathsf{R'})$ is injective. We prove this\nconjecture for the free 2-rig on one object, namely the category of Schur\nfunctors, whose Grothendieck ring is the free $\\lambda$-ring on one generator,\nalso known as the ring of symmetric functions. We use this task as an excuse to\ndevelop the representation theory of affine categories - that is, categories\nenriched in affine schemes - using the theory of 2-rigs.",

While algorithms like\nMultivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) excel at capturing such\ncontinuous relationships, they perform poorly when modeling discontinuities. To\naddress the limitations of both approaches, we introduce Spline-based\nMultivariate Adaptive Regression Trees (SMART), which uses a decision tree to\nidentify subsets of data with distinct continuous relationships and then\nleverages MARS to fit these relationships independently. Unlike other methods\nthat rely on the tree structure to model interaction and higher-order terms,\nSMART leverages MARS's native ability to handle these terms, allowing the tree\nto focus solely on identifying discontinuities in the relationship. We test\nSMART on various datasets, demonstrating its improvement over state-of-the-art\nmethods in such cases.

Such motifs span vast length scales;\nexamples include certain pinwheel molecules, nautilus shells, cyclone wind\npatterns and spiral galaxies. Although pervasive in nature, it has only\nrecently been found that condensed matter systems can exhibit a form of planar\nchirality through toroidal arrangements of electric dipoles, known as\nferro-rotational (FR) order. A key characteristic of such order is that\nenantiomorph conversion occurs when the solid is flipped by 180 degrees about\nan in-plane axis. Consequently, ferro-rotationally ordered materials may\nexhibit directionally asymmetric response functions, even while preserving\ninversion and time-reversal symmetry. Such an effect, however, has yet to be\nobserved. Using second harmonic interferometry, we show here that when\ncircularly polarized light is incident on MnTiO$_3$, the generated nonlinear\nsignal exhibits directional asymmetry. Depending on whether the incident light\nis parallel or anti-parallel to the FR axis, we observe a different conversion\nefficiency of two right (left) circularly polarized photons into a\nfrequency-doubled left (right) circularly polarized photon.

Recent studies have drawn\nanalogies between GNN feature propagation and diffusion processes, which can be\ninterpreted as dynamical systems. In this paper, we delve deeper into this\nperspective by connecting the dynamics in GNNs to modern Koopman theory and its\nnumerical method, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD). We illustrate how DMD can\nestimate a low-rank, finite-dimensional linear operator based on multiple\nstates of the system, effectively approximating potential nonlinear\ninteractions between nodes in the graph. This approach allows us to capture\ncomplex dynamics within the graph accurately and efficiently. We theoretically\nestablish a connection between the DMD-estimated operator and the original\ndynamic operator between system states. Building upon this foundation, we\nintroduce a family of DMD-GNN models that effectively leverage the low-rank\neigenfunctions provided by the DMD algorithm. We further discuss the potential\nof enhancing our approach by incorporating domain-specific constraints such as\nsymmetry into the DMD computation, allowing the corresponding GNN models to\nrespect known physical properties of the underlying system. Our work paves the\npath for applying advanced dynamical system analysis tools via GNNs. We\nvalidate our approach through extensive experiments on various learning tasks,\nincluding directed graphs, large-scale graphs, long-range interactions, and\nspatial-temporal graphs.

    "abstract": "Future multi-spacecraft missions require robust autonomous trajectory\noptimization capabilities to ensure safe and efficient rendezvous operations.\nThis capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in\nreal-time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex\nprogramming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this\nburden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) introduced a generative\nmodel trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides\nconvergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves\nfeasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization\nalgorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to\naddress robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART\nis applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO),\nensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive\nexperimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently\nproduce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30\\% cost\nimprovement and 50\\% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional\nmethods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state\nrepresentations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to\nassess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures,\nmarking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions\nin safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.",

Contrary to traditional deep learning, large language models\n(LLMs) are (i) even more overparameterized, (ii) trained on unlabeled text\ncorpora curated from the Internet with minimal human intervention, and (iii)\ntrained in an online fashion. These stark contrasts prevent researchers from\ntransferring lessons learned on model generalization and adaptation in deep\nlearning contexts to LLMs. To this end, our short paper introduces empirical\nobservations that aim to shed light on further training of already pretrained\nlanguage models. Specifically, we demonstrate that training a model on a text\ndomain could degrade its perplexity on the test portion of the same domain. We\nobserve with our subsequent analysis that the performance degradation is\npositively correlated with the similarity between the additional and the\noriginal pretraining dataset of the LLM. Our further token-level perplexity\nobservations reveals that the perplexity degradation is due to a handful of\ntokens that are not informative about the domain.

The DCAE is used to extract\nrelevant features in the corrupted data, while the BiGRU captures the temporal\ndynamics of the gravitational-wave signals. We show for a massive black hole\nbinary signal, corrupted by data gaps of various numbers and duration, that we\nyield an overlap of greater than 99.97% when the gaps do not occur in the\nmerging phase and greater than 99% when the gaps do occur in the merging phase.\nHowever, if data gaps occur during merger time, we show that we get biased\nastrophysical parameter estimates, highlighting the need for \"protected\nperiods,\" where antenna repointing does not occur during the predicted merger\ntime.",

    "abstract": "Job interviews play a critical role in shaping one's career, yet practicing\ninterview skills can be challenging, especially without access to human coaches\nor peers for feedback. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)\npresent an opportunity to enhance the interview practice experience. Yet,\nlittle research has explored the effectiveness and user perceptions of such\nsystems or the benefits and challenges of using LLMs for interview practice.\nFurthermore, while prior work and recent commercial tools have demonstrated the\npotential of AI to assist with interview practice, they often deliver one-way\nfeedback, where users only receive information about their performance. By\ncontrast, dialogic feedback, a concept developed in learning sciences, is a\ntwo-way interaction feedback process that allows users to further engage with\nand learn from the provided feedback through interactive dialogue. This paper\nintroduces Conversate, a web-based application that supports reflective\nlearning in job interview practice by leveraging large language models (LLMs)\nfor interactive interview simulations and dialogic feedback. To start the\ninterview session, the user provides the title of a job position (e.g.,\nentry-level software engineer) in the system. Then, our system will initialize\nthe LLM agent to start the interview simulation by asking the user an opening\ninterview question and following up with questions carefully adapted to\nsubsequent user responses. After the interview session, our back-end LLM\nframework will then analyze the user's responses and highlight areas for\nimprovement. Users can then annotate the transcript by selecting specific\nsections and writing self-reflections. Finally, the user can interact with the\nsystem for dialogic feedback, conversing with the LLM agent to learn from and\niteratively refine their answers based on the agent's guidance.",

    "abstract": "The yields of hadrons and light nuclei in relativistic collisions of\nheavy-nuclei at a center of mass energy of 2.6 TeV can be described remarkably\nwell by a thermal distribution of an ideal gas of hadrons and light nuclei\ninteracting only via the decay of resonances. Given the particularly small\nbinding energy of hypertritons relative to the temperature describing the\nyields (about 156 MeV), one might naturally expect hypertrions to dissociate in\nmedium, making the agreement of hypertriton yields with thermal predictions\nhighly puzzling. The puzzle is compounded by the fact that small binding energy\nis associated with the large size of the hypertriton. This size is on a similar\nscale to the overall size of the fireball and much larger than the length scale\nover which temperatures in the fireball vary over phenomenologically relevant\namounts. This paper quantifies the tension this effect causes and shows that it\nis sufficiently large to render the thermal model inconsistent: its natural\nassumptions are in conflict with its outputs. The possibility that hypertritons\nare formed at freeze out as compact objects, quark droplets, that subsequently\nevolve into hypertritons is considered as a way to resolve the puzzle. It is\nnoted that beyond making the assumption that compact quark droplets form,\nadditional detailed dynamical assumptions which have not been justified are\nneeded to make the thermal model work. The issue of why, despite these issues,\nthe hypertriton is well described by a simple statistical description at freeze\nout is unresolved. Resolving the hypertriton puzzle is important as it may\nclarify whether the phenomenological success of the simple thermal model for\nyields accurately reflects the simple picture of the underlying physics on\nwhich it is based.",

    "abstract": "We calculate the screening masses of pseudoscalar mesons in a hot and\nstrongly magnetized medium within the framework of the SU(3)\nNambu-Jona--Lasinio model, using a magnetic field-independent regularization\nscheme. Inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) is implemented through the use of a\nmagnetic field-dependent coupling $G(B)$, fitted to reproduce lattice quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) results for the pseudocritical chiral transition\ntemperature $T_c^B$. For the external homogeneous magnetic field considered,\nneutral screening masses separate in two types: perpendicular and parallel to\nthe direction of the field, while for charged mesons only parallel energies can\nbe defined for each Landau level. We obtain $m_{\\mathrm{scr},\\perp} >\nm_{\\mathrm{scr},\\parallel}$, as expected from causality. Thermally, all\nscreening energies are almost constant until some critical temperature, whose\nbehavior is correlated with $T_c^B$. They rapidly increase around this value,\nkeeping a steady enhancement afterward due to thermal excitation. Magnetically,\nneutral parallel masses are enhanced (suppressed) at high temperatures when\nconsidering $G(B)$ ($G$). Perpendicular ones display a non-monotonic magnetic\nbehavior for $G$ (due to increasing $T_c^B$) when $T \\lesssim 500$~MeV, but\nbecome magnetically enhanced when $T \\gtrsim 500$~MeV. For $G(B)$ they always\nincrease with $B$. Charged parallel energies are always magnetically enhanced,\nfor both couplings. In the high-temperature limit, we show that both neutral\nand charged screening energies converge to $2\\pi T$. At $B=0$ the model\noverestimates the remaining quark interaction in this regime. At $B\\neq 0$ we\nfind that, when IMC is accounted for, the interaction is suppressed as $B$\nincreases, a fact that appears to be at odds with currently available lattice\nQCD results.",

With\nfixed regressors and correlated errors, the conventional wisdom is to modify\nthe variance-covariance estimator to accommodate the known correlation\nstructure of the errors. We depart from the literature by showing that with\nrandom regressors, linear regression inference is robust to correlated errors\nwith unknown correlation structure. The existing theoretical analyses for\nlinear regression are no longer valid because even the asymptotic normality of\nthe least-squares coefficients breaks down in this regime. We first prove the\nasymptotic normality of the t statistics by establishing their Berry-Esseen\nbounds based on a novel probabilistic analysis of self-normalized statistics.\nWe then study the local power of the corresponding t tests and show that,\nperhaps surprisingly, error correlation can even enhance power in the regime of\nweak signals. Overall, our results show that linear regression is applicable\nmore broadly than the conventional theory suggests, and further demonstrate the\nvalue of randomization to ensure robustness of inference.",
