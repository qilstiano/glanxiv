    "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) and clinical numeric data are essential modalities\nfor cancer evaluation, but building large-scale multimodal training datasets\nfor developing medical foundation models remains challenging due to the\nstructural complexity of multi-slice CT data and high cost of expert\nannotation. In this study, we propose MEDFORM, a multimodal pre-training\nstrategy that guides CT image representation learning using complementary\ninformation from clinical data for medical foundation model development.\nMEDFORM efficiently processes CT slice through multiple instance learning (MIL)\nand adopts a dual pre-training strategy: first pretraining the CT slice feature\nextractor using SimCLR-based self-supervised learning, then aligning CT and\nclinical modalities through cross-modal contrastive learning. Our model was\npre-trained on three different cancer types: lung cancer (141,171 slices),\nbreast cancer (8,100 slices), colorectal cancer (10,393 slices). The\nexperimental results demonstrated that this dual pre-training strategy improves\ncancer classification performance and maintains robust performance in few-shot\nlearning scenarios.

Device manufacturers and IP vendors have claimed for\nyears that antifuses are a ``high security\" memory which is significantly more\ndifficult for an attacker to extract data from than other types of memory, such\nas Flash or mask ROM - however, as our results show, this is untrue. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that data bits stored in a widely used antifuse block can\nbe extracted by a semiconductor failure analysis technique known as passive\nvoltage contrast (PVC) using a focused ion beam (FIB). The simple form of the\nattack demonstrated here recovers the bitwise OR of two physically adjacent\nmemory rows sharing common metal 1 contacts, however we have identified several\npotential mechanisms by which it may be possible to read the even and odd rows\nseparately. We demonstrate the attack on a commodity microcontroller made on\nthe 40nm node and show how it can be used to extract significant quantities of\nsensitive data, such as keys for firmware encryption, in time scales which are\nvery practical for real world exploitation (1 day of sample prep plus a few\nhours of FIB time) with only a single target device required after initial\nreconnaissance has been completed on blank devices.",

    "abstract": "Barren plateaus (BP), characterized by exponentially vanishing gradients that\nhinder the training of variational quantum circuits (VQC), present a pervasive\nand critical challenge in applying variational quantum algorithms to real-world\napplications. It is widely recognized that the BP problem becomes more\npronounced with an increase in the number of parameters. This work demonstrates\nthat the BP problem manifests at different scales depending on the specific\napplication, highlighting the absence of a universal VQC ansatz capable of\nresolving the BP issue across all applications. Consequently, there is an\nimminent need for an automated tool to design and optimize VQC architectures\ntailored to specific applications. To close the gap, this paper takes\nVariational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) as a vehicle, and we propose a novel\nquantum circuit parameter and architecture co-exploration framework, namely\nAntiBP.

    "abstract": "Recent research has highlighted a critical issue known as ``robust fairness\",\nwhere robust accuracy varies significantly across different classes,\nundermining the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs). A common approach\nto address this has been to dynamically reweight classes during training,\ngiving more weight to those with lower empirical robust performance. However,\nwe find there is a divergence of class-wise robust performance between training\nset and testing set, which limits the effectiveness of these explicit\nreweighting methods, indicating the need for a principled alternative. In this\nwork, we derive a robust generalization bound for the worst-class robust error\nwithin the PAC-Bayesian framework, accounting for unknown data distributions.\nOur analysis shows that the worst-class robust error is influenced by two main\nfactors: the spectral norm of the empirical robust confusion matrix and the\ninformation embedded in the model and training set. While the latter has been\nextensively studied, we propose a novel regularization technique targeting the\nspectral norm of the robust confusion matrix to improve worst-class robust\naccuracy and enhance robust fairness. We validate our approach through\ncomprehensive experiments on various datasets and models, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in enhancing robust fairness.",

At any time instant, REAP converts the MPC problem\ninto the evolution of a virtual dynamical system whose trajectory converges to\nthe optimal solution, and provides guaranteed sub-optimal and feasible solution\nwhenever its evolution is terminated due to limited computational power. REAP\nhas been introduced as a continuous-time scheme and its theoretical properties\nhave been derived under the assumption that it performs all the computations in\ncontinuous time. However, REAP should be practically implemented in\ndiscrete-time. This paper focuses on the discrete-time implementation of REAP,\nexploring conditions under which anytime feasibility and convergence properties\nare maintained when the computations are performed in discrete time.

Understanding the interrelation between these\ndistinct order parameters remains a significant challenge, leaving much of the\nassociated physics unexplored. In the kagome superconductor KV3Sb5, which\nexhibits a charge density wave (CDW) state below T = 78 K, we uncover an\nunpredicted field-induced phase transition below 6 K. The observed transition\nis marked by a hysteretic anomaly in the resistivity, nonlinear electrical\ntransport, and a change in the symmetry of the electronic response as probed\nvia the angular dependence of the magnetoresistivity. These observations\nsurprisingly suggest the emergence of an unanticipated broken symmetry state\ncoexisting with the original CDW. To understand this experimental observation,\nwe developed a theoretical minimal model for the normal state inside the\nhigh-temperature parent CDW phase where an incommensurate CDW order emerges as\nan instability sub-leading to superconductivity. The incommensurate CDW emerges\nwhen superconducting fluctuations become fully suppressed by large magnetic\nfields.

We find that during the accretion phase, low-energy\nneutrinos are mainly produced by pp chains and plasma decay, and photon\nluminosity is greater than low-energy nuclear and thermal neutrino luminosity.\nDuring the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) phase, low-energy neutrinos are mainly\nproduced by the CNO cycle and photon-neutrino, and the low-energy nuclear and\nthermal neutrino luminosity far exceeds the photon luminosity. We find that the\nmore massive the WD, the shorter the cycle time and the higher the low-energy\nnuclear neutrino luminosity. The higher the accretion rate, the lower the\nlow-energy nuclear neutrino luminosity. If the accretion mixing effect is not\ntaken into account, the outburst interval becomes longer, the low-energy\nnuclear neutrino luminosity will be increased. And for the cooler nova model\n$(T_{\\mathrm{C}}=1\\times10^{7}\\rm K)$, the low-energy nuclear neutrino\nluminosity will be lower during the accretion phase and higher at the TNR. We\nalso predict the neutrino luminosity and energy spectrum of the upcoming\nrecurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB).

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream solution for novel\nview synthesis and 3D reconstruction. By explicitly encoding a 3D scene using a\ncollection of Gaussian kernels, 3DGS achieves high-quality rendering with\nsuperior efficiency. As a learning-based approach, 3DGS training has been dealt\nwith the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which offers at\nmost linear convergence. Consequently, training often requires tens of minutes,\neven with GPU acceleration. This paper introduces a (near) second-order\nconvergent training algorithm for 3DGS, leveraging its unique properties. Our\napproach is inspired by two key observations. First, the attributes of a\nGaussian kernel contribute independently to the image-space loss, which\nendorses isolated and local optimization algorithms. We exploit this by\nsplitting the optimization at the level of individual kernel attributes,\nanalytically constructing small-size Newton systems for each parameter group,\nand efficiently solving these systems on GPU threads. This achieves Newton-like\nconvergence per training image without relying on the global Hessian. Second,\nkernels exhibit sparse and structured coupling across input images. This\nproperty allows us to effectively utilize spatial information to mitigate\novershoot during stochastic training. Our method converges an order faster than\nstandard GPU-based 3DGS training, requiring over $10\\times$ fewer iterations\nwhile maintaining or surpassing the quality of the compared with the SGD-based\n3DGS reconstructions.",

Motivated by transitive behavior in real-world networks (i.e., ``the\nfriend of my friend is my friend''), a recent line of work considers\nspatially-embedded networks, which exhibit transitive behavior. In particular,\nthe Geometric Hidden Community Model (GHCM), introduced by Gaudio, Guan, Niu,\nand Wei, models a network as a labeled Poisson point process where every pair\nof vertices is associated with a pairwise observation whose distribution\ndepends on the labels and positions of the vertices. The GHCM is in turn a\ngeneralization of the Geometric SBM (proposed by Baccelli and Sankararaman).\nGaudio et al. provided a threshold below which exact recovery is\ninformation-theoretically impossible. Above the threshold, they provided a\nlinear-time algorithm that succeeds in exact recovery under a certain\n``distinctness-of-distributions'' assumption, which they conjectured to be\nunnecessary. In this paper, we partially resolve the conjecture by showing that\nthe threshold is indeed tight for the two-community GHCM. We provide a\ntwo-phase, linear-time algorithm that explores the spatial graph in a\ndata-driven manner in Phase I to yield an almost exact labeling, which is\nrefined to achieve exact recovery in Phase II. Our results extend achievability\nto geometric formulations of well-known inference problems, such as the planted\ndense subgraph problem and submatrix localization, in which the\ndistinctness-of-distributions assumption does not hold.",

Many patients receive care at home from visiting nurses with\nvarying levels of wound expertise, leading to inconsistent care. Problematic,\nnon-healing wounds should be referred to wound specialists, but referral\ndecisions in non-clinical settings are often erroneous, delayed, or\nunnecessary.\n  This paper introduces the Deep Multimodal Wound Assessment Tool (DM-WAT), a\nmachine learning framework designed to assist visiting nurses in deciding\nwhether to refer chronic wound patients. DM-WAT analyzes smartphone-captured\nwound images and clinical notes from Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

In this paper, we experimentally\ndemonstrate high-dimensional, polarization-resolved, programmable 3D\nspatiotemporal toroidal beams with arbitrary 3D geometry.

Our approach\nleverages 25,000 programmable spatiotemporal and polarization degrees of\nfreedom to achieve precise manipulation of the amplitude, phase, polarization\nand temporal properties of toroidal beams. These beams feature highly\ncustomizable 3D geometries, allowing independent control of their aspect ratio\nand orientation. We further demonstrate the generation of beams with arbitrary\nOAM orientation, with beam rotations about any 3D spatiotemporal axis. These\nbeams are delivered through an MMF which enables their transport deep into\nscattering materials and into otherwise hard-to-access regions which could\ninclude biological tissues.

Although machine learning (ML) has\nfacilitated the design of dealloying systems, the selection of key thermal\ntreatment parameters for nanostructure formation remains largely unknown and\ndependent on experimental trial and error. To overcome this challenge, a\nworkflow enabling high-throughput characterization of thermal treatment\nparameters while probing local nanostructures of thin-film samples is needed.\nIn this work, a laser-based thermal treatment is demonstrated to create\ntemperature gradients on single thin-film samples of Nb-Al/Sc and Nb-Al/Cu.\nThis continuous thermal space enables observation of dealloying transitions and\nthe resulting nanostructures of interest. Through synchrotron X-ray multimodal\nand high-throughput characterization, critical transitions and nanostructures\ncan be rapidly captured and subsequently verified using electron microscopy.\nThe key temperatures driving chemical reactions and morphological evolutions\nare clearly identified within this framework. While the oxidation process may\ncontribute to nanostructure formation during thin-film treatment, the\ndealloying process at the dealloying front involves interactions solely between\nthe dealloying elements, highlighting the availability and viability of the\nselected systems.

Simulation tools\nare essential for quantitatively modelling these effects, yet unless artificial\nrestrictions are placed on the circuit or noise model, accurately modelling\nnoisy quantum computations is an extremely challenging task due to unfavourable\nscaling of required computational resources. Tensor network methods offer a\nviable solution for simulating computations that generate limited entanglement\nor that have noise models which yield low gate fidelities. However, in the most\ninteresting regime of entangling circuits (with high gate fidelities) relevant\nfor error correction and mitigation tensor network simulations often achieve\npoor accuracy.\n  In this work we develop and numerically test a method for significantly\nimproving the accuracy of tensor network simulations of noisy quantum circuits\nin the low-noise (i.e. high gate-fidelity) regime. Our method comes with the\nadvantages that it (i) allows for the simulation of quantum circuits under\ngeneric types of noise model, (ii) is especially tailored to the low-noise\nregime, and (iii) retains the benefits of tensor network scaling, enabling\nefficient simulations of large numbers of qubits.

Given the region's cultural, social,\nand economic disparities, there is a contrasting digital divide that\nsignificantly impacts how OGDIs are being developed. Therefore, this paper\nanalyses recent progress in developing OGDIs in Latin America, technological\ngaps, and open geographical data initiatives. The main results denote an early\ndevelopment of OGDIs in the region. Nevertheless, this opens the door for the\ntimely involvement of citizens and non-government sectors to share needs,\nexperiences, knowledge, and expertise, as well as to address a transboundary\nresearch agenda. Challenges are discussed from multiple perspectives: data,\nmethodological, governmental and readiness, and potential impact. This analysis\nis aimed at researchers, policymakers, and practitioners interested in the\nspecific challenges and progress of OGDIs in Latin America, while also\ncontributing to the global conversation on best practices and lessons learned\nin implementing OGDIs across different contexts.",

The optimal order of tensor contractions\ncan then be systematically determined for every SSM block to maximize training\nefficiency. This allows more flexibility in designing SSM blocks beyond the\ndepthwise-separable configuration commonly implemented. The new design choices\nwill take inspiration from classical convolutional blocks including group\nconvolutions, full convolutions, and bottleneck blocks. We architect the\nCentaurus network with a mixture of these blocks, to balance between network\nsize and performance, as well as memory and computational efficiency during\nboth training and inference.

This \"AI Penalization\" effect was robust across (1) different types\nof work (e.g., specific tasks or general work scenarios) and worker statuses\n(e.g., full-time, part-time, or freelance), (2) different forms of compensation\n(e.g., required payments or optional bonuses) and their timing, (3) various\nmethods of eliciting compensation (e.g., slider scale, multiple choice, and\nnumeric entry), and (4) conditions where workers' output quality was held\nconstant, subject to varying inferences, or statistically controlled. Moreover,\nthe effect emerged not only in hypothetical compensation scenarios (Studies\n1-9) but also with real gig workers and real monetary compensation (Studies 10\nand 11). People reduced compensation for workers using AI because they believed\nthese workers deserved less credit than those who did not use AI (Studies 7 and\n8).

AI models segmented structures from\n3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and magnetic resonance images\n(MRI). RNFL thickness was derived from OCT scans and corrected for ocular\nmagnification, was derived from OCT. From MRIs, we extracted: ONT, globe\nproptosis, axial length, and a novel interzygomatic line-to-posterior pole\n(ILPP) distance, a composite marker of globe proptosis and size. GEE models\nassessed associations between orbital and retinal features across all\npopulations.\n  Results: Segmentation models achieved Dice coefficients over 0.94 for both\nMRI and OCT. RNFL thickness was positively correlated with both ONT and ILPP\ndistance (r = 0.065, p < 0.001, and r = 0.206, p < 0.001 respectively). The\nsame was true for glaucoma (r = 0.040, p = 0.74, and r = 0.224, p = 0.059), and\nfor myopia (r = 0.069, p < 0.001, and r = 0.100, p < 0.0001). GEE models\nrevealed straighter optic nerves and shorter ILPP distance as predictive of\nthinner RNFL in all populations.\n  Conclusions: This study emphasizes the impact of ONT, globe size, and\nproptosis on retinal health, suggesting RNFL thinning may arise from\nbiomechanical stress due to straighter optic nerves or reduced ILPP distance,\nparticularly in glaucoma or myopia. The novel ILPP metric, integrating globe\nsize and position, shows potential as a biomarker for axonal health.

    "abstract": "The use of moving averages is pervasive in macroeconomic monitoring,\nparticularly for tracking noisy series such as inflation. The choice of the\nlook-back window is crucial. Too long of a moving average is not timely enough\nwhen faced with rapidly evolving economic conditions. Too narrow averages are\nnoisy, limiting signal extraction capabilities. As is well known, this is a\nbias-variance trade-off. However, it is a time-varying one: the optimal size of\nthe look-back window depends on current macroeconomic conditions. In this\npaper, we introduce a simple adaptive moving average estimator based on a\nRandom Forest using as sole predictor a time trend. Then, we compare the\nnarratives inferred from the new estimator to those derived from common\nalternatives across series such as headline inflation, core inflation, and real\nactivity indicators. Notably, we find that this simple tool provides a\ndifferent account of the post-pandemic inflation acceleration and subsequent\ndeceleration.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems in healthcare have demonstrated\nremarkable potential to improve patient outcomes. However, if not designed with\nfairness in mind, they also carry the risks of perpetuating or exacerbating\nexisting health disparities. Although numerous fairness-enhancing techniques\nhave been proposed, most focus on a single sensitive attribute and neglect the\nbroader impact that optimizing fairness for one attribute may have on the\nfairness of other sensitive attributes. In this work, we introduce a novel\napproach to multi-attribute fairness optimization in healthcare AI, tackling\nfairness concerns across multiple demographic attributes concurrently. Our\nmethod follows a two-phase approach: initially optimizing for predictive\nperformance, followed by fine-tuning to achieve fairness across multiple\nsensitive attributes. We develop our proposed method using two strategies,\nsequential and simultaneous. Our results show a significant reduction in\nEqualized Odds Disparity (EOD) for multiple attributes, while maintaining high\npredictive accuracy. Notably, we demonstrate that single-attribute fairness\nmethods can inadvertently increase disparities in non-targeted attributes\nwhereas simultaneous multi-attribute optimization achieves more balanced\nfairness improvements across all attributes. These findings highlight the\nimportance of comprehensive fairness strategies in healthcare AI and offer\npromising directions for future research in this critical area.",

While Federated Learning (FL) holds\npromise for intrusion detection in FANETs with its cooperative and\ndecentralized model training, it also faces drawbacks such as large data\nrequirements, power consumption, and time constraints. Moreover, the high\nspeeds of nodes in dynamic networks like FANETs may disrupt communication among\nIntrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

Covert\ncommunication refers to reliable communication between a transmitter and a\nreceiver while ensuring a low probability of detection by an adversary, which\nwe refer to as `warden'. It is well known that in a point-to-point DMC, it is\npossible to communicate on the order of $\\sqrt{N}$ bits reliably and covertly\nover $N$ channel uses while the transmitter and the receiver are required to\nshare a secret key on the order of $\\sqrt{N}$ bits.

We derive achievable rates for both the non-causal and causal scenarios\nby using block-Markov encoding and secret key generation from the ADSI, which\nsubsumes the best achievable rates for channels with random states.

This wind can\ninteract with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate\nunderstanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its\neffects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on\nextreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at\nthese wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be\ndifficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby\nregions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear\ndark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues,\nthis work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical\nEUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges\n(ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated\ndirectly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing\nnon-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the\nboundary which identifies the CH boundary. This reduces the presence of\nfilaments while simultaneously allowing the segmentation to include CH regions\nthat may be difficult to identify due to the aforementioned inconsistent\nintensities.",

Indeed, it proves more costly to find good\napproximations for $p=3$ than for SK, even for our heuristic. Compared to SK,\nthe ground-state behavior for $p=3$ is quite distinct also in other ways. For\nSK, finite-size corrections for large system sizes $N\\to\\infty$ of both, the\nensemble average over ground state energy densities and the width of their\ndistribution, vary anomalously with non-integer exponents. In the $p=3$ case\nhere, the energy density and its distribution appear to scale with $\\ln N/N$\nand $1/N$ corrections, respectively. The distribution itself is consistent with\na Gumbel form. Even more stark is the contrast for the bond-diluted case, where\nSK has shown previously a notable variation of the anomalous corrections\nexponent with the bond density, while for $p=3$ no such variation is found\nhere. Hence, for the 3-spin model, all measured corrections scale the same as\nfor the random energy model (REM), corresponding to $p=\\infty$. This would\nsuggest that all $p$-spin models with $p\\geq3$ exhibit the same ground-state\ncorrections as in REM.",

    "abstract": "Assembly bias is the variation in the clustering of dark matter halos and\ngalaxies that arises from correlations between the halo assembly history and\nthe large-scale environment at fixed halo mass. In this work, we use the\ncosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulation TNG300 to investigate how\nassembly bias affects the environment-dependent galaxy luminosity function. We\nmeasure the luminosity functions in bins of large-scale environment for the\noriginal simulated galaxy sample and for a shuffled sample, where the galaxies\nare randomly reassigned among halos of similar mass to remove assembly bias. By\ncomparing them, we find distinct signatures, showing variations in the number\nof galaxies at the $\\sim10\\%$ level across all luminosities. Assembly bias\nincreases the tendency of galaxies to reside in denser environments and further\ndilutes underdense regions, beyond the trends governed by halo mass. When\nseparating by color, we see that assembly bias has a much bigger effect on red\ngalaxies fainter than $\\mathrm{M_r} - 5 \\log{h} = -18.5$, which accounts for a\n$\\sim20\\%$ increase in the number of galaxies in the densest environment and a\nremarkable $50\\%$ decrease in the least dense regions. The ratio of these\nmeasurements for the densest and least dense regions provides a significant\nassembly bias signal for the faint red galaxies, larger than a factor of two.\nOverall, our results provide a novel sensitive measure of assembly bias,\noffering valuable insight for modeling the effect and a potential new route to\ndetect it in observations.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a robot action planning scheme that provides an efficient\nand probabilistically safe plan for a robot interacting with an unconcerned\nhuman -- someone who is either unaware of the robot's presence or unwilling to\nengage in ensuring safety. The proposed scheme is predictive, meaning that the\nrobot is required to predict human actions over a finite future horizon; such\npredictions are often inaccurate in real-world scenarios. One possible approach\nto reduce the uncertainties is to provide the robot with the capability of\nreasoning about the human's awareness of potential dangers. This paper\ndiscusses that by using a binary variable, so-called danger awareness\ncoefficient, it is possible to differentiate between concerned and unconcerned\nhumans, and provides a learning algorithm to determine this coefficient by\nobserving human actions. Moreover, this paper argues how humans rely on\npredictions of other agents' future actions (including those of robots in\nhuman-robot interaction) in their decision-making. It also shows that ignoring\nthis aspect in predicting human's future actions can significantly degrade the\nefficiency of the interaction, causing agents to deviate from their optimal\npaths. The proposed robot action planning scheme is verified and validated via\nextensive simulation and experimental studies on a LoCoBot WidowX-250.",

To avoid relying on specialized bilevel solvers, our\nmethod exploits the fact that the signed distance is the minimal point of a\nconvex region related to the two bodies.

One of the principal challenges in MARL is the need for explicit\nprediction of the agents' behavior to achieve cooperation. To resolve this\nissue, we propose the Shared Recurrent Memory Transformer (SRMT) which extends\nmemory transformers to multi-agent settings by pooling and globally\nbroadcasting individual working memories, enabling agents to exchange\ninformation implicitly and coordinate their actions. We evaluate SRMT on the\nPartially Observable Multi-Agent Pathfinding problem in a toy Bottleneck\nnavigation task that requires agents to pass through a narrow corridor and on a\nPOGEMA benchmark set of tasks. In the Bottleneck task, SRMT consistently\noutperforms a variety of reinforcement learning baselines, especially under\nsparse rewards, and generalizes effectively to longer corridors than those seen\nduring training. On POGEMA maps, including Mazes, Random, and MovingAI, SRMT is\ncompetitive with recent MARL, hybrid, and planning-based algorithms. These\nresults suggest that incorporating shared recurrent memory into the\ntransformer-based architectures can enhance coordination in decentralized\nmulti-agent systems.

However, existing prompt-based and Low-Rank\nAdaptation-based (LoRA-based) methods often require expanding a prompt/LoRA\npool or retaining samples of previous tasks, which poses significant\nscalability challenges as the number of tasks grows. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Scalable Decoupled LoRA (SD-LoRA) for class incremental\nlearning, which continually separates the learning of the magnitude and\ndirection of LoRA components without rehearsal. Our empirical and theoretical\nanalysis reveals that SD-LoRA tends to follow a low-loss trajectory and\nconverges to an overlapping low-loss region for all learned tasks, resulting in\nan excellent stability-plasticity trade-off. Building upon these insights, we\nintroduce two variants of SD-LoRA with further improved parameter efficiency.\nAll parameters of SD-LoRAs can be end-to-end optimized for CL objectives.\nMeanwhile, they support efficient inference by allowing direct evaluation with\nthe finally trained model, obviating the need for component selection.\nExtensive experiments across multiple CL benchmarks and foundation models\nconsistently validate the effectiveness of SD-LoRA.

Our\nresults demonstrate that many of the augmentations commonly used for tasks on\nnatural images are also effective on ultrasound images, even more so than\naugmentations developed specifically for ultrasound images in some cases. We\nalso show that diverse augmentation using TrivialAugment, which is widely used\nfor natural images, is also effective for ultrasound images. Moreover, our\nproposed methodology represents a structured approach for assessing various\ndata augmentations that can be applied to other contexts and modalities.",

This problem naturally\narises in many engineering problems.\n  The main technical challenge is to develop a sequential testing scheme that\nadapts its sample size to the unknown alternative. Indeed, if we knew the\nalternative distribution (that is, the transition matrix) $Q$, a natural\napproach would be to use a generalization of Wald's sequential probability\nratio test (SPRT).

To trigger explosions in 1D, various\nnumerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the\ncomplex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the\ncompact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the\ntwo most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in\ncomparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the\nP-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and\nevolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific\nexplosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we\nemploy widely-used (\"classic\") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the\nstandard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably\nselected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as\n\"special trajectories.\" Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a\nfactor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor\nthermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion\nenergies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the\nproblem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which\ndiminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the\nspecial trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however,\nmake the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an updated framework for studying the ionizing conditions\nand elemental abundances of photoionized, metal-enriched quasar absorption\nsystems. The standard assumption of ionization equilibrium invoked in\nabsorption line analyses requires gas to cool on longer timescales than ionic\nrecombination (t_cool >> t_rec). However, this assumption may not be valid at\nhigh metallicities due to enhanced cooling losses. This work presents a suite\nof time-dependent photoionization (TDP) models that self-consistently solve for\nthe ionization state of rapidly cooling gas irradiated by the extragalactic\nultraviolet background (UVB). The updated framework explores various revised\nUVBs from recent studies, a range of initial temperatures, and different\nelemental abundance patterns to quantify the effects of TDP on the observed ion\nfractions. A metal-enriched ($\\mathrm{[\\alpha/H]}=0.6_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$) C IV\nabsorption system at z ~ 1 previously studied using photoionization equilibrium\n(PIE) models is re-examined under the TDP framework. The main findings are as\nfollows: (1) varying prescriptions for the underlying UVB or adopting initial\ntemperatures T_0 < 1e6 K (with the starting ionization state in collisional\nequilibrium) change TDP ion fractions by up to a factor of three and ten\nrespectively, but the adopted relative elemental abundance pattern affects ion\nfractions by at most 40%; (2) the inferred gas densities are consistent between\nPIE and TDP, but under TDP solar metallicity cannot be ruled out at more than\n2-$\\sigma$ significance and a non-solar [C/$\\alpha$]$\\approx 0.25$ is robustly\nconstrained from the observed relative ion abundances. Extending the TDP\nanalyses to a larger sample of super-solar absorption components with high\nsignal-to-noise absorption spectra is needed to quantify the fraction of metal\nabsorbers originating in rapid cooling gas.",

For instance, it has been\nshown that planet-planet scattering can reproduce the eccentricity distribution\nof exoplanets. It can also contribute to the current census of free floating\nplanets. In this work we run an ensemble of N-body simulations of planetary\nsystems, and record the properties of planets which are ejected from the\nsystem. In our simulations we sample a wide range of orbital and physical\nproperties of the planets. We find that in general $40-80\\%$ of the planets are\nejected from the system depending on the number of planets initially in the\nsystem. Most of the planets are ejected over a timescale of $\\sim 10^8-10^9$\nyears. The ejected planets have a mean excess velocity in the range of 2-6\nkm/sec with respect to the host star. The excess velocities of the planets\nejected from the system strongly depends on the semi-major axis of the inner\nmost planet. We find that irrespective of their initial location in the\nplanetary system, all planets are equally likely to be ejected from the system.\nAlso, bound and ejected planets have distinct mass distributions, with bound\nplanets being more massive than ejected planets. In addition, increasing the\nradii of the planets reduces the ejection fraction. The properties of the\nejected planets do not strongly depend on the initial spacing between the\nplanets. The timescale over which ejections happen does increase with the\ninitial separation between the planets. We also find that the ejection fraction\ndoes not strongly depend on the distance from the host star beyond which the\nplanets are considered unbound. Finally, we compared our results with observed\npopulations of free floating planets. We conclude that on average 5-10 planets\nshould form around each star to reproduce the observations.",

We also observed a critical\nfrequency at $\\sim$ 2.31 Hz, above which the behavior of the Q-factor of the\nQPO changed significantly with the QPO frequency. We further identified two\nevents characterized by a surge in the total flux, corresponding to the\ndisappearance of type-C QPOs. Although the first event appeared like an X-ray\nflare, during the second event, the source reached a state with a total flux\nhigher than 10$^{-8}$ erg/cm$^{2}$/s and exhibited a different type of QPO with\nlower frequencies and weaker amplitudes. We compare our results with the\npreviously reported QPO characteristics for black hole outbursts and discuss\nthe various models that could interpret the critical frequency and potentially\nexplain the origin and evolution of these type-C QPOs.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the emergence of chaos in many-body quantum systems away from\nsemi-classical limits, particularly in spatially local interacting spin\nHamiltonians, has been a long-standing problem. In these intrinsically quantum\nregimes, quantum chaos has been primarily understood through the correspondence\nbetween the eigensystem statistics of midspectrum eigenstates and the universal\nstatistics described by random matrix theory (RMT). However, this\ncorrespondence no longer holds for finite-temperature eigenstates. Here we show\nthat the statistical properties of finite-temperature eigenstates of quantum\nchaotic Hamiltonians can be accurately described by pure random states\nconstrained by a local charge, with the average charge density of the\nconstrained random state ensemble playing the same role as the average energy\ndensity of the eigenstates. By properly normalizing the energy density using a\nsingle Hamiltonian-dependent parameter that quantifies the typical energy per\ndegree of freedom, we find excellent agreement between the entanglement entropy\nstatistics of eigenstates and that of constrained random states. Interestingly,\nin small pockets of Hamiltonian parameter phase space which we previously\nidentified as `maximally chaotic' [PRX 14, 031014 (2024)], we find excellent\nagreement not only at the level of the first moment, including O(1)\ncorrections, but also at the level of statistical fluctuations. These results\nshow that notions of maximal chaos -- in terms of how much randomness\neigenstates contain -- can still be defined at finite temperature in physical\nHamiltonian models away from semi-classical and large-$N$ limits.",

We present axisymmetric time-dependent radiation transport\nsimulations of dust-shrouded transients with \\texttt{Athena++} and tabulated\ngray opacities, which predict the light-curves of the dust-reprocessed infrared\n(IR) radiation. The luminosity and timescale of the IR light-curve depends on\nwhether the transient rises rapidly or slowly compared to the light\ncrossing-time of the photosphere, $t_{\\rm lc}$. For slow-rising transients\n($t_{\\rm rise} \\gg t_{\\rm lc}$) such as SNe, the reprocessed IR radiation\ndiffuses outwards through the dust shell faster than the sublimation front\nexpands; the IR light-curve therefore begins rising prior to the escape of\nUV/optical light, but peaks on a timescale $\\sim t_{\\rm rise}$ shorter than the\ntransient duration. By contrast, for fast-rising transients ($t_{\\rm rise} \\ll\nt_{\\rm lc}$) such as FBOTs and some TDEs, the finite light-travel time results\nin the reprocessed radiation arriving as an ``echo'' lasting much longer than\nthe transient itself (despite the dust photosphere having already being\ndestroyed by peak light). We explore the effects of the system geometry by\nconsidering a torus-shaped distribution of dust. The IR light-curves seen by\nobservers in the equatorial plane of the torus resemble those for a spherical\ndust shell, while polar observers see faster-rising, brighter and shorter-lived\nemission.

Executing a quantum program\nrequires the compilation of its quantum circuit for a target Quantum Processing\nUnit (QPU). Various methods for qubit mapping, gate synthesis, and optimization\nof quantum circuits have been proposed and implemented in compilers. These\ncompilers try to generate a quantum circuit that leads to the best execution\nquality - a criterion that is usually approximated by figures of merit such as\nthe number of (two-qubit) gates, the circuit depth, expected fidelity, or\nestimated success probability. However, it is often unclear how well these\nfigures of merit represent the actual execution quality on a QPU.

    "abstract": "For most galaxies in the cosmos, our knowledge of their motion is limited to\nline-of-sight velocities from redshift observations. To determine the radial\nvelocity between two galaxies the minor and major infall models were\nestablished by Karachentsev & Kashibadze (2006). Regardless of the background\ncosmology, our derivations reveal that these infall models approximate the\ntotal radial velocity between two galaxies by two different projections\nemploying different information about the system. For galaxies having small\nangular separations $\\theta$, all infall models agree that the radial velocity\nis the difference of their line-of-sight components. Applying these models to\nca. $500$ halos of the Illustris-3 simulation, we find the perpendicular and\ntangential velocity parts to be non-negligible for more than 90% of all, more\nthan 5000 infalling subhalos. Thus, even for $\\theta < 10$ deg, the\ninfall-model velocities deviate from the true radial velocity. Only for 30% we\nfound the true one lay between the minor and major infall velocity. However,\nthe infall models yield robust upper and lower bounds to the true radial\nvelocity dispersion. Observed under $\\theta < 10$ deg the velocity dispersion\ninferred from the sole difference of line-of-sight velocity components even\ncoincides with the true one, justifying this approach for high-redshift groups\nand clusters. Based on these findings, we predict the radial velocity\ndispersion of the M81-group from the minor infall model (upper bound)\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{r,min}} = (180 \\pm 42)~\\mbox{km}/\\mbox{s}$, from the major\ninfall model (lower bound) $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{r,maj}} = (142 \\pm 64)\n~\\mbox{km}/\\mbox{s}$ and $\\sigma_\\mathrm{r,\\Delta v} = (99 \\pm\n36)~\\mbox{km}/\\mbox{s}$ from the line-of-sight-velocity difference.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel leptogenesis scenario utilising the two-body decay of\nheavy right handed neutrino (RHN) via the electromagnetic dipole operator.\nWhile the requirement of the standard model (SM) gauge invariance requires such\ndipole operator only at dimension-6 forcing the generation of non-zero CP\nasymmetry from three-body decay with two-loop corrections, we write down\ndimension-5 dipole operators involving heavy RHN $N_R$ and its lighter\ncounterpart $\\nu_R$. This allows the generation of lepton asymmetry in $\\nu_R$\nfrom two-body decay of heavy RHN which later gets transferred to left handed\nleptons via sizeable Yukawa coupling with a neutrinophilic Higgs doublet. The\nasymmetry in left handed leptons is then converted to baryon asymmetry via\nelectroweak sphalerons. The lepton number violation by heavy RHN also induces a\none-loop Majorana mass of $\\nu_R$ rendering the light neutrinos to be Majorana\nfermions. While smallness of the Majorana mass of $\\nu_R$ prevents additional\nsources or washout of lepton asymmetry, it also constrains the scale of\nleptogenesis. For $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ TeV scale leptogenesis, this leads to\nadditional sterile neutrinos lighter than a few keV with interesting\nimplications for a variety of observables including neutrino oscillation, warm\ndark matter as well as effective degrees of freedom within reach of future\ncosmic microwave background experiments.

ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future\nfeatures in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen\ndiffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key\nintuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are\nsimilar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower\nburden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly\nflexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block\nfrom the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the\ndiffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero\ninitialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike\nsome prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our\nmodel freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many\nefforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image\nquality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best\ncase results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing\nruntime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong\nperformance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT)\nand text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma. The\nquality of ILF's 1.7x-1.8x speedups are confirmed by FID, CLIP score, CLIP\nImage Quality Assessment, ImageReward, and qualitative comparisons.

The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the\nvision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key\ninsight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text\ndata is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing\nmassive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and\nhigh-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1)\nVision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of\nvariable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly\ntunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data\ncovering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as\ntext-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT\ndata for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for\nvideo understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the\nmodel's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to\nbetter capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is\nadapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding\nnumbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the\nnumber of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the\nrepresentation of videos will be more precise and compact.

For\nthe investigation of this problem, probes that span all over the redshift $z$\nranges are needed. Cepheids are local objects, SNe Ia reached up to $z=2.9$,\nand CMB is observed at $z=1100$. In this context, the use of probes at\nintermediate redshift $z>3$ is auspicious for casting more light on modern\ncosmology.

The monitor chooses the sequence of sensors to observe with the goal\nof minimizing the mean of age of incorrect information (MAoII) by using the\npartial state observations obtained, which have different freshness levels. For\ninstance, a monitor may be interested in tracking the location of an object by\nobtaining observations from two sensors, which observe the $x$ and $y$\ncoordinates of the object separately, in different time slots. The monitor,\nthen, needs to decide which coordinate to observe in the next time slot given\nthe history. In addition to this partial observability of the state of Markov\nprocess, there is an erasure channel with a fixed one-slot delay between each\nsensor and the monitor. First, we obtain a sufficient statistic, namely the\n\\emph{belief}, representing the joint distribution of the age of incorrect\ninformation (AoII) and the current state of the observed process by using the\nhistory of all pull requests and observations.

We assume that we can\nact in the dynamic of the system by a hierarchy of controls. According to the\nformulation given by H. Von Stackelberg \\cite{S}, there are local controls,\ncalled followers and global controls, called leaders. In fact, one considers\nsituations where there are two cost (objective) functions. One possible way is\nto cut the control into two parts, one being thought of as \"the leader\" and the\nother one as \"the follower\". This situation is studied in the paper, with one\nof the cost functions being of the controllability type. Existence and\nuniqueness is proven. The optimality system is given in the paper.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of selecting relay nodes and coordinating\namong them in UAV-assisted Internet-of-Vehicles (IoV). The selection of UAV\nrelay nodes in IoV employs mechanisms executed either at centralized servers or\ndecentralized nodes, which have two main limitations: 1) the traceability of\nthe selection mechanism execution and 2) the coordination among the selected\nUAVs, which is currently offered in a centralized manner and is not coupled\nwith the relay selection. Existing UAV coordination methods often rely on\noptimization methods, which are not adaptable to different environment\ncomplexities, or on centralized deep reinforcement learning, which lacks\nscalability in multi-UAV settings. Overall, there is a need for a comprehensive\nframework where relay selection and coordination are coupled and executed in a\ntransparent and trusted manner. This work proposes a framework empowered by\nreinforcement learning and Blockchain for UAV-assisted IoV networks. It\nconsists of three main components: a two-sided UAV relay selection mechanism\nfor UAV-assisted IoV, a decentralized Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning\n(MDRL) model for autonomous UAV coordination, and a Blockchain implementation\nfor transparency and traceability in the interactions between vehicles and\nUAVs. The relay selection considers the two-sided preferences of vehicles and\nUAVs based on the Quality-of-UAV (QoU) and the Quality-of-Vehicle (QoV). Upon\nselection of relay UAVs, the decentralized coordination between them is enabled\nthrough an MDRL model trained to control their mobility and maintain the\nnetwork coverage and connectivity using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The\nevaluation results demonstrate that the proposed selection and coordination\nmechanisms improve the stability of the selected relays and maximize the\ncoverage and connectivity achieved by the UAVs.",

However, its full potential remains inaccessible to a\nbroader audience due to its complexity, which requires expertise in training\nand designing DRL solutions, high computational capabilities, and sometimes\naccess to pre-trained models. This necessitates the need for hassle-free\nservices that increase the availability of DRL solutions to a variety of users.\nTo enhance the accessibility to DRL services, this paper proposes a novel\nblockchain-based crowdsourced DRL as a Service (DRLaaS) framework. The\nframework provides DRL-related services to users, covering two types of tasks:\nDRL training and model sharing. Through crowdsourcing, users could benefit from\nthe expertise and computational capabilities of workers to train DRL solutions.\nModel sharing could help users gain access to pre-trained models, shared by\nworkers in return for incentives, which can help train new DRL solutions using\nmethods in knowledge transfer. The DRLaaS framework is built on top of a\nConsortium Blockchain to enable traceable and autonomous execution. Smart\nContracts are designed to manage worker and model allocation, which are stored\nusing the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to ensure tamper-proof data\ndistribution.

The success of\ntask-agnostic foundation models (FMs), including multimodal large language\nmodels (LLMs), in addressing similar challenges across natural language,\ncomputer vision, and human speech has generated considerable enthusiasm for and\nexploration of FMs and LLMs as flexible building blocks in CPS-IoT analytics\npipelines, promising to reduce the need for costly task-specific engineering.\n  Nonetheless, a significant gap persists between the current capabilities of\nFMs and LLMs in the CPS-IoT domain and the requirements they must meet to be\nviable for CPS-IoT applications.

To this end, randomized smoothing provides\ntheoretical guarantees for certifying robustness against adversarial\nperturbations. Recently, diffusion models have been successfully employed for\nrandomized smoothing to purify noise-perturbed samples before making\npredictions with a standard classifier. While these methods excel at small\nperturbation radii, they struggle with larger perturbations and incur a\nsignificant computational overhead during inference compared to classical\nmethods. To address this, we reformulate the generative modeling task along the\ndiffusion trajectories in pixel space as a discriminative task in the latent\nspace.

We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets\nand achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal computation budget during\ninference. For example, our method outperforms the certified accuracy of\ndiffusion-based methods on ImageNet across all perturbation radii by 5.3% on\naverage, with up to 11.6% at larger radii, while reducing inference costs by\n85$\\times$ on average.

    "abstract": "Clustering is often a challenging problem because of the inherent ambiguity\nin what the \"correct\" clustering should be. Even when the number of clusters\n$K$ is known, this ambiguity often still exists, particularly when there is\nvariation in density among different clusters, and clusters have multiple\nrelatively separated regions of high density. In this paper we propose an\ninformation-theoretic characterization of when a $K$-clustering is ambiguous,\nand design an algorithm that recovers the clustering whenever it is\nunambiguous. This characterization formalizes the situation when two high\ndensity regions within a cluster are separable enough that they look more like\ntwo distinct clusters than two truly distinct clusters in the $K$-clustering.\nThe algorithm first identifies $K$ partial clusters (or \"seeds\") using a\ndensity-based approach, and then adds unclustered points to the initial $K$\npartial clusters in a greedy manner to form a complete clustering. We implement\nand test a version of the algorithm that is modified to effectively handle\noverlapping clusters, and observe that it requires little parameter selection\nand displays improved performance on many datasets compared to widely used\nalgorithms for non-convex cluster recovery.",

    "abstract": "The min-sum approximation is widely used in the decoding of polar codes.\nAlthough it is a numerical approximation, hardly any penalties are incurred in\npractice. We give a theoretical justification for this. We consider the common\ncase of a binary-input, memoryless, and symmetric channel, decoded using\nsuccessive cancellation and the min-sum approximation. Under mild assumptions,\nwe show the following. For the finite length case, we show how to exactly\ncalculate the error probabilities of all synthetic (bit) channels in time\n$O(N^{1.585})$, where $N$ is the codeword length. This implies a code\nconstruction algorithm with the above complexity. For the asymptotic case, we\ndevelop two rate thresholds, denoted $R_{\\mathrm{L}} = R_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\lambda)$\nand $R_{\\mathrm{U}} =R_{\\mathrm{U}}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda(\\cdot)$ is the\nlabeler of the channel outputs (essentially, a quantizer). For any $0 < \\beta <\n\\frac{1}{2}$ and any code rate $R < R_{\\mathrm{L}}$, there exists a family of\npolar codes with growing lengths such that their rates are at least $R$ and\ntheir error probabilities are at most $2^{-N^\\beta}$. That is, strong\npolarization continues to hold under the min-sum approximation. Conversely, for\ncode rates exceeding $R_{\\mathrm{U}}$, the error probability approaches $1$ as\nthe code-length increases, irrespective of which bits are frozen. We show that\n$0 < R_{\\mathrm{L}} \\leq R_{\\mathrm{U}} \\leq C$, where $C$ is the channel\ncapacity. The last inequality is often strict, in which case the ramification\nof using the min-sum approximation is that we can no longer achieve capacity.",

    "abstract": "Recent observations from JWST have revealed an abundant population of active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) and so-called ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs) at $2\\lesssim z\n\\lesssim 11$, many of which are characterized by V-shaped UV-to-optical\ncontinua with turnovers around the Balmer limit. The physical nature of these\nLRDs is unclear, and it remains debated whether the peculiar spectral shape\noriginates from AGN, compact galaxies, or both. We present the analysis of new\nNIRSpec-IFU data from the BlackTHUNDER JWST Large Programme and archival\nNIRSpec-MSA data of a lensed LRD at $z=7.04$. The spectra confirm the presence\nof a smooth Balmer break and a broad H$\\beta$ tracing the Broad Line Region\n(BLR) of an AGN. The small velocity dispersion of the H$\\beta$ narrow component\nindicates a small dynamical mass of the host galaxy of $M_{\\rm dyn}<4 \\times\n10^8~M_{\\odot}$, which implies that the stellar population cannot contribute\nmore than 10% to the optical continuum. We show that the Balmer break can be\nwell described by an AGN continuum absorbed by very dense ($n_{\\rm H}\\sim\n10^{10}~{\\rm cm^{-3}}$) and nearly dust-free gas along our line-of-sight\n(possibly gas in the BLR or its surrounding). The same gas is expected to\nproduce H$\\beta$ absorption, at a level consistent with a tentative detection\n($3\\sigma$) in the high-resolution spectrum. Such a non-stellar origin of the\nBalmer break may apply to other LRDs, and would alleviate the issue of\nextremely high stellar mass surface densities inferred in the case of a stellar\ninterpretation of the Balmer break. We note that this is a rare case of a black\nhole that is overmassive relative to both the host galaxy stellar and dynamical\nmasses. We finally report indications of variability and the first attempt of\nAGN reverberation mapping at such an early epoch.",

This model belongs to a broader class of models often used in\nthe study of opinion dynamics in financial markets. In the presence of noise,\nthese iterated maps are known to exhibit dynamics which resemble empirically\nobserved behavior of financial markets, such as volatility clustering. Research\nin the recent past has identified attractor bubbling as one of the underlying\nmechanisms that lead to clustering of high volatility events in models of\nopinion dynamics. In this work, we employ the method of bailout embedding to\ncreate an extended, higher-dimensional system of iterated maps where the\nbubbling dynamics is isolated from dynamics in the original lower-dimensional\nspace. The bailout embedding technique also introduces a bailout parameter and\nan associated bailout function which allows us to systematically induce several\nregimes of stability in the opinion dynamics and thus enables us to better\nunderstand the onset of attractor bubbling in this system. We demonstrate the\noccurrence of intermittency in opinion dynamics under appropriate conditions,\nwith the discrete opinion dynamics sharing characteristics of empirically\nobserved financial time series with volatility clustering. Inspired by the\noriginal context under which bailout embeddings were introduced, we propose an\ninterpretation of the bailout function as a measure of investor inertia in the\nmarkets.

    "abstract": "This paper claims that machine learning (ML) largely overlooks an important\nfacet of general intelligence: robustness to a qualitatively unknown future in\nan open world. Such robustness relates to Knightian uncertainty (KU) in\neconomics, i.e. uncertainty that cannot be quantified, which is excluded from\nconsideration in ML's key formalisms. This paper aims to identify this blind\nspot, argue its importance, and catalyze research into addressing it, which we\nbelieve is necessary to create truly robust open-world AI. To help illuminate\nthe blind spot, we contrast one area of ML, reinforcement learning (RL), with\nthe process of biological evolution. Despite staggering ongoing progress, RL\nstill struggles in open-world situations, often failing under unforeseen\nsituations. For example, the idea of zero-shot transferring a self-driving car\npolicy trained only in the US to the UK currently seems exceedingly ambitious.\nIn dramatic contrast, biological evolution routinely produces agents that\nthrive within an open world, sometimes even to situations that are remarkably\nout-of-distribution (e.g. invasive species; or humans, who do undertake such\nzero-shot international driving). Interestingly, evolution achieves such\nrobustness without explicit theory, formalisms, or mathematical gradients. We\nexplore the assumptions underlying RL's typical formalisms, showing how they\nlimit RL's engagement with the unknown unknowns characteristic of an\never-changing complex world. Further, we identify mechanisms through which\nevolutionary processes foster robustness to novel and unpredictable challenges,\nand discuss potential pathways to algorithmically embody them. The conclusion\nis that the intriguing remaining fragility of ML may result from blind spots in\nits formalisms, and that significant gains may result from direct confrontation\nwith the challenge of KU.",

AoE is based on the\ninsight that an expert is aware of its own capacity to effectively process a\ntoken, an awareness reflected in the scale of its internal activations. In AoE,\nrouters are removed; instead, experts pre-compute internal activations for\ninputs and are ranked based on their activation norms. Only the top-ranking\nexperts proceed with the forward pass, while the others abort. The overhead of\npre-computing activations is reduced through a low-rank weight factorization.\nThis self-evaluating-then-partner-comparing approach ensures improved expert\nselection and effective learning. We pre-train language models having 700M up\nto 4B parameters, demonstrating that AoE outperforms traditional MoE models\nwith comparable efficiency.",

    "abstract": "World model based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising\napproach for autonomous driving, which learns a latent dynamics model and uses\nit to train a planning policy. To speed up the learning process, the\npretrain-finetune paradigm is often used, where online RL is initialized by a\npretrained model and a policy learned offline. However, naively performing such\ninitialization in RL may result in dramatic performance degradation during the\nonline interactions in the new task. To tackle this challenge, we first analyze\nthe performance degradation and identify two primary root causes therein: the\nmismatch of the planning policy and the mismatch of the dynamics model, due to\ndistribution shift. We further analyze the effects of these factors on\nperformance degradation during finetuning, and our findings reveal that the\nchoice of finetuning strategies plays a pivotal role in mitigating these\neffects. We then introduce AdaWM, an Adaptive World Model based planning\nmethod, featuring two key steps: (a) mismatch identification, which quantifies\nthe mismatches and informs the finetuning strategy, and (b) alignment-driven\nfinetuning, which selectively updates either the policy or the model as needed\nusing efficient low-rank updates. Extensive experiments on the challenging\nCARLA driving tasks demonstrate that AdaWM significantly improves the\nfinetuning process, resulting in more robust and efficient performance in\nautonomous driving systems.",

Gaining insight into the spatial variation and interactions between\nthese extremes is critical for effective risk management, early warning\nsystems, and informed policy-making. However, challenges such as the rarity of\nextreme events, spatial dependencies, and complex cross-variable interactions\nhinder accurate modeling. We introduce a novel framework for modeling spatial\nextremes, building upon spatial generalized extreme value (GEV) models. Our\napproach incorporates a dimension-reduced latent spatial process to improve\nscalability and flexibility, particularly in capturing asymmetry in\ncross-covariance structures. This Joint Latent Spatial GEV model (JLS-GEV)\novercomes key limitations of existing methods by providing a more flexible\nframework for inter-variable dependencies. In addition to addressing event\nrarity, spatial dependence and cross-variable interactions, JLS-GEV supports\nnonstationary spatial behaviors and independently collected data sources, while\nmaintaining practical fitting times through dimension reduction. We validate\nJLS-GEV through extensive simulation studies, demonstrating its superior\nperformance in capturing spatial extremes compared to baseline modeling\napproaches. Application to real-world data on extreme precipitation and\ntemperature in the southeastern United States highlights its practical utility.\nWhile primarily motivated by environmental challenges, this framework is\nbroadly applicable to interdisciplinary studies of spatial extremes in\ninterdependent natural processes.",

    "abstract": "Tidal interactions in a coalescing binary neutron star (BNS) or neutron\nstar-black hole (NSBH) system driven by gravitational wave (GW) radiation\ncontain precious information about physics both at extreme density and in the\nhighly relativistic regime. In the late inspiral stage, where the tidal effects\nare the strongest, dynamical corrections to the tidal response become\nsignificant. Previous analyses model the finite-frequency correction through\nthe effective Love number approach, which only accounts for the correction in\nthe radial interaction but ignores the lag in the tidal bulge behind the\ncompanion due to the continuous orbital shrinkage. The lag provides a torque,\ncausing the star's spin to change over time. We dub the evolving component of\nthe spin the tidal spin, whose dimensionless value can reach 0.03-0.4 depending\non how rapidly the background star rotates. We present an effective-one-body\n(EOB) waveform model for BNSs and NSBHs incorporating the tidal spin,\nparticularly its back reaction to the orbit due to the Newtonian tidal torque\nand the relativistic orbital hang-up. Beyond the conservative dynamics, we also\nderive the corrections to the dissipative radiation due to finite-frequency\neffects to the first post-Newtonian order. Depending on the star's background\nspin, the phase error in the time-domain waveform due to ignoring the tidal\nspin ranges from 0.3 to 4 radians at the waveform's peak amplitude. The\ndifference in the waveforms with and without the tidal spin remarkably\nresembles the difference between previous effective Love number models and\nnumerical relativity simulations, underscoring the significance of tidal spin\nin the construction of faithful models. Our model further extends the\ndescription of dynamics in the high-background spin regions of the parameter\nspace that are yet to be covered by numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "As computing's societal impact grows, so does the need for computing students\nto recognize and address the ethical and sociotechnical implications of their\nwork. While there are efforts to integrate ethics into computing curricula, we\nlack a standardized tool to measure those efforts, specifically, students'\nattitudes towards ethical reflection and their ability to effect change. This\npaper introduces the novel framework of Critically Conscious Computing and\nreports on the development and content validation of the Critical Reflection\nand Agency in Computing Index, a novel instrument designed to assess\nundergraduate computing students' attitudes towards practicing critically\nconscious computing. The resulting index is a theoretically grounded,\nexpert-reviewed tool to support research and practice in computing ethics\neducation. This enables researchers and educators to gain insights into\nstudents' perspectives, inform the design of targeted ethics interventions, and\nmeasure the effectiveness of computing ethics education initiatives.",

As $J_2$\nincreases, the magnon mode develops incommensurability. The system undergoes a\nfirst-order transition at $J_2 = 0.76 J_1$, and at that point, domain walls\nlead to a continuum of fractional quasi-particles or spinons. By studying small\nvariations in $J_2$ around the transition point, we observe the confinement of\nspinons into bound states in the spectral function and find a smooth evolution\nof the spectrum into magnon modes away from the phase transition. We employ the\nsingle-mode approximation to accurately account for the dispersion of the\nmagnon mode away from the phase transition and describe the associated continua\nand bound states. We extend the single-mode approximation to describe the\ndispersion of a spinon at the phase transition point and obtain its dispersion\nthroughout the Brillouin zone. This allows us to relate the incommensurability\nat and around the transition point to the competition between a negative\nnearest-neighbour hopping amplitude and a positive next-nearest-neighbour one\nfor the domain wall.",

    "abstract": "We present a fast and accurate solution to the perspective $n$-points\nproblem, by way of a new approach to the n=4 case. Our solution hinges on a\nnovel separation of variables: given four 3D points and four corresponding 2D\npoints on the camera canvas, we start by finding another set of 3D points,\nsitting on the rays connecting the camera to the 2D canvas points, so that the\nsix pair-wise distances between these 3D points are as close as possible to the\nsix distances between the original 3D points. This step reduces the perspective\nproblem to an absolute orientation problem, which has a solution via explicit\nformula. To solve the first problem we set coordinates which are as\norientation-free as possible: on the 3D points side our coordinates are the\nsquared distances between the points. On the 2D canvas-points side our\ncoordinates are the dot products of the points after rotating one of them to\nsit on the optical axis. We then derive the solution with the help of a\ncomputer algebra system. Our solution is an order of magnitude faster than\nstate of the art algorithms, while offering similar accuracy under realistic\nnoise. Moreover, our reduction to the absolute orientation problem runs two\norders of magnitude faster than other perspective problem solvers, allowing\nextremely efficient seed rejection when implementing RANSAC.",

We reproduce prior results, showing the WGAN model successfully\ngenerates high-resolution data with summary statistics, including the power\nspectrum and halo mass function, that closely match those of true\nhigh-resolution simulations.

STMDNet designs a\nnovel dual-dynamics-and-correlation mechanism, harnessing ipsilateral\nexcitation to integrate target cues and leakage-enhancing-type contralateral\ninhibition to suppress large-object and background motion interference.\nMoreover, we develop the first collaborative directional encoding-decoding\nstrategy that determines the motion direction from only one correlation per\nspatial location, cutting computational costs to one-eighth of prior methods.\nFurther, simply substituting the backbone of a strong STMD model with STMDNet\nraises AUC by 24%, yielding an enhanced STMDNet-F. Evaluations on real-world\nlow sampling frequency datasets show state-of-the-art results, surpassing the\ndeep learning baseline. Across diverse speeds, STMDNet-F improves mF1 by 19%,\n16%, and 8% at 240Hz, 120Hz, and 60Hz, respectively, while STMDNet achieves 87\nFPS on a single CPU thread.

It is therefore crucial to develop adaptable machine\nlearning models that can be effectively transferred from one environment to\nanother, enabling rapid adaptation using normal operational data. We extended\nthis problem setting to an arbitrary classification task and formulated the\none-class domain adaptation (OC-DA) problem setting. We took a meta-learning\napproach to tackle the challenge of OC-DA, and proposed a task sampling\nstrategy to adapt any bi-level meta-learning algorithm to OC-DA.

We provided a theoretical analysis showing\nthat OC-DA MAML optimizes for meta-parameters that enable rapid one-class\nadaptation across domains. The OC-DA MAML algorithm is evaluated on the\nRainbow-MNIST meta-learning benchmark and on a real-world dataset of\nvibration-based sensor readings.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising representation for\nphotorealistic rendering of 3D scenes. However, its high storage requirements\npose significant challenges for practical applications. We observe that\nGaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics that are analogous to\ntraditional artistic techniques -- Like how artists first sketch outlines\nbefore filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture\nhigh-frequency features like edges and contours; While other Gaussians\nrepresent broader, smoother regions, that are analogous to broader brush\nstrokes that add volume and depth to a painting. Based on this observation, we\npropose a novel hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i)\nSketch Gaussians, which define scene boundaries, and (ii) Patch Gaussians,\nwhich cover smooth regions. Sketch Gaussians are efficiently encoded using\nparametric models, leveraging their geometric coherence, while Patch Gaussians\nundergo optimized pruning, retraining, and vector quantization to maintain\nvolumetric consistency and storage efficiency. Our comprehensive evaluation\nacross diverse indoor and outdoor scenes demonstrates that this structure-aware\napproach achieves up to 32.62% improvement in PSNR, 19.12% in SSIM, and 45.41%\nin LPIPS at equivalent model sizes, and correspondingly, for an indoor scene,\nour model maintains the visual quality with 2.3% of the original model size.",

Motivated by this fact, the main\npurpose of this work is to study causal properties of time series under the\nstructural assumption of a VARMA model with instantaneous effects. First, the\nglobal Markov property is studied, building on existing work for VAR processes\nwithout instantaneous effects. Infinite graphs which represent the dependencies\nof the process are defined so that separation statements translate to\nconditional independencies in the stationary distribution of the process.\nSecond, faithfulness is examined as a counterpart of this Markov property.\nConditions are given so that the stationary distribution of the process is\nalmost surely faithful to said infinite graphs. In addition, an instrumental\nvariable regression framework is developed for VARMA models with instantaneous\neffects. This allows to identify and consistently estimate total causal\neffects.",

We study the eigenmodes\nof a 9-site latent-symmetric photonic network and find that an anti-symmetric\ninput state is fundamentally precluded from populating so-called singlet sites.\nFurthermore, arbitrary extensions of the system at these sites do not break its\nlatent symmetry. Therefore anti-symmetric excitations cannot leave the initial\nsystem, which can be leveraged e.g. for the storage of information. This holds\ntrue for both single-photon states, or classical light, as well as both\ndistinguishable and indistinguishable two-photon quantum states.

In this system, a dual-function base station (BS) communicates\nwith a user equipment (UE) and a sensing receiver (SR) is deployed to collect\necho signals reflected from a target of interest. The BS regularly transmits\nmessages of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) services to the UE. During each\neMBB transmission, if the SR senses the presence of a target of interest, it\nimmediately triggers the transmission of an additional URLLC message. To\nreinforce URLLC transmissions, we propose a dirty-paper coding (DPC)-based\ntechnique that mitigates the interference of both eMBB and sensing signals. For\nthis system, we formulate the rate-reliability-detection trade-off in the\nfinite blocklength regime by evaluating the communication rate of the eMBB\ntransmissions, the reliability of the URLLC transmissions and the probability\nof the target detection. Our numerical analysis show that our proposed\nDPC-based ISAC scheme significantly outperforms power-sharing based ISAC and\ntraditional time-sharing schemes.

    "abstract": "Even though neural networks are being increasingly deployed in\nsafety-critical control applications, it remains difficult to enforce\nconstraints on their output, meaning that it is hard to guarantee safety in\nsuch settings. While many existing methods seek to verify a neural network's\nsatisfaction of safety constraints, few address how to correct an unsafe\nnetwork. The handful of works that extract a training signal from verification\ncannot handle non-convex sets, and are either conservative or slow. To begin\naddressing these challenges, this work proposes a neural network training\nmethod that can encourage the exact image of a non-convex input set for a\nneural network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities to avoid a\nnon-convex unsafe region. This is accomplished by reachability analysis with\nscaled hybrid zonotopes, a modification of the existing hybrid zonotope set\nrepresentation that enables parameterized scaling of non-convex polytopic sets\nwith a differentiable collision check via mixed-integer linear programs\n(MILPs). The proposed method was shown to be effective and fast for networks\nwith up to 240 neurons, with the computational complexity dominated by inverse\noperations on matrices that scale linearly in size with the number of neurons\nand complexity of input and unsafe sets. We demonstrate the practicality of our\nmethod by training a forward-invariant neural network controller for an affine\ndynamical system with a non-convex input set, as well as generating safe\nreach-avoid plans for a black-box dynamical system.",

For the observed Nube's stellar core to be reproduced with\nnon-negative DF, cuspy NFW (Navarro, Frenk, and White) potentials are highly\ndisfavored compared with potentials having cores (Schuster-Plummer or rho-230).\nThe method assumes the stellar system to have spherical symmetry and isotropic\nvelocity distribution, however, we discuss simple extensions that relax the\nneed for isotropy and may help to drop the spherical symmetry assumption.",

Traditional closed peer review systems, while\nessential for quality control, are often slow, costly, and subject to biases\nthat can impede scientific progress. Here, we introduce a method that evaluates\nindividual reviewer reliability by quantifying agreement with community\nconsensus scores and applying Bayesian weighting to refine paper quality\nassessments. We analyze open peer review data from two major scientific\nconferences, and demonstrate that reviewer-specific quality scores\nsignificantly improve the reliability of paper quality estimation. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, we find that reviewer quality scores are unrelated to authorship\nquality. Our model incorporates incentive structures to recognize high-quality\nreviewers and encourage broader coverage of submitted papers, thereby\nmitigating the common \"rich-get-richer\" pitfall of social media. These findings\nsuggest that open peer review, with mechanisms for estimating and incentivizing\nreviewer quality, offers a scalable and equitable alternative for scientific\npublishing, with potential to enhance the speed, fairness, and transparency of\nthe peer review process.",

The vocoder's out-of-distribution performance has a smaller impact.\nAdditionally, we discovered that synthesis artifacts increase spectral\nkurtosis, biasing emotion recognition evaluation towards classifying utterances\nas angry. Therefore, we conclude that reporting unweighted average recall alone\nfor emotion recognition performance is suboptimal.",

More in detail, within the context of a generic Finite Volume (FV)\nsemidiscretization, we consider Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO)\nspatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The\ngoal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we want to demonstrate the\npossibility of utilizing very high order schemes in concrete situations and\nhighlight the related advantages. On the other one, we want to debunk the myth\naccording to which, in the context of numerical resolution of hyperbolic PDEs\nwith very high order spatial discretizations, the adoption of lower order time\ndiscretizations, e.g., strong stability preserving (SSP) or linearly strong\nstability preserving ($\\ell SSP$) Runge--Kutta (RK) schemes, does not affect\nthe overall accuracy of the resulting approach and consequently its\ncomputational efficiency. Numerical results are reported for the linear\nadvection equation (LAE) and for the Euler equations of fluid dynamics, showing\nthe advantages and the critical aspects of the adoption of very high order\nnumerical methods. Overall, the results indicate the potential for their use in\nreal--life applications, offering advantages in terms of efficiency, such as\nrequiring shorter computational times to achieve a prescribed error, even in\nproblems involving discontinuities.

Aiming to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 under the\nEuropean Green Deal, Europe requires an in-depth understanding of the potential\nenergy transition pathways. In this paper, we develop four qualitative\nlong-term scenarios covering the European energy landscape, considering key\nuncertainty pillars -- categorized under social, technological, economic,\npolitical, and geopolitical aspects. First, we place the scenarios in a\nthree-dimensional space defined by Social dynamics, Innovation, and\nGeopolitical instabilities. These scenarios are brought to life by defining\ntheir narratives and focus areas according to their location in this\nthree-dimensional space. The scenarios envision diverse futures and include\ndistinct features. The EU Trinity scenario pictures how internal divisions\namong EU member states, in the context of global geopolitical instability,\naffect the EU climate targets. The REPowerEU++ scenario outlines the steps\nneeded for a self-sufficient, independent European energy system by 2050. The\nGo RES scenario examines the feasibility of achieving carbon neutrality earlier\nthan 2050 given favourable uncertain factors. The NECP Essentials scenario\nextends current national energy and climate plans until 2060 to assess their\nrole in realizing climate neutrality. The scenarios are extended by\nincorporating policies and economic factors and detailed in a Qualitative to\nQuantitative (Q2Q) matrix, linking narratives to quantification. Finally, two\nscenarios are quantified to illustrate the quantification process. All the\nscenarios are in the process of being quantified and will be openly available\nand reusable.",

These sources'\ngamma-ray data is typically degenerate between hadronic and leptonic emission\nscenarios, which hinders their straightforward association with the cosmic ray\npopulation. Here, we aimed to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic\nparticle acceleration scenarios for the PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458,\nassociated with the star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). We first studied the\ndiffuse X-ray emission from Wd 1 to better understand if its origin is of\nthermal or nonthermal nature. In addition, we searched for X-ray synchrotron\nemission from the associated PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458 to put new\nconstraints on the magnetic field strength and the leptonic particle population\nof this source. We used data from eROSITA on board the SRG orbital platform to\nspectrally analyze the diffuse emission from Wd 1 and HESS J1646-458. For Wd 1,\nwe compared a purely thermal model and a model with a thermal and a nonthermal\ncomponent. Next, we analyzed the spectra of four annuli around Wd 1 which\ncoincide with HESS J1646-458 to search for synchrotron radiation. We find that\neROSITA data cannot distinguish between thermal and nonthermal source scenarios\nfor the diffuse emission from Wd 1 itself. In the case of HESS J1646-458, we\nfind no evidence of synchrotron emission. We estimated an upper confidence\nbound of the synchrotron flux up to 40' around Wd 1 of 1.9e-3 keV-1 cm-2 s-1,\nwhich we used to study the spectral energy distribution of the source. From\nthis, we obtained an upper 1 sigma bound on the magnetic field strength of HESS\nJ1646-458 of 7 uG. This is compatible with a previous estimate in the\nliterature for a fully leptonic source scenario. A purely leptonic emission\nscenario, a hadronic, and a hybrid one are compatible with our results.",

The presence of soft UV Lyman Werner (LW)\nbackground radiation can suppress Population III star formation in minihalos\nand allow them to form in pristine atomic cooling halos. In the absence of\nmolecular hydrogen ($\\rm H_2$) cooling, atomic-cooling halos enable rapid\ncollapse with suppressed fragmentation. High background LW fluxes from\npreceding star-formation have been proposed to dissociate $\\rm H_2$. This flux\ncan be supplemented by LW radiation from one or more Population III star(s) in\nthe same halo, reducing the necessary background level. Here we consider\natomic-cooling halos in which multiple protostellar cores form close to one\nanother nearly simultaneously. We assess whether the first star's LW radiation\ncan dissociate nearby $\\rm H_2$, enabling the prompt formation of a second,\nsupermassive star (SMS) from warm, atomically-cooled gas. We use a set of\nhydrodynamical simulations with the code ENZO, with identical LW backgrounds\ncentered on a halo with two adjacent collapsing gas clumps. When an additional\nlarge local LW flux is introduced, we observe immediate reductions in both the\naccretion rates and the stellar masses that form within these clumps. While the\nLW flux reduces the $\\text{H}_2$ fraction and increases the gas temperature,\nthe halo core's potential well is too shallow to promptly heat the gas to\n$\\gtrsim$ 1000 K and increase the accretion rate onto the second protostar.

First, we give a recursive combinatorial derivation of these\n$\\hat{Z}$-invariants using graphs with certain hypercubic structures. Next, we\nconsider such graphs as annotated Loewy diagrams in an abelian category,\nallowing non-split extensions by the ambiguity of embedding of subobjects. If\nsuch an extension has good algebraic group actions, then the above derivation\nof $\\hat{Z}$-invariants in the Grothendieck group of the abelian category can\nbe understood in terms of the theory of shift systems, i.e., Weyl-type\ncharacter formula of the nested Feigin-Tipunin constructions. For the project\nof developing the dictionary between logarithmic CFTs and 3-manifolds, these\ndiscussions give a glimpse of a hypothetical and prototypical, but unified\nconstruction/research method for the former from the new perspective,\nreductions of representation theories by recursive structures.",

To\naddress this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration\nmethod, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world\nunderwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple\ndegradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various\ndegradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This\nmodule enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and\ncollaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature\nrepresentation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to\nenhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise\nwhen handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency\nprior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both\nspatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate\ntask-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of\nimage restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex,\nregion-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information\nderived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling\nthe network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image\nregions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nUniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative\ncomparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.",

Conventional two-equation RANS models (e.g., the $k$-$\\varepsilon$\nmodel) lack a clear criterion for incorporating unstable buoyancy effects in\ntheir scale-determining equations (e.g., $\\varepsilon$-equation). To address\nthis gap, a global correction function is introduced, derived from a\ngeneralized algebraic formulation that incorporates available potential energy\nas an additional parameter. This function reproduces a global similarity law\ncommonly observed in natural convection flows--for instance, the correlation\namong the Nusselt, Rayleigh, and Prandtl numbers, which can be approximately\nexpressed as a single power law over a wide parameter range. A calibration\nmethod is proposed in which an approximate analytical solution for\nRayleigh--B\\'enard convection is obtained via equilibrium analysis, confirming\nthat the proposed model captures similarity relations not addressed by\nconventional one-point closures. Numerical results show significantly improved\nagreement with experimental data, accurately reproducing Nusselt number\ndependencies over broad ranges of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers in unstably\nstratified flows, such as Rayleigh--B\\'enard convection and two types of\ninternally heated convection. The method remains fully compatible with standard\nRANS frameworks and reverts to traditional turbulence treatments in\nshear-driven flows where buoyant effects are negligible. By introducing only a\nsingle, simple, algebraic global function in the conventional\n$\\varepsilon$-equation, this approach significantly enhances the accuracy and\nrobustness of buoyancy-driven turbulence simulations.",

Bayesian optimization has been applied\nsuccessfully in different fields to automate this process. However, when tuning\non hardware, such as in automotive applications, strict safety requirements\noften arise. To obtain safety guarantees, many existing safe Bayesian\noptimization methods rely on assumptions that are hard to verify in practice.\nThis leads to the use of unjustified heuristics in many applications, which\ninvalidates the theoretical safety guarantees. Furthermore, applications often\nrequire multiple safety constraints to be satisfied simultaneously. Building on\nrecently proposed Lipschitz-only safe Bayesian optimization, we develop an\nalgorithm that relies on readily interpretable assumptions and satisfies\nmultiple safety constraints at the same time. We apply this algorithm to the\nproblem of automatically tuning a trajectory-tracking controller of a\nself-driving car. Results both from simulations and an actual test vehicle\nunderline the algorithm's ability to learn tracking controllers without leaving\nthe track or violating any other safety constraints.",

In light of discriminatory algorithmic behaviors, the EU has recently\npassed the AI Act, which mandates specific rules for high-risk systems,\nincorporating both traditional legal non-discrimination regulations and machine\nlearning based algorithmic fairness concepts. This paper aims to bridge these\ntwo different concepts in the AI Act through: First, a necessary high-level\nintroduction of both concepts targeting legal and computer science-oriented\nscholars, and second, an in-depth analysis of the AI Act's relationship between\nlegal non-discrimination regulations and algorithmic fairness. Our analysis\nreveals three key findings: (1.) Most non-discrimination regulations target\nonly high-risk AI systems. (2.) The regulation of high-risk systems encompasses\nboth data input requirements and output monitoring, though these regulations\nare partly inconsistent and raise questions of computational feasibility. (3.)\nFinally, we consider the possible (future) interaction of classical EU\nnon-discrimination law and the AI Act regulations.

    "abstract": "The complexity characteristics of texts written in natural languages are\nsignificantly related to the rules of punctuation. In particular, the distances\nbetween punctuation marks measured by the number of words quite universally\nfollow the family of Weibull distributions known from survival analyses.\nHowever, the values of two parameters marking specific forms of these\ndistributions distinguish specific languages. This is such a strong constraint\nthat the punctuation distributions of texts translated from the original\nlanguage into another adopt quantitative characteristics of the target\nlanguage. All these changes take place within Weibull distributions such that\nthe corresponding hazard functions are always increasing. Recent previous\nresearch shows that James Joyce's famous \"Finnegans Wake\" is subject to such\nextreme distribution from the Weibull family that the corresponding hazard\nfunction is clearly decreasing. At the same time, the distances of sentence\nending punctuation marks, determining the variability of sentence length, have\nan almost perfect multifractal organization, so far to such an extent found\nnowhere else in the literature. In the present contribution based on several\navailable translations (Dutch, French, German, Polish, Russian) of \"Finnegans\nWake\", it is shown that the punctuation characteristics of this work remain\nlargely translation invariant, contrary to the common cases. These observations\nmay constitute further evidence that \"Finnegans Wake\" is a translinguistic work\nin this respect as well, in line with Joyce's original intention.",

    "abstract": "Fixed-node diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) is a widely-trusted\nmany-body method for solving the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation, known for its\nreliable predictions of material and molecular properties. Furthermore, its\nexcellent scalability with system complexity and near-perfect utilization of\ncomputational power makes FN-DMC ideally positioned to leverage new advances in\ncomputing to address increasingly complex scientific problems. Even though the\nmethod is widely used as a computational gold standard, reproducibility across\nthe numerous FN-DMC code implementations has yet to be demonstrated. This\ndifficulty stems from the diverse array of DMC algorithms and trial wave\nfunctions, compounded by the method's inherent stochastic nature. This study\nrepresents a community-wide effort to assess the reproducibility of the method,\naffirming that: Yes, FN-DMC is reproducible (when handled with care). Using the\nwater-methane dimer as the canonical test case, we compare results from eleven\ndifferent FN-DMC codes and show that the approximations to treat the\nnon-locality of pseudopotentials are the primary source of the discrepancies\nbetween them. In particular, we demonstrate that, for the same choice of\ndeterminantal component in the trial wave function, reliable and reproducible\npredictions can be achieved by employing the T-move (TM), the determinant\nlocality approximation (DLA), or the determinant T-move (DTM) schemes, while\nthe older locality approximation (LA) leads to considerable variability in\nresults. These findings demonstrate that, with appropriate choices of\nalgorithmic details, fixed-node DMC is reproducible across diverse community\ncodes-highlighting the maturity and robustness of the method as a tool for open\nand reliable computational science.",

However, existing algorithms' complex design\nand joint optimization make them difficult to train and reduce detection\nefficiency. Additionally, these methods require the number of communities to be\npredefined, making the results susceptible to artificial interference. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective community detection\nalgorithm that can adaptively detect communities without relying on data\naugmentation and contrastive optimization. The proposed algorithm first\nperforms community pre-detection to extract global structural information\nadaptively. It then utilizes GCN to integrate local structures and attribute\nfeatures.

Finally, a\nmodularity maximization method is employed to optimize the communities based on\nthese three types of information, thereby uncovering the community affiliation\nof each node. We conduct experimental comparisons across various graph\ndatasets, evaluating the proposed algorithm against traditional methods and\nstate-of-the-art community detection algorithms.

In the former case single particle interference is\ndestroyed with which-path information while in the latter bunching interference\ntails-off as photons become distinguishable. It has been observed that when\nmore than two particles are involved, these interference patterns are in\ngeneral a non monotonic function of the distinguishability. Here we perform a\ncomprehensive characterization, both theoretically and experimentally, of\nfour-photon interference by analyzing the corresponding correlation functions,\ncontemplating several degrees of distinguishability across different\nparameters. This study provides all the necessary tools to quantify the impact\nof multi-photon interference on precision measurements of parameters such as\nphase, frequency, and time difference. We apply these insights to quantify the\nprecision in the estimation of an interferometric phase in a two-port\ninterferometer using a four-photon state. Our results reveal that, for certain\nphase values, partially distinguishable multi-photon states can achieve higher\nFisher information values compared to the two-photon experiment. These findings\nhighlight the potential of distinguishable multi-photon states for enhanced\nprecision in quantum metrology and related applications.",

    "abstract": "Information and communications technology and technology-enhanced learning\nhave unquestionably transformed traditional teaching-learning processes and are\npositioned as key factors to promote quality education, one of the basic\nsustainable development goals of the 2030 agenda. Document annotation, which\nwas traditionally carried out with pencil and paper and currently benefits from\ndigital document annotation tools, is a representative example of this\ntransformation. Using document annotation tools, students can enrich the\ndocuments with annotations that highlight the most relevant aspects of these\ndocuments. As the conceptual complexity of the learning domain increases, the\nannotation of the documents may require comprehensive domain knowledge and an\nexpert analysis capability that students usually lack. Consequently, a\nproliferation of irrelevant, incorrect, and/or poorly decontextualized\nannotations may appear, while other relevant aspects are completely ignored by\nthe students. The main hypothesis proposed by this paper is that the use of a\nguiding annotation ontology in the annotation activities is a keystone aspect\nto alleviate these shortcomings. Consequently, comprehension is improved,\nexhaustive content analysis is promoted, and meta-reflective thinking is\ndeveloped. To test this hypothesis, we describe our own annotation tool,\n\\@note, which fully implements this ontology-enhanced annotation paradigm, and\nwe provide experimental evidence about how \\@note can improve academic\nperformance via a pilot study concerning critical literary annotation.",

In these scenarios, schedulers must make real-time decisions\nto satisfy both delay and resource constraints without prior knowledge of\nsystem dynamics, which are often time-varying and challenging to estimate.\nCurrent learning-based methods typically require interactions with actual\nsystems during the training stage, which can be difficult or impractical, as it\nis capable of significantly degrading system performance and incurring\nsubstantial service costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\noffline reinforcement learning-based algorithm, named \\underline{S}cheduling By\n\\underline{O}ffline Learning with \\underline{C}ritic Guidance and\n\\underline{D}iffusion Generation (SOCD), to learn efficient scheduling policies\npurely from pre-collected \\emph{offline data}.

By integrating the Lagrangian multiplier optimization into\nthe offline reinforcement learning, SOCD effectively trains high-quality\nconstraint-aware policies exclusively from available datasets, eliminating the\nneed for online interactions with the system.

In some systems parabolic magnetoresistance can rise to hundreds of\nthousands of times its low-temperature, zero-field value. While the origin of\nsuch a dramatic effect remains unresolved, these systems are often\nlow-carrier-density compensated metals, and the physics is expected to be\nquasi-classical. Here we demonstrate that this MR anomaly in temperature also\nexists in high conductivity good metals with large Fermi surfaces, namely Cr,\nMo, and W, for both linear and quadratic field-dependent regimes with their\nnon-saturation attributed to open orbit and electron-hole compensation,\nrespectively. We provide evidence that quantum transport across sharp Fermi\nsurface arcs, but not necessarily the full cyclotron orbit, governs this\nlow-temperature MR anomaly. In Cr, extremely sharp curvatures are induced by\nsuperposed lattice and SDW band structures. One observes an overlay of the\ntemperature dependence of three phenomena: namely, MR at a constant high field,\nlinear MR in the low-field limit, and Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations of\nthe lightest orbit. In Mo, the temperature dependence of low-T MR anomaly\nextends beyond those of its SdH oscillations but disappears at temperatures\nwhere Kohler's scaling reemerges. In the low-temperature and high-field limit,\nlarge magnetoresistance from carriers circling quantum orbits is the\nthree-dimensional analogy to the zero-conductance state of carrier localization\nin the integer quantum Hall effect, especially with regard to the adverse\neffect of disorder.",

This framework is successfully integrated into the\nDigital Catalysis Database (DigCat), enabling efficient screening for 2e- water\noxidation reaction (2e- WOR) catalysts across four material categories (i.e.,\nmetal alloys, metal oxides and perovskites, and single-atom catalysts) within a\nML model.

Excitingly, based on the wACSF descriptors, the ML models\naccurately predict the adsorption free energies of hydroxyl ({\\Delta}GOH*) and\noxygen ({\\Delta}GO*) for such a wide range of catalysts, achieving R2 values of\n0.84 and 0.91, respectively.

    "abstract": "The rise of integer-valued data, partly driven by the Internet of Things\n(IoT), has increased demand for efficient compression methods to reduce storage\nand transmission costs. Existing, speed-oriented methods rely on the\n``smaller-numbers-less-bits'' principle, assuming unimodal distributions\ncentered around zero. This assumption is often violated in practice, leading to\nsuboptimal compression. We propose QuaRs, a transformation that reshapes\narbitrary distributions into unimodal ones centered around zero, improving\ncompatibility with fast integer compression methods. QuaRs remaps data based on\nquantiles, assigning smaller magnitudes to frequent values. The method is fast,\ninvertible, and has sub-quadratic complexity. QuaRs enhances compression\nefficiency, even for challenging distributions, while integrating seamlessly\nwith existing techniques.",

Predicting disease progression with a probabilistic and\ntime-dependent approach might help in suggesting interventions that can delay\nthe progression of the disease. However, extracting informative knowledge from\nirregularly collected longitudinal data is difficult, and missing data pose\nsignificant challenges.

EDSS assesses impairment in eight functional systems (FS).\nFrequently, only the EDSS score assigned by clinicians is reported, while FS\nsub-scores are missing.

This study aimed at i) exploring different methodologies for\nimputing missing FS sub-scores, and ii) predicting the EDSS score using\ncomplete clinical data.

We use this method to study the two\nAtlantic EBUS from CMIP6 models from the HadGEM3-GC3.1 and the CNRM6-CM6\nfamily, for both the historical period and a high-emission future scenario with\nspatial resolutions in the ocean component ranging from 1{\\deg}to 1/12{\\deg}.\nThe two major upwelling regions are divided in subregions depending on their\nseasonality. The vertical transport index shows similar values to a\nwind-derived Ekman index. Directly evaluating upwelling from transport\nprocesses further provides information about the depth of the upwelling, which\nhas previously been identified as an important factor for nutrient\navailability. We show that depending on the subregion of the upwelling system,\ndifferent cell structures can be seen in terms of depth and distance to the\ncoast of maximum velocities. When looking at possible future changes, high\ninterannual variability limits the significance of the trends but could\nindicate a poleward shift of the upwelling regions.A detailed comparison of the\nspatial structures and the distinction in subregions is important to explain\ncontradictory trends in previous works.",

In particular, this concept has been introduced also in the context of\ninterpretability in artificial intelligence, where counterfactuals refer to the\nminimum change to the feature values that changes the prediction of a\nclassification model. The artificial intelligence framework of counterfactuals\nis mostly focused on machine learning approaches, typically neglecting the\nphysics of the variables that determine a change in class. However, a\ntheoretical formulation of counterfactuals in a control system framework -\ni.e., able to account for the mechanisms underlying a change in class - is\nlacking. To fill this gap, in this work we propose an original control system,\nphysics-informed, theoretical foundation for counterfactuals, by means of the\nformulation of an optimal control problem. We apply the proposed methodology to\na general glucose-insulin regulation model and results appear promising and\npave the way to the possible integration with artificial intelligence\ntechniques, with the aim of feeding machine learning models with the physics\nknowledge acquired through the system framework.",

In light of this distinction, we provide an overview of\nrecent achievements and new challenges with a focus on the cardiovascular\nsystem. Attention has shifted from generating a universal model of the human to\neither models of individual humans (digital twins) or entire cohorts of models\nrepresentative of clinical populations to enable in silico clinical trials.\nDisease-specific parameterisation, inter-individual and intra-individual\nvariability, uncertainty quantification as well as interoperable, standardised,\nand quality-controlled data are important issues today, which call for open\ntools, data and metadata standards, as well as strong community interactions.\nThe quantitative, biophysical, and highly controlled approach provided by in\nsilico methods has become an integral part of physiological and medical\nresearch. In silico methods have the potential to accelerate future progress\nalso in the fields of integrated multi-physics modelling, multi-scale models,\nvirtual cohort studies, and machine learning beyond what is feasible today. In\nfact, mechanistic and data-driven modelling can complement each other\nsynergistically and fuel tomorrow's artificial intelligence applications to\nfurther our understanding of physiology and disease mechanisms, to generate new\nhypotheses and assess their plausibility, and thus to contribute to the\nevolution of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches.",

To\naddress this issue, we present FAS (Fast and Secure Federated Learning), a\nnovel approach that strategically combines selective homomorphic encryption,\ndifferential privacy, and bitwise scrambling to achieve robust security without\ncompromising practical usability. Our approach eliminates the need for model\npretraining phases while dynamically protecting high-risk model parameters\nthrough layered encryption and obfuscation.

In\naddition, we eliminated the computational overhead that is required by\ncompetitors such as FedML-HE and MaskCrypt.

We run a large set of relativistic\nhydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of\nthese events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of\nthe dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent,\nwhich is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be\npotentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic\nsystems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric\nbinaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass.\nHyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger\nGW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature\nto identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral\nfeatures are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense\nthat one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific\nthermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical\nmass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in\ncomparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of\ncold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these\nsystems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass\nfor prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\\odot}$ in\ncomparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.",

    "abstract": "Contextual Partitioning introduces an innovative approach to enhancing the\narchitectural design of large-scale computational models through the dynamic\nsegmentation of parameters into context-aware regions. This methodology\nemphasizes the importance of task-specific specialization, achieved through\nadaptive parameter allocation mechanisms that align with the linguistic\nfeatures of input data. Experimental evaluations demonstrated substantial\nimprovements in accuracy, perplexity, and contextual coherence across a variety\nof linguistic tasks, highlighting the adaptability and scalability of the\nproposed framework. By reducing redundancy and enhancing computational\nefficiency, Contextual Partitioning not only streamlines model operations but\nalso expands the scope of applications for advanced language processing\nsystems. The approach operates autonomously, requiring no external fine-tuning,\nthereby addressing a significant limitation in conventional parameter\noptimization techniques. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of\ngradient-driven segmentation, enabling models to dynamically recalibrate and\nspecialize in response to task-specific demands. Furthermore, resource\nutilization metrics reveal notable reductions in memory usage and training\ntimes, confirming the efficiency of the approach. Observations from qualitative\nanalyses illustrate improved contextual coherence and logical flow in generated\noutputs, reinforcing the practical value of this technique.

Both are designed to solve complex\nclassification tasks but from different perspectives. This study demonstrates\nthat CNNs and ViT architectures stem from a unified underlying learning\nmechanism, which quantitatively measures the single-nodal performance (SNP) of\neach node in feedforward (FF) and multi-head attention (MHA) sub-blocks. Each\nnode identifies small clusters of possible output labels, with additional noise\nrepresented as labels outside these clusters. These features are progressively\nsharpened along the transformer encoders, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio.\nThis unified underlying learning mechanism leads to two main findings. First,\nit enables an efficient applied nodal diagonal connection (ANDC) pruning\ntechnique without affecting the accuracy. Second, based on the SNP, spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking occurs among the MHA heads, such that each head focuses its\nattention on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs.\nConsequently, each head becomes an expert in recognizing its designated labels,\nrepresenting a quantitative MHA modus vivendi mechanism. This statistical\nmechanics inspired viewpoint enables to reveal macroscopic behavior of the\nentire network from the microscopic performance of each node. These results are\nbased on a compact convolutional transformer architecture trained on the\nCIFAR-100 and Flowers-102 datasets and call for their extension to other\narchitectures and applications, such as natural language processing.",

Data-intensive underwriting means that insurers\nanalyze more data for estimating the claim cost of a consumer and for\ndetermining the premium based on that estimation. Insurers also offer\nbehavior-based insurance. For example, some car insurers use artificial\nintelligence (AI) to follow the driving behavior of an individual consumer in\nreal-time and decide whether to offer that consumer a discount. In this paper,\nwe report on a survey of the Dutch population (N=999) in which we asked\npeople's opinions about examples of data-intensive underwriting and\nbehavior-based insurance. The main results include: (i) If survey respondents\nfind an insurance practice unfair, they also find the practice unacceptable.\n(ii) Respondents find almost all modern insurance practices that we described\nunfair. (iii) Respondents find practices for which they can influence the\npremium fairer. (iv) If respondents find a certain consumer characteristic\nillogical for basing the premium on, then respondents find using the\ncharacteristic unfair. (v) Respondents find it unfair if an insurer offers an\ninsurance product only to a specific group. (vi) Respondents find it unfair if\nan insurance practice leads to the poor paying more.

Rather than relying on purely numerical rewards,\nTPO translates reward signals into textual critiques and uses them as textual\nrewards to iteratively refine its response. Evaluations on benchmarks covering\ninstruction following, preference alignment, safety, and mathematics reveal\nthat TPO progressively improves alignment with human preferences.

To evaluate our system, we conducted an online\nuser study (N=30) to explore the impact of user control on users' perceptions\nof the ERS in terms of several important user-centric aspects.

    "abstract": "Context. Classical chemically peculiar stars exhibit atmospheres that are\noften structured by the effects of atomic diffusion. As a result of these\nelemental diffusion and horizontal abundance variations, photospheric\ntemperature varies at a given height in the atmosphere. This may lead to\nhorizontal flows in the photosphere. In addition, the suppression of such flows\nby magnetic field can alter the elemental transport processes. Aims. Using a\nsimplified model of such a structured atmosphere and 2D MHD simulations of a\ntypical He-rich star, we examine atmospheric flows in these chemically peculiar\nstars which often are strongly magnetic. Methods. We use Zeus-MP which is a\nFortran 90 based publicly available parallel finite element modular code.\nResults. We find that for non-magnetic stars of spectral type BA, atmospheric\nflow related to horizontal temperature gradient can reach 1.0 km/s yielding\nmixing timescale of order of tens of days. For the magnetic counterparts, the\nflow speeds are an order of magnitude lower allowing for stratification of\nchemical elements. Conclusions. Magnetic field can influence the dynamics in\natmospheres significantly. Strong horizontal magnetic field inhibits flow in\nthe vertical direction, while strong vertical magnetic field can suppress\nhorizontal atmospheric flow preventing elemental mixing.",

Conventional definitions often overlook the interplay between\nclimate variables, biosphere processes, and seasonal anticipation, particularly\nas global climate change disrupts traditional patterns. This study addresses\nthe limitations of current seasonal classification by proposing a framework\nbased on phenological markers such as NDVI, EVI, LAI, fPAR, and the Bowen\nratio, using plants as a nature-based sensor of seasonal transitions.\nIndicators derived from satellite data and ground observations provide robust\nfoundations for defining seasonal boundaries. The normalized daily temperature\nrange (DTRT), validated in crop and orchard regions, is hypothesized as a\nreliable seasonality index to capture transitions. We demonstrated the\nalignment of this index with phenological markers across boreal, temperate, and\ndeciduous forests. Analyzing trends, extreme values and inflection points in\nthe seasonality index time series, we established a methodology to identify\nseasonal onset, duration, and transitions. This universal, scalable\nclassification aligns with current knowledge and perception of seasonal shifts\nand captures site-specific timing. Findings reveal shifts in the\nEuro-Mediterranean region, with winters shortening, summers extending, and\ntransitions becoming more pronounced. Effects include the Gulf Stream s\ninfluence on milder transitions, urban heat islands accelerating seasonal\nshifts, and large inland lakes moderating durations.

However, both methods\nface fundamental limitations, such as limited Q-factor and near-field\nenhancement control and the inability to achieve resonance on/off switching by\ncompletely coupling and decoupling the mode from the far-field. Here, we\ndemonstrate temporal symmetry-breaking in metasurfaces via ultrafast optical\npumping, marking the first experimental realization of radiative loss-driven\nresonance creation, annihilation, broadening, and sharpening.

It turns out that these two\nnotions are in general incomparable. Moreover, the weak simpliciality is not\naffected by renorming the target space $E$, while vector simpliciality may be\naffected. Further, if $H$ contains constants, vector simpliciality is strictly\nstronger and admits several characterizations (partially analogous to the\ncharacterizations known in the scalar case).

    "abstract": "The emergence of exceptional points in non-Hermitian systems represents an\nintriguing phenomenon characterized by the coalescence of eigenenergies and\neigenstates. When a system approaches an exceptional point, it exhibits a\nheightened sensitivity to perturbations compared to the conventional band\ndegeneracy observed in Hermitian systems. This sensitivity, manifested in the\nsplitting of the eigenenergies, is amplified as the order of the exceptional\npoint increases. Infernal points constitute a unique subclass of exceptional\npoints, distinguished by their order escalating with the expansion of the\nsystem's size. In this paper, we show that, when a non-Hermitian system is at\nan infernal point, a perturbation of strength $\\epsilon$, which couples the two\nopposing boundaries of the system, causes the eigenenergies to split according\nto the law $\\sqrt[k]{\\epsilon}$, where $k$ is an integer proportional to the\nsystem's size. Utilizing the perturbation theory of Jordan matrices, we\ndemonstrate that the exceptional sensitivity of the eigenenergies at infernal\npoints to boundary-coupling perturbations is a ubiquitous phenomenon,\nirrespective of the specific form of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Notably,\nwe find that this phenomenon remains robust even when the system deviates\nsubstantially from the infernal point. The universal nature and robustness of\nthis phenomenon suggest potential applications in enhancing sensor sensitivity.",

In this context, textured surfaces impregnated with a liquid\nlubricant show promise due to their ability to sustain a liquid-liquid layer\nthat induces slippage. However, theoretical and numerical studies suggest that\nthe slippage can be compromised by surfactants in the overlying fluid, which\ncontaminate the liquid-liquid interface and generate Marangoni stresses. In\nthis study, we use Doppler-optical coherence tomography, an interferometric\nimaging technique, combined with numerical simulations to investigate how\nsurfactants influence the slip length of lubricant-infused surfaces with\nlongitudinal grooves in a laminar flow. We introduce surfactants by adding\ntracer particles (milk) to the working fluid (water). Local measurements of\nslip length at the liquid-liquid interface are significantly smaller than\ntheoretical predictions for clean interfaces (Sch\\\"onecker & Hardt 2013). In\ncontrast, measurements are in good agreement with numerical simulations of\nfully immobilized interfaces, indicating that milk particles adsorbed at the\ninterface are responsible for the reduction in slippage. This work provides the\nfirst experimental evidence that liquid-liquid interfaces within textured\nsurfaces can become immobilized in the presence of surfactants and flow.",

The\nhypothesis of temporal nonlocality has received recent support in the\nliterature, and its existence would likely influence the future development of\nphysical theories. This paper shows how Adlam's principle of temporal locality\ncan be violated within a protocol involving indefinite causal orders. While the\nderivations of Leggett-Garg inequalities or the temporal CHSH inequality are\nsaid to involve problematic assumptions preventing a targeted probing of a\nwell-defined notion of temporal nonlocality, the present test is free from such\nworries. However, it is shown that the test, in its current formulation, fails\nto be fully model-independent. We provide several considerations regarding the\nphysicality of ICOs that could help alleviate this drawback. In the present\nwork, a specific physical interpretation of ICOs in terms of retrocausal\ninfluences would explain the presence of temporally nonlocal correlations. It\nis argued that, as the physical underpinnings of temporal nonlocality might\nalso account for standard Bell nonlocality, focusing on the former as a\nconsequence of ICOs might support under-explored strategies to make sense of\nthe latter.",

Extensive experiments were conducted on five challenging crack datasets\nincluding CFD, CrackTree200, DeepCrack, GAPs384, and Rissbilder. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposed CrossDiff model achieves impressive performance,\noutperforming other state-of-the-art methods by 8.0% in terms of both Dice\nscore and IoU. The code will be open-source soon.",

Consequently, this paper adopts the Monte Carlo simulation method\n(MCS) to solve the fading-free impulse response of the joint\nreflection-scattering channel. Furthermore, a weighted double gamma function\n(WDGF) is proposed to characterize the channel impulse response (CIR). Based on\nthe closed CIR model, the average bit error rate and the performance of the\ninterruption probability of the UWOC system under turbulence are analyzed.

    "abstract": "Representation learning on heterogeneous text-rich networks (HTRNs), which\nconsist of multiple types of nodes and edges with each node associated with\ntextual information, is essential for various real-world applications. Given\nthe success of pretrained language models (PLMs) in processing text data,\nrecent efforts have focused on integrating PLMs into HTRN representation\nlearning. These methods typically handle textual and structural information\nseparately, using both PLMs and heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs).\nHowever, this separation fails to capture the critical interactions between\nthese two types of information within HTRNs. Additionally, it necessitates an\nextra alignment step, which is challenging due to the fundamental differences\nbetween distinct embedding spaces generated by PLMs and HGNNs. To deal with it,\nwe propose HierPromptLM, a novel pure PLM-based framework that seamlessly\nmodels both text data and graph structures without the need for separate\nprocessing. Firstly, we develop a Hierarchical Prompt module that employs\nprompt learning to integrate text data and heterogeneous graph structures at\nboth the node and edge levels, within a unified textual space. Building upon\nthis foundation, we further introduce two innovative HTRN-tailored pretraining\ntasks to fine-tune PLMs for representation learning by emphasizing the inherent\nheterogeneity and interactions between textual and structural information\nwithin HTRNs. Extensive experiments on two real-world HTRN datasets demonstrate\nHierPromptLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant\nimprovements of up to 6.08% for node classification and 10.84% for link\nprediction.",

By leveraging the\ndiscrete derivative and Taylor expansion, the problem is formulated in a way\nthat enables the application of both methods, allowing for flexible, efficient\nsolutions.

The proposed\nmethods are evaluated by using numerical examples, including both linear and\nnonlinear parameter models, and compare the results to the well-known Nonlinear\nLeast Squares (NLS) method. While NR converges rapidly to the optimal solution,\nGD demonstrates robustness in handling chaotic systems, though it may\noccasionally lead to suboptimal results. Overall, the proposed methods provide\nimproved accuracy in parameter estimation for ODE systems, outperforming NLS in\nterms of error metrics such as bias, mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute\npercentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of\ndetermination R2.

    "abstract": "One of the most interesting problems in the theory of Birkhoff billiards is\nthe problem of integrability. In all known examples of integrable billiards,\nthe billiard tables are either conics, quadrics (closed ellipsoids as well as\nunclosed quadrics like paraboloids or cones), or specific configurations of\nconics or quadrics. This leads to the natural question: are there other\nintegrable billiards? The Birkhoff conjecture states that if the billiard\ninside a convex, smooth, closed curve is integrable, then the curve is an\nellipse or a circle.\n  In this paper we study the Birkhoff billiard inside a cone in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\nWe prove that the billiard always admits a first integral of degree two in the\ncomponents of the velocity vector. Using this fact, we prove that every\ntrajectory inside a $C^3$ convex cone has a finite number of reflections. Here,\nby $C^3$ convex cone, we mean a cone whose section with some hyperplane is a\nstrictly convex closed $C^3$ submanifold of the hyperplane with nondegenerate\nsecond fundamental form. The main result of this paper is the following. We\nprove that the Birkhoff billiard inside a convex $C^3$ cone is integrable. This\nis the first example of an integrable billiard where the billiard table is\nneither a quadric nor composed of pieces of quadrics.",

However, missing MR modalities pose significant challenges for\ntasks like brain tumor segmentation, especially in deep learning-based\nsegmentation, as each modality provides complementary information crucial for\nimproving accuracy. A promising solution is missing data imputation, where\nabsent modalities are generated from available ones. While generative models\nhave been widely used for this purpose, most state-of-the-art approaches are\nlimited to single or dual target translations, lacking the adaptability to\ngenerate missing modalities based on varying input configurations. To address\nthis, we propose an Adaptive Multi-Modality Diffusion Network (AMM-Diff), a\nnovel diffusion-based generative model capable of handling any number of input\nmodalities and generating the missing ones. We designed an Image-Frequency\nFusion Network (IFFN) that learns a unified feature representation through a\nself-supervised pretext task across the full input modalities and their\nselected high-frequency Fourier components. The proposed diffusion model\nleverages this representation, encapsulating prior knowledge of the complete\nmodalities, and combines it with an adaptive reconstruction strategy to achieve\nmissing modality completion.

The capabilities of transformer\nnetworks have led to notable progress in several activities related to vision.\nIn this paper, we thoroughly examine transformer models, emphasizing the\ncritical role that attention mechanisms play. The proposed model uses a\ntransformer encoder-decoder architecture to create textual captions and a deep\nlearning convolutional neural network to extract features from the images.

    "abstract": "The damping of built-up structures stems largely from the microscopic dry\nfrictional interactions in the contact interfaces. The accurate prediction of\nfriction damping has been an important scientific aim of the past several\ndecades. Recent research indicates that very good agreement with vibration\nmeasurements is to be expected if the actual contact surface topography is\nsufficiently well known and finely resolved, and frictional-unilateral\ninteractions are modeled in terms of the Coulomb-Signorini conditions.\nResolving all relevant length scales in one finite element model leads to\nenormous or even prohibitive computation effort and regularization of the\nset-valued contact laws might be needed to ensure numerical stability. In this\nwork, we propose a multi-scale approach: The stress and deformation field in\nthe contact region is modeled using elastic half-space theory, implemented on a\nregular and fine grid of boundary elements (BE), so that the compliance matrix\ncan be expressed in closed form. The vibration behavior of the remaining region\nis described using a relatively coarse finite element (FE) model, which is\nfurther reduced via component mode synthesis. The two models are coupled by\nenforcing compatibility and equilibrium conditions in the far field. The\nset-valued Coulomb-Signorini conditions are enforced robustly and efficiently\nusing a projected over-relaxation scheme in conjunction with an appropriate\nactive-set strategy. For the S4 beam benchmark, very good agreement with regard\nto the amplitude-dependent frequency and damping ratio of the first few modes\nis achieved, while the computation effort is reduced by several orders of\nmagnitude compared to the full-FE reference. The proposed multi-scale method\npermits a very fine resolution of the contact surface topography without\nsuffering from numerical instability.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel approach for dynamic load balancing in\nSoftware-Defined Networks (SDNs) using a Transformer-based Deep Q-Network\n(DQN). Traditional load balancing mechanisms, such as Round Robin (RR) and\nWeighted Round Robin (WRR), are static and often struggle to adapt to\nfluctuating traffic conditions, leading to inefficiencies in network\nperformance. In contrast, SDNs offer centralized control and flexibility,\nproviding an ideal platform for implementing machine learning-driven\noptimization strategies. The core of this research combines a Temporal Fusion\nTransformer (TFT) for accurate traffic prediction with a DQN model to perform\nreal-time dynamic load balancing. The TFT model predicts future traffic loads,\nwhich the DQN uses as input, allowing it to make intelligent routing decisions\nthat optimize throughput, minimize latency, and reduce packet loss. The\nproposed model was tested against RR and WRR in simulated environments with\nvarying data rates, and the results demonstrate significant improvements in\nnetwork performance. For the 500MB data rate, the DQN model achieved an average\nthroughput of 0.275 compared to 0.202 and 0.205 for RR and WRR, respectively.\nAdditionally, the DQN recorded lower average latency and packet loss. In the\n1000MB simulation, the DQN model outperformed the traditional methods in\nthroughput, latency, and packet loss, reinforcing its effectiveness in managing\nnetwork loads dynamically. This research presents an important step towards\nenhancing network performance through the integration of machine learning\nmodels within SDNs, potentially paving the way for more adaptive, intelligent\nnetwork management systems.",

The essence of recommender systems lies in their ability to predict\nusers' ratings or preferences for various items and subsequently recommend the\nmost relevant ones based on historical interaction data and publicly available\ninformation. With the advent of diverse multimedia services, including text,\nimages, video, and audio, humans can perceive the world through multiple\nmodalities.

Multimodal Recommender Systems (MRS) not only capture implicit\ninteraction information across multiple modalities but also have the potential\nto uncover hidden relationships between these modalities. The primary objective\nof this survey is to comprehensively review recent research advancements in MRS\nand to analyze the models from a technical perspective. Specifically, we aim to\nsummarize the general process and main challenges of MRS from a technical\nperspective. We then introduce the existing MRS models by categorizing them\ninto four key areas: Feature Extraction, Encoder, Multimodal Fusion, and Loss\nFunction.

While recent advances in computer vision (CV) have enabled DNN-based\nmodels to accurately estimate optical flow in naturalistic images, a\nsignificant disparity remains between CV models and the biological visual\nsystem in both architecture and behavior. This disparity includes humans'\nability to perceive the motion of higher-order image features (second-order\nmotion), which many CV models fail to capture because of their reliance on the\nintensity conservation law. Our model architecture mimics the cortical V1-MT\nmotion processing pathway, utilizing a trainable motion energy sensor bank and\na recurrent graph network. Supervised learning employing diverse naturalistic\nvideos allows the model to replicate psychophysical and physiological findings\nabout first-order (luminance-based) motion perception. For second-order motion,\ninspired by neuroscientific findings, the model includes an additional sensing\npathway with nonlinear preprocessing before motion energy sensing, implemented\nusing a simple multilayer 3D CNN block. When exploring how the brain acquired\nthe ability to perceive second-order motion in natural environments, in which\npure second-order signals are rare, we hypothesized that second-order\nmechanisms were critical when estimating robust object motion amidst optical\nfluctuations, such as highlights on glossy surfaces. We trained our\ndual-pathway model on novel motion datasets with varying material properties of\nmoving objects. We found that training to estimate object motion from\nnon-Lambertian materials naturally endowed the model with the capacity to\nperceive second-order motion, as can humans.

Tables of quasinormal frequencies for\nvarious parameter configurations are provided based on the sixth-order WKB\nmethod. Our findings reveal the differences in the quasinormal modes of black\nholes in $f(\\mathbb{Q})$ gravity compared to those in $f(R)$ and\n$f(\\mathbb{T})$ gravity.

As\nmost previous methods treat prediction and planning as separate tasks, it is\ndifficult to model these interactions. Furthermore, since the route path\nnavigates ego vehicles to a predefined destination, it provides relatively\nstable intentions for ego vehicles and helps constrain uncertainty. On this\nbasis, we construct Int2Planner, an \\textbf{Int}ention-based\n\\textbf{Int}egrated motion \\textbf{Planner} achieves multi-modal planning and\nprediction. Instead of static intention points, Int2Planner utilizes route\nintention points for ego vehicles and generates corresponding planning\ntrajectories for each intention point to facilitate multi-modal planning. The\nexperiments on the private dataset and the public nuPlan benchmark show the\neffectiveness of route intention points, and Int2Planner achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. We also deploy it in real-world vehicles and have\nconducted autonomous driving for hundreds of kilometers in urban areas. It\nfurther verifies that Int2Planner can continuously interact with the traffic\nenvironment. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/cxlz/Int2Planner.",

For example, the\nhyper-parameter tuning problem of machine learning models. Bayesian\noptimization is a class of methods with state-of-the-art performance delivering\na solution to this problem in real scenarios. It uses an iterative process that\nemploys a probabilistic surrogate model, typically a Gaussian process, of the\nobjective function to be optimized computing a posterior predictive\ndistribution of the black-box function. Based on the information given by this\nposterior predictive distribution, Bayesian optimization includes the\ncomputation of an acquisition function that represents, for every input space\npoint, the utility of evaluating that point in the next iteraiton if the\nobjective of the process is to retrieve a global extremum. This paper is a\nsurvey of the information theoretical acquisition functions, whose performance\ntypically outperforms the rest of acquisition functions. The main concepts of\nthe field of information theory are also described in detail to make the reader\naware of why information theory acquisition functions deliver great results in\nBayesian optimization and how can we approximate them when they are\nintractable.

The rapid variability observed in the\nX-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to\nindirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole\nhorizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between\nX-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those\nthat first reflect off the accretion disc.

Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment\nof the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to\ndistance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate\nvariability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona.\nWe fit two different distance-sensitive models, and both return reasonable\nvalues of distance and mass within a factor 2 of the accepted values. The\nmodels both employ a point-like 'lamppost' corona and differ only in their\ntreatment of the angular emissivity of the corona. The two models return\ndifferent mass and distance estimates to one another, indicating that future\nreverberation models that include an extended corona geometry can be used to\nconstrain the shape of the corona if the known mass and distance are utilised\nvia Bayesian priors.",

    "abstract": "Tree-structured models are a powerful alternative to parametric regression\nmodels if non-linear effects and interactions are present in the data. Yet,\nclassical tree-structured models might not be appropriate if data comes in\nclusters of units, which requires taking the dependence of observations into\naccount. This is, for example, the case in cross-national studies, as presented\nhere, where country-specific effects should not be neglected. To address this\nissue, we present a flexible tree-structured approach that achieves a sparse\nmodeling of unit-specific effects and identifies subgroups (based on\nindividual-level covariates) that differ with regard to the outcome. The\nmethodological advances were motivated by the analysis of quality of life in\nolder adults using data from the survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in\nEurope. Application of the proposed model yields promising results and\nillustrated the accessibility of the approach. A comparison to alternative\nmethods with regard to variable selection and goodness-of-fit was performed in\nseveral simulation experiments.",

As the density of the water\nincreases with increased salt concentration, the evaporation leads to a\ngravitational unstable setting, where density instabilities can form. Whether\ndensity instabilities form, depends on a large range of parameters like the\nevaporation rate and intrinsic permeability of the porous medium, but also on\nthe water saturation. As water saturation decreases, the storage, convection\nand diffusion of salt also decrease, which all influence the onset of\ninstabilities. By performing a linear stability analysis on the governing\nequations, we give criteria for onset of instabilities. Numerical simulations\ngive information about the further development of these instabilities. With\nthis knowledge we can predict whether and when density instabilities occur, and\nhow they will influence the further development of salt concentration in the\nporous medium.",

However,\nexisting platforms do not provide an upper bound for the billing model which\nmakes the overall cost unpredictable, precluding many organizations from\nmanaging their budgets. Due to the diverse ranges of serverless functions and\nthe heterogeneous capacity of edge devices, it is challenging to receive\nnear-optimal solutions for deployment cost in a polynomial time. In this paper,\nwe investigated the function scheduling problem with a budget constraint for\nserverless computing in wireless networks. Users and IoT devices are sending\nrequests to edge nodes, improving the latency perceived by users. We propose\ntwo online scheduling algorithms based on reinforcement learning, incorporating\nseveral important characteristics of serverless functions. Via extensive\nsimulations, we justify the superiority of the proposed algorithm by comparing\nwith an ILP solver (Midaco). Our results indicate that the proposed algorithms\nefficiently approximate the results of Midaco within a factor of 1.03 while our\ndecision-making time is 5 orders of magnitude less than that of Midaco.",

    "abstract": "Knotted molecules occur naturally and are designed by scientists to gain\nspecial biological and material properties. Understanding and utilizing\nknotting require efficient methods to recognize and generate knotted\nstructures, which are unsolved problems in mathematics and physics. Here, we\nsolve these two problems using machine learning. First, our Transformer-based\nneural network (NN) can recognize the knot types of given chain conformations\nwith an accuracy of $>99\\%$. We can use a single NN model to recognize knots\nwith different chain lengths, and our computational speed is about 4500 times\nfaster than the most popular mathematical method for knot recognition: the\nAlexander polynomials. Second, we for the first time design a diffusion-based\nNN model to generate conformations for given knot types. The generated\nconformations satisfy not only the desired knot types, but also the correct\nphysical distributions of the radii of gyration and knot sizes. The results\nhave several implications. First, the Transformer is suitable for handling\nknotting tasks, probably because of its strength in processing sequence\ninformation, a key component in knotting. Second, our NN can replace\nmathematical methods of knot recognition for faster speed on many occasions.\nThird, our models can facilitate the design of knotted protein structures.\nLastly, analyzing how NN recognizes knot types can provide insight into the\nprinciple behind knots, an unsolved problem in mathematics.

    "abstract": "Worldwide, sight loss is commonly occurred by retinal diseases, with\nage-related macular degeneration (AMD) being a notable facet that affects\nelderly patients. Approaching 170 million persons wide-ranging have been\nspotted with AMD, a figure anticipated to rise to 288 million by 2040. For\nvisualizing retinal layers, optical coherence tomography (OCT) dispenses the\nmost compelling non-invasive method. Frequent patient visits have increased the\ndemand for automated analysis of retinal diseases, and deep learning networks\nhave shown promising results in both image and pixel-level 2D scan\nclassification. However, when relying solely on 2D data, accuracy may be\nimpaired, especially when localizing fluid volume diseases. The goal of\nautomatic techniques is to outperform humans in manually recognizing illnesses\nin medical data. In order to further understand the benefit of deep learning\nmodels, we studied the effects of the input size. The dice similarity\ncoefficient (DSC) metric showed a human performance score of 0.71 for\nsegmenting various retinal diseases. Yet, the deep models surpassed human\nperformance to establish a new era of advancement of segmenting the diseases on\nmedical images. However, to further improve the performance of the models,\noverlapping patches enhanced the performance of the deep models compared to\nfeeding the full image. The highest score for a patch-based model in the DSC\nmetric was 0.88 in comparison to the score of 0.71 for the same model in\nnon-patch-based for SRF fluid segmentation. The objective of this article is to\nshow a fair comparison between deep learning models in relation to the input\n(Patch-Based vs. NonPatch-Based).",

The study utilizes a fine lattice\nspacing of 0.0493 fm at all temperatures. Extended bottomonium operators are\nimplemented to achieve optimized overlaps with the targeted excited states,\nenhancing sensitivity to thermal effects.

    "abstract": "Accurate traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in modern Intelligent\nTransportation Systems (ITS), as it enables real-time traffic flow management,\nreduces congestion, and improves the overall efficiency of urban transportation\nnetworks. With the rise of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), it has emerged a new\nparadigm possessing the potential to enhance predictive capabilities beyond\nwhat classical machine learning models can achieve. In the present work we\npursue a heuristic approach to explore the potential of QML, and focus on a\nspecific transport issue. In particular, as a case study we investigate a\ntraffic forecast task for a major urban area in Athens (Greece), for which we\npossess high-resolution data. In this endeavor we explore the application of\nQuantum Neural Networks (QNN), and, notably, we present the first application\nof quantum data re-uploading in the context of transport forecasting. This\ntechnique allows quantum models to better capture complex patterns, such as\ntraffic dynamics, by repeatedly encoding classical data into a quantum state.\nAside from providing a prediction model, we spend considerable effort in\ncomparing the performance of our hybrid quantum-classical neural networks with\nclassical deep learning approaches. Our results show that hybrid models achieve\ncompetitive accuracy with state-of-the-art classical methods, especially when\nthe number of qubits and re-uploading blocks is increased. While the classical\nmodels demonstrate lower computational demands, we provide evidence that\nincreasing the complexity of the quantum model improves predictive accuracy.\nThese findings indicate that QML techniques, and specifically the data\nre-uploading approach, hold promise for advancing traffic forecasting models\nand could be instrumental in addressing challenges inherent in ITS\nenvironments.",

Additionally, it results in\nan attention map that shows the proportional influence of each input in its\ndecision. Empirical studies postulate that attention maps can be provided as an\nexplanation for model output. However, it is still questionable to ask whether\nthis explanation helps regular people to understand and accept the model output\n(the plausibility of the explanation). Recent studies show that attention\nweights in the RNN encoders are hardly plausible because they spread on input\ntokens. We thus propose 3 additional constraints to the learning objective\nfunction to improve the plausibility of the attention map: regularization to\nincrease the attention weight sparsity, semi-supervision to supervise the map\nby a heuristic and supervision by human annotation. Results show that all\ntechniques can improve the attention map plausibility at some level. We also\nobserve that specific instructions for human annotation might have a negative\neffect on classification performance. Beyond the attention map, the result of\nexperiments on text classification tasks also shows that no matter how the\nconstraint brings the gain, the contextualization layer plays a crucial role in\nfinding the right space for finding plausible tokens.",

The challenge is that only the cascaded two-hop channel spanning from\nthe user equipments (UEs) to the RIS and spanning from the RIS to the BS can be\nestimated, due to the lack of active radio frequency (RF) chains at RIS\nelements, which leads to high pilot overhead. In this paper, we propose a\nlow-overhead linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation method\nby exploiting the spatial correlation of channel links, which strikes a\ntrade-off between the pilot overhead and the channel estimation accuracy.\nMoreover, we calculate the theoretical normalized mean square error (MSE) for\nour channel estimation method. Finally, we verify numerically that the proposed\nLMMSE estimator has lower MSE than the state-of-the-art (SoA) grouping based\nestimators.",

Here we\nintroduce a multi-model framework fit to incidence time-series, data that is\nmuch more readily available. The framework consists of five discrete-time,\nstochastic, branching-process models of epidemics spread through a susceptible\npopulation. The framework includes a baseline model of homogeneous\ntransmission, a unimodal and a bimodal model for super-spreading events, as\nwell as a unimodal and a bimodal model for super-spreading individuals.\nBayesian statistics is used to infer model parameters using Markov Chain\nMonte-Carlo. Model comparison is conducted by computing Bayes factors, with\nimportance sampling used to estimate the marginal likelihood of each model.\nThis estimator is selected for its consistency and lower variance compared to\nalternatives. Application to simulated data from each model identifies the\ncorrect model for the majority of simulations and accurately infers the true\nparameters, such as the basic reproduction number. We also apply our methods to\nincidence data from the 2003 SARS outbreak and the Covid-19 pandemic.

We use a simple {\\misaell} model to qualitatively explain the\ngeneral trend of RCs from the tilted-ring method (${\\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$) and\nthe discrepancy between ${\\mathrm{RC_{tilted}}}$ and ${\\mathrm{RC_{true}}}$.\nFurthermore, we propose a straightforward method to implement a first-order\ncorrection to the RC derived from the tilted-ring method. Our study is the\nfirst to systematically discuss the bar-induced \"dip\" feature in the RCs of\nbarred galaxies combining both simulations and observations.",

Moreover,\nby combining efforts from the kaon community worldwide, we plan to develop the\nKOTO II detector further and expand the physics reach of the experiment to\ninclude measurements of the branching ratio of the $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\ell^+\\ell^-$\ndecays, studies of other $K_L$ decays, and searches for dark photons, axions,\nand axion-like particles.

Previous studies have paid little\nattention to the impact of rotation on the subsurface convective zone (CZ), so\nwe aim to investigate the evolution of this zone in rapidly rotating massive\nstars. We use the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) to\nsimulate the subsurface CZs of massive stars during the main sequence phase. We\nestablish stellar models with initial masses ranging from 5 $M_{\\odot}$ to 120\n$M_{\\odot}$, incorporating four metallicities (Z = 0.02, 0.006, 0.002, and\n0.0001) and three rotational velocities ($\\mit\\omega/\\omega_{\\text {crit}}$ =\n0, $\\mit\\omega/\\omega_{\\text {crit}}$ = 0.50, and $\\mit\\omega/\\omega_{\\text\n{crit}}$ = 0.75). We find that rapid rotation leads to an expansion of the\nsubsurface CZ, increases convective velocities, and promotes the development of\nthis zone. Additionally, subsurface CZs can also emerge in stars with lower\nmetallicities. Comparing our models with observations of massive stars in the\nGalaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, we find\nthat rotating models better encompass the observed samples. Rotation\nsignificantly influences the evolution of the subsurface CZ in massive stars.\nBy comparing with the observed microturbulence on the surfaces of OB stars, we\npropose that the subsurface CZs may be one of the sources of microturbulence.",

    "abstract": "Light-travel-time delays provide one of the most powerful ways of learning\nabout the structure and kinematics of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Estimating\ndelays from observations of AGN variability presents statistical challenges\nbecause the time series are almost invariably irregularly sampled. Correct\nassessment of errors in lag estimates is important for evaluating results. The\nmost widely used method of determining phase lags has been the interpolated\ncross-correlation function method introduced by Gaskell and Sparke (1986, GS).\nIt is shown here that the widely used modified smooth bootstrap method of\nPeterson et al. (1998) significantly overestimates the error in lags derived\nusing the GS, especially for poorly sampled light curves. The remarkably high\naccuracy claimed for lags obtained by the JAVELIN method of Zu et al. (2011)\n(more than an order of magnitude improvement for 25% of cases) is spurious and\nthe accuracy no better than the GS method. A related method proposed by Li et\nal. (2013) suffers from similar but less serious problems. A slightly modified\nversion of the analytic formula of Gaskell and Peterson (1987) gives an easy\nand accurate way of estimating lag errors for well-sampled, high-quality data.\nThe width of the continuum autocorrelation function is shown to be proportional\nto the square root of the luminosity. This is useful in planning observing\ncampaigns. The discrete correlation function method is less powerful than the\nGS method and for many typical situations gives errors in the lag twice as\nlarge as those of the GS method.",

The feasibility of such a \"one-shot\" calibration or discovery heavily\nrelies upon the richness of the measured displacement data, i.e., their ability\nto probe the space of the state variables and the stress space (whereby the\nstresses depend on the constitutive law being sought) to an extent sufficient\nfor an accurate and robust calibration or discovery process. The richness of\nthe displacement data is in turn directly governed by the specimen geometry. In\nthis paper, we propose a density-based topology optimisation framework to\noptimally design the geometry of the target specimen for calibration of an\nanisotropic elastic material model. To this end, we perform automatic,\nhigh-resolution specimen design by maximising the robustness of the solution of\nthe inverse problem, i.e., the identified material parameters, given noisy\ndisplacement measurements from digital image correlation.

In this work, we extend this\ninvestigation to explore the propagation of extreme events between two distinct\nlayers in a multiplex network. We consider a two-layer network, where one layer\nis globally coupled and exhibits extreme events, while the second layer remains\nuncoupled. The interlayer connections between the layers are either\nunidirectional or bidirectional. We find that unidirectional coupling between\nthe layers can induce extreme events in the uncoupled layer, whereas\nbidirectional coupling tends to mitigate extreme events in the globally coupled\nlayer. To characterize extreme and non-extreme states, we use probability plots\nto identify distinct regions in the parameter space. Additionally, we study the\nrobustness of extreme events emergence by examining various network topologies\nin the uncoupled layer. The mechanism behind the occurrence of extreme events\nis explored, with a particular focus on the transition from asynchronous states\nto a fully synchronized excitable state. For numerical simulations, we use\nnonidentical FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons at each node, which captures the dynamical\nbehavior of both coupled and uncoupled layers. Our findings suggest that\nextreme events in the uncoupled layer emerge through the gradual disappearance\nof disorder, accompanied by occasional bursts of synchronized activity. Results\nobtained in this work will serve a starting point in understanding the dynamics\nbehind the propagation of extreme events in real-world networks.",

However, the\nincorporation of extremely large RISs, as recently being considered for\nultra-high capacity industrial environments at subTHz frequencies, imposes\ncertain challenges for indoor channel characterization. In particular, such\nRISs contribute additional multipath components and their large sizes with\nrespect to the signal wavelength lead to near-field propagation. To this end,\nray tracing approaches become quite cumbersome and need to be rerun for\ndifferent RIS unit cell designs. In this paper, we present a novel approach for\nthe incorporation of RISs in indoor multipath environments towards their\nefficient channel characterization. An $100\\times100$ RIS design with $2$-bit\nresolution unit cells realizing a fixed anomalous reflection at 300 GHz is\npresented, whose radar cross section patterns are obtained via full-wave\nsimulations.

The price of these currencies has seen\na lot of fluctuations at times, which has increased the need for prediction. As\ntheir most popular, Bitcoin(BTC) has become a research hotspot. The main\nchallenge and trend of digital currencies, especially BTC, is price\nfluctuations, which require studying the basic price prediction model. This\nresearch presents a classification and regression model based on stack deep\nlearning that uses a wavelet to remove noise to predict movements and prices of\nBTC at different time intervals. The proposed model based on the stacking\ntechnique uses models based on deep learning, especially neural networks and\ntransformers, for one, seven, thirty and ninety-day forecasting. Three feature\nselection models, Chi2, RFE and Embedded, were also applied to the data in the\npre-processing stage. The classification model achieved 63\\% accuracy for\npredicting the next day and 64\\%, 67\\% and 82\\% for predicting the seventh,\nthirty and ninety days, respectively.

Solar filament oscillations have been observed for many years, but\nrecent advances in telescope capabilities now enable daily monitoring of these\nperiodic motions, offering valuable insights into the structure of filaments.

Although some\nexisting machine learning approaches such as implicit U-net enhanced Fourier\nneural operator (IUFNO) have been proven to be capable of achieving stable\nlong-term predictions for turbulent flows, their computational costs are\nusually high. In this paper, we use the adaptive Fourier neural operator (AFNO)\nas the backbone to construct a model that can predict 3D turbulence.\nFurthermore, we employ the implicit iteration to our constructed AFNO and\npropose the implicit adaptive Fourier neural operator (IAFNO). IAFNO is\nsystematically tested in three types of 3D turbulence, including forced\nhomogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), temporally evolving turbulent mixing\nlayer and turbulent channel flow. The numerical results demonstrate that IAFNO\nis more accurate than IUFNO and the traditional large-eddy simulation using\ndynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM), while exhibiting greater stability compared to\nIUFNO. Meanwhile, the AFNO model exhibits instability in numerical simulations.\nMoreover, the training efficiency of IAFNO is 4 times higher than that of\nIUFNO, and the number of parameters and GPU memory occupation of IAFNO are only\n1/80 and 1/3 of IUFNO, respectively in HIT. In other tests, the improvements\nare slightly lower but still considerable. These improvements mainly come from\npatching and self-attention in 3D space. Besides, the well-trained IAFNO is\nsignificantly faster than the DSM. The code (and datasets) of the current work\ncan be accessed at https://github.com/yuchi-richard-jiang/IAFNO.",

Thus, online RLHF is more\ndesirable to empower the LLM to explore outside the support of the initial\ndataset by iteratively collecting the prompt-response pairs. In this paper, we\nstudy the fundamental problem in online RLHF, i.e. \\emph{how to explore} for\nLLM. We give a theoretical motivation in linear reward assumption to show that\nan optimistic reward with an upper confidence bound (UCB) term leads to a\nprovably efficient RLHF policy.

The spatial\ndiscretization is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, which\nnaturally allows high-order accuracy. The asymptotic-preserving (AP) and the\nasymptotically-accurate (AA) properties of the two approaches are assessed on a\nnumber of classical benchmarks for ideal gases and on their extension to\nnon-ideal gases.",

By transforming from static to sequential graph data, GRAMA\nleverages the strengths of the ARMA framework, while preserving permutation\nequivariance. Moreover, GRAMA incorporates a selective attention mechanism for\ndynamic learning of ARMA coefficients, enabling efficient and flexible\nlong-range information propagation. We also establish theoretical connections\nbetween GRAMA and Selective SSMs, providing insights into its ability to\ncapture long-range dependencies.

Methods: We conducted a literature survey of ~27,000\nempirical studies, using LLMs to classify statistical methodologies as adequate\nor inadequate.

When the bag radius of a hadron falls below this value, the bag\nbinding energy satisfies $E_{B} < 0$, indicating that the system has a compact\nintention. We consider various combinations of different numbers and ratios of\nheavy and light quarks, indicating that the bag radius of hadrons depending on\nthe number of quarks is suppressed by the presence of heavy quarks. Focusing on\nfive-quark combinations, we find that the average bag radius of $nncc\\bar{c}$\nis below the threshold $R_{c}$. We take into account color-magnetic\ninteractions and calculate the mass, magnetic moment, binding energy, and\nrelative strong decay width for the $nnQQ\\bar{Q}$ system.

However, journal\nentry data is highly sensitive, making it infeasible to share them directly\nacross audit firms. To address this challenge, journal entry anomaly detection\nmethods based on model share-type federated learning (FL) have been proposed.\nThese methods require multiple rounds of communication with external servers to\nexchange model parameters, which necessitates connecting devices storing\nconfidential data to external networks -- a practice not recommended for\nsensitive data such as journal entries. To overcome these limitations, a novel\nanomaly detection framework based on data collaboration (DC) analysis, a\nnon-model share-type FL approach, is proposed. The method first transforms raw\njournal entry data into secure intermediate representations via dimensionality\nreduction and then constructs a collaboration representation used to train an\nanomaly detection autoencoder. Notably, the approach does not require raw data\nto be exposed or devices to be connected to external networks, and the entire\nprocess needs only a single round of communication. The proposed method was\nevaluated on both synthetic and real-world journal entry data collected from\neight healthcare organizations. The experimental results demonstrated that the\nframework not only outperforms the baseline trained on individual data but also\nachieves higher detection performance than model-sharing FL methods such as\nFedAvg and FedProx, particularly under non-i.i.d. settings that simulate\npractical audit environments.

To fill in the research gap, this paper\nproposes a systematic data characteristic framework based on a 6Vs model. The\nframework aims to unveil the data characteristics in terms of data volume,\nvariety, velocity, veracity, value, and variability through a set of\nstatistical indicators. This model improves the objectivity of data\ncharacteristic understanding by relying solely on data-driven indicators. The\nindicators related to time-related characteristics in physical-sensor data are\nalso included. Furthermore, the big data challenges are linked to each\ndimension of the 6Vs model to gain a quantitative understanding of the data\nchallenges. Finally, a pipeline is developed to implement the proposed\nframework, and two case studies are conducted to illustrate the process of\nunderstanding the physical-sensor data characteristics and making\nrecommendations for data preprocessing to address the big data challenges. The\nproposed framework is able to analyze the characteristics of all\nphysical-sensor data, therefore, identifying potential challenges in subsequent\nanalytics, and providing recommendations for data preprocessing.",

These\nmodels are particularly suited for survival analysis in clustered data where\nunobserved heterogeneity changes over time, providing greater flexibility in\nmodeling time-to-event data.\n  The package builds on the piecewise gamma frailty model originally proposed\nby Paik (1994) and refined by Wintrebert et al. (2004). Our key contributions\ninclude the integration of posterior frailty estimation, a reduction in\ncomputational complexity, the definition of a prediction framework and the\nefficient implementation of these models within an R package.\n  As a practical application, we use TimeDepFrail to analyze dropout rates\nwithin a university, where high dropout rates are a known issue. By allowing\nfrailty to vary over time, the package uncovers new insights into the\nunobserved factors influencing dropout.\n  TimeDepFrail simplifies access to advanced time-varying frailty models,\nproviding a practical and scalable alternative to more computationally\ndemanding methods, making it highly applicable for large-scale datasets.",

    "abstract": "While the exponential decay of tunneling probability with barrier thickness\nis well known, the accompanying oscillations with thickness have been\ncomparatively less explored. Using a tight binding model, we investigate an\nAB-stacked bilayer graphene region acting as an energy barrier between two\nmonolayer graphene leads, under a vertical electric field. We discuss the case\nwhere the energy gap induced by the vertical electric field is comparable to\nthe interlayer transfer integral. In the up (down) junction, the left and right\nmonolayer leads are connected to different layers (a common layer) of the\ncentral bilayer, while the remaining, unconnected layers form armchair-type\nopen edges. We reveal a characteristic relation between the tunneling\nprobability and the wave function structure. Among the valley-resolved\ntransmission probabilities, only the valley-reversed transmission in the up\njunction exhibits even symmetry with respect to energy $E$. This result is\ncounterintuitive. The interlayer wave function ratio $\\beta$ is asymmetric in\n$E$, i.e., $\\beta(-E) \\neq \\beta(E)$, and electrons cannot bypass the\ninterlayer path in the up junction, whereas they can in the down junction. We\nattribute this unexpected symmetry to a self-cancellation effect of $\\beta$,\nwhich arises from chiral and rotational symmetry operations combined with the\nconservation of probability. Our results demonstrate that the energy dependence\nof conductance in double junction structures serves as evidence of this effect.",

The study investigates the impact\nof metallicity on $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ values. Notably, it predicts a significant\nanti-correlation between $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$ and UV luminosity ($L_{\\rm UV}$),\nconsistent with observations, with the slope of this relationship varying with\nmetallicity for BH-ULXs. The NS-ULX population shows a relatively consistent\nslope around $-0.33$ across metallicities, with minor variations. The number of\nULXs decreases with increasing metallicity, consistent with observational data,\nand the X-ray luminosity function shows a slight variation in its slope with\nmetallicity, exhibiting a relative excess of high-luminosity ULXs at lower\nmetallicities. Inclusion of beaming effect in the analysis shows a significant\nimpact on the XLF and $\\alpha_{\\rm ox}$, particularly at high accretion rates,\nwhere the emission is focused into narrower cones.

To\nenhance the generation efficiency while maintaining the quality of the\ngenerated codes, we propose VRank, an automatic framework that generates\nVerilog codes with LLMs. In our framework, multiple code candidates are\ngenerated with LLMs by leveraging their probabilistic nature. Afterwards, we\ngroup Verilog code candidates into clusters based on identical outputs when\ntested against the same testbench, which is also generated by LLMs. Clusters\nare ranked based on the consistency they show on testbench. To determine the\nbest candidate, Chain-of-Thought is further applied to select the best\ncandidate from the top-ranked clusters. By systematically analyzing diverse\noutputs of generated codes, VRank reduces errors and enhances the overall\nquality of the generated Verilog code. Experimental results on the\nVerilogEval-Human benchmark demonstrate a significant 10.5% average increase in\nfunctional correctness (passl1) across multiple LLMs, demonstrating VRank's\neffectiveness in improving the accuracy of automated hardware description\nlanguage generation for complex design tasks.",

In the case of shortest\nand shortest foremost paths, it requires O(n + M ) space and runs in time where\nM is the number of temporal edges, thus significantly improving the algorithm\nof Bu{\\ss} et al in terms of time complexity (note that T is usually large).\nExperimental evidence is provided that our algorithm performs between twice and\nalmost 250 times better than the algorithm of Bu{\\ss} et al. Moreover, we were\nable to compute the exact temporal betweenness values of several large temporal\ngraphs with over a million of temporal edges. For such size, only approximate\ncomputation was possible by using the algorithm of Santoro and Sarpe [WWW\n2022]. Maybe more importantly, our algorithm extends to the case of restless\nwalks (that is, walks with waiting constraints in each node), thus providing a\npolynomial-time algorithm (with complexity O(nM )) for computing the temporal\nbetweenness in the case of several different optimality criteria. Such restless\ncomputation was known only for the shortest criterion (Rymar et al [JGAA\n2023]), with complexity O(n 2 M T 2 ).

Taking together, these results\nshowcase REX's effectiveness in accurately recovering true causal structures\nwhile minimizing false positive predictions, its robustness across diverse\ndatasets, and its applicability to real-world problems. By combining ML and\nexplainability techniques with causal discovery, REX bridges the gap between\npredictive modeling and causal inference, offering an effective tool for\nunderstanding complex causal structures.

CASSI systems can now be optimized in order to fulfill simultaneously\nseveral optical design constraints as well as processing constraints. Four\ncomparable CASSI systems with varying degree of optical aberrations have been\ndesigned and modeled. The resulting rendered hyperspectral acquisitions from\neach of these systems are combined with five state-of-the-art hyperspectral\ncube reconstruction processes. These reconstruction processes encompass a\nmapping function created from each system's propagation model to account for\ndistortions and aberrations during the reconstruction process. Our analyses\nshow that if properly modeled, the effects of geometric distortions of the\nsystem and misalignments of the dispersive elements have a marginal impact on\nthe overall quality of the reconstructed hyperspectral data cubes. Therefore,\nrelaxing traditional constraints on measurement conformity and fidelity to the\nscene enables the development of novel imaging instruments, guided by\nperformance metrics applied to the design or the processing of acquisitions.

This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image\nrestoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion\nprior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human\nvisual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR\nscenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from\nan autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks.

An analysis of the radio light curves reveals\nsignificant time delays (0.6 to 6.4 years) between the radio frequencies along\nwith variability timescales ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 years in the source's rest\nframe, which is similar to the blazars at lower redshifts.

    "abstract": "We present a numerical approach to calculate inelastic light scattering\nspectra from gold nanocrystals, based on the finite element method. This\napproach is validated by comparison with previous analytic calculations for\nspherically symmetric scatterers. Superellipsoid nanocrystals are considered in\norder to smoothly vary the shape from octahedra to cubes via spheres, while\npreserving cubic symmetry. Spectra are calculated and discussed taking into\naccount the irreducible representation of the involved vibration modes. A\nstrong increase in the inelastically scattered light intensity is observed for\nsmall variations of the shape around the sphere. This increase is related to\nvariations of the electric field inside the nanocrystals, which are very small\nfor small nanospheres but increase quickly for non-spherical nanocrystals. This\nstrong dependence with shape must be taken into account when interpreting\nexperimental spectra acquired from inhomogeneous ensembles of nanocrystals\nwhose shape dispersion are usually neglected. The overall changes in the\nspectra when varying the shape of the nanocrystals provide additional insight\ninto previously published results. Preliminary calculations for chiral shapes\nfurther show a significant difference between spectra obtained with right or\nleft circularly polarized light.",

    "abstract": "When confronted with an undesired cell population, such as bacterial\ninfections or tumors, we seek the most effective treatment, designed to\neliminate the population as rapidly as possible. A common practice is to\nmonitor the cells short-term response to the treatment, and from that,\nextrapolate the eventual treatment outcome, i.e. will it eradicate the cells,\nand if yes at what timescales. Underlying this approach is the assumption that\nthe cells exhibit a homogeneous response to the treatment, and hence the early\nresponse patterns can be naturally extended to later times. Recent experiments\non cancer cell populations, however, indicate a significant level of cellular\nheterogeneity, undermining this classic assessment protocol of treatment\nefficacy. We, therefore, develop here a stochastic framework, to analytically\npredict the temporal dynamics of a heterogeneous cell population. Quite often,\nwe find, the average cellular parameters, governing the short-term response,\nfail to predict the actual treatment outcome. In contrast, our analysis, which\nalso incorporates the populations variability, helps identify the relevant\nstatistical parameters, which in turn, enable us to predict the full trajectory\nof the cell population, and specifically - the likelihood and typical\ntimescales for remission.",

Our real-world studies reveal that over 70% of user requests\nto LLMs have semantically similar counterparts, suggesting the potential for\nknowledge transfer among requests. However, naively caching and reusing past\nresponses leads to a big quality drop. In this paper, we introduce IC-Cache, a\ncaching system that enables live LLM capability augmentation to improve serving\nefficiency: by leveraging historical request-response pairs from larger models\nas in-context examples, IC-Cache empowers small LLMs to imitate and even exceed\nthe compositional abilities (e.g., reasoning) of their larger counterparts,\nenabling selective offloading of requests to reduce cost and latency. Achieving\nthis live augmentation at scale introduces intricate trade-offs between\nresponse quality, latency, and system throughput. For a new request, IC-Cache\nefficiently selects similar, high-utility examples to prepend them to the new\nrequest's input. At scale, it adaptively routes requests across LLMs of varying\ncapabilities, accounting for response quality and serving loads. IC-Cache\nemploys a cost-aware cache replay mechanism that refines example quality\noffline to maximize online cache utility and efficiency. Evaluations on\nmillions of realistic requests demonstrate that IC-Cache improves LLM serving\nthroughput by 1.4-5.9x and reduces latency by 28-71% without hurting response\nquality.",

For each component, single-crystal LiF is highly effective\nto block electron transport, with a critical thickness of 2.9 nm, much smaller\nthan that of Li2O (19.0 nm).

This gradual approach enhances their\nexpressiveness and generation quality. Not only that, diffusion models have\nalso been shown to extract meaningful representations from data while learning\nto generate samples. Despite their success, the application of diffusion models\nto graph-structured data remains relatively unexplored, primarily due to the\ndiscrete nature of graphs, which necessitates discrete diffusion processes\ndistinct from the continuous methods used in other domains.

Existing works mainly focus on sharing and\nrecombining local domain-specific attributes to increase data diversity and\nsimulate potential domain shifts. However, these methods may be insufficient\nsince only the local attribute recombination can be hard to touch the\nout-of-distribution of global data. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple-yet-efficient framework named Federated Domain Adversarial Generation\n(FedDAG). It aims to simulate the domain shift and improve the model\ngeneralization by adversarially generating novel domains different from local\nand global source domains. Specifically, it generates novel-style images by\nmaximizing the instance-level feature discrepancy between original and\ngenerated images and trains a generalizable task model by minimizing their\nfeature discrepancy. Further, we observed that FedDAG could cause different\nperformance improvements for local models. It may be due to inherent data\nisolation and heterogeneity among clients, exacerbating the imbalance in their\ngeneralization contributions to the global model. Ignoring this imbalance can\nlead the global model's generalization ability to be sub-optimal, further\nlimiting the novel domain generation procedure. Thus, to mitigate this\nimbalance, FedDAG hierarchically aggregates local models at the within-client\nand across-client levels by using the sharpness concept to evaluate client\nmodel generalization contributions. Extensive experiments across four medical\nbenchmarks demonstrate FedDAG's ability to enhance generalization in federated\nmedical scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Flaky tests pose a significant issue for software testing. A test with a\nnon-deterministic outcome may undermine the reliability of the testing process,\nmaking tests untrustworthy. Previous research has identified test order\ndependency as one of the most prevalent causes of flakiness, particularly in\nJava and Python. However, little is known about test order dependency in\nJavaScript tests. This paper aims to investigate test order dependency in\nJavaScript projects that use Jest, a widely used JavaScript testing framework.\nWe implemented a systematic approach to randomise tests, test suites and\ndescribe blocks and produced 10 unique test reorders for each level. We reran\neach order 10 times (100 reruns for each test suite/project) and recorded any\nchanges in test outcomes. We then manually analysed each case that showed flaky\noutcomes to determine the cause of flakiness. We examined our detection\napproach on a dataset of 81 projects obtained from GitHub. Our results revealed\n55 order-dependent tests across 10 projects. Most order-dependent tests (52)\noccurred between tests, while the remaining three occurred between describe\nblocks. Those order-dependent tests are caused by either shared files (13) or\nshared mocking state (42) between tests. While sharing files is a known cause\nof order-dependent tests in other languages, our results underline a new cause\n(shared mocking state) that was not reported previously",

An important new feature of the expression is the involvement of an\nintegral of the Hamiltonian associated with a special, real, pole-free solution\nfor $\\mathrm{P_{I}^{2k}}$. In addition, we show that the total integral of the\nHamiltonian vanishes for all $k$, and establish a transition from the\nhigher-order Tracy-Widom distribution to the classical one in the asymptotic\nregime.

    "abstract": "We present a model of price formation in an inelastic market whose dynamics\nare partially driven by both money flows and their impact on asset prices. The\nmoney flow to the market is viewed as an investment policy of outside\ninvestors. For the price impact effect, we use an impact function that\nincorporates the phenomena of market inelasticity and saturation from new money\n(the $dumb \\; money$ effect). Due to the dependence of market investors' flows\non market performance, the model implies a feedback mechanism that gives rise\nto nonlinear dynamics. Consequently, the market price dynamics are seen as a\nnonlinear diffusion of a particle (the $marketron$) in a two-dimensional space\nformed by the log-price $x$ and a memory variable $y$. The latter stores\ninformation about past money flows, so that the dynamics are non-Markovian in\nthe log price $x$ alone, but Markovian in the pair $(x,y)$, bearing a strong\nresemblance to spiking neuron models in neuroscience. In addition to market\nflows, the model dynamics are partially driven by return predictors, modeled as\nunobservable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. By using a new interpretation of\npredictive signals as $self$-$propulsion$ components of the price dynamics, we\ntreat the marketron as an active particle, amenable to methods developed in the\nphysics of active matter. We show that, depending on the choice of parameters,\nour model can produce a rich variety of interesting dynamic scenarios. In\nparticular, it predicts three distinct regimes of the market, which we call the\n$Good$, the $Bad$, and the $Ugly$ markets. The latter regime describes a\nscenario of a total market collapse or, alternatively, a corporate default\nevent, depending on whether our model is applied to the whole market or an\nindividual stock.",

Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that\ndenoising score matching can enhance detection power by effectively controlling\nthe injected noise scale. Finally, we validate the practical efficacy of our\nmethod through numerical experiments on two synthetic datasets and a real-world\nearthquake precursor detection task, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nchallenging scenarios.",

First, we work in any dimension. Second, each\nsite can hold several different stacks of sand, one for each of a certain given\nnumber of different layers or colors. Third, when a stack of one color at a\nsite topples, it can send sand not only to its nearest neighbors in equal\namounts, but to all possible locations and colors, according to a fixed but\narbitrary mass distribution. Stacks of different colors can topple according to\ndifferent distributions and different leakiness parameters, however the\ntoppling rule should be site-independent. We obtain three main results. First,\nin this generality, when the LASM is started with $N$ grains of sand in one\ncolor at the origin, the final stable configuration, after scaling down by\n$\\log N$, converges to a limit shape as $N$ goes to infinity. Second, when the\nleakiness parameter converges to infinity and the toppling distribution has\nfinite range, the limit shape converges to a polytope. Third, when the\nleakiness parameters converge to one, which means the leakiness disappears, the\nlimit shape of the sandpile converges to an ellipsoid. From a technical point\nof view, we rely on a strong relation between the Green function for random\nwalk and the shape of the sandpile.

We\nshow that our simulated star clusters can be divided into two types: with and\nwithout [Fe/H] abundance variations. The former is created by a seed star\ncluster (the first-generation stars) formed in compressed gas. These stars\ncontaminate the surrounding gas by Type II supernovae (SNe). At that time, the\nenergy injection is insufficient to induce an outflow of the surrounding gas.\nAfter that, the contaminated gas falls into the seed, thereby forming a new\ngeneration of stars from the contaminated gas. We also show that most star\nclusters are formed in the galactic central region after the second encounter\nand fall into the galactic center due to dynamical friction within several\nhundred Myr. As a result, close encounters and mergers between the clusters\ntake place. Although the clusters with shallower gravitational potential are\ntidally disrupted by these close encounters, others survive and finally merge\nat the center of the merged dwarf galaxies to create a nuclear star cluster.\nTherefore, the nuclear star cluster is comprised of various stellar components\nin [Fe/H] abundance and age.

Traditional physics-based\nmethods struggle to accurately model the nonlinear dynamics of these\ninteractions, while data-driven approaches often suffer from overfitting to\nspecific motion patterns, vehicle sizes, and types, limiting their\ngeneralizability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a vision-based\nfriction estimation framework grounded in neuro-symbolic principles,\nintegrating neural networks for visual perception with symbolic reasoning for\nphysical modeling. This enables significantly improved generalization abilities\nthrough explicit physical reasoning incorporating the predicted friction.\nAdditionally, we develop a physics-informed planner that leverages the learned\nfriction coefficient to generate physically feasible and efficient paths, along\nwith corresponding speed profiles. We refer to our approach as AnyNav and\nevaluate it in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its\nutility and robustness across various off-road scenarios and multiple types of\nfour-wheeled vehicles.

We predict an A-type AFM monolayer\nFe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, which shows a significant spontaneous valley polarization of\n157 meV. In Fe$_2$C(OH)$_2$, spatial inversion symmetry (P) and time-reversal\nsymmetry (T) are individually broken, yet the combined PT symmetry is\npreserved. This symmetry conservation leads to spin degeneracy, resulting in\nzero Berry curvature in the momentum space and absence of AVHE. However, a\nlayer-locked hidden Berry curvature is produced, leading to the observation of\nthe valley layer-spin Hall effect. Further, an external out-of-plane electric\nfield can induce spin splitting by introducing layer-dependent electrostatic\npotential, enabling the layer-locked AVHE. Additionally, the introduction of a\nbuilt-in electric field caused by the Janus structure also induces spin\nsplitting in monolayer Fe$_2$C(OH)F due to the\nelectric-potential-difference-AFM mechanism.

These nickelates crystallize in an orthogonal/monoclinic structure\nwith tilted NiO$_6$ octahedra at ambient pressure and enter a density-wave-like\nphase at low temperatures. The application of pressure suppresses the\noctahedral tilting and triggers a transition to tetragonal structure (I4/mmm),\nwhich is believed to be a key prerequisite for the emergence of superconducting\nstate.

Through temperature variation and scaling analysis, we\nidentify the quantum metric quadrupole as the physical origin of the observed\nthird-order longitudinal nonlinearity. Additionally, we determine the angle\ndependence of the quantum metric quadrupole, establishing third-order\nnonlinearity as an efficient method for revealing the quantum metric structure.",

Given their reliance on classification objectives, traditional WSOL\nmethods like class activation mapping focus on the most discriminative object\nparts, often missing the full spatial extent. In contrast, recent WSOL methods\nbased on vision-language models like CLIP require ground truth classes or\nexternal classifiers to produce a localization map, limiting their deployment\nin downstream tasks. Moreover, methods like GenPromp attempt to address these\nissues but introduce considerable complexity due to their reliance on\nconditional denoising processes and intricate prompt learning.

Multiple instance learning of these\nimage patches allows for accurate localization and classification using one\nmodel without requiring external classifiers. Such integration of textual and\nvisual modalities addresses the longstanding challenge of achieving accurate\nlocalization and classification concurrently, as WSOL methods in the literature\ntypically converge at different epochs. Extensive experiments show that\nleveraging text embeddings and localization cues provides a cost-effective WSOL\nmodel.

When GCRs reach\nEarth, they are significantly influenced by the solar wind and the heliospheric\nmagnetic field, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. This effect introduces\ntime-dependent variations in GCR fluxes. The AMS-02 experiment has released\ntime-dependent flux data for protons, electrons, and positrons, revealing clear\ncorrelations with solar modulation. Studies suggest that cosmic rays with the\nsame charge, such as protons and helium nuclei, exhibit similar/same solar\nmodulation parameters. In this work, we derive the LIS for protons and\npositrons under the assumption of a common solar modulation potential, using\ndata from Voyager 1 and a 7-year average from AMS-02. Similarly, the LIS for\nantiprotons and electrons is derived by assuming they are governed by a\nseparate solar modulation potential. We demonstrate that the time-dependent\nfluxes of positrons and protons can be accurately modeled using the same set of\nsolar modulation parameters within a modified force-field approximation\nframework. Based on this, we predict the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons\nusing the corresponding electron flux data.",

We observe\nthat the design space for concurrency control on managed code involves complex\ntrade-offs between expressibility, applicability, and maintainability on the\none hand, and bug-finding efficiency on the other hand.\n  This paper presents Fray, a platform for performing push-button concurrency\ntesting of data-race-free JVM programs. The key insight behind Fray is that\neffective controlled concurrency testing requires orchestrating thread\ninterleavings without replacing existing concurrency primitives, while encoding\ntheir semantics for faithfully expressing the set of all possible program\nbehaviors. Fray incorporates a novel concurrency control mechanism called\nshadow locking, designed to make controlled concurrency testing practical and\nefficient for JVM programs. In an empirical evaluation on 53 benchmark programs\nwith known bugs (SCTBench and JaConTeBe), Fray with random search finds 70%\nmore bugs than JPF and 77% more bugs than RR's chaos mode.

However, method names may become inconsistent with their\ncorresponding implementations, causing confusion and errors. Several deep\nlearning (DL)-based approaches have been proposed to identify such\ninconsistencies, with initial evaluations showing promising results. However,\nthese evaluations typically use a balanced dataset, where the number of\ninconsistent and consistent names are equal. This setup, along with flawed\ndataset construction, leads to false positives, making reported performance\nless reliable in real-world scenarios, where most method names are consistent.\nIn this paper, we present an empirical study that evaluates state-of-the-art\nDL-based methods for identifying inconsistent method names. We create a new\nbenchmark by combining automatic identification from commit histories and\nmanual developer inspections, reducing false positives. We evaluate five\nrepresentative DL approaches (one retrieval-based and four generation-based) on\nthis benchmark. Our results show that performance drops substantially when\nmoving from the balanced dataset to the new benchmark. We further conduct\nquantitative and qualitative analyses to understand the strengths and\nweaknesses of the approaches. Retrieval-based methods perform well on simple\nmethods and those with popular name sub-tokens but fail due to inefficient\nrepresentation techniques. Generation-based methods struggle with inaccurate\nsimilarity calculations and immature name generation.

    "abstract": "Supernova remnants are one potential source class considered a PeVatron (i.e.\ncapable of accelerating cosmic rays above PeV energies). The shock fronts\nproduced after the explosion of the supernova are ideal regions for particle\nacceleration. IC 443 is a supernova remnant that has been studied extensively\nat different wavelengths. Using 2966 days of gamma-ray data from the HAWC\nobservatory, we study the emission of IC 443 with the objective of finding\nsignatures of cosmic-ray acceleration at the PeV scale. Using a maximum\nlikelihood method, we find a point source located at ($\\alpha$=94.42$^{\\circ}$,\n$\\delta$=22.35$^{\\circ}$) that we associate with IC 443. The measured spectrum\nis a simple power law with an index of $-3.14\\pm$0.18, which is consistent with\nprevious TeV observations. Although we cannot confirm that IC 443 is a hadronic\nPeVatron, we do not find any sign that the spectrum has a cut off at tens of\nTeV energies, with the spectrum extending to $\\sim$30 TeV. Furthermore, we also\nfind a new extended component in the region whose emission is described by a\nsimple power law with an index of $-2.49\\pm$0.08 and which we call HAWC\nJ0615+2213. While we show evidence that this new source might be a new TeV\nhalo, we defer a detailed analysis of this new source to another publication.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) models have rapidly advanced, enabling the generation of\nhigh-quality images from text prompts across various domains. However, these\nmodels present notable safety concerns, including the risk of generating\nharmful, biased, or private content. Current research on assessing T2I safety\nremains in its early stages. While some efforts have been made to evaluate\nmodels on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To\naddress this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I\nmodels across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a\ndetailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains,\nand meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and\nprompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated\nimages and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous\nwork has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary\nmodels like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 12 prominent diffusion\nmodels on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues\nwith racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant\nvariation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods\nlike concept erasing. Data and evaluator are released under\nhttps://github.com/adwardlee/t2i_safety.",

Wikipedia APIs, DBpedia, and Wikidata endpoints were used to query the\ndata to ensure persistent data collection. The WGD was then created with\nMicrosoft Power BI before being embedded on a public website. The analysis of\nthe data available in the WGD found that female articles only represent around\n17% of English Wikipedia, but it has been growing steadily over the last 20\nyears. Meanwhile, the average age across genders decreased over time. WGD also\nshows that most subclasses of `Person' are male-dominated. Wikipedia editors\ncan make use of WGD to locate areas with marginalized genders in Wikipedia, and\nincrease their efforts to produce more content providing coverage for those\ngenders to achieve better gender equality in Wikipedia.",

    "abstract": "Feature selection can select important features to address dimensional\ncurses. Subspace learning, a widely used dimensionality reduction method, can\nproject the original data into a low-dimensional space. However, the\nlow-dimensional representation is often transformed back into the original\nspace, resulting in information loss. Additionally, gate function-based methods\nin Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy system (TSK-FS) are commonly less discrimination.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a novel feature selection method\nthat integrates subspace learning with TSK-FS. Specifically, a projection\nmatrix is used to fit the intrinsic low-dimensional representation.\nSubsequently, the low-dimensional representation is fed to TSK-FS to measure\nits availability. The firing strength is slacked so that TSK-FS is not limited\nby numerical underflow. Finally, the $\\ell _{2,1}$-norm is introduced to select\nsignificant features and the connection to related works is discussed. The\nproposed method is evaluated against six state-of-the-art methods on eighteen\ndatasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

To alleviate the language\nconfusion in self-attention, based on LR-MoE, we propose to apply attention-MoE\narchitecture for MASR. In our new architecture, MoE is utilized not only on\nfeed-forward network (FFN) but also on self-attention. In addition, to improve\nthe robustness of the LID-based router on language confusion, we propose expert\npruning and router augmentation methods. Combining the above, we get the\nboosted language-routing MoE (BLR-MoE) architecture. We verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed BLR-MoE in a 10,000-hour MASR dataset.",

    "abstract": "It has previously been demonstrated that the mesonic fields in chiral\nLagrangians can be related to the quark-level operators of QCD sum-rules via\nenergy-independent (constant) scale factor matrices constrained by chiral\nsymmetry. This leads to universal scale factors for each type of chiral nonet\nrelated to quark-antiquark ($q\\bar q$) operators and four-quark ($qq\\bar q\\bar\nq$) operators. Motivated by these successful demonstrations of scale-factor\nuniversality for the $K_0^*$ isodoublet and $a_0$ isotriplet scalar mesons, a\nrevised Gaussian QCD sum-rule methodology is developed that enables the\nextension to higher-dimensional isospin sectors, including the possibility of\nmixing with glueball components. Moreover, to extract non-perturbative\ninformation about a resonance stemming from the final state interactions of its\ndecay products, a background-resonance interference approximation is developed\nand shown to provide an excellent description of both $\\pi K$ scattering\namplitude data and $\\pi\\eta$ scattering calculations. This background-resonance\ninterference approximation inspires new resonance models as ingredients in the\nscale-factor analysis connecting chiral Lagrangians and QCD Gaussian sum-rules.\nUsing the revised Gaussian QCD sum-rule methodology, key properties of the\nscale factors are examined for the $K_0^*$ isodoublet and $a_0$ isotriplet\nscalar mesons for a sequence of increasingly sophisticated resonance models.\nGaussian sum-rules are demonstrated to have sufficient resolution to\ndistinguish between different resonance models, and it is shown that the\nbackground-resonance interference approximation not only describes $\\{\\pi\nK,\\pi\\eta\\}$ scattering, but leads to the best universality and\nenergy-independence properties of the scale factors.",

Unlike value-based PDE or BSDE\napproaches, PG-DPO enforces PMP conditions at each gradient step, naturally\naccommodating no-short-selling or borrowing constraints and optional\nconsumption bounds. A \"one-shot\" variant rapidly computes Pontryagin-optimal\ncontrols after a brief warm-up, leading to substantially higher accuracy than\nnaive baselines. On modern GPUs, near-optimal solutions often emerge within\njust one or two minutes of training. Numerical experiments confirm that, for up\nto 1,000 assets, PG-DPO accurately recovers the known closed-form solution in\nthe unconstrained case and remains tractable under constraints -- far exceeding\nthe longstanding DP-based limit of around seven assets.",

However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In\nlight of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest\nmulti-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques,\nmulti-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling\nand improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach,\nwhich establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more\ncomplex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and\nprocess reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning\nperformance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME,\n96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching\nOpenAI's o1.

    "abstract": "Mutation analysis of deep neural networks (DNNs) is a promising method for\neffective evaluation of test data quality and model robustness, but it can be\ncomputationally expensive, especially for large models. To alleviate this, we\npresent DEEPMAACC, a technique and a tool that speeds up DNN mutation analysis\nthrough neuron and mutant clustering. DEEPMAACC implements two methods: (1)\nneuron clustering to reduce the number of generated mutants and (2) mutant\nclustering to reduce the number of mutants to be tested by selecting\nrepresentative mutants for testing. Both use hierarchical agglomerative\nclustering to group neurons and mutants with similar weights, with the goal of\nimproving efficiency while maintaining mutation score. DEEPMAACC has been\nevaluated on 8 DNN models across 4 popular classification datasets and two DNN\narchitectures. When compared to exhaustive, or vanilla, mutation analysis, the\nresults provide empirical evidence that neuron clustering approach, on average,\naccelerates mutation analysis by 69.77%, with an average -26.84% error in\nmutation score. Meanwhile, mutant clustering approach, on average, accelerates\nmutation analysis by 35.31%, with an average 1.96% error in mutation score.

    "abstract": "Invariant learning demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing the\ngeneralization of graph neural networks (GNNs) with out-of-distribution (OOD)\ndata. It aims to recognize stable features in graph data for classification,\nbased on the premise that these features causally determine the target label,\nand their influence is invariant to changes in distribution. Along this line,\nmost studies have attempted to pinpoint these stable features by emphasizing\nexplicit substructures in the graph, such as masked or attentive subgraphs, and\nprimarily enforcing the invariance principle in the semantic space, i.e., graph\nrepresentations. However, we argue that focusing only on the semantic space may\nnot accurately identify these stable features. To address this, we introduce\nthe Unified Invariant Learning (UIL) framework for graph classification. It\nprovides a unified perspective on invariant graph learning, emphasizing both\nstructural and semantic invariance principles to identify more robust stable\nfeatures. In the graph space, UIL adheres to the structural invariance\nprinciple by reducing the distance between graphons over a set of stable\nfeatures across different environments. Simultaneously, to confirm semantic\ninvariance, UIL underscores that the acquired graph representations should\ndemonstrate exemplary performance across diverse environments. We present both\ntheoretical and empirical evidence to confirm our method's ability to recognize\nsuperior stable features. Moreover, through a series of comprehensive\nexperiments complemented by in-depth analyses, we demonstrate that UIL\nconsiderably enhances OOD generalization, surpassing the performance of leading\nbaseline methods.

    "abstract": "In blockchain-based order book systems, buyers and sellers trade assets,\nwhile it is miners to match them and include their transactions in the\nblockchain. It is found that many miners behave selfishly and myopically,\nprioritizing transactions with high fees and ignoring many desirable matches\nthat could enhance social welfare. Existing blockchain mechanisms fail to\naddress this issue by overlooking miners' selfish behaviors. To our best\nknowledge, this work presents the first analytical study to quantify and\nunderstand buyer and seller transaction fee choices and selfish miners'\ntransaction matching strategies, proving an infinitely large price of anarchy\n(PoA) for social welfare loss. To mitigate this, we propose an adjustable block\nsize mechanism that is easy to implement without altering the existing\ndecentralized protocols and still allows buyers and sellers to freely decide\ntransaction fees and miners to selfishly match. The analysis is challenging, as\npure strategy Nash equilibria do not always exist, requiring the analysis of\nmany buyers' or sellers' interactive mixed-strategy distributions. Moreover,\nthe system designer may even lack information about each buyer's or seller's\nbid/ask prices and trading quantities. Nevertheless, our mechanism achieves a\nwell-bounded PoA, and under the homogeneous-quantity trading for non-fungible\ntokens (NFT), it attains a PoA of 1 with no social welfare loss. We implement\nour mechanism on a local instance of Ethereum to demonstrate the feasibility of\nour approach. Experiments based on the realistic dataset demonstrate that our\nmechanism achieves social optimum for homogeneous-quantity trading like NFT. It\ncan enhance social welfare up to 3.7 times compared to the existing order book\nbenchmarks for heterogeneous-quantity trading of Bitcoin tokens.

We tackle these problems by employing a graph exploration\nframework grounded in machine learning. Leveraging the structure of the\nsubgraph gradually obtained from graph exploration, we construct prediction\nmodels to identify target hidden nodes in unknown social graphs. Through\nempirical investigations of real social graphs, we investigate the efficiency\nof graph exploration strategies in uncovering hidden nodes. Our results show\nthat our graph exploration strategies discover hidden nodes with an efficiency\ncomparable to that when the graph structure is known. Specifically, the query\ncost of discovering 10% of the hidden nodes is at most only 1.2 times that when\nthe topology is known, and the query-cost multiplier for discovering 90% of the\nhidden nodes is at most only 1.4. Furthermore, our results suggest that using\nnode embeddings, which are low-dimensional vector representations of nodes, for\nhidden-node discovery is a double-edged sword: it is effective in certain\nscenarios but sometimes degrades the efficiency of node discovery. Guided by\nthis observation, we examine the effectiveness of using a bandit algorithm to\ncombine the prediction models that use node embeddings with those that do not,\nand our analysis shows that the bandit-based graph exploration strategy\nachieves efficient node discovery across a wide array of settings.",

    "abstract": "As a common method in the field of computer vision, spatial attention\nmechanism has been widely used in semantic segmentation of remote sensing\nimages due to its outstanding long-range dependency modeling capability.\nHowever, remote sensing images are usually characterized by complex backgrounds\nand large intra-class variance that would degrade their analysis performance.\nWhile vanilla spatial attention mechanisms are based on dense affine\noperations, they tend to introduce a large amount of background contextual\ninformation and lack of consideration for intrinsic spatial correlation. To\ndeal with such limitations, this paper proposes a novel scene-Coupling semantic\nmask network, which reconstructs the vanilla attention with scene coupling and\nlocal global semantic masks strategies. Specifically, scene coupling module\ndecomposes scene information into global representations and object\ndistributions, which are then embedded in the attention affinity processes.\nThis Strategy effectively utilizes the intrinsic spatial correlation between\nfeatures so that improve the process of attention modeling. Meanwhile, local\nglobal semantic masks module indirectly correlate pixels with the global\nsemantic masks by using the local semantic mask as an intermediate sensory\nelement, which reduces the background contextual interference and mitigates the\neffect of intra-class variance. By combining the above two strategies, we\npropose the model SCSM, which not only can efficiently segment various\ngeospatial objects in complex scenarios, but also possesses inter-clean and\nelegant mathematical representations. Experimental results on four benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the the effectiveness of the above two strategies for\nimproving the attention modeling of remote sensing images.

    "abstract": "Recently, long-thought reasoning LLMs, such as OpenAI's O1, adopt extended\nreasoning processes similar to how humans ponder over complex problems. This\nreasoning paradigm significantly enhances the model's problem-solving abilities\nand has achieved promising results. However, long-thought reasoning process\nleads to a substantial increase in inference time. A pressing challenge is\nreducing the inference overhead of long-thought LLMs while ensuring accuracy.\nIn this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that long-thought reasoning models\nstruggle to effectively allocate token budgets based on problem difficulty and\nreasoning redundancies. To address this, we propose Length-Harmonizing\nFine-Tuning (O1-Pruner), aiming at minimizing reasoning overhead while\nmaintaining accuracy. This effective fine-tuning method first estimates the\nLLM's baseline performance through pre-sampling and then uses RL-style\nfine-tuning to encourage the model to generate shorter reasoning processes\nunder accuracy constraints. This allows the model to achieve efficient\nreasoning with lower redundancy while maintaining accuracy. Experiments on\nvarious mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that O1-Pruner not only\nsignificantly reduces inference overhead but also achieves higher accuracy,\nproviding a novel and promising solution to this challenge.

    "abstract": "Brain tumors are highly heterogeneous in terms of their spatial and scaling\ncharacteristics, making tumor segmentation in medical images a difficult task\nthat might result in wrong diagnosis and therapy. Automation of a task like\ntumor segmentation is expected to enhance objectivity, repeatability and at the\nsame time reducing turn around time. Conventional convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) exhibit sub-par performance as a result of their inability to accurately\nrepresent the range of tumor sizes and forms. Developing on that, UNets have\nbeen a commonly used solution for semantic segmentation, and it uses a\ndownsampling-upsampling approach to segment tumors. This paper proposes a novel\narchitecture that integrates Attention-UNet with repeated Atrous Spatial\nPyramid Pooling (ASPP). ASPP effectively captures multi-scale contextual\ninformation through parallel atrous convolutions with varying dilation rates.\nThis allows for efficient expansion of the receptive field while maintaining\nfine details. The attention provides the necessary context by incorporating\nlocal characteristics with their corresponding global dependencies. This\nintegration significantly enhances semantic segmentation performance.

However, DNN-based systems often suffer from reliability\nissues due to their inherent complexity and the stochastic nature of their\nunderlying models. Unfortunately, existing techniques to detect faults in DNN\nprograms are either limited by the types of faults (e.g., hyperparameter or\nlayer) they support or the kind of information (e.g., dynamic or static) they\nuse. As a result, they might fall short of comprehensively detecting and\ndiagnosing the faults. In this paper, we present DEFault (Detect and Explain\nFault) -- a novel technique to detect and diagnose faults in DNN programs. It\nfirst captures dynamic (i.e., runtime) features during model training and\nleverages a hierarchical classification approach to detect all major fault\ncategories from the literature. Then, it captures static features (e.g., layer\ntypes) from DNN programs and leverages explainable AI methods (e.g., SHAP) to\nnarrow down the root cause of the fault. We train and evaluate DEFault on a\nlarge, diverse dataset of ~14.5K DNN programs and further validate our\ntechnique using a benchmark dataset of 52 real-life faulty DNN programs. Our\napproach achieves ~94% recall in detecting real-world faulty DNN programs and\n~63% recall in diagnosing the root causes of the faults, demonstrating 3.92% -\n11.54% higher performance than that of state-of-the-art techniques.

The derived metric, influenced by DZ profile parameters, exhibits two\ndistinct regimes: for $r \\ll r_{\\rm c}$ (\\textcolor{black}{$r_{\\rm c}$ is a\ncharacteristic radius}), exponential corrections dominate, producing\nsignificant deviations from the Schwarzschild solution near dense cores, while\nfor $r \\gg r_{\\rm c}$, these corrections vanish, restoring the Schwarzschild\nmetric at large distances. These findings ensure consistency with general\nrelativity in vacuum. \\textcolor{black}{The black hole shadow and deflection\nangle are analyzed, demonstrating that the shadow radius increases with black\nhole mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$), while higher central densities ($\\rho_{\\rm ch}$)\nresult in smaller shadows, reflecting the environmental impact of dense dark\nmatter halos.} Photon dynamics reveal how DZ profiles modify critical impact\nparameters and effective potentials, with gravitational lensing effects highly\nsensitive to the characteristic radius ($r_{\\rm c}$). Smaller $r_{\\rm c}$\nvalues lead to larger deflection angles due to stronger gravitational effects\nnear compact cores. This work highlights the significance dark matter profiles\nin shaping black hole observables, providing a theoretical foundation for\nfuture observational studies and advancing the understanding of dark\nmatter-black hole interactions in astrophysical and cosmological contexts.",

This study presents a model trained using density functional theory\ndata for full concentration CuxW100-x compounds. Through this model, we\nsystematically investigate the structural and mechanical properties of W-Cu\nalloys and have the following findings. First, the bulk modulus (B) and Young's\nmodulus (E) of W-Cu alloys exhibit a linear decline as the Cu content\nincreases, indicating a softening trend in the CuxW100-x compounds as the Cu\nconcentration rises. Second, a higher Cu content results in higher critical\nstrain and lower critical stress for these compounds. A brittle-to-ductile\ntransition in the deformation mode predicted is predicted at around 37.5 at. %\nCu content. Third, tensile loading tests in the W-Cu gradient structure reveal\nthat Cu-poor region serves as a barrier, hindering shear band propagation while\npromoting new shear band formation in the Cu-rich region.

This source was observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite (TESS) in multiple sectors. We used the generalized Lomb-Scargle\nperiodogram method and weighted wavelet Z-transform method to search for\nsignificant periodic signals. The main results are as follows: We found QPOs of\n$\\sim$ 7.0 days (persisted for 4 cycles, with a significance of\n$\\sim3.5\\sigma$) and $\\sim$ 7.3 days (persisted for 5 cycles, with a\nsignificance of $\\sim3.8\\sigma$) in the light curves of Sector 47 and EP1,\nrespectively. Considering range of error, we consider them to be the same. We\ndiscussed two likely models of these rapid quasi-periodic variations: One comes\nfrom the jet and the other from the accretion disk. For the first one, we\nconsider kink instability of the jet as a plausible explanation. Second, the\nQPO is probable to come from the main hot spots in the accretion disk, which is\nlocated approximately within the innermost stable circular orbit allowed by\ngeneral relativity.

However, improperly positioned or designed\nvirtual content can be detrimental to task performance, as it can impair users'\nability to accurately interpret real-world information. In this paper we\nexamine two types of task-detrimental virtual content: obstruction attacks, in\nwhich virtual content prevents users from seeing real-world objects, and\ninformation manipulation attacks, in which virtual content interferes with\nusers' ability to accurately interpret real-world information. We provide a\nmathematical framework to characterize these attacks and create a custom\nopen-source dataset for attack evaluation. To address these attacks, we\nintroduce ViDDAR (Vision language model-based Task-Detrimental content Detector\nfor Augmented Reality), a comprehensive full-reference system that leverages\nVision Language Models (VLMs) and advanced deep learning techniques to monitor\nand evaluate virtual content in AR environments, employing a user-edge-cloud\narchitecture to balance performance with low latency. To the best of our\nknowledge, ViDDAR is the first system to employ VLMs for detecting\ntask-detrimental content in AR settings. Our evaluation results demonstrate\nthat ViDDAR effectively understands complex scenes and detects task-detrimental\ncontent, achieving up to 92.15% obstruction detection accuracy with a detection\nlatency of 533 ms, and an 82.46% information manipulation content detection\naccuracy with a latency of 9.62 s.",

A circle packing corresponding to\na graph $G$ is a configuration of disjoint disks such that each vertex of $G$\ncorresponds to a circle, two disks are externally tangent if and only if their\nvertices are connected by an edge in $G$, and $G$ is a triangulation of the\nsurface.

    "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are envisioned as a transformative\nmethod for enhancing the physical layer security of future communication\nnetworks. However, current IRS-assisted secure wireless system designs incur\nhigh time cost for the joint optimization of beamforming vectors and IRS phase\nshifts and are susceptible to unforeseen disruption. Therefore, introducing\nresilience in IRS-assisted secure systems is essential. In this paper, we first\nquantify the resilience performance as the combination of the absorption and\nadaptation performance. In particular, the absorption performance measures the\nsystem's robustness when facing failure while the adaptation performance\nreflects the system's ability to recover from failure. Then, we propose a\ntwo-timescale transmission protocol aiming to enhance system resilience while\nlimiting maximum information leakage to eavesdroppers. Specifically, in the\ninitialization phase, the base station (BS) beamforming vectors and IRS phase\nshifts are optimized iteratively using an alternating optimization (AO)\napproach to improve the absorption performance of the system, i.e., the\nworst-case achievable rate, given a predefined maximum tolerable leakage rate,\nby accounting for the impact of long-term channel variations. When the system\ndetects an outage, a fast system recovery mechanism is activated to restore\noperation by adjusting only the BS beamforming vectors, which enhances the\nadaptation performance of the system. Our numerical results reveal that the\nproposed algorithm significantly improves system resilience, including system\nrobustness and recovery performance. Moreover, the proposed design guarantees\noutage-free transmission over a long time interval for moderate-size IRSs.",
