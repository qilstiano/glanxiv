    "abstract": "We simulate the formation of Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) cores in the presence of\na Black Hole (BH) to explore whether BHs can serve as seeds for FDM core\ncondensation. Our analysis is based on the core-condensation via the kinetic\nrelaxation process for random initial conditions of the FDM. In a generic\nscenario the BH merges with a pre-collapsed mini-cluster formed in a random\nlocation, once they share location the core-condensation starts withe the FDM\ndensity centered at the black hole that during the process acquires a profile\nconsistent with that of the stationary solution of the FDM+BH eigenvalue\nproblem. These results indicate that BHs can indeed act as focal points for FDM\ncore condensation. Furthermore, we find that the central density of the\nresulting FDM core depends on the mass of the BH, which due to its permanent\nmotion relative to the FDM core during the evolution, produces a smaller core\ndensity for bigger BH masses; in this way the BH mass is a parameter leading to\na new diversity of central FDM core densities. As a collateral result, for our\nanalysis we revised the construction of stationary solutions of FDM+BH and\nfound a phenomenological formula for the FDM density that can be used to fit\nFDM cores around BHs.",

    "abstract": "Binary neutron stars (BNSs) detected in the Milky Way have the total masses\ndistributing narrowly around $\\sim2.6-2.7M_\\odot$, while the BNS merger\nGW190425 detected via gravitational wave has a significantly larger mass\n($\\sim3.4M_\\odot$). This difference is not well understood, yet. In this paper,\nwe investigate the BNS spin evolution via an improved binary star evolution\nmodel and its effects on the BNS observability, with implementation of various\nrelevant astrophysical processes. We find that the first-born neutron star\ncomponent in low-mass BNSs can be spun up to millisecond pulsars by the\naccretion of Roche-lobe overflow from its companion and its radio lifetime can\nbe comparable to the Hubble time. However, most high-mass BNSs have\nsubstantially shorter radio lifetime than the low-mass BNSs, and thus smaller\nprobability being detected via radio emission. Adopting the star formation and\nmetal enrichment history of the Milky Way given by observations, we obtain the\nsurvived Galactic BNSs with pulsar components from our population synthesis\nmodel and find that their distributions on the diagrams of spin period versus\nspin-period-time-derivative ($P-\\dot{P}$) and orbital period versus\neccentricity ($P_{\\rm orb}-e$) can well match those of the observed Galactic\nBNSs. The total mass distribution of the observed Galactic BNSs can also be\nmatched by the model. A significant fraction ($\\sim19\\%-22\\%$) of merging BNSs\nat redshift $z\\sim0$ have masses $\\gtrsim3M_\\odot$, which seems compatible with\nthe GW observations. Future radio observations may detect many more Galactic\nBNSs, which will put strong constraint on the spin evolution of BNSs during\ntheir formation processes.",

Furthermore, whilst QRE have full support for finite games,\nit is not clear how Q-Learning behaves as the game becomes large. In this\npaper, we characterise the critical exploration rate that guarantees\nconvergence to a unique fixed point, addressing the two shortcomings above.\nUsing a generating-functional method, we show that this rate increases with the\nnumber of players and the alignment of their payoffs. For many-player\ncoordination games with perfectly aligned payoffs, this exploration rate is\nroughly twice that of $p$-player zero-sum games. As for large games, we provide\na structural result for QRE, which suggests that as the game size increases,\nQ-Learning converges to a QRE near the boundary of the simplex of the action\nspace, a phenomenon we term asymptotic extinction, where a constant fraction of\nthe actions are played with zero probability at a rate $o(1/N)$ for an\n$N$-action game.",

This study evaluates the integration of traditional technical\nindicators with random forest regression models using minute-level SPY data,\nanalyzing 13 distinct model configurations. Our empirical results reveal a\nstark contrast between in-sample and out-of-sample performance, with $R^2$\nvalues deteriorating from 0.749--0.812 during training to negative values in\ntesting. A feature importance analysis demonstrates that primary price-based\nfeatures dominate the predictions made by the model, accounting for over 60% of\nthe importance, while established technical indicators, such as RSI and\nBollinger Bands, account for only 14%--15%. Although the indicator-enhanced\nmodels achieved superior risk-adjusted metrics, with Rachev ratios between\n0.919 and 0.961, they consistently underperformed a simple buy-and-hold\nstrategy, generating returns ranging from -2.4% to -3.9%.

    "abstract": "Photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction plays an important role in autonomous\ndriving, enabling the generation of novel data from existing datasets to\nsimulate safety-critical scenarios and expand training data without additional\nacquisition costs. Gaussian Splatting (GS) facilitates real-time,\nphotorealistic rendering with an explicit 3D Gaussian representation of the\nscene, providing faster processing and more intuitive scene editing than the\nimplicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). While extensive GS research has\nyielded promising advancements in autonomous driving applications, they\noverlook two critical aspects: First, existing methods mainly focus on\nlow-speed and feature-rich urban scenes and ignore the fact that highway\nscenarios play a significant role in autonomous driving. Second, while LiDARs\nare commonplace in autonomous driving platforms, existing methods learn\nprimarily from images and use LiDAR only for initial estimates or without\nprecise sensor modeling, thus missing out on leveraging the rich depth\ninformation LiDAR offers and limiting the ability to synthesize LiDAR data. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel GS method for dynamic scene synthesis and\nediting with improved scene reconstruction through LiDAR supervision and\nsupport for LiDAR rendering. Unlike prior works that are tested mostly on urban\ndatasets, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to focus on the more\nchallenging and highly relevant highway scenes for autonomous driving, with\nsparse sensor views and monotone backgrounds.

Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations\n(AIOps) tools have been developed to automate the process of log-based anomaly\ndetection for software systems. Three practical challenges are widely\nrecognized in this field: high data labeling costs, evolving logs in dynamic\nsystems, and adaptability across different systems. In this paper, we propose\nCroSysLog, an AIOps tool for log-event level anomaly detection, specifically\ndesigned in response to these challenges. Following prior approaches, CroSysLog\nuses a neural representation approach to gain a nuanced understanding of logs\nand generate representations for individual log events accordingly. CroSysLog\ncan be trained on source systems with sufficient labeled logs from open\ndatasets to achieve robustness, and then efficiently adapt to target systems\nwith a few labeled log events for effective anomaly detection. We evaluate\nCroSysLog using open datasets of four large-scale distributed supercomputing\nsystems: BGL, Thunderbird, Liberty, and Spirit. We used random log splits,\nmaintaining the chronological order of consecutive log events, from these\nsystems to train and evaluate CroSysLog. These splits were widely distributed\nacross a one/two-year span of each system's log collection duration, thereby\ncapturing the evolving nature of the logs in each system. Our results show\nthat, after training CroSysLog on Liberty and BGL as source systems, CroSysLog\ncan efficiently adapt to target systems Thunderbird and Spirit using a few\nlabeled log events from each target system, effectively performing anomaly\ndetection for these target systems. The results demonstrate that CroSysLog is a\npractical, scalable, and adaptable tool for log-event level anomaly detection\nin operational and maintenance contexts of software systems.",

    "abstract": "Jets clustered from heavy ion collision measurements combine a dense\nbackground of particles with those actually resulting from a hard partonic\nscattering. The background contribution to jet transverse momentum ($p_{T}$)\nmay be corrected by subtracting the collision average background; however, the\nbackground inhomogeneity limits the resolution of this correction. Many recent\nstudies have embedded jets into heavy ion backgrounds and demonstrated a\nmarkedly improved background correction is achievable by using neural networks\n(NNs) trained with aspects of jet substructure which are used to map measured\njet $p_\\mathrm{T}$ to the embedded truth jet $p_\\mathrm{T}$. However, jet\nquenching in heavy ion collisions modifies jet substructure, and\ncorrespondingly biases the NNs' background corrections. This study investigates\nthose biases by using simulations of jet quenching in central Au+Au collisions\nat $\\sqrt{s_\\mathrm{NN}}=200\\;\\mathrm{GeV}/c$ with hydrodynamically modeled\nquark-gluon plasma (QGP) evolution. To demonstrate the magnitude of the effect\nof such biases in measurement, a leading jet nuclear modification factor\n($R_\\mathrm{AA}$) is calculated and reported using the NN background correction\non jets quenched utilizing a brick of QGP.",

The measured electron temperatures in the\nhigh-ionization regions of these galaxies range from $T_e$([O III]) = 12,000 to\n24,000 K, consistent with temperatures observed in local metal-poor galaxies\nand previous JWST studies. In 10 galaxies, we also detect the [O II] auroral\nline, allowing us to determine electron temperatures in the low-ionization\nregions, which range between $T_e$([O II]) = 10,830 and 20,000 K. The\ndirect-$T_e$-based metallicities of our sample span from 12 + log(O/H) = 7.2 to\n8.4, indicating these high-redshift galaxies are relatively metal-poor.

Widely adopted QEC codes for FTQC,\nsuch as the surface code and color codes, utilize Clifford+T gate sets, where T\ngates are generally considered as the primary bottleneck due to their high\nresource costs. Recent advances in T gate optimization have significantly\nreduced this overhead, making Clifford gate complexity an increasingly critical\nbottleneck that remains largely unaddressed in present FTQC compiler and\narchitecture designs. To address this new bottleneck, this paper introduces\nTACO, a \\textbf{T}ranspiler-\\textbf{A}rchitecture \\textbf{C}odesign\n\\textbf{O}ptimization framework, to reduce Clifford cost. Specifically, we\nobserve that, through codesign, insights rooted in the FTQC architecture can\ninform novel circuit-level optimizations for FTQC compilers. These\noptimizations, in turn, provide new opportunities to redesign and improve the\nunderlying architecture. Evaluations show that TACO achieves an average 91.7%\nreduction in Clifford gates across diverse quantum circuits and significantly\nenhances gate parallelism compared to Pauli-based approaches. These\nimprovements enable an efficient FTQC architecture that can achieve\nsingle-gate-per-cycle throughput using only $1.5n+4$ logical qubit tiles,\nconsiderably pushing forward upon previously proposed designs that require\n$2n+\\sqrt{8n}+1$ tiles.

To summarise, failures in dangerous\ncapability testing may manifest in two ways: higher bias in our estimates of AI\ndanger, or larger lags in threshold monitoring. We highlight two drivers of\nthese failure modes: uncertainty around dynamics in AI capabilities and\ncompetition between frontier AI labs. Effective AI policy demands that we\naddress these failure modes and their drivers. Even if the optimal targeting of\nresources is challenging, we show how delays in testing can harm AI policy.

Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost\nconstraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this\ncan result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety\nconstraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates\ndesirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we\nfirst partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into\ndesirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high\nreward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories\nand low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates\ndesirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where\n(un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of\ndesirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the\ncomputational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is\nemployed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong\nconnections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback.

However, this graph is frequently suboptimal due to unreliable\nhigh-dimensional distances and the limited information extracted from the\nhigh-dimensional data. This problem is exacerbated as the dataset size\nincreases. If we reduce the size of the dataset by selecting points for a\nspecific sections of the embeddings, the clusters observed through DR are more\nseparable since the extracted subgraphs are more reliable. In this paper, we\nintroduce LocalMAP, a new dimensionality reduction algorithm that dynamically\nand locally adjusts the graph to address this challenge. By dynamically\nextracting subgraphs and updating the graph on-the-fly, LocalMAP is capable of\nidentifying and separating real clusters within the data that other DR methods\nmay overlook or combine. We demonstrate the benefits of LocalMAP through a case\nstudy on biological datasets, highlighting its utility in helping users more\naccurately identify clusters for real-world problems.",

    "abstract": "The finitary isomorphism theorem, due to Keane and Smorodinsky, raised the\nnatural question of how \"finite\" the isomorphism can be, in terms of moments of\nthe coding radius. More precisely, for which values does there exist an\nisomorphism between any two i.i.d. processes of equal entropy, with coding\nradii exhibiting finite t-moments? [3, 4]. Parry [13] and Krieger [10] showed\nthat those finite moments must be lesser than 1 in general, and Harvey and\nPeres [5] showed that they must be lesser than 1/2 in general. However, the\nquestion for the range between 0 and 1/2 remained open, and in fact no general\nconstruction of an isomorphism was shown to exhibit any non trivial finite\nmoments. In the present work we settle this problem, showing that between any\ntwo aperiodic Markov processes (and i.i.d. processes in particular) of the same\nentropy, there exists an isomorphism f with coding radii exhibiting finite\nt-moments for all t in (0,1/2). The isomorphism is constructed explicitly, and\nthe tails of the radii are shown to be optimal up to a poly-logarithmic factor.",

This term\nis based on a translation of the Chinese term \"Sha Zhu Pan\", where scammers\nrefer to victims as \"pig\" which are to be \"fattened up before slaughter\" so\nthat scammer can siphon off as much monetary value as possible. In this type of\nscam, attackers perform social engineering tricks on victims over an extended\nperiod to build credibility or relationships. After a certain period, when\nvictims transfer larger amounts of money to scammers, the fraudsters' platforms\nor profiles go permanently offline and the victims' money is lost.\n  In this work, we provide the first comprehensive study of pig-butchering\nscams from multiple vantage points. Our study analyzes the direct victims'\nnarratives shared on multiple social media platforms, public abuse report\ndatabases, and case studies from news outlets. Between March 2024 to October\n2024, we collected data related to pig butchering scams from (i) four social\nmedia platforms comprised of more than 430,000 social media accounts and\n770,000 posts; (ii) more than 3,200 public abuse reports narratives, and (iii)\nabout 1,000 news articles. Through automated and qualitative evaluation, we\nprovide an evaluation of victims of pig-butchering scams, finding 146 social\nmedia scammed users, 2,570 abuse reports narratives, and 50 case studies of 834\nsouls from news outlets. In total, we approximated losses of over \\$521 million\nrelated to such scams. To complement this analysis, we performed a survey on\ncrowdsourcing platforms with 584 users to broaden the insights on comparative\nanalysis of pig-butchering scams with other types of scams. Our research\nhighlights that these attacks are sophisticated and often require multiple\nentities, including policymakers and law enforcement, to work together\nalongside user education to create a proactive detection of such scams.",

    "abstract": "CuInS2 quantum dots have been studied in a broad range of applications, but\ndespite this, the fine details of their charge carrier dynamics remain a\nsubject of intense debate. Two of the most relevant points of discussion are\nthe hole dynamics and the influence of Cu:In synthesis stoichiometry on them.\nIt has been proposed that Cu-deficiency leads to the formation of Cu2+,\naffecting the localization of holes into Cu defects. Importantly, it is\nprecisely these confined hole states which are used to explain the interesting\nphotoluminescence properties of CuInS2 quantum dots. We use static X-ray\nspectroscopy to reveal no evidence for a measurable amount of native Cu2+\nstates in Cu-deficient samples. Instead, the improved properties of these\nsamples are explained by an increase of crystallinity, reducing the\nconcentration of mid gap states. Furthermore, to understand the charge carrier\ndynamics, herein we employ ultrafast optical transient absorption, and\nfluorescence up-conversion spectroscopies in combination with ultrafast X-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy using a hard X-ray free electron laser. We demonstrate\nthat in non-passivated samples, holes are transferred from Cu atoms in\nsub-picosecond timescales. We assign this transfer to occur towards the\nthiol-based ligands. Finally, we observe that Cu-deficient samples are more\nrobust against the photothermal heating effects of using higher laser fluences.\nThis is not the case for the stoichiometric sample, where heating effects on\nthe structure are directly observed.",

We investigate the ground-motion\ncharacteristics of cascading ruptures across damage zone fracture networks of\nmoderate-sized earthquakes using high-resolution 3D dynamic rupture\nsimulations. Our models feature a listric fault surrounded by over 800\nfractures, emulating a major fault and its associated damage zone. We analyze\nthree cases: a cascading rupture propagating within the fracture network, a\nnon-cascading main-fault rupture with off-fault fracture slip, and a main-fault\nrupture without a fracture network. Cascading ruptures within the fracture\nnetwork produce distinct ground-motion signatures with high-frequency content,\narising from simultaneous slip of multiple fractures and parts of the main\nfault, resembling source coda-wave-like signatures. This case shows elevated\nnear-field characteristic frequency (fc) and stress drop, approximately an\norder of magnitude higher than the estimation directly on the fault of the\ndynamic rupture simulation. The inferred fc of the modeled vertical components\nreflects the complexity of the radiation pattern and rupture directivity of\ncascading earthquakes. We show that this is consistent with observations of\nstrong azimuthal dependence of corner frequency in the 2009-2016 Central\nApennines, Italy, earthquake sequence. Simulated ground motions from cascading\nruptures also show pronounced azimuthal variations in peak ground acceleration\n(PGA), peak ground velocity, and pseudo-spectral acceleration, with average PGA\nnearly double that of the non-cascading cases. Such outcomes emphasize the\ncritical role of fault-zone complexity in affecting rupture dynamics and\nseismic radiation and have important implications for physics-based seismic\nhazard assessment.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently identifying sleep stages is crucial for unraveling the\nintricacies of sleep in both preclinical and clinical research. The\nlabor-intensive nature of manual sleep scoring, demanding substantial\nexpertise, has prompted a surge of interest in automated alternatives. Sleep\nstudies in mice play a significant role in understanding sleep patterns and\ndisorders and underscore the need for robust scoring methodologies. In\nresponse, this study introduces LG-Sleep, a novel subject-independent deep\nneural network architecture designed for mice sleep scoring through\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) signals. LG-Sleep extracts local and global temporal\ntransitions within EEG signals to categorize sleep data into three stages:\nwake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.\nThe model leverages local and global temporal information by employing\ntime-distributed convolutional neural networks to discern local temporal\ntransitions in EEG data. Subsequently, features derived from the convolutional\nfilters traverse long short-term memory blocks, capturing global transitions\nover extended periods. Crucially, the model is optimized in an\nautoencoder-decoder fashion, facilitating generalization across distinct\nsubjects and adapting to limited training samples. Experimental findings\ndemonstrate superior performance of LG-Sleep compared to conventional deep\nneural networks. Moreover, the model exhibits good performance across different\nsleep stages even when tasked with scoring based on limited training samples.",

    "abstract": "As large language models scale, training them requires thousands of GPUs over\nextended durations--making frequent failures an inevitable reality. While\ncheckpointing remains the primary fault-tolerance mechanism, existing methods\nfall short when applied to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Due to their\nsubstantially larger training state, MoE models exacerbate checkpointing\noverheads, often causing costly stalls or prolonged recovery that severely\ndegrade training efficiency.\n  We present MoEtion, a distributed, in-memory checkpointing system tailored\nfor MoE models. MoEtion is built on three key ideas: (1) sparse checkpointing,\nwhich incrementally snapshots subsets of experts across iterations to reduce\noverhead; (2) a sparse-to-dense checkpoint conversion mechanism that\nincrementally reconstructs consistent dense checkpoints from sparse snapshots;\nand (3) upstream logging of activations and gradients at pipeline-stage\nboundaries, enabling localized recovery without re-executing unaffected\nworkers. Evaluations across diverse MoE models with up to 64 experts show that\nMoEtion reduces checkpointing overhead by up to \\(4\\times\\) and recovery\noverhead by up to \\(31\\times\\) compared to state-of-the-art approaches,\nsustaining consistently high Effective Training Time Ratios (ETTR) of up to\n$\\ge 0.94$ even under frequent failures (MTBF as low as 10 minutes) and\ndelivering up to $8\\times$ overall training speedup, all without compromising\nsynchronous training semantics. Overall, MoEtion offers a robust and scalable\nfault-tolerance solution for the next generation of sparsely activated models.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the evolution of a particle wave function when it propagates\nthrough free space in the longitudinal z-direction from a thin entrance slit to\na detector behind a thin exit slit parallel to the horizontal y-axis. We\nconsider an extra aperture slit between the two slits to probe the evolution of\nthe wave function and close the aperture slit starting from wide open until the\ndetection counting rate in a repeated experiment drops to half. When all the\nslits are long and thin, the 1D Schroedinger equation gives the wave function\nevolution until the final detection. The width of the aperture slit in the\nvertical x-direction depends on the z-position of the slit providing an\napproximate description of the wave function evolution. The width of the\nfunction characterizing this dependence starts from the entrance slit. It grows\nwider until it reaches a maximum and then shrinks narrower and finally\ncollapses into the exit slit where the particle is detected. Thus the envelope\nof this function has a spindle shape with its pointed ends at the two slits.\nHence it is very different from the well-known wave function of the\nSchroedinger equation with the initial condition at the entrance slit, which is\nnarrow only at the beginning, then grows wider until it reaches the exit slit,\nwhere it is much larger than the slit width. However, the phase information is\nlost because the aperture slit distorts the wave function. To keep the phase\ninformation, we replace the aperture slit with a thin pin (parallel to the\ny-axis) that blocks the wave function. We then study its perturbative effect on\nthe counting rate of the detector. This analysis provides a function to probe\nthe process of the wave function collapse right before the detection. We show\nthis function is real-valued, with amplitude and phase information, and is\nclosely related to the wave function.",

    "abstract": "In the class of immersed boundary (IB) methods, the choice of the delta\nfunction plays a crucial role in transferring information between fluid and\nsolid domains. Most prior work has used isotropic kernels that do not preserve\nthe divergence-free condition of the velocity field, leading to loss of\nincompressibility of the solid when interpolating velocity to Lagrangian\nmarkers. To address this issue, in simulations involving large deformations of\nincompressible hyperelastic structures immersed in fluid, researchers often use\nstabilization approaches such as adding a volumetric energy term. Composite\nB-spline (CBS) kernels offer an alternative by maintaining the discrete\ndivergence-free property. This work evaluates CBS kernels in terms of volume\nconservation and accuracy, comparing them with isotropic kernel functions using\na construction introduced by Peskin (IB kernels) and B-spline (BS) kernels.\nBenchmark tests include pressure-loaded and shear-dominated flows, such as an\nelastic band under pressure loads, a pressurized membrane, a compressed block,\nCook's membrane, and a slanted channel flow. Additionally, we validate our\nmethodology using a complex fluid-structure interaction model of bioprosthetic\nheart valve dynamics. Results demonstrate that CBS kernels achieve superior\nvolume conservation compared to isotropic kernels, eliminating the need for\nstabilization techniques. Further, CBS kernels converge on coarser fluid grids,\nwhile IB and BS kernels need finer grids for comparable accuracy. Unlike IB and\nBS kernels, which perform better with larger mesh ratios, CBS kernels improve\nwith smaller mesh ratios. Wider kernels provide more accurate results across\nall methods, but CBS kernels are less sensitive to grid spacing variations than\nisotropic kernels.",

Here, the (ex post) regret\nexperienced by the decision maker is defined as the difference between the cost\nincurred by a chosen decision given a particular realization of the objective\ncoefficients and the minimum achievable cost with perfect knowledge of the\ncoefficients at the outset. For this class of ambiguity sets, the worst-case\nexpected regret is shown to equal the expected regret under the nominal\ndistribution plus a regularization term that has the effect of drawing optimal\nsolutions toward the \"center\" of the feasible region as the radius of the\nambiguity set increases. This novel form of regularization is also shown to\narise when minimizing the worst-case conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of\nregret.

    "abstract": "We develop a hydrodynamic description of self-generated electrolyte flow in\ncapillaries whose bounding walls feature both non-uniform distributions of\ncharge and non-uniform active ionic fluxes. The hydrodynamic velocity arising\nin such a system has components that are forbidden by symmetry in the absence\nof charge and fluxes. However, when these two boundary mechanisms are\nsimultaneously present, they can lead to a symmetry broken state where steady\nflows with both unidirectional and circulatory components emerge. We show that\nthese flow states arise when modulated boundary patterns of charge and fluxes\nare offset by a flux-charge phase difference, which is associated with the\nseparation between sites of their peak densities on the wall. Mismatch in\ndiffusivity of cationic and anionic species can modify the flow states and\nbecomes an enhancing factor when fluxes of both ion species are being produced\ntogether at the same site. We demonstrate that this mechanism can be realized\nwith a microfluidic generator which is powered by enzyme-coated patches that\ncatalyzes reactants in the solution to produce fluxes of ions. The local ionic\nelevation or depletion that disrupts a non-uniform double layer, promotes\nself-induced gradients yielding persistent body forces to generate bulk fluid\nmotion. Our work quantifies a boundary-driven mechanism behind self-sustained\nelectrolyte flow in confined environments that exists without any external\nbulk-imposed fields or gradients. It provides a theoretical framework for\nunderstanding the combined effect of active and charged boundaries that are\nrelevant in biological or soft matter systems, and can be utilized in\nelectrofluidic and iontronic applications.",

    "abstract": "As microstructure property models improve, additional information from\ncrystallographic degrees of freedom and grain boundary networks (GBNs) can be\nincluded in microstructure design problems. However, the high dimensional\nnature of including this information precludes the use of many common\noptimization approaches and requires less efficient methods to generate quality\ndesigns. Previous work demonstrated that human-in-the-loop optimization,\ninstantiated as a video game, achieved high-quality, efficient solutions to\nthese design problems. However, such data is expensive to obtain. In the\npresent work, we show how a Decision Transformer machine learning (ML) model\ncan be used to learn from the optimization trajectories generated by human\nplayers, and subsequently solve materials design problems. We compare the ML\noptimization trajectories against players and a common global optimization\nalgorithm: simulated annealing (SA). We find that the ML model exhibits a\nvalidation accuracy of 84% against player decisions, and achieves solutions of\ncomparable quality to SA (92%), but does so using three orders of magnitude\nfewer iterations. We find that the ML model generalizes in important and\nsurprising ways, including the ability to train using a simple constitutive\nstructure-property model and then solve microstructure design problems for a\ndifferent, higher-fidelity, constitutive structure-property model without any\nretraining.

This\nstudy proposes a new mixed-supervision approach for training multitask networks\nin digital pathology by incorporating cell counts derived from the eyeballing\nprocess--a quick visual estimation method commonly used by pathologists. This\nstudy has two main contributions: (1) It proposes a mixed-supervision strategy\nfor digital pathology that utilizes cell counts obtained by eyeballing as an\nauxiliary supervisory signal to train a multitask network for the first time.\n(2) This multitask network is designed to concurrently learn the tasks of cell\ncounting and cell localization, and this study introduces a consistency loss\nthat regularizes training by penalizing inconsistencies between the predictions\nof these two tasks.

    "abstract": "Accurate energy price forecasting is crucial for participants in day-ahead\nenergy markets, as it significantly influences their decision-making processes.\nWhile machine learning-based approaches have shown promise in enhancing these\nforecasts, they often remain confined to the specific markets on which they are\ntrained, thereby limiting their adaptability to new or unseen markets. In this\npaper, we introduce a cross-domain adaptation model designed to forecast energy\nprices by learning market-invariant representations across different markets\nduring the training phase. We propose a doubly residual N-BEATS network with\nKolmogorov Arnold networks at its core for time series forecasting. These\nnetworks, grounded in the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, offer a\npowerful way to approximate multivariate continuous functions. The cross domain\nadaptation model was generated with an adversarial framework. The model's\neffectiveness was tested in predicting day-ahead electricity prices in a zero\nshot fashion. In comparison with baseline models, our proposed framework shows\npromising results. By leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, our model can\npotentially enhance its ability to capture complex patterns in energy price\ndata, thus improving forecast accuracy across diverse market conditions. This\naddition not only enriches the model's representational capacity but also\ncontributes to a more robust and flexible forecasting tool adaptable to various\nenergy markets.",

On the other hand, the multiplicative\ngroup $\\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ is cyclic and any generator of this group is a\nprimitive element. Many past works have dealt with the existence of primitive\nand normal elements with specified properties, including the existence of\nprimitive elements whose traces over intermediate extensions are prescribed.\nInspired by the latter, in this paper we explore the existence of normal\nelements whose norms over intermediate extensions are prescribed.

We determine the reddening effect of an\nabsorption system by fitting an un-reddened template spectrum to a sample of\n50,674 QSO spectra that contain Mg II absorbers. We find that reddening caused\nby intervening absorbers (voff > 3500 km/s) has an average color excess of\nE(B-V) = 0.04 magnitudes. We find that the E(B-V) tends to be greater for\nabsorbers at low redshifts, or those having Mg II absorption lines with higher\nequivalent widths, but shows no clear trend with voff for intervening systems.\nHowever, the E(B-V) of associated absorbers, those at voff < 3500 km/s, shows a\nstrong trend with voff , increasing rapidly with decreasing voff and peaking\n(approximately 0.15 magnitudes) around voff = 0 km/s. We demonstrate that Mg II\nabsorbers impact redshift estimation for QSOs by investigating the\ndistributions of voff for associated absorbers. We find that at z > 1.5 these\ndistributions broaden and bifurcate in a nonphysical manner. In an effort to\nmitigate this effect, we mask pixels associated with the Mg II absorption lines\nand recalculate the QSO redshifts. We find that we can recover voff populations\nin better agreement with those for z < 1.5 absorbers and in doing so typically\nshift background QSO redshifts by delta_z approximately equal to plus or minus\n0.005.",

In this paper, we evaluate the conceptual understanding of uncertainty\nusing the Concise Data Processing Assessment (CDPA) test.

Following the analysis of student responses (N = 2023),\nwe specifically investigate data collected in second-year courses to better\nunderstand what student errors reveal about common misconceptions in\nexperimental physics. This more in-depth analysis focuses on data collected\nfrom students at the beginning and end of two consecutive experimental\nlaboratory courses that build on each other. By the end of the second course,\nstudents have engaged with all the material covered in the CDPA test. Overall\nresults show an upward shift in student understanding of uncertainties over\ntime.

WPA3 comes with exciting new features that allows for\nincreased security of Wi-Fi networks. One such feature is the Simultaneous\nAuthentication of Equals (SAE) which is a protocol whereby passphrases are\nhashed using a Password Authenticated Key Exchange with keys from both the\nAccess Point and the Client making the password resistant to offline dictionary\nattacks.

This method can prove to be useful given that majority of\nnetwork attacks stem from social engineering. For this research we would be\nlooking at the security of WPA3 personal transition mode and capture the\nnetwork password via a captive portal.

Due to the discovery of Dragonblood downgrade attacks disclosed in 2019,\nidentified that WPA2/3Handshakes could be acquired. A Man in the Middle attack\nproposed set up is carried out by using race conditions to deauthentication\nWPA3 network and then using a Raspberry Pi to spawn a rouge WPA3 network.

Next, for safe operation with a human\ndriver, we simplify it to a maximum-power-or-coast operation in full-throttle\nregions (straights). Thereby, both the positions from which the vehicle should\nstart coasting and the optimal throttle map are subject to tuning. To this end,\nwe define the coasting sections with a threshold on the co-state trajectory of\nthe kinetic energy from the optimal solution. We devise an online implementable\nbisection algorithm to tune this threshold and adapt it using PI feedback.\nFinally, we validate the proposed approach for an electric endurance race car\nand compare three variants with varying implementation challenges: one\nre-optimizing and updating the kinetic co-state trajectory online, one applying\nonly the bisection algorithm online, and one relying exclusively on feedback\ncontrol.

    "abstract": "Administrative burden has been growing in organizations despite many\ncounterproductive effects. We develop a system dynamics model to explain why\nthis phenomenon occurs and to explore potential remedies. Prior literature has\nidentified behavioral mechanisms leading to process creation, obsolescence, and\nremoval, but typically examines them individually. Here, we integrate these\nmechanisms in the context of an organization allocating limited resources to\ncompeting priorities. We show that their interaction -- via accumulation and\nfeedback loops -- leads to two possible outcomes: a sustainable equilibrium,\nwhere administrative costs stabilizes, and runaway administrative bloat, where\nadministrative costs and waste accumulate in a self-reinforcing cycle. The two\noutcomes are separated by a critical threshold in management behavioral\nparameters -- the propensity to create processes in response to problems, and\nthe propensity to prune obsolete processes in response to administrative\nburden. Rapid environmental change worsens the threshold, making bloat more\nlikely. We evaluate several intervention strategies using simulation and find\nthat lasting reductions in administrative costs and waste require two key\ncommitments: a permanent shift in organizational priorities, and investment in\ndiscerning obsolete processes from useful ones. In contrast, temporary shifts\nand indiscriminate process cuts offer only short-lived relief.\nCounterintuitively, we find that prioritizing direct production can increase\nadministrative waste. Our findings suggest that while dynamic environments make\nadministrative bloat more likely, administrative bloat is not inevitable --\nmanagers play a critical role in preventing or reversing it.",

We\ntest this framework on both Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models and chaotic\nLorenz-96 systems, analysing the ability of KANs to sparsify input features by\nidentifying Granger causal relationships, providing a concise yet accurate\nmodel for Granger causality detection. Our findings show the potential of KANs\nto outperform MLPs in discerning interpretable Granger causal relationships,\nparticularly for the ability of identifying sparse Granger causality patterns\nin high-dimensional settings, and more generally, the potential of AI in\ncausality discovery for the dynamical laws in physical systems.",

    "abstract": "Physics-based deep learning frameworks have shown to be effective in\naccurately modeling the dynamics of complex physical systems with\ngeneralization capability across problem inputs. Data-driven networks like GNN,\nNeural Operators have proved to be very effective in generalizing the model\nacross unseen domain and resolutions. But one of the most critical issues in\nthese data-based models is the computational cost of generating training\ndatasets. Complex phenomena can only be captured accurately using deep networks\nwith large training datasets. Furthermore, numerical error of training samples\nis propagated in the model errors, thus requiring the need for accurate data,\ni.e. FEM solutions on high-resolution meshes. Multi-fidelity methods offer a\npotential solution to reduce the training data requirements. To this end, we\npropose a novel GNN architecture, Multi-Fidelity U-Net, that utilizes the\nadvantages of the multi-fidelity methods for enhancing the performance of the\nGNN model. The proposed architecture utilizes the capability of GNNs to manage\ncomplex geometries across different fidelity levels, while enabling flow of\ninformation between these levels for improved prediction accuracy for\nhigh-fidelity graphs. We show that the proposed approach performs significantly\nbetter in accuracy and data requirement and only requires training of a single\nnetwork compared to other benchmark multi-fidelity approaches like transfer\nlearning. We also present Multi-Fidelity U-Net Lite, a faster version of the\nproposed architecture, with 35% faster training, with 2 to 5% reduction in\naccuracy. We carry out extensive validation to show that the proposed models\nsurpass traditional single-fidelity GNN models in their performance, thus\nproviding feasible alternative for addressing computational and accuracy\nrequirements where traditional high-fidelity simulations can be time-consuming.",

Using 2D axisymmetric (magneto-)hydrodynamic\nsimulations with Athena++ implementing fully coupled thermochemistry, we\ninvestigate the signatures of the two winds in CO and [C~I] ALMA observations,\nand examine the potential to distinguish the origins. Our simulations reveal\nfundamental differences between the two winds: magnetized winds are colder and\ndenser, exhibiting super-Keplerian rotation with small poloidal velocities of\n$\\lesssim 1~{\\rm km~s}^{-1}$ in the atmosphere ($z/R\\gtrsim0.45$), while\nphotoevaporative winds are hotter and less dense, exhibiting sub-Keplerian\nrotation with higher poloidal velocity of several ${\\rm km~s}^{-1}$. In\naddition to previously identified factors like thermal pressure gradient and\ndisk's self-gravity, we demonstrate that magnetic tension/pressure and\nadvection significantly influence rotational velocities of the gas in the wind,\nwhich lead to emission patterns that are distinct from Keplerian rotation in\nsynthetic ALMA observations. Magnetized winds are visible in CO channel maps\nwhen wind loss rates are $\\gtrsim10^{-8}~M_\\odot~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. When wind loss\nrates are lower, magnetized winds produce subtle perturbations in channel maps,\nwhich resemble the so-called ``velocity kinks'' produced by protoplanets. While\nphotoevaporative winds dissociate CO through strong XUV radiation and thus are\nweaker in CO, they can create observable ring-like substructures.

However, this problem\nis challenging due to the spatial heterogeneity of the environment. Existing\ndata-driven methods mostly focus on studying homogeneous areas with limited\nsize (e.g. a single urban area such as New York City) and fail to handle the\nheterogeneous accident patterns over space at different scales. Recent advances\n(e.g. spatial ensemble) utilize pre-defined space partitions and learn multiple\nmodels to improve prediction accuracy. However, external knowledge is required\nto define proper space partitions before training models and pre-defined\npartitions may not necessarily reduce the heterogeneity. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel Learning-Integrated Space Partition Framework (LISA) to\nsimultaneously learn partitions while training models, where the partitioning\nprocess and learning process are integrated in a way that partitioning is\nguided explicitly by prediction accuracy rather than other factors. Experiments\nusing real-world datasets, demonstrate that our work can capture underlying\nheterogeneous patterns in a self-guided way and substantially improve baseline\nnetworks by an average of 13.0%.",

However, in the strong injection limit, nonlinearities\ndominate close to the injection site and a soliton is formed; this solution has\nbeen termed a contact soliton dissipative exchange flow (CS-DEF). Here, we\nnumerically investigate CS-DEF solutions in a moderate injection regime and a\nfinite injection width. We find a solution where two metastable solitons\ncoexist in the injection region. This solution is metastable in the sense that\nany perturbation to the system will eject one of the solitons out of the\ninjection region. Moreover, soliton dynamics can be excited when two injection\nregions are separated by a certain distance. We find that the ensuing DEF\nbetween the solitons induces a steady-state dynamics in which metastable\nsolitons are continually ejected and nucleated. Furthermore, and depending on\nthe relative signs of the spin injections, the soliton dynamics possess a\nparticular handedness and frequency related to the spin transfer torque\ndelivered by the DEF. Our results provide insights into the transport of spin\ncurrent by DEFs - where the interaction between DEFs and solitons suggests a\nmechanism for detaching contact-solitons from the injection boundary. Although\nthis study focuses on the \"nonlocal\" interaction between solitons, it may lead\nto the investigation of new mechanisms for inserting solitons in a DEF, e.g.,\nfor discrete motion and transport of information over long distances.",

We propose a fine-tuning approach where we adapt the\ndiffusion model by conditioning it with real images and novel text embeddings.\nWe introduce a unique procedure called Mixing Visual Concepts (MVC) where we\ncreate novel text embeddings from image captions. The MVC enables us to\ngenerate multiple images which are diverse and yet similar to the real data\nenabling us to perform effective dataset augmentation. We perform comprehensive\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations with the proposed dataset augmentation\napproach showcasing both coarse-grained and finegrained changes in generated\nimages.

    "abstract": "This work investigates the impact of device length on thermal conductivity in\nperiodic and aperiodic superlattices (SLs). While it is well known that thermal\nconductivity in aperiodic SLs exhibits a weaker dependence on device length\ncompared to periodic SLs, existing literature attributes this behavior to the\nscattering of coherent phonons by aperiodically arranged interfaces. Through\natomistic wave-packet simulations, we show that coherent phonons in aperiodic\nSLs have spatial extensions limited to a certain number of SL layers, which\nprevents transmission if the extension is shorter than the device length.\nSpecifically, the disordered interface spacing in aperiodic SLs causes coherent\nphonons to behave as non-propagative vibrational modes, resulting in diffuse\nenergy transmission. In periodic SLs, however, coherent phonons can propagate\nacross the entire structure, enabling high transmission. The difference between\nballistic transport in periodic SLs and diffuse transport in aperiodic SLs is\ncaptured in the length-dependence of phonon transmission. These findings\nprovide new insights into phonon coherence and its implications for heat\nconduction in superlattices, with potential applications in the thermal design\nof nanostructures.",

Besides accuracy,\ninterpretability is also a key requirement for spatiotemporal forecasting\nmodels to justify the decisions. Interpretation of the spatiotemporal\nforecasting mechanism is, however, challenging due to the complexity of\nmulti-source spatiotemporal features, the non-intuitive nature of\nspatiotemporal patterns for non-expert users, and the presence of spatial\nheterogeneity in the data. Currently, no existing deep learning model\nintrinsically interprets the complex predictive process learned from\nmulti-source spatiotemporal features. To bridge the gap, we propose GeoPro-Net,\nan intrinsically interpretable spatiotemporal model for spatiotemporal event\nforecasting problems. GeoPro-Net introduces a novel Geo-concept convolution\noperation, which employs statistical tests to extract predictive patterns in\nthe input as Geo-concepts, and condenses the Geo-concept-encoded input through\ninterpretable channel fusion and geographic-based pooling. In addition,\nGeoPro-Net learns different sets of prototypes of concepts inherently, and\nprojects them to real-world cases for interpretation.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion generative models have yielded remarkable\nprogress. While the quality of generated content continues to improve, these\nmodels have grown considerably in size and complexity. This increasing\ncomputational burden poses significant challenges, particularly in\nresource-constrained deployment scenarios such as mobile devices. The\ncombination of model pruning and knowledge distillation has emerged as a\npromising solution to reduce computational demands while preserving generation\nquality. However, this technique inadvertently propagates undesirable\nbehaviors, including the generation of copyrighted content and unsafe concepts,\neven when such instances are absent from the fine-tuning dataset. In this\npaper, we propose a novel bilevel optimization framework for pruned diffusion\nmodels that consolidates the fine-tuning and unlearning processes into a\nunified phase. Our approach maintains the principal advantages of\ndistillation-namely, efficient convergence and style transfer\ncapabilities-while selectively suppressing the generation of unwanted content.\nThis plug-in framework is compatible with various pruning and concept\nunlearning methods, facilitating efficient, safe deployment of diffusion models\nin controlled environments.",

This transition moves from a heavy Fermi\nliquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*'\nstate, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with\nfractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is\ndriven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge\nunder an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random\nKondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical\ntransport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower in a 'skewed' marginal Fermi\nliquid, with similarities to the skewed non-Fermi liquid of Georges and Mravlje\n(arXiv:2102.13224). Our findings are consistent with recent observations in\nheavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an\nenhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a\nnon-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply\nto single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In\nthe ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice\ntransition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the\ncondensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower\non the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the\ncuprates (C. Collignon et al., arXiv:2011.14927; A.

    "abstract": "Simulating the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) is one of\nthe most promising applications of quantum simulators. Regularizing a bosonic\nQFT for quantum simulation purposes typically involves a truncation in Hilbert\nspace in addition to a discretization of space. Here, we discuss how to perform\nsuch a regularization of scalar QFTs by explicitly constructing suitable\nmany-body lattice Hamiltonians using multi-level or qudit systems, and show\nthat this enables quantitative predictions in the continuum limit by\nextrapolating results obtained for large-spin models. With extensive\nmatrix-product state simulations, we numerically demonstrate the sequence of\nextrapolations that leads to quantitative agreement of observables for the\nintegrable sine-Gordon (sG) QFT. We further show how to prepare static and\nmoving soliton excitations, and analyze their scattering dynamics in the\ncontinuum limit, in agreement with a semi-classical model and with quantitative\nanalytical predictions. Finally, we illustrate how a non-integrable\nperturbation of the sG model gives rise to dynamics reminiscent of string\nbreaking and plasma oscillations in gauge theories. Our methods are directly\napplicable in state-of-the-art analog quantum simulators, opening the door to\nquantitatively investigating a wide variety of scalar field theories and\ntackling long-standing questions in non-equilibrium QFT like the fate of the\nfalse vacuum.",

Roughly two years after the initial\nASAS-SN discovery, a second flare was detected coincident with ASASSN-22ci.\nUV/optical photometry and optical spectroscopy indicate that both flares are\nlikely powered by TDEs. The striking similarity in flare properties suggests\nthat these flares result from subsequent disruptions of the same star. Each\nflare rises on a timescale of $\\sim$30 days, has a temperature of\n$\\approx$30,000 K, a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{UV/Opt} = 10^{43.6 -\n43.9} \\textrm{ erg} \\textrm{ s}^{-1}$, and exhibits a blue optical spectrum\nwith broad H, He, and N lines. No X-ray emission is detected during either\nflare, but X-ray emission with an unabsorbed luminosity of $L_{X} =\n3\\times10^{41} \\textrm{ erg} \\textrm{ s}^{-1}$ and $kT = 0.042$ eV is observed\nbetween the flares. Pre-discovery survey observations rule out the existence of\nearlier flares within the past $\\approx$6000 days, indicating that the\ndiscovery of ASASSN-22ci likely coincides with the first flare. If the observed\nflare separation of $720 \\pm 4.7$ days is the orbital period, the next flare of\nASASSN-22ci should occur near MJD 61075 (2026 February 04). Finally, we find\nthat the existing sample of repeating TDE candidates is consistent with Hills\ncapture of a star initially in a binary with a total mass between $\\sim$$1 - 4$\nM$_{\\odot}$ and a separation of $\\sim$$0.01 - 0.1$ AU.",

    "abstract": "The advent of non-Hermitian physics has enriched the plethora of topological\nphases to include phenomena without Hermitian counterparts. Despite being among\nthe most well-studied uniquely non-Hermitian features, the topological\nproperties of multifold exceptional points, $n$-fold spectral degeneracies\n(EP$n$s) at which also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce, were only\nrecently revealed in terms of topological resultant winding numbers and\nconcomitant Abelian doubling theorems. Nevertheless, a more mathematically\nfundamental description of EP$n$s and their topological nature has remained an\nopen question. To fill this void, in this article, we revisit the topological\nclassification of EP$n$s in generic systems and systems with local symmetries,\ngeneralize it in terms of more mathematically tractable (local) similarity\nrelations, and extend it to include all such similarities as well as non-local\nsymmetries. Through the resultant vector, whose components are given in terms\nof the resultants between the corresponding characteristic polynomial and its\nderivatives, the topological nature of the resultant winding number is\nunderstood in several ways: in terms of i) the tenfold classification of\n(Hermitian) topological matter, ii) the framework of Mayer--Vietoris sequence,\nand iii) the classification of vector bundles. The classification scheme\nfurther predicts the existence of topological bulk Fermi arcs protected by a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-invariant, induced by non-local symmetries, dubbed\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-protected Fermi arcs. Our work reveals the mathematical\nfoundations on which the topological nature of EP$n$s resides, enriches the\ntheoretical understanding of non-Hermitian spectral features, and will\ntherefore find great use in modern experiments within both classical and\nquantum physics.",

This allows us to bypass the need for ground-truth\nedited images and unlock training for the first time on datasets comprising\neither real image-caption pairs or image-caption-edit triplets. We empirically\nshow that our unsupervised technique performs better across a broader range of\nedits with high fidelity and precision.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models, and their generalization, flow matching, have had a\nremarkable impact on the field of media generation. Here, the conventional\napproach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of\nGaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as\ntext-to-image generation, this same mapping from noise to image is learnt\nwhilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far\nrelatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that, unlike Diffusion\nmodels, they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise.\nHence, in this paper, we propose a paradigm shift, and ask the question of\nwhether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping\nfrom the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another, thus\nobviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism.\nWe present a general and simple framework, CrossFlow, for cross-modal flow\nmatching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input\ndata, and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly,\nfor text-to-image, CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention\nslightly outperforms standard flow matching, and we show that it scales better\nwith training steps and model size, while also allowing for interesting latent\narithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space.\nTo demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we also show that\nCrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various\ncross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks, viz. image captioning, depth\nestimation, and image super-resolution.

Pioneering works introduce NTP to\nautoregressive visual generation tasks. In this work, we rethink the NTP for\nautoregressive image generation and extend it to a novel Next Patch Prediction\n(NPP) paradigm. Our key idea is to group and aggregate image tokens into patch\ntokens with higher information density. By using patch tokens as a more compact\ninput sequence, the autoregressive model is trained to predict the next patch,\nsignificantly reducing computational costs. To further exploit the natural\nhierarchical structure of image data, we propose a multi-scale coarse-to-fine\npatch grouping strategy. With this strategy, the training process begins with a\nlarge patch size and ends with vanilla NTP where the patch size is 1$\\times$1,\nthus maintaining the original inference process without modifications.\nExtensive experiments across a diverse range of model sizes demonstrate that\nNPP could reduce the training cost to around 0.6 times while improving image\ngeneration quality by up to 1.0 FID score on the ImageNet 256x256 generation\nbenchmark. Notably, our method retains the original autoregressive model\narchitecture without introducing additional trainable parameters or\nspecifically designing a custom image tokenizer, offering a flexible and\nplug-and-play solution for enhancing autoregressive visual generation.",

In this\npaper, we introduce AutoTrust, a comprehensive trustworthiness benchmark for\nlarge vision-language models in autonomous driving (DriveVLMs), considering\ndiverse perspectives -- including trustfulness, safety, robustness, privacy,\nand fairness. We constructed the largest visual question-answering dataset for\ninvestigating trustworthiness issues in driving scenarios, comprising over 10k\nunique scenes and 18k queries. We evaluated six publicly available VLMs,\nspanning from generalist to specialist, from open-source to commercial models.\nOur exhaustive evaluations have unveiled previously undiscovered\nvulnerabilities of DriveVLMs to trustworthiness threats. Specifically, we found\nthat the general VLMs like LLaVA-v1.6 and GPT-4o-mini surprisingly outperform\nspecialized models fine-tuned for driving in terms of overall trustworthiness.\nDriveVLMs like DriveLM-Agent are particularly vulnerable to disclosing\nsensitive information. Additionally, both generalist and specialist VLMs remain\nsusceptible to adversarial attacks and struggle to ensure unbiased\ndecision-making across diverse environments and populations.

Recently, in image\ngeneration, VAR proposes scale-wise autoregressive modeling, which extends the\nnext token prediction to the next scale prediction, preserving the 2D structure\nof images. However, VAR encounters two primary challenges: (1) its complex and\nrigid scale design limits generalization in next scale prediction, and (2) the\ngenerator's dependence on a discrete tokenizer with the same complex scale\nstructure restricts modularity and flexibility in updating the tokenizer. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce FlowAR, a general next scale prediction\nmethod featuring a streamlined scale design, where each subsequent scale is\nsimply double the previous one. This eliminates the need for VAR's intricate\nmulti-scale residual tokenizer and enables the use of any off-the-shelf\nVariational AutoEncoder (VAE). Our simplified design enhances generalization in\nnext scale prediction and facilitates the integration of Flow Matching for\nhigh-quality image synthesis.

Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can\napproach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise\non the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two\nmethods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum\nlubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy\ncycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance\nfluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a\nnoise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or\nadiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed\nto increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be\nconsistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly,\nby comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a\nprojectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction\nfor this quantum engine model is investigated.",

To alleviate this issue, we propose\na contamination-free and more challenging MCQ benchmark called MMLU-CF. This\nbenchmark reassesses LLMs' understanding of world knowledge by averting both\nunintentional and malicious data leakage.

Continuing on from our previous\nwork, we turn our attention to the issue of Krylov complexity upon the\ninsertion of a class of single-particle operators in the double-scaled SYK\nmodel. Such an operator is described by a matter-chord insertion, which splits\nthe theory into left/right sectors, allowing us, via chord-diagram technology,\nto compute two different notions of complexity associated to the operator\ninsertion: first a Krylov operator complexity, and second the Krylov complexity\nof a state obtained by an operator acting on the thermofield double state. We\nwill provide both an analytic proof and detailed numerical evidence, that both\nKrylov complexities arise from a recursively defined basis of states\ncharacterized by a constant total chord number. As a consequence, in all cases\nwe are able to establish that Krylov complexity is given by the expectation\nvalue of a length operator acting on the Hilbert space of the theory, expressed\nin terms of basis states, organized by left and right chord number. We find\nanalytic expressions for the semiclassical limit of K-complexity, and study how\nthe size of the operator encodes the scrambling dynamics upon the matter\ninsertion in Krylov language. We furthermore determine the effective\nHamiltonian governing the evolution of K-complexity, showing that evolution on\nthe Krylov chain can equivalently be understood as a particle moving in a Morse\npotential. A particular type of triple scaling limit allows to access the\ngravitational sector of the theory, in which the geometrical nature of\nK-complexity is assured by virtue of being a total chord length, in an\nanalogous fashion to what was found in [1] for the K-complexity of the\nthermofield double state.",

    "abstract": "Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity,\nand complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as\nnatural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods\ntreat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task,\ngeneralist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these\ngeneralist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the\nperformance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to\nnegative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific\nspecialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training\npolicies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than\ndeploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we\nnon-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test\ntime. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts\nof low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the \"sub\"-trajectory granularity\nenables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness\nin adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory\nretrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared\ncross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging\npre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve\nsub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion.\nSTRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning\nmethods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much\nlarger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn\nrobust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.",

In a\nquantum error correcting code (QECC), a collection of computational degrees of\nfreedom that make up a device's physical layer is used to redundantly encode a\nsmaller amount of logical information. We elaborate this clear parallel in\nterms of quantum reference frames (QRFs), which are a universal toolkit for\nquantization in the presence of symmetries. The result is a precise dictionary\nbetween QECCs and QRFs within the perspective-neutral framework for constrained\nsystems. Concepts from quantum error correction like error sets and\ncorrectability translate to novel insights into the informational architecture\nof gauge theories. Conversely, the dictionary provides a systematic procedure\nfor constructing symmetry-based QECCs and characterizing their error correcting\nproperties. In this initial work, we scrutinize the dictionary between Pauli\nstabilizer codes and their corresponding QRF setups, which possess symmetry\ngroups that are isomorphic to the stabilizer group. We show that there is a\none-to-one correspondence between maximal correctable error sets and tensor\nfactorizations splitting system from frame degrees of freedom, relative to\nwhich errors corrupt only redundant frame data. When passed through the\ndictionary, standard Pauli errors from the code essentially behave as electric\nexcitations that are exactly dual, via Pontryagin duality, to magnetic\nexcitations related to gauge-fixing.

The\nresults seem to suggest that LLMs still work as (highly advanced) data pattern\nidentifiers, scoring poorly when attempting to generalise and solve reasoning\nproblems the models have never previously seen or that are not close to samples\npresented in their training data. To address this compelling concern, this\npaper makes use of the notion of critical questions from the literature on\nargumentation theory, focusing in particular on Toulmin's model of\nargumentation. We show that employing these critical questions can improve the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs. By probing the rationale behind the models'\nreasoning process, the LLM can assess whether some logical mistake is occurring\nand correct it before providing the final reply to the user prompt. The\nunderlying idea is drawn from the gold standard of any valid argumentative\nprocedure: the conclusion is valid if it is entailed by accepted premises. Or,\nto paraphrase such Aristotelian principle in a real-world approximation,\ncharacterised by incomplete information and presumptive logic, the conclusion\nis valid if not proved otherwise. This approach successfully steers the models'\noutput through a reasoning pipeline, resulting in better performance against\nthe baseline and its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) implementation.

We also develop a protocol\nusing Shortcuts to Adiabaticity (STA) techniques that allows us to include the\neffects of static traps. By computing a measure of the error after transport\nand two measures of the heating for transient times, we provide a systematic\ncharacterization of the performance of all the considered pulses and show that\nour proposed STA protocol outperforms the experimentally inspired pulses. After\npulse shape optimization we find a lower threshold for the total time of the\nprotocol that is compatible with the limit below which the increase in the\nvibrational excitations exceeds half of the amount of states hosted by the\nmoving tweezer.

In order to identify the most\n  statistically accurate parametrization, we apply a newly developed\ncross-validation method as a ``model selection'' tool. We confirm that the\n  spectral function contains a power-law divergent edge in the QLRO phase and a\nvery sharp (likely $\\delta$-function) magnon peak in the AFM phase.\n  From our SAC results, we extract the dispersion relation in the different\nregimes of the model, and in the AFM phase we extract the weight of\n  the magnon pole. In the limit where the model reduces to the conventional\nHeisenberg chain with nearest-neighbor interactions, our $S(k,\\omega)$\n  agrees well with known Bethe ansatz results. In the AFM phase the low-energy\ndispersion relation is known to be nonlinear, $\\omega_k \\sim k^z$,\n  and we extract the corresponding dynamic exponent $z(\\alpha)$, which in\ngeneral is somewhat above the form obtained in linear spin-wave\n  theory. We also find a significant continuum above the magnon peak. This\nstudy serves as a benchmark for SAC/QMC studies of systems with a transition\n  from conventional to fractionalized quasi-particles.",

The ability of the SPT to point accurately at the\nsky is limited by its structural imperfections, which are impacted by the\nextreme weather at the South Pole. Pointing accuracy is particularly important\nduring SPT participation in observing campaigns with the Event Horizon\nTelescope (EHT), which requires stricter accuracy than typical observations\nwith the SPT. We compile a training dataset of historical observations of\nastronomical sources made with the SPT-3G and EHT receivers on the SPT. We\ntrain two XGBoost models to learn a mapping from current weather conditions to\ntwo telescope drive control arguments -- one which corrects for errors in\nazimuth and the other for errors in elevation. Our trained models achieve root\nmean squared errors on withheld test data of $2.14''$ in cross-elevation and\n$3.57''$ in elevation, well below our goal of $5''$ along each axis. We deploy\nour models on the telescope control system and perform further in situ test\nobservations during the EHT observing campaign in 2024 April. Our models result\nin significantly improved pointing accuracy: for sources within the range of\ninput variables where the models are best trained, average combined pointing\nerror improved 33%, from $15.9''$ to $10.6''$. These improvements, while\nsignificant, fall shy of our ultimate goal, but they serve as a proof of\nconcept for the development of future models. Planned upgrades to the EHT\nreceiver on the SPT will necessitate even stricter pointing accuracy which will\nbe achievable with our methods.",

To address this, we propose a transferable framework that reduces the\ndata bottleneck by using a unified digital human model as a common prototype\nand bypassing the need for re-training on every new robot platform. The model\nlearns behavior primitives from human demonstrations through adversarial\nimitation, and the complex robot structures are decomposed into functional\ncomponents, each trained independently and dynamically coordinated. Task\ngeneralization is achieved through a human-object interaction graph, and skills\nare transferred to different robots via embodiment-specific kinematic motion\nretargeting and dynamic fine-tuning. Our framework is validated on five\nhumanoid robots with diverse configurations, demonstrating stable\nloco-manipulation and highlighting its effectiveness in reducing data\nrequirements and increasing the efficiency of skill transfer across platforms.",

By encoding quantum information into logical\nqubits utilizing quantum error correcting codes, physical errors can be\ndetected and corrected, enabling substantial reduction in logical error rates.\nHowever, the set of logical operations that can be easily implemented on such\nencoded qubits is often constrained, necessitating the use of special resource\nstates known as 'magic states' to implement universal, classically hard\ncircuits. A key method to prepare high-fidelity magic states is to perform\n'distillation', creating them from multiple lower fidelity inputs. Here we\npresent the experimental realization of magic state distillation with logical\nqubits on a neutral-atom quantum computer. Our approach makes use of a\ndynamically reconfigurable architecture to encode and perform quantum\noperations on many logical qubits in parallel. We demonstrate the distillation\nof magic states encoded in d=3 and d=5 color codes, observing improvements of\nthe logical fidelity of the output magic states compared to the input logical\nmagic states. These experiments demonstrate a key building block of universal\nfault-tolerant quantum computation, and represent an important step towards\nlarge-scale logical quantum processors.",

This includes hiring\nmarkets, where employers have increasingly been interested in using automated\ntools to help hire candidates. In response, there has been significant effort\nto understand and mitigate the sources of discrimination in these tools.\nHowever, previous work has largely assumed that discrimination, in any area of\nML, is the result of some initial \\textit{unequal distribution of resources}\nacross groups: One group is on average less qualified, there is less training\ndata for one group, or the classifier is less accurate on one group, etc.\nHowever, recent work have suggested that there are other sources of\ndiscrimination, such as relational inequality, that are notably\nnon-distributional. First, we show consensus in strategy choice is a\nnon-distributional source of inequality at equilibrium in games: We provide\nsubgame perfect equilibria in a simple sequential model of a hiring market with\nRubinstein-style bargaining between firms and candidates that exhibits\nasymmetric wages resulting from differences in agents' threat strategies during\nbargaining. Second, we give an initial analysis of how agents could learn such\nstrategies via convergence of an online learning algorithm to asymmetric\nequilibria.

Exploiting these structural differences, in 2018,\nBeelen, Bossert, Puchinger and Rosenkilde proposed a subfamily of Maximum\nDistance Separable (MDS) Twisted Reed-Solomon (TRS) codes over $\\mathbb{F}_q$\nwith $\\ell$ twists $q \\approx n^{2^{\\ell}}$ for McEliece encryption, claiming\ntheir resistance to both Sidelnikov Shestakov attack and Schur products--based\nattacks. In short, they claimed these codes to resist to classical key recovery\nattacks on McEliece encryption scheme instantiated with Reed-Solomon (RS) or\nGRS codes. In 2020, Lavauzelle and Renner presented an original attack on this\nsystem based on the computation of the subfield subcode of the public TRS code.\n  In this paper, we show that the original claim on the resistance of TRS and\nTGRS codes to Schur products based--attacks is wrong. We identify a broad class\nof codes including TRS and TGRS ones that is distinguishable from random by\ncomputing the Schur square of some shortening of the code. Then, we focus on\nthe case of single twist (i.e., $\\ell = 1$), which is the most efficient one in\nterms of decryption complexity, to derive an attack. The technique is similar\nto the distinguisher-based attacks of RS code-based systems given by Couvreur,\nGaborit, Gauthier-Uma\\~na, Otmani, Tillich in 2014.",

Additionally, we introduce an online DPO algorithm to address\nthe off-policy optimization and scalability issue in existing video preference\nlearning frameworks. By employing the video reward model to offer concise video\nfeedback on the fly, OnlineVPO offers effective and efficient preference\nguidance.

The generated gravitational wave spectrum is enhanced in the\nintermediate frequency regime and exhibits interesting \"knee\" and \"ankle\"\nfeatures, the most common of which is related to the turn on of the dark force\nmediator radiation. Other such spectral features are related to changes in the\nbinary merger lifetime and the probability distribution for the initial binary\nseparation. The stochastic gravitational wave background from sub-solar-mass\ndark binaries is detectable by both space- and ground-based gravitational wave\nobservatories.",

When considering the entire Pantheon+ sample, we\nfind very strong evidence ($\\ln B> 5$) in favour of timescape over\n$\\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, even restricting the sample to redshifts beyond any\nconventional scale of statistical homogeneity, $z > 0.075$, timescape is\npreferred over $\\Lambda$CDM with $\\ln B> 1$. These results provide evidence for\na need to revisit the foundations of theoretical and observational cosmology.",

    "abstract": "The Kuramoto model (KM) of $n$ coupled phase-oscillators is analyzed in this\nwork. The KM on a Cayley graph possesses a family of steady state solutions\ncalled twisted states. Topologically distinct twisted states are distinguished\nby the winding number $q\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. These states are known to be stable for\nsmall enough $q$. In the presence of small noise, the KM exhibits metastable\ntransitions between $q$-twisted states: A typical trajectory remains in the\nbasin of attraction of a given $q$-twisted state for an exponentially long\ntime, but eventually transitions to the vicinity of another such state. In the\ncourse of this transition, it passes in close proximity of a saddle of Morse\nindex $1$, called a relevant saddle. In this work, we provide an exhaustive\nanalysis of metastable transitions in the stochastic KM with nearest-neighbor\ncoupling. We start by analyzing the equilibria and their stability. First, we\nidentify all equilibria in this model. Using the discrete Fourier transform and\neigenvalue estimates for rank-1 perturbations of symmetric matrices, we\nclassify the equilibria by their Morse indices. In particular, we identify all\nstable equilibria and all relevant saddles involved in the metastable\ntransitions. Further, we use Freidlin-Wentzell theory and the\npotential-theoretic approach to metastability to establish the metastable\nhierarchy and sharp estimates of Eyring-Kramers type for the transition times.\nThe former determines the precise order, in which the metastable transitions\noccur, while the latter characterizes the times between successive transitions.\nThe theoretical estimates are complemented by numerical simulations and a\ncareful numerical verification of the transition times. Finally, we discuss the\nimplications of this work for the KM with other coupling types including\nnonlocal coupling and the continuum limit as $n$ tends to infinity.",

Then, we rank the importance of\nall modules to determine the specific layers that should be pruned to meet\nparticular performance requirements. Furthermore, we develop a new group\nfine-tuning strategy to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs. Finally, we\nevaluate the proposed SAAP method on multiple LLMs across two common tasks,\ni.e., zero-shot classification and text generation. Experimental results show\nthat our SAAP method outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods,\nachieving 2.17%, 2.37%, and 2.39% accuracy gains on LLaMA-7B, Vicuna-7B, and\nLLaMA-13B. Additionally, SAAP improves the token generation speed by 5%,\nshowcasing its practical advantages in resource-constrained scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables operations on encrypted data,\nmaking it extremely useful for privacy-preserving applications, especially in\ncloud computing environments. In such contexts, operations like ranking, order\nstatistics, and sorting are fundamental functionalities often required for\ndatabase queries or as building blocks of larger protocols. However, the high\ncomputational overhead and limited native operations of FHE pose significant\nchallenges for an efficient implementation of these tasks. These challenges are\nexacerbated by the fact that all these functionalities are based on comparing\nelements, which is a severely expensive operation under encryption. Previous\nsolutions have typically based their designs on swap-based techniques, where\ntwo elements are conditionally swapped based on the results of their\ncomparison. These methods aim to reduce the primary computational bottleneck:\nthe comparison depth, which is the number of non-parallelizable homomorphic\ncomparisons in the algorithm. The current state of the art solution for sorting\nby Hong et al. (IEEE TIFS 2021), for instance, achieves a comparison depth of k\nlog_k^2 N. In this paper, we address the challenge of reducing the comparison\ndepth by shifting away from the swap-based paradigm. We present solutions for\nranking, order statistics, and sorting, that achieve a comparison depth of up\nto 2 (constant), making our approach highly parallelizable and suitable for\nhardware acceleration. Leveraging the SIMD capabilities of the CKKS FHE scheme,\nour approach re-encodes the input vector under encryption to allow for\nsimultaneous comparisons of all elements with each other. Experimental results\nshow that our approach ranks a 128-element vector in approximately 5.76s,\ncomputes its argmin/argmax in 12.83s, and sorts it in 78.64s.",

Three distinct scenarios of oscillations as a response to the\nsubstrate vibrations have been identified. The first scenario reflects a common\nsituation where the droplet can follow the substrate vibrations. In the other\ntwo scenarios, favored in the case of hydrophilic substrates, droplet\noscillations generate high shear rates that ultimately lead to droplet breakup.\nLeveraging our simulation model, the properties of the droplet and the\nmechanisms related to the oscillations are analyzed with a molecular-level\nresolution, while results are also put in the perspective of experiment. Our\nstudy suggests that the three scenarios can be distinguished by the\ncontact-surface velocity of the oscillating droplet, with threshold velocities\ninfluenced by the substrate's wettability. Moreover, the mean magnitude of the\nparticle velocity at the contact surface plays a key role in determining the\nthree oscillation phases, suggesting that the capillary number of the\noscillating droplet governs the phase behavior. Thus, our approach aims to\noptimize droplet oscillations and deformations on solid substrates, which have\ndirect implications for technological applications.",

    "abstract": "The standard cosmological model currently in force, aka $\\Lambda$CDM, has\nbeen plagued with a variety of tensions in the last decade or so, which puts it\nagainst the wall. At the core of the $\\Lambda$CDM we have a rigid cosmological\nterm, $\\Lambda$, for the entire cosmic history. Recently, the results from the\nDESI collaboration suggested the possibility that dark energy (DE) should be\ndynamical rather than just a cosmological constant. Using a generic $w_0w_a$CDM\nparameterization, DESI favors quintessence behavior at $\\sim 3\\sigma$ c.l.\nHowever, to alleviate the tensions the DE needs more features. In the proposed\n$w$XCDM model of [45] the DE is actually a composite cosmic fluid with two\ncomponents $(X,Y)$ acting sequentially: first $X$ (above a transition redshift\n$z_t$) and second $Y$ (below $z_t$). Fitting the model to the data, we find\nthat the late component $Y$ behaves as quintessence, like DESI. However, to\ncure the $H_0$ and growth tensions, $X$ must behave as `phantom matter' (PM),\nwhich in contrast to phantom DE provides positive pressure at the expense of\nnegative energy density. Using the SNIa (considering separately Pantheon$+$ and\nDESY5), cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data, and the full CMB\nlikelihood from Planck 2018, we find that both tensions can be completely cut\ndown. We also compare the $w$XCDM with our own results using the standard\n$w$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM parameterizations of the DE. In all cases, model $w$XCDM\nperforms much better. Finally, we have repeated our analysis with BAO 3D data\n(replacing BAO 2D), and we still find that the main dynamical DE models\n(including composite ones) provide a much better fit quality compared to\n$\\Lambda$CDM. The growth tension is alleviated again, but in contrast, the\n$H_0$-tension remains significant, which is most likely reminiscent of the\ninternal conflict in the BAO sector.",

The experimental results were compared with\npredictions from the previously reported simple exponential and the adapted\ntransmission line models, as well as with a long-wavelength approximation.\nResults: Both models effectively predicted the trends in lead tip temperature\nrise for all the wire configurations, with the adapted transmission line model\nshowing superior accuracy.

This paper addresses these gaps by\nproviding a thorough review of FAI, focusing on theoretical perspectives both\nfor and against its development, and presenting a formal definition in a clear\nand accessible format. Key applications are discussed from the perspectives of\neXplainable AI (XAI), privacy, fairness and affective computing (AC).\nAdditionally, the paper identifies challenges in current technological\nadvancements and explores future research avenues.

This paper presents an end-to-end paradigm that predicts actions\nusing inverse dynamics models conditioned on the robot's forecasted visual\nstates, named Predictive Inverse Dynamics Models (PIDM). By closing the loop\nbetween vision and action, the end-to-end PIDM can be a better scalable action\nlearner. In practice, we use Transformers to process both visual states and\nactions, naming the model Seer. It is initially pre-trained on large-scale\nrobotic datasets, such as DROID, and can be adapted to realworld scenarios with\na little fine-tuning data. Thanks to large-scale, end-to-end training and the\nsynergy between vision and action, Seer significantly outperforms previous\nmethods across both simulation and real-world experiments. It achieves\nimprovements of 13% on the LIBERO-LONG benchmark, 21% on CALVIN ABC-D, and 43%\nin real-world tasks.

Some novae lack\nspectra with sufficient resolution and signal-to-noise ratios; therefore, we\nsupplement as necessary with 3D and 2D dust maps. Utilising only novae with\nDIB- or 3D-map-based $E(B-V)$, we find an average intrinsic $(B-V)_0$ colour of\nnovae at $V$-band light curve peak of 0.20 with a standard deviation of 0.31,\nbased on 25 novae. When the light curve has declined by 2 magnitudes ($t_2$),\nwe find an average $(B-V)_0 = -0.03$ with a standard deviation of 0.19. These\naverage colours are consistent with previous findings, although the spreads are\nlarger than previously found due to more accurate reddening estimates. We also\nexamined the intrinsic $(R-I)_0$ and $(V-R)_0$ colours across our sample. These\ncolours behave similarly to $(B-V)_0$, except that the $(V-R)_0$ colour gets\nredder after peak, likely due to the contributions of emission line flux. We\nsearched for correlations between nova colours and $t_2$, peak $V$-band\nabsolute magnitude, and GeV $\\gamma$-ray luminosity, but find no statistically\nsignificant correlations. Nova colours can therefore be used as standard\n``crayons\" to estimate interstellar reddening from photometry alone, with\n0.2--0.3 mag uncertainty. We present a novel Bayesian strategy for estimating\ndistances to Galactic novae based on these $E(B-V)$ measurements, independent\nof assumptions about luminosity, built using 3D dust maps and a stellar mass\nmodel of the Milky Way.",

    "abstract": "In the realm of Text-Based Person Search (TBPS), mainstream methods aim to\nexplore more efficient interaction frameworks between text descriptions and\nvisual data. However, recent approaches encounter two principal challenges.\nFirstly, the widely used random-based Masked Language Modeling (MLM) considers\nall the words in the text equally during training. However, massive\nsemantically vacuous words ('with', 'the', etc.) be masked fail to contribute\nefficient interaction in the cross-modal MLM and hampers the representation\nalignment. Secondly, manual descriptions in TBPS datasets are tedious and\ninevitably contain several inaccuracies. To address these issues, we introduce\nan Attention-Guided Alignment (AGA) framework featuring two innovative\ncomponents: Attention-Guided Mask (AGM) Modeling and Text Enrichment Module\n(TEM). AGM dynamically masks semantically meaningful words by aggregating the\nattention weight derived from the text encoding process, thereby cross-modal\nMLM can capture information related to the masked word from text context and\nimages and align their representations. Meanwhile, TEM alleviates low-quality\nrepresentations caused by repetitive and erroneous text descriptions by\nreplacing those semantically meaningful words with MLM's prediction. It not\nonly enriches text descriptions but also prevents overfitting. Extensive\nexperiments across three challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our AGA, achieving new state-of-the-art results with Rank-1 accuracy\nreaching 78.36%, 67.31%, and 67.4% on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, and RSTPReid,\nrespectively.",

This new knowledge raises new ethical questions, such as: When is\nit (un)justifiable to develop an AI system, and how to make design choices,\nconsidering its environmental impact?

    "abstract": "Retrieve-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks have emerged as a promising\nsolution to multi-hop question answering(QA) tasks since it enables large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to incorporate external knowledge and mitigate their\ninherent knowledge deficiencies. Despite this progress, existing RAG\nframeworks, which usually follows the retrieve-then-read paradigm, often\nstruggle with multi-hop QA with temporal information since it has difficulty\nretrieving and synthesizing accurate time-related information. To address the\nchallenge, this paper proposes a novel framework called review-then-refine,\nwhich aims to enhance LLM performance in multi-hop QA scenarios with temporal\ninformation. Our approach begins with a review phase, where decomposed\nsub-queries are dynamically rewritten with temporal information, allowing for\nsubsequent adaptive retrieval and reasoning process. In addition, we implement\nadaptive retrieval mechanism to minimize unnecessary retrievals, thus reducing\nthe potential for hallucinations. In the subsequent refine phase, the LLM\nsynthesizes the retrieved information from each sub-query along with its\ninternal knowledge to formulate a coherent answer. Extensive experimental\nresults across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nframework, highlighting its potential to significantly improve multi-hop QA\ncapabilities in LLMs.",

To move towards fully\nsimulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a\ncomprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis.\nIn this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of\nmodel discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model\nmisspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the\nstatistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for\ndistortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections\nto classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and\ngoodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient\nself-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We\ndemonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the\nconnection to classical results where they are valid.

The aim of this work is to analyse the signatures of these glitches and\nunderstand the origin of the differences in these signatures between G-type and\nF-type stars. We fit the glitch signatures in the frequencies, second\ndifferences, and $r_{010}$ ratios while assuming either a sinusoidal variation\nor a more complex expression. The fit provides the acoustic depth, and hence\nthe position, of the bottom of the convective envelope for nine \\textit{Kepler}\nstars and the Sun. We find that for F-type stars, the most commonly used\nfitting expressions for the glitch of the bottom of the convective envelope\nprovide different measurements of the position of the bottom of the convective\nenvelope for the three seismic indicators, while it is not the case for G-type\nstars. When adding an additional term in the fitting expression with twice the\nacoustic depth of the standard term (a contribution that accounts for the\nhighly non-sinusoidal shape of the signature in the $r_{010}$ ratios), we find\nbetter agreement between the three seismic indicators and with the prediction\nof stellar evolution models. While the origin of this additional term is not\nyet understood, this may be an indication that the transition between the\nconvective envelope and the underlying radiative zone is different for G- and\nF-type stars. This outcome brings new insight into the physics in these\nregions.",

Many of these applications are yet to be realised,\nprimarily because engineering long-lived coherent superpositions of multiple\nrotational states is highly challenging. Here, we investigate how multilevel\ncoherences between rotational states can be engineered by using optical tweezer\ntraps operating close to a magic wavelength for a given pair of states. By\nperforming precision Ramsey spectroscopy we find the exact magic wavelengths\nand sensitivities to detuning errors for multiple rotational state\nsuperpositions. We find that, for a trap polarised parallel to the quantisation\naxis, the magic wavelengths are closely clustered enabling long-lived coherence\nacross multiple rotational states simultaneously. As an example, we demonstrate\nsimultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising\nthis extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a\ngeneralised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in\nthe rotational states.

These problems are ubiquitous in\nseveral scientific fields, but more accurate solutions are specifically needed\nas a prerequisite for many quantum simulation tasks. To address this, we\nestablish three methods in detail: quantum adiabatic evolution with optimal\ncontrol, the Rodeo Algorithm, and the Variational Rodeo Algorithm. The first\nmethod explored is adiabatic evolution, a technique that prepares quantum\nstates by simulating a quantum system that evolves slowly over time. The\nadiabatic theorem can be used to ensure that the system remains in an\neigenstate throughout the process, but its implementation can often be\ninfeasible on current quantum computing hardware. We employ a unique approach\nusing optimal control to create custom gate operations for superconducting\nqubits and demonstrate the algorithm on a two-qubit IBM cloud quantum computing\ndevice. We then explore an alternative to adiabatic evolution, the Rodeo\nAlgorithm, which offers a different approach to eigenstate preparation by using\na controlled quantum evolution that selectively filters out undesired\ncomponents in the wave function stored on a quantum register. We show results\nsuggesting that this method can be effective in preparing eigenstates, but its\npracticality is predicated on the preparation of an initial state that has\nsignificant overlap with the desired eigenstate. To address this, we introduce\nthe novel Variational Rodeo Algorithm, which replaces the initialization step\nwith dynamic optimization of quantum circuit parameters to increase the success\nprobability of the Rodeo Algorithm. The added flexibility compensates for\ninstances in which the original algorithm can be unsuccessful, allowing for\nbetter scalability.",

However, nonlinear\ndynamics of vehicle and traffic systems make accurate modeling and real-time\noptimization challenging. Learning-based control offer a promising alternative,\nas they adapt to environment without requiring an explicit model. For learning\ncontrol framework, an augmented state space system design is necessary since\noptimal control depends on both the ego vehicle's state and predicted states of\nother vehicles. This work develops a traffic adaptive augmented state space\nsystem that allows the control strategy to intelligently adapt to varying\ntraffic conditions. This design ensures that while different vehicle\ntrajectories alter initial conditions, the system dynamics remain independent\nof specific trajectories. Additionally, a physics-informed learning control\nframework is presented that combines value function from Bellman's equation\nwith derivative of value functions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle into a\nunified loss function.

    "abstract": "Some recent papers have extended the concept of finite-time stability (FTS)\nto the context of 2D linear systems, where it has been referred to as\nfinite-region stability (FRS). FRS methodologies make even more sense than the\nclassical FTS approach developed for 1D-systems, since, typically, at least one\nof the state variables of 2D-systems is a space coordinate, rather than a time\nvariable. Since space coordinates clearly belong to finite intervals, FRS\ntechniques are much more effective than the classical Lyapunov approach, which\nlooks to the asymptotic behavior of the system over an infinite interval. To\nthis regard, the novel contribution of this paper goes in several directions.\nFirst, we provide a novel sufficient condition for the FRS of linear\ntime-varying (LTV) discrete-time 2D-systems, which turns out to be less\nconservative than those ones provided in the existing literature. Then, an\ninteresting application of FRS to the context of iterative learning control\n(ILC) is investigated, by exploiting the previously developed theory. In\nparticular, a new procedure is proposed so that the tracking errors of the ILC\nlaw converges within the desired bound in a finite number of iterations.\nFinally, a sufficient condition to solve the finite-region stabilization\nproblem is proposed. All the results provided in the paper lead to optimization\nproblems constrained by linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), that can be solved\nvia widely available software. Numerical examples illustrate and validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed technique.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we employed the Ising model to identify phase transitions in a\nmagnetic system where the degree distribution of the network follows a\npower-law and the connections are assortatively mixed. In the Ising model, the\nspins assume only two values, $\\sigma = \\pm 1$, and interact through\nferromagnetic coupling $J$. The network is characterized by four variable\nparameters: $\\alpha$ denotes the degree distribution exponent, the minimum\ndegree $k_0$, the maximum degree $k_m$, and the $p_r$ represents the\nassortativity or disassortativity of the network. To investigate the effect of\ndegree correlations on the critical behavior of the system, we fix $k_0=4$,\n$k_m=10$, and $\\alpha=1$, and vary $p_r$ to obtain an assortative mixing of\nedges. As result, we have calculated the phase transition points of the system,\nand the critical exponents related to magnetization $\\beta$, magnetic\nsusceptibility $\\gamma$, and the correlation length $\\nu$.",

The rendering equation is the core of the two tasks, as an ideal\nconditional distribution transfer function from intrinsic properties to RGB\nimages. Despite achieving promising results of existing rendering methods, they\nmerely approximate the ideal estimation for a specific scene and come with a\nhigh computational cost. Additionally, the inverse conditional distribution\ntransfer is intractable due to the inherent ambiguity. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a data-driven method that jointly models rendering and\ninverse rendering as two conditional generation tasks within a single diffusion\nframework.

This unified approach,\nnamed Uni-Renderer, allows the two processes to facilitate each other through a\ncycle-consistent constrain, mitigating ambiguity by enforcing consistency\nbetween intrinsic properties and rendered images. Combined with a meticulously\nprepared dataset, our method effectively decomposition of intrinsic properties\nand demonstrates a strong capability to recognize changes during rendering.

In this paper, we study these\nLSTs in the presence of a surface defect, which is introduced through the\naction of a $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold that breaks the gauge groups into\n$[U(1)]^N$. We provide a combinatoric expression for the non-perturbative BPS\npartition function for this system. This form allows us to argue that a number\nof non-perturbative symmetries, that have previously been established for the\nLSTs, are preserved in the presence of the defect. Furthermore, we discuss the\nNekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) limit of the defect partition function: focusing in\ndetail on the case $(M,N)=(1,2)$, we analyse two distinct proposals made in the\nliterature. We unravel an algebraic structure that is responsible for the\ncancellation of singular terms in the NS limit, which we generalise to generic\n$(M,N)$.

One\nof the most remarkable features is that each parity-partner-pair degenerates\nwhen $T>T_c$, with $T_c$ being the critical temperature. For each pair, the\nscreening mass of the negative parity meson increases monotonously with\ntemperature. In contrast, the screening mass of the meson with positive parity\nis almost invariant on the domain $T\\lesssim T_c/2$; when $T$ gets close to\n$T_c$, it decreases but soon increases again and finally degenerates with its\nparity partner, which signals the restoration of chiral symmetry. We also find\nthat the $T$-dependent behaviours of baryon screening masses are quite similar\nto those of the mesons. For baryons, the dynamical, nonpointlike diquark\ncorrelations play a crucial role in the screening mass evolution. We further\ncalculate the evolution of the fraction of each kind of diquark within baryons\nrespective to temperature.

    "abstract": "The popularity of the Rust language continues to explode; yet, many critical\ncodebases remain authored in C, and cannot be realistically rewritten by hand.\nAutomatically translating C to Rust is thus an appealing course of action.\nSeveral works have gone down this path, handling an ever-increasing subset of C\nthrough a variety of Rust features, such as unsafe. While the prospect of\nautomation is appealing, producing code that relies on unsafe negates the\nmemory safety guarantees offered by Rust, and therefore the main advantages of\nporting existing codebases to memory-safe languages.\n  We instead explore a different path, and explore what it would take to\ntranslate C to safe Rust; that is, to produce code that is trivially memory\nsafe, because it abides by Rust's type system without caveats. Our work sports\nseveral original contributions: a type-directed translation from (a subset of)\nC to safe Rust; a novel static analysis based on \"split trees\" that allows\nexpressing C's pointer arithmetic using Rust's slices and splitting operations;\nan analysis that infers exactly which borrows need to be mutable; and a\ncompilation strategy for C's struct types that is compatible with Rust's\ndistinction between non-owned and owned allocations.\n  We apply our methodology to existing formally verified C codebases: the HACL*\ncryptographic library, and binary parsers and serializers from EverParse, and\nshow that the subset of C we support is sufficient to translate both\napplications to safe Rust. Our evaluation shows that for the few places that do\nviolate Rust's aliasing discipline, automated, surgical rewrites suffice; and\nthat the few strategic copies we insert have a negligible performance impact.\nOf particular note, the application of our approach to HACL* results in a\n80,000 line verified cryptographic library, written in pure Rust, that\nimplements all modern algorithms - the first of its kind.",

The joint\nsurvival function of the response is constructed using parametric copulas,\nallowing for a separate specification of the dependence structure between the\ntime-to-event outcome variables and their respective marginal survival\ndistributions. The latter are specified using well-known parametric\ndistributions such as the log-Normal, log-Logistic (proportional odds model),\nor Weibull (proportional hazards model) distributions. Hence, the marginal\nunivariate event times can be specified as parametric (also known as\nAccelerated Failure Time, AFT) models. Embedding our model into the class of\ngeneralized additive models for location, scale and shape, possibly all\ndistribution parameters of the joint survival function can depend on\ncovariates. We develop a component-wise gradient-based boosting algorithm for\nestimation. This way, our approach is able to conduct data-driven variable\nselection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of\nmultivariate AFT models via distributional copula regression with automatic\nvariable selection via statistical boosting. A special merit of our approach is\nthat it works for high-dimensional (p>>n) settings.

Line and continuum emission in this\nmassive system (log10(M*/Msol)=9.8+/-0.2) is resolved into two strong cores,\ntwo weaker clumps, and a faint arc, as seen in recent JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our\ndataset contains detections of [OII]3727,3729, [NeIII]3869,3968, Balmer lines\n(HBeta, HGamma, HDelta, HEpsilon, HZeta), [OIII]5007, and weak [OIII]4363. Each\nspectrum is fit with a model that consistently incorporates interstellar medium\nconditions (i.e., electron temperature, T_e, electron density, n_e, and colour\nexcess, E(B-V)). The resulting line fluxes are used to constrain the gas-phase\nmetallicity (~0.3-0.4 solar) and HBeta-based SFR (310+/-40 Msol/yr) for each\nregion. Common line ratio diagrams (O32-R23, R3-R2, Ne3O2-R23) reveal that each\nline-emitting region lies at the intersection of local and high-redshift\ngalaxies, suggesting low ionisation and higher metallicity compared to the\npredominantly lower-mass galaxies studied with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU so far at\nz>5.5. Spaxel-by-spaxel fits reveal evidence for both narrow (FWHM<400 km/s)\nand broad (FWHM >500 km/s) line emission, the latter of which likely represents\ntidal interaction or outflows. Comparison to ALMA [CII]158um and [OIII]88um\ndata shows a similar velocity structure, and optical-far infrared diagnostics\nsuggest regions of high Lyman continuum escape fraction and n_e. This source\nlies on the mass-metallicity relation at z>4, suggesting an evolved nature. The\ntwo core galaxies show contrasting properties (e.g., SFR, M*, gas-phase\nmetallicity), suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways. Combining the NIRSpec\nIFU and ALMA data sets, our analysis opens new windows into the merging system\nB14-65666.",

This\nprocess is time-consuming, difficult to scale, and lacks automation tools that\npreserve creative intent. Despite recent advances in vision-to-audio\ngeneration, producing temporally coherent and semantically controllable sound\neffects from video remains a major challenge. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce FolAI, a two-stage generative framework that decouples the when and\nthe what of sound synthesis, i.e., the temporal structure extraction and the\nsemantically guided generation, respectively. In the first stage, we estimate a\nsmooth control signal from the video that captures the motion intensity and\nrhythmic structure over time, serving as a temporal scaffold for the audio. In\nthe second stage, a diffusion-based generative model produces sound effects\nconditioned both on this temporal envelope and on high-level semantic\nembeddings, provided by the user, that define the desired auditory content\n(e.g., material or action type). This modular design enables precise control\nover both timing and timbre, streamlining repetitive tasks while preserving\ncreative flexibility in professional Foley workflows. Results on diverse visual\ncontexts, such as footstep generation and action-specific sonorization,\ndemonstrate that our model reliably produces audio that is temporally aligned\nwith visual motion, semantically consistent with user intent, and perceptually\nrealistic. These findings highlight the potential of FolAI as a controllable\nand modular solution for scalable, high-quality Foley sound synthesis in\nprofessional and interactive settings.

An additional challenge in PET/CT imaging arises from the\nrespiratory phase mismatch between CT-based attenuation correction and PET\nacquisition, leading to attenuation artifacts. To address these issues, we\npropose two new, purely data-driven methods for the joint estimation of\nactivity, attenuation, and motion in respiratory self-gated TOF PET. These\nmethods enable the reconstruction of a single activity image free from motion\nand attenuation artifacts.\n  The proposed methods were evaluated using data from the anthropomorphic\nWilhelm phantom acquired on a Siemens mCT PET/CT system, as well as 3 clinical\nFDG PET/CT datasets acquired on a GE DMI PET/CT system. Image quality was\nassessed visually to identify motion and attenuation artifacts. Lesion uptake\nvalues were quantitatively compared across reconstructions without motion\nmodeling, with motion modeling but static attenuation correction, and with our\nproposed methods.\n  For the Wilhelm phantom, the proposed methods delivered image quality closely\nmatching the reference reconstruction from a static acquisition. The\nlesion-to-background contrast for a liver dome lesion improved from 2.0 (no\nmotion correction) to 5.2 (proposed methods), matching the contrast from the\nstatic acquisition (5.2). In contrast, motion modeling with static attenuation\ncorrection yielded a lower contrast of 3.5. In patient datasets, the proposed\nmethods successfully reduced motion artifacts in lung and liver lesions and\nmitigated attenuation artifacts, demonstrating superior lesion to background\nseparation.\n  Our proposed methods enable the reconstruction of a single, high-quality\nactivity image that is motion-corrected and free from attenuation artifacts,\nwithout the need for external hardware.",

Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a\nsolvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a\ncell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes.\nDescribing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging\nbecause direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay)\nplay a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low\nviscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly\nviscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes\nhydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity.\nAssuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the\nsolvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the\ndiffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can\nvary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact\nformal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion\ncoefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of\nshort-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a\nfunction of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on\nself-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction.

We image the diffuse emission at high resolution,\nconstrain its integrated spectrum, and map the spectral index distribution. We\nconfirm the presence of steep-spectrum ($\\alpha$ $\\sim$ -1.3) emission on a\nscale of about 0.5 Mpc in both subclusters. We identify two smaller ultra-steep\nspectrum ($\\alpha$ $<$ -2) regions, superimposed on larger-scale radio emission\nassociated with the southwestern subcluster. At 340 MHz, we detect a radio edge\nbounding the emission to the south and show that it is coincident with a weak\n(M $\\sim$ 1.2) shock identified in the Chandra image. At 3 GHz, the emission\ndoes not show any corresponding edge-like feature, and in fact it extends\nbeyond the shock.

This problem is particularly\ncritical for specialised applications such as medical imaging, where both the\ndata and the number of clients are limited. In this paper, we empirically\ndemonstrate that inconsistencies in client-side training distributions\nsubstantially degrade the performance of federated learning models across\nmultiple benchmark datasets. We propose a novel FL framework using a\ncombination of pruning and regularisation of clients' training to improve the\nsparsity, redundancy, and robustness of neural connections, and thereby the\nresilience to model aggregation. To address a relatively unexplored dimension\nof data heterogeneity, we further introduce a novel benchmark dataset,\nCelebA-Gender, specifically designed to control for within-class distributional\nshifts across clients based on attribute variations, thereby complementing the\npredominant focus on inter-class imbalance in prior federated learning\nresearch. Comprehensive experiments on many datasets like CIFAR-10, MNIST, and\nthe newly introduced CelebA-Gender dataset demonstrate that our method\nconsistently outperforms standard FL baselines, yielding more robust and\ngeneralizable models in heterogeneous settings.",

The idea is to compute the Jacobian matrix of\nthe forward map with respect to the contact strengths and project the electrode\nmeasurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the range of\nthis Jacobian. Using the smoothened complete electrode model as the forward\nmodel, it is demonstrated that inverting the resulting projected equation with\nrespect to only the internal conductivity of the examined body results in good\nquality reconstructions both when resorting to a single step linearization with\na smoothness prior and when combining lagged diffusivity iteration with total\nvariation regularization. The quality of the reconstructions is further\nimproved if the range of the employed projection is also orthogonal to that of\nthe Jacobian with respect to the electrode positions. These results hold even\nif the projections are formed at internal and contact conductivities that\nsignificantly differ from the true ones; it is numerically demonstrated that\nthe orthogonal complement of the range of the contact Jacobian is almost\nindependent of the conductivity parameters at which it is evaluated. In\nparticular, our observations introduce a numerical technique for inferring\nwhether a change in the electrode measurements is caused by a change in the\ninternal conductivity or alterations in the electrode contacts, which has\npotential applications, e.g., in bedside monitoring of stroke patients. The\nideas are tested both on simulated data and on real-world water tank\nmeasurements with adjustable contact resistances.",

In contrast to\nconventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), CAPAs emit electromagnetic (EM)\nprobing signals through continuous source currents for target sensing, thereby\nexploiting the full spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). The maximum likelihood\nestimation (MLE) method for estimating target locations in the near-field\nregion is developed. To evaluate the NISE performance with CAPAs, the CRB for\nestimating target locations is derived based on continuous transmit and receive\narray responses of CAPAs. Subsequently, a CRB minimization problem is\nformulated to optimize the continuous source current of CAPAs. This results in\na non-convex, integral-based functional optimization problem. To address this\nchallenge, the optimal structure of the source current is derived and proven to\nbe spanned by a series of basis functions determined by the system geometry. To\nsolve the CRB minimization problem, a low-complexity subspace manifold gradient\ndescent (SMGD) method is proposed, leveraging the derived optimal structure of\nthe source current.

We reveal one rule for exciton mediated\nsuperconductivity is that the resistivity is an inverse linear function of the\ncurrent through the BEC superfluid state, which should be ascribed to the\nAndreev-Bashkin effect, which reflects the coupling between the BEC state of\nexciton and Cooper pairs mediated by excitons. Furthermore, a record transition\ntemperature above 200 K has been found for one superconducting sample, which\nshows the Josephson oscillation dominated by a pendulum-like equation caused by\nthe quantum coupling between superconductor and BEC superfluid of exciton.",

    "abstract": "Nanoconfined water plays an indispensable role in various phenomena in\nbiology, chemistry, and engineering. It exhibits many abnormal properties\ncompared to bulk water, especially under strong confinement. However, the\norigin of those anomalies is still elusive due to the lack of structural\ninformation on hydrogen-bonding networks. Considering the inhomogeneity of the\nnanocavity and the tiny amount of water molecules, conventional optical\nspectroscopies and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) fail to realize the\nstructure analysis of nanoconfined water. Here, we addressed this issue by\ncombining scanning probe microscopy (SPM) with advanced quantum sensing(QS)\nbased on an atomic-size quantum sensor like nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in\ndiamond, which can apply the nanoscale-NMR for characterizing both the dynamics\nand structure of confined water at ambient conditions. We built a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) nanoconfined water system with a hexagonal-boron nitride\n(hBN) flake and a hydrophilic diamond surface. By using the SPM tip to measure\nthe confinement size precisely, we observed a critical confinement size of ~2\nnm, below which the water diffusion was significantly suppressed and the\nhydrogen-bonding network of water showed an ordered structure. Meanwhile,\nmolecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a solid-like water contact layer on\nthe diamond surface under strong confinement, which also reproduced the\nmeasured nanoscale-NMR spectra and confirmed the liquid-solid phase transition\nobserved in the experiments. Notably, with this new SPM-QS platform, our\nresults showed a promising way to elucidate the abnormal properties of\nnanoconfined water in future applications.",

Traditional detection\nmethods often fall short when confronting AI-powered jamming that dynamically\nmodifies its behavior, while contemporary machine learning approaches\nfrequently demand substantial feature engineering and struggle with temporal\npatterns in attack signatures. The vulnerability extends to 5G networks\nemploying Time Division Duplex (TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD), where\nservice quality may deteriorate due to deliberate interference. We introduce a\nnovel U-shaped transformer architecture that leverages Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) to refine feature representations for improved wireless\nsecurity. The training process is regularized by incorporating the output\nentropy uncertainty into the loss function, a mechanism inspired by the Soft\nActor-Critic (SAC) algorithm in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable robust\njamming detection techniques. The architecture features a modified transformer\nencoder specially designed to process critical wireless signal features,\nincluding Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal-to-\nInterference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) measurements. We complement this with a\ncustom positional encoding mechanism that specifically accounts for the\ninherent periodicity of wireless signals,enabling a more accurate\nrepresentation of temporal signal patterns. In addition, we propose a batch\nsize scheduler and implement chunking techniques to optimize convergence for\ntime series data. These advancements contribute to up to a ten times\nimprovement in training speed within the advanced U-shaped encoder-decoder\ntransformer model introduced in this study.

Connectomics-based neuromorphic computing has primarily\nfocused on embedding human brain large-scale structural connectomes (SCs), as\nestimated from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) modality, to\necho-state networks (ESNs). A critical step in ESN embedding requires\npre-determined read-in and read-out layers constructed by the induced subgraphs\nof the embedded reservoir. As \\textit{a priori} set of functional sub-circuits\nare derived from functional MRI (fMRI) modality, it is unknown, till this\npoint, whether the embedding of fMRI-induced sub-circuits/networks onto SCs is\nwell justified from the neuro-physiological perspective and ESN performance\nacross a variety of tasks. This paper proposes a pipeline to implement and\nevaluate ESNs with various embedded topologies and processing/memorization\ntasks. To this end, we showed that different performance optimums highly depend\non the neuro-physiological characteristics of these pre-determined fMRI-induced\nsub-circuits.

We investigate how\nmixtures of these two behaviors shape the macroscopic properties of the liquid\nof agents.

The recent advancements in Large Language Models\n(LLMs) introduce new possibilities by coupling LLMs with evolutionary\ncomputation to automatically generate heuristics, known as LLM-based\nEvolutionary Program Search (LLM-EPS). While previous LLM-EPS studies obtained\ngreat performance on various tasks, there is still a gap in understanding the\nproperties of heuristic search spaces and achieving a balance between\nexploration and exploitation, which is a critical factor in large heuristic\nsearch spaces. In this study, we address this gap by proposing two diversity\nmeasurement metrics and perform an analysis on previous LLM-EPS approaches,\nincluding FunSearch, EoH, and ReEvo. Results on black-box AHD problems reveal\nthat while EoH demonstrates higher diversity than FunSearch and ReEvo, its\nobjective score is unstable. Conversely, ReEvo's reflection mechanism yields\ngood objective scores but fails to optimize diversity effectively. With this\nfinding in mind, we introduce HSEvo, an adaptive LLM-EPS framework that\nmaintains a balance between diversity and convergence with a harmony search\nalgorithm. Through experimentation, we find that HSEvo achieved high diversity\nindices and good objective scores while remaining cost-effective.

The\nmost fundamental quantum cryptographic building block in such a distrustful\nsetting is quantum coin flipping, which provides an advantage compared to its\nclassical equivalent. So far, few experimental studies on quantum coin flipping\nhave been reported, all of which used probabilistic quantum light sources\nfacing fundamental limitations.

    "abstract": "When studying gauge theories in the presence of boundaries, local symmetry\ntransformations are typically classified as gauge or physical depending on\nwhether the associated charges vanish or not. Here, we propose that physical\ncharges should further be refined into \"dynamical\" or \"kinematical\" depending\non whether they are associated with flux-balance laws or not. To support this\nproposal, we analyze (A)dS$_3$ gravity with boundary Weyl rescalings and\ncompare the solution spaces in Bondi-Sachs and Fefferman-Graham coordinates.\nOur results show that the Weyl charge vanishes in the Bondi-Sachs gauge but not\nin the Fefferman-Graham gauge. Conversely, the charges arising from the metric\nChern-Simons Lagrangian behave in the opposite way. This indicates that the\ngauge-dependent Weyl charge differs fundamentally from charges like mass and\nangular momentum. This interpretation is reinforced by two key observations:\nthe Weyl conformal factor does not satisfy any flux-balance law, and the\nassociated charge arises from a corner term in the symplectic structure. These\nproperties justify assigning the Weyl charge a kinematical status. These\nresults can also be derived using the field-dependent diffeomorphism that maps\nbetween the two gauges. Importantly, this diffeomorphism does not act\ntensorially on the variational bi-complex due to its field dependency, and is\nable to \"toggle\" charges on or off.

We show that upon condensation ATP assembles via\npi-pi interactions, resulting in the formation of a large cluster of stacked\nATP molecules stabilized by sodium counterions. The surface of the ATP assembly\ninteracts with the arginine-rich regions of the Caprin1 protein, particularly\nwith its N-terminus, to promote the complete phase-separated droplet on a\nlengthscale of tens of nanometers. In order to understand droplet stability, we\nanalyze the near-surface electrostatic potential (NS-ESP) of Caprin1 and\nestimate the zeta potential of the Caprin1-ATP assemblies. We predict a\npositive NS-ESP at the Caprin1 surface for low ATP concentrations that defines\nthe early mixed state, in excellent agreement with the NS-ESP obtained from NMR\nexperiments using paramagnetic resonance enhancement. By contrast, the NS-ESP\nof Caprin1 at the surface of the nanocondensate at moderate levels of ATP is\nhighly negative compared to the mixed state, and estimates of a large zeta\npotential outside the highly dense region of charge further explains the\nremarkable stability of this phase separated droplet assembly. As ATP\nconcentrations rise further, the strong electrostatic forces needed for\nnanocondensate stability are replaced by weaker Caprin1-ATP interactions that\ndrive the reentry into the mixed state that exhibits a much lower zeta\npotential.",

To\ncontrol this trade-off flexibly and efficiently, we propose a simple\nclass-specific scaling strategy, directly applicable to existing debiasing\nalgorithms with no additional training. We further develop an instance-wise\nadaptive scaling technique to alleviate this trade-off, even leading to\nimprovements in both robust and average accuracies. Our approach reveals that a\nna\\\"ive ERM baseline matches or even outperforms the recent debiasing methods\nby simply adopting the class-specific scaling technique. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel unified metric that quantifies the trade-off between the two\naccuracies as a scalar value, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of\nexisting algorithms. By tackling the inherent trade-off and offering a\nperformance landscape, our approach provides valuable insights into robust\ntechniques beyond just robust accuracy.

    "abstract": "Existing skeleton-based human action classification models rely on\nwell-trimmed action-specific skeleton videos for both training and testing,\nprecluding their scalability to real-world applications where untrimmed videos\nexhibiting concatenated actions are predominant. To overcome this limitation,\nrecently introduced skeleton action segmentation models involve un-trimmed\nskeleton videos into end-to-end training. The model is optimized to provide\nframe-wise predictions for any length of testing videos, simultaneously\nrealizing action localization and classification. Yet, achieving such an\nimprovement im-poses frame-wise annotated skeleton videos, which remains\ntime-consuming in practice. This paper features a novel framework for\nskeleton-based action segmentation trained on short trimmed skeleton videos,\nbut that can run on longer un-trimmed videos. The approach is implemented in\nthree steps: Stitch, Contrast, and Segment. First, Stitch proposes a tem-poral\nskeleton stitching scheme that treats trimmed skeleton videos as elementary\nhuman motions that compose a semantic space and can be sampled to generate\nmulti-action stitched se-quences. Contrast learns contrastive representations\nfrom stitched sequences with a novel discrimination pretext task that enables a\nskeleton encoder to learn meaningful action-temporal contexts to improve action\nsegmentation. Finally, Segment relates the proposed method to action\nsegmentation by learning a segmentation layer while handling particular da-ta\navailability. Experiments involve a trimmed source dataset and an untrimmed\ntarget dataset in an adaptation formulation for real-world skeleton-based human\naction segmentation to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Nevertheless, stellar spin-down mechanisms in\nprotostellar and pre-main-sequence stellar phases have been a long-standing\nproblem in the star formation theory. To realize the spin-down, previous\naxisymmetric models based on the conventional magnetospheric paradigm have to\nassume massive stellar winds or produce highly time-variable magnetospheric\nejections. However, this picture has been challenged by both numerical\nsimulations and observations. With a particular focus on the propeller regime\nfor solar-mass stars, we propose a new picture of stellar spin-down based on\nour recent three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic simulation and stellar\nevolution calculation. We show that failed magnetospheric winds, unique to 3D\nmodels, significantly reduce the spin-up accretion torque, which make it easier\nfor the star to spin-down. Additionally, the amplitude of time variability\nassociated with magnetospheric ejections is reduced by 3D effects. Our\nsimulation demonstrates that the star spins down by generating a conical disk\nwind, driven by a rotating stellar magnetosphere. Our theoretical estimates,\ninspired by the numerical model, suggest that the conical disk wind is likely\nto play a crucial role in extracting stellar angular momentum during the\nprotostellar phase. As magnetospheric accretion is expected to occur in other\naccreting objects such as proto-giant planets, this study will also contribute\nto the understanding of the angular momentum of such objects.",

Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to\nefficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk\nconnectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks,\nand graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and\ndeterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via\nlazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced\nby orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting\ndown the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction\ntechniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum\nspeedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In\nparticular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an\neasy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset\nof a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements\na hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given\ninput graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum\nhardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph\nembedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable\noverhead and optimized ancilla placements.

    "abstract": "Speculative data-parallel algorithms for language recognition have been\nwidely experimented for various types of finite-state automata (FA),\ndeterministic (DFA) and nondeterministic (NFA), often derived from regular\nexpressions (RE). Such an algorithm cuts the input string into chunks,\nindependently recognizes each chunk in parallel by means of identical FAs, and\nat last joins the chunk results and checks overall consistency. In chunk\nrecognition, it is necessary to speculatively start the FAs in any state, thus\ncausing an overhead that reduces the speedup compared to a serial algorithm.\nExisting data-parallel DFA-based recognizers suffer from the excessive number\nof starting states, and the NFA-based ones suffer from the number of\nnondeterministic transitions. Our data-parallel algorithm is based on the new\nFA type called reduced interface DFA (RI-DFA), which minimizes the speculation\noverhead without incurring in the penalty of nondeterministic transitions or of\nimpractically enlarged DFA machines. The algorithm is proved to be correct and\ntheoretically efficient, because it combines the state-reduction of an NFA with\nthe speed of deterministic transitions, thus improving on both DFA-based and\nNFA-based existing implementations. The practical applicability of the RI-DFA\napproach is confirmed by a quantitative comparison of the number of starting\nstates for a large public benchmark of complex FAs. On multi-core computing\narchitectures, the RI-DFA recognizer is much faster than the NFA-based one on\nall benchmarks, while it matches the DFA-based one on some benchmarks and\nperforms much better on some others. The extra time cost needed to construct an\nRI-DFA compared to a DFA is moderate and is compatible with a practical use.",

Meanwhile,\npairing these object data with detailed annotations to enable training for\nvarious tasks is also difficult and labor-intensive to achieve. In order to\nexpeditiously gather a significant number of 3D articulated objects with\ncomprehensive and detailed annotations for training, we propose Articulated\nObject Procedural Generation toolbox, a.k.a.

Arti-PG toolbox\nconsists of i) descriptions of articulated objects by means of a generalized\nstructure program along with their analytic correspondence to the objects'\npoint cloud, ii) procedural rules about manipulations on the structure program\nto synthesize large-scale and diverse new articulated objects, and iii)\nmathematical descriptions of knowledge (e.g. affordance, semantics, etc.) to\nprovide annotations to the synthesized object. Arti-PG has two appealing\nproperties for providing training data for articulated object understanding\ntasks: i) objects are created with unlimited variations in shape through\nprogram-oriented structure manipulation, ii) Arti-PG is widely applicable to\ndiverse tasks by easily providing comprehensive and detailed annotations.\nArti-PG now supports the procedural generation of 26 categories of articulate\nobjects and provides annotations across a wide range of both vision and\nmanipulation tasks, and we provide exhaustive experiments which fully\ndemonstrate its advantages.

    "abstract": "Low-rank regularization is an effective technique for addressing ill-posed\ninverse problems when the unknown variable exhibits low-rank characteristics.\nHowever, global low-rank assumptions do not always hold for seismic wavefields;\nin many practical situations, local low-rank features are instead more commonly\nobserved. To leverage this insight, we propose partitioning the unknown\nvariable into tiles, each represented via low-rank factorization.\n  We apply this framework to regularize multidimensional deconvolution in the\nfrequency domain, considering two key factors. First, the unknown variable,\nreferred to as the Green's function, must maintain symmetry according to the\nreciprocity principle of wave propagation. To ensure symmetry within the\ntile-based low-rank framework, diagonal tiles are formulated as the product of\na low-rank factor and its transpose if numerically rank-deficient. Otherwise,\nthey are represented by preconditioned dense forms. Symmetry in off-diagonal\nelements is achieved by parameterizing sub-diagonal tiles as the product of two\ndistinct low-rank factors, with the corresponding super-diagonal tiles set as\ntheir transposes.\n  Second, the rank of the Green's function varies with frequency; in other\nwords, the Green's function has different ranks at different frequencies. To\ndetermine the numerical rank and optimal tile size for each frequency, we first\nsolve the multidimensional deconvolution problem using a benchmark solver.\nBased on these results, we estimate the optimal tile size and numerical rank\nfor our proposed solver.",

Unlike\ntraditional Lagrangian approaches, which require contact detection and\nresolution algorithms, the Eulerian framework utilizes a single, fixed spatial\nmesh combined with a diffuse interface phase-field approach, simplifying\ncontact resolution significantly. Moreover, the Eulerian method is well-suited\nfor developing a unified framework to handle multiphysical systems involving\ngrowing bodies that interact with a constraining medium. In this work, we\nextend our previous methodology to incorporate frictional contact. By\nleveraging the intersection of the phase fields of multiple bodies, we define\nnormal and tangential penalty force fields, which are incorporated into the\nlinear momentum equations to capture frictional interactions. This formulation\nallows independent motion of each body using distinct velocity fields, coupled\nsolely through interfacial forces arising from contact and friction. We\nthoroughly validate the proposed approach through several numerical examples.\nThe method is shown to handle large sliding effortlessly, accurately capture\nthe stick-slip transition, and preserve history-dependent energy dissipation,\noffering a solution for modeling frictional contact in Eulerian models.",

We examined their responses following\nofficial guidelines and evaluated their explanations' reasoning quality.\n  Results: Seven models exceeded the 60-point passing threshold in both\nsections. Chinese models performed better in jurisprudence (median = 77.0 vs.\n70.3) but slightly lower in applied knowledge (median = 65.5 vs. 67.0).

    "abstract": "In this paper we present a new thin-wall eddy current modeling code,\nThinCurr, for studying inductively-coupled currents in 3D conducting structures\n-- with primary application focused on the interaction between currents flowing\nin coils, plasma, and conducting structures of magnetically-confined plasma\ndevices. The code utilizes a boundary finite element method on an unstructured,\ntriangular grid to accurately capture device structures. The new code, part of\nthe broader Open FUSION Toolkit, is open-source and designed for ease of use\nwithout sacrificing capability and speed through a combination of Python,\nFortran, and C/C++ components. Scalability to large models is enabled through\nuse of hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank compression of the inductance matrix,\nwhich is otherwise dense. Ease of handling large models of complicated geometry\nis further supported by automatic determination of supplemental elements\nthrough a greedy homology approach. A detailed description of the numerical\nmethods of the code and verification of the implementation of those methods\nusing cross-code comparisons against the VALEN code and Ansys commercial\nanalysis software is shown.",

    "abstract": "The sensing and manipulation of transparent objects present a critical\nchallenge in industrial and laboratory robotics. Conventional sensors face\nchallenges in obtaining the full depth of transparent objects due to the\nrefraction and reflection of light on their surfaces and their lack of visible\ntexture. Previous research has attempted to obtain complete depth maps of\ntransparent objects from RGB and damaged depth maps (collected by depth sensor)\nusing deep learning models. However, existing methods fail to fully utilize the\noriginal depth map, resulting in limited accuracy for deep completion. To solve\nthis problem, we propose TDCNet, a novel dual-branch CNN-Transformer parallel\nnetwork for transparent object depth completion. The proposed framework\nconsists of two different branches: one extracts features from partial depth\nmaps, while the other processes RGB-D images. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple public\ndatasets. Our code and the pre-trained model are publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/XianghuiFan/TDCNet.",

In this paper, we aim to interpret LLMs' intrinsic\nself-correction for different tasks, especially for those failure cases. By\nincluding one simple task and three complex tasks with state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nLLMs like ChatGPT families (o1, 4o, 3.5-turbo) and Llama families (2-7B, 3-8B,\nand 3.1-8B), we design three interpretation methods to reveal the dark side of\nLLMs' intrinsic self-correction. We identify intrinsic self-correction can (1)\ncause LLMs to waver both intermedia and final answers and lead to prompt bias\non simple factual questions; (2) introduce human-like cognitive bias on complex\ntasks. In light of our findings, we also provide two simple yet effective\nstrategies for alleviation: question repeating and supervised fine-tuning with\na few samples.

    "abstract": "A world model provides an agent with a representation of its environment,\nenabling it to predict the causal consequences of its actions. Current world\nmodels typically cannot directly and explicitly imitate the actual environment\nin front of a robot, often resulting in unrealistic behaviors and\nhallucinations that make them unsuitable for real-world robotics applications.\nTo overcome those challenges, we propose to rethink robot world models as\nlearnable digital twins. We introduce DreMa, a new approach for constructing\ndigital twins automatically using learned explicit representations of the real\nworld and its dynamics, bridging the gap between traditional digital twins and\nworld models. DreMa replicates the observed world and its structure by\nintegrating Gaussian Splatting and physics simulators, allowing robots to\nimagine novel configurations of objects and to predict the future consequences\nof robot actions thanks to its compositionality. We leverage this capability to\ngenerate new data for imitation learning by applying equivariant\ntransformations to a small set of demonstrations. Our evaluations across\nvarious settings demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and\nrobustness by incrementing actions and object distributions, reducing the data\nneeded to learn a policy and improving the generalization of the agents. As a\nhighlight, we show that a real Franka Emika Panda robot, powered by DreMa's\nimagination, can successfully learn novel physical tasks from just a single\nexample per task variation (one-shot policy learning).

In this letter, we show that the previous studies are in\nagreement with each other when using the same set of parameters. But for\nobservationally motivated parameters of a typical protoplanetary disk, the disk\nis unlikely to break due to interactions with the triple star system. We run\n3-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a circumtriple disk around GW Ori\nwith different disk aspect ratios. For a disk aspect ratio typical of\nprotoplanetary disks, $H/r \\gtrsim 0.05$, the disk does not break.

To address these challenges, this\npaper presents a computer vision-based system for detecting and tracking ears\nof corn in an image sequence. The proposed system could accurately detect,\ntrack, and predict the ear's orientation, which can be useful in monitoring\ntheir growth behavior. This can significantly save time compared to manual\nmeasurement and enables additional areas of ear orientation research and\npotential increase in efficiencies for maize production. Using an object\ndetector with keypoint detection, the algorithm proposed could detect 90\npercent of all ears. The cardinal estimation had a mean absolute error (MAE) of\n18 degrees, compared to a mean 15 degree difference between two people\nmeasuring by hand. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using computer\nvision techniques for monitoring maize growth and can lead to further research\nin this area.",

    "abstract": "Recent observational results from asteroseismic studies show that an\nimportant fraction of solar-like stars do not present detectable stochastically\nexcited acoustic oscillations. This non-detectability seems to correlate with a\nhigh rotation rate in the convective envelope and a high surface magnetic\nactivity. At the same time, the properties of stellar convection are affected\nby rotation and magnetism. We investigate the role of rotation in the\nexcitation of acoustic modes in the convective envelope of solar-like stars, to\nevaluate its impact on the energy injected in the oscillations. We derive\ntheoretical prescriptions for the excitation of acoustic waves in the\nconvective envelope of rotating solar-like stars. We adopt the Rotating\nMixing-Length Theory to model the influence of rotation on convection. We use\nthe MESA stellar evolution code and the GYRE stellar oscillation code to\nestimate the power injected in the oscillations from our theoretical\nprescriptions. We demonstrate that the power injected in the acoustic modes is\ninsensitive to the rotation if a Gaussian time-correlation function is assumed,\nwhile it can decrease by up to 60 % for a Lorentzian time-correlation function,\nfor a $20 \\Omega_{\\odot}$ rotation rate. This result can allow us to better\nconstrain the properties of stellar convection by studying observationally\nacoustic modes excitation. These results demonstrate how important it is to\ntake into account the modification of stellar convection by rotation when\nevaluating the amplitude of the stellar oscillations it stochastically excites.\nThey open the path for understanding the large variety of observed\nacoustic-mode amplitudes at the surface of solar-like stars as a function of\nsurface rotation rates.",

In this paper, we\naddress this limitation by proposing GenCon, a novel approach to learn\nparameterized constraint models capable of modeling varying instances of the\nsame problem. To achieve this generalization, we make use of statistical\nlearning techniques at the level of individual constraints.

We then show\nhow, for some classes of classifiers, we can extract decision rules to\nconstruct interpretable constraint specifications. This enables the generation\nof ground constraints for any parameter instantiation. Additionally, we present\na generate-and-test approach that can be used with any classifier, to generate\nthe ground constraints on the fly.

Motivated by a real data application with partially missing\nmultivariate outcomes related to leaf photosynthetic traits and several\nenvironmental covariates, we propose two methods under a selection model\nframework for handling data with missingness in the response variables suitable\nfor recovering various missingness mechanisms. Both approaches use a\nmultivariate extension of Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) to flexibly\nmodel the outcomes.

In scenarios where the relationship\nbetween the missingness and the data is more complex or non-linear, we propose\na second approach using a probit BART model to characterize the missing data\nprocess, thereby employing two BART models simultaneously.

The log-rank test, while effective in\ncontrolling false positive rates, may lose power in scenarios where survival\ncurves remain similar for extended periods before diverging. To address this,\nvarious weighted versions of the log-rank test have been proposed, including\nthe MaxCombo test, which combines multiple weighted log-rank statistics to\nenhance power across a range of alternative hypotheses.\n  Despite its potential, the MaxCombo test has seen limited adoption, possibly\nowing to its proneness to produce counterintuitive results in situations where\nthe hazard functions on the two arms cross. In response, the modestly weighted\nlog-rank test was developed to provide a balanced approach, giving greater\nweight to later event times while avoiding undue influence from early\ndetrimental effects. However, this test also faces limitations, particularly if\nthe possibility of early separation of survival curves cannot be ruled out a\npriori.\n  We propose a novel test statistic that integrates the strengths of the\nstandard log-rank test, the modestly weighted log-rank test, and the MaxCombo\ntest. By considering the maximum of the standard log-rank statistic and a\nmodestly weighted log-rank statistic, the new test aims to maintain power under\ndelayed effect scenarios while minimizing power loss, relative to the log-rank\ntest, in worst-case scenarios. Simulation studies and a case study demonstrate\nthe efficiency and robustness of this approach, highlighting its potential as a\nrobust alternative for primary analysis in immuno-oncology trials.",

    "abstract": "Neural surface representation has demonstrated remarkable success in the\nareas of novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. However, assessing the\ngeometric quality of 3D reconstructions in the absence of ground truth mesh\nremains a significant challenge, due to its rendering-based optimization\nprocess and entangled learning of appearance and geometry with photometric\nlosses. In this paper, we present a novel framework, i.e, GURecon, which\nestablishes a geometric uncertainty field for the neural surface based on\ngeometric consistency. Different from existing methods that rely on\nrendering-based measurement, GURecon models a continuous 3D uncertainty field\nfor the reconstructed surface, and is learned by an online distillation\napproach without introducing real geometric information for supervision.\nMoreover, in order to mitigate the interference of illumination on geometric\nconsistency, a decoupled field is learned and exploited to finetune the\nuncertainty field. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority\nof GURecon in modeling 3D geometric uncertainty, as well as its plug-and-play\nextension to various neural surface representations and improvement on\ndownstream tasks such as incremental reconstruction.

In view of\nits global complexity bound of the order $O(\\sqrt{n} \\ln {1 \\over \\epsilon})$,\nthis fact proves that the functional proximity measure, used for controlling\nthe closeness to Greedy Central Path, is large enough for ensuring a local\nsuper-linear rate of convergence, provided that the proximity to the path is\ngradually reduced.\n  This requirement is eliminated in our second algorithm based on a new\nauto-correcting predictor direction. This method, besides the best-known\npolynomial-time complexity bound, ensures an automatic switching onto the local\nquadratic convergence in a small neighborhood of solution.\n  Our third algorithm approximates the path by quadratic curves. On the top of\nthe best-known global complexity bound, this method benefits from an unusual\nlocal cubic rate of convergence. This amelioration needs no serious increase in\nthe cost of one iteration. We compare the advantages of these local\naccelerations with possibilities of finite termination. The conditions allowing\nthe optimal basis detection sometimes are even weaker than those required for\nthe local superlinear convergence. Hence, it is important to endow the\npractical optimization schemes with both abilities.\n  The proposed methods have a very interesting combination of favorable\nproperties, which can be hardly found in the most of existing Interior-Point\nschemes.

Here, we explore the crossover between these models\nvia a parent spin model from bidirectional waveguide QED, by varying positional\ndisorder among emitters. Solving mean-field equations and employing a\nsecond-order cumulant expansion for the unidirectional model -- equivalent to\nthe Maxwell-Bloch equations -- we study phase diagrams, the emitter's\ninversion, and transmission depending on optical depth, drive strength, and\nspatial disorder. We find in the thermodynamic limit the emergence of phase\nseparation with a critical value that depends on the degree of spatial order\nbut is independent of inhomogeneous broadening effects. Even far from the\nthermodynamic limit, this critical value marks a special point in the emitter's\ncorrelation landscape of the unidirectional model and is also observed as a\nmaximum in the magnitude of inelastically transmitted photons.

Our study applies existing methods to the MRWeb problem using a\nnewly curated dataset of 500 websites (300 synthetic, 200 real-world).\nSpecifically, we identify the best metric to evaluate the similarity of the web\nUI, assess the impact of the resource list on MRWeb generation, analyze MLLM\nlimitations, and evaluate the effectiveness of the MRWeb tool in real-world\nworkflows. The results show that resource lists boost navigation functionality\nfrom 0% to 66%-80% while facilitating visual similarity. Our proposed metrics\nand evaluation framework provide new insights into MLLM performance on MRWeb\ntasks. We release the MRWeb tool, dataset, and evaluation framework to promote\nfurther research.",

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a noise-robust SFT\nframework to enhance model capabilities in downstream tasks. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce a robust SFT framework (RobustFT) that performs noise\ndetection and relabeling on downstream task data. For noise identification, our\napproach employs a multi-expert collaborative system with inference-enhanced\nmodels to achieve superior noise detection. In the denoising phase, we utilize\na context-enhanced strategy, which incorporates the most relevant and confident\nknowledge followed by careful assessment to generate reliable annotations.\nAdditionally, we introduce an effective data selection mechanism based on\nresponse entropy, ensuring only high-quality samples are retained for\nfine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Cutting planes are frequently used for solving integer programs. A common\nstrategy is to derive cutting planes from building blocks or a substructure of\nthe integer program. In this paper, we focus on knapsack constraints that arise\nfrom single row relaxations. Among the most popular classes derived from\nknapsack constraints are lifted minimal cover inequalities. The separation\nproblem for these inequalities is NP-hard though, and one usually separates\nthem heuristically, therefore not fully exploiting their potential. For many\nbenchmarking instances however, it turns out that many knapsack constraints\nonly have few different coefficients. This motivates the concept of sparse\nknapsacks where the number of different coefficients is a small constant,\nindependent of the number of variables present. For such knapsacks, we observe\nthat there are only polynomially many different classes of structurally\nequivalent minimal covers. This opens the door to specialized techniques for\nusing lifted minimal cover inequalities. In this article we will discuss two\nsuch techniques, which are based on specialized sorting methods. On the one\nhand, we present new separation routines that separate equivalence classes of\ninequalities rather than individual inequalities. On the other hand, we derive\ncompact extended formulations that express all lifted minimal cover\ninequalities by means of a polynomial number of constraints. These extended\nformulations are based on tailored sorting networks that express our separation\nalgorithm by linear inequalities. We conclude the article by a numerical\ninvestigation of the different techniques for popular benchmarking instances.",

The social-psychological factors were\nfound to be associated with range anxiety, but how the charging decisions are\naffected by range anxiety is still unclear. Thus, in our study, through an\nonline questionnaire issued in mainland China, we collected 230 participants'\ncharging decisions in 60 range-anxiety-inducing scenarios in which both\ndistance-related, and time-related anxiety co-existed. Then, an interpretable\nmachine learning (ML) approach with the Shapley Additive Explanations method\nwas used to model BEV users' charging decisions in these scenarios.

It also provides a targeted and\nefficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we\nderive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band\nnon-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary\nconditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models\nand the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence\nof non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made\npossible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In\naddition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics,\nincluding the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge\nmodes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and\nfavorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under\nopen boundary conditions.",

The depression, as seen in the Bartel rotation-averaged proton flux,\nhas the form of a Forbush decrease (FD). Despite this resemblance, however, the\ncause of the observed depression does not have such a simple explanation as\nFDs, due to coronal mass ejections (CMEs), typically last for a few days at 1\nAU rather than half a year. In this work, we seek the cause of the observed\ndepression and investigate two main possibilities. First, we consider a\nmini-cycle - a temporary change in the solar dynamo that changes the behavior\nof the global solar magnetic field and, by this, the modulation of GCRs.\nSecondly, we investigate the behavior of solar activity, both CMEs and\nco-rotating/stream interactions regions (C/SIRs), during this period. Our\nfindings show that, although there is some evidence for mini-cycle behavior\nprior to the depression, the depression is ultimately due to a combination of\nrecurrent CMEs, SIRs and CIRs. A particular characteristic of the depression is\nthat the largest impacts that help to create and maintain it are due to four\nCMEs from the same, highly active, magnetic source that persists for several\nsolar rotations. This active magnetic source is unusual given the closeness of\nthe solar cycle to solar minimum, which also helps to make the depression more\nevident.",

Specifically, (1) for fact\nfabrication, we apply the context-aware negative training that fine-tunes the\nLLMs with negative supervisions, thus explicitly guiding the LLMs to refuse to\nanswer when contexts are not related to questions; (2) for fact omission, we\npropose the information-calibrated aggregation which prioritizes context\nwindows with higher information increment from their contexts.

In this study, we perform radiation hydrodynamic simulations\nof star-cluster formation in clouds with finite metallicities, $Z=10^{-6}$ to\n$10^{-2} Z_{\\odot}$, incorporating detailed thermal and chemical processes and\nradiative feedback from forming stars. Extending the simulations to\napproximately two million years, we demonstrate that SMSs with masses exceeding\n$10^4~M_\\odot$ can form even in metal-enriched clouds with $Z \\lesssim 10^{-3}\nZ_{\\odot}$. The accretion process in these cases, driven by \"super-competitive\naccretion,\" preferentially channels gas into central massive stars in spite of\nsmall (sub-pc) scale fragmentation.

We generalise this result by using the Fourier\nspectrum; a family of dimensions that interpolate between the Fourier and\nSobolev dimensions for measures. This gives us a continuum of Stein--Tomas type\nestimates, and optimising over this continuum gives a new $L^q\\to L^2$\nrestriction theorem which often outperforms the Stein--Tomas result.

    "abstract": "We derive the effective transmission condition for a cluster of acoustic\nsubwavelength resonators, modeled as small-scaled bubbles distributed not\nnecessarily periodically along a smooth, bounded hypersurface, which need not\nbe flat. The transmission condition specifies that the jump in the normal\nderivative of the acoustic field is proportional to its second time derivative,\nconvoluted in time with a sinusoidal kernel. This kernel has a period\ndetermined by the common subwavelength resonance (specifically, the Minnaert\nresonance in this case). This dispersive transmission condition can also be\ninterpreted as a Dirac-like surface potential that is convoluted in the time\ndomain and spatially supported on the specified hypersurface. We highlight the\nfollowing features: 1. High resonance regime: When the common resonance is\nlarge, the surface behaves as fully transparent, permitting complete\ntransmission of the acoustic field. 2. Moderate resonance regime: For moderate\nresonance values, the surface acts as a screen with memory effects, capturing\nthe dispersive behavior induced by the resonance. 3. Low resonance regime: When\nthe common resonance is small, the surface functions as a partial reflective\n(or partial transmissive) screen with no memory effect.",

Understanding the electron dynamics\nwithin these QDs is essential for characterizing their properties and\nfunctionality. Here, we show how by virtue of the recently introduced quantum\npolyspectral analysis of transport measurements, the complex transport\nmeasurements of multi-electron QD systems can be analyzed. This method directly\nrelates higher-order temporal correlations of a raw quantum point contact (QPC)\ncurrent measurement to the Liouvillian of the measured quantum system. By\napplying this method to the two-level switching dynamics of a double QD system,\nwe reveal a hidden third state, without relying on the identification of\nquantum jumps or prior assumptions about the number of involved quantum states.\nWe show that the statistics of the QPC current measurement can identically be\ndescribed by different three-state Markov models, each with significantly\ndifferent transition rates. Furthermore, we compare our method to a traditional\nanalysis via waiting-time distributions for which we prove that the statistics\nof a three-state Markov model is fully described without multi-time\nwaiting-time distributions even in the case of two level switching dynamics.\nBoth methods yield the same parameters with a similar accuracy. The quantum\npolyspectra method, however, stays applicable in scenarios with low\nsignal-to-noise, where the traditional full counting statistics falters. Our\napproach challenges previous assumptions and models, offering a more nuanced\nunderstanding of QD dynamics and paving the way for the optimization of quantum\ndevices.",

The\ntime-shift operation is implemented by interpolating discretely sampled data.\nTo enable in-band laser noise reduction by eight to nine orders of magnitude,\ninterpolation has to be performed with high accuracy. Optimizing the design of\nthose interpolation methods is the focus of this work. Previous research that\nstudied constant time-shifts suggested Lagrange interpolation as the\ninterpolation method for TDI. Its transfer function performs well at low\nfrequency but requires a high number of coefficients. Furthermore, when applied\nin TDI we observed prominent time-domain features when a time-varying shift\nscanned over a pure integer sample shift. To limit this effect we identify an\nadditional requirement for the interpolation kernel: when considering\ntime-varying shifts the interpolation kernel must be sufficiently smooth to\navoid unwanted time-domain transitions that produce glitch-like features in\npower spectral density estimates. The Lagrange interpolation kernel exhibits a\ndiscontinuous first derivative by construction, which is insufficient for the\napplication to LISA or other space-based GW observatories. As a solution we\npropose a novel design method for interpolation kernels that respect a\npredefined requirement on in-band interpolation residuals and that possess\ncontinuous derivatives up to a prescribed order. Using this method we show that\nan interpolation kernel with 22 coefficients is sufficient to respect LISA's\npicometre-requirement and to allow for a continuous first derivative which\nsuppresses the magnitude of the time-domain transition adequately. The\nreduction from 42 (Lagrange interpolation) to 22 coefficients enables us to\nsave computational cost and increases robustness against artefacts in the data.",

    "abstract": "Phase crystals are a class of nonuniform superconducting ground states\ncharacterized by spontaneous phase gradients of the superconducting order\nparameter. These phase gradients nonlocally drive periodic currents and\nmagnetic fields, thus breaking both time-reversal symmetry and continuous\ntranslational symmetry. The phase crystal instability is generally triggered by\nnegative and inhomogeneous superfluid stiffness. Several scenarios have been\nidentified that can realize phase crystals, especially flat bands at specific\nedges of unconventional nodal superconductors. Motivated by omnipresent\ndisorder in all materials, we employ the ${t}$-matrix approach within the\nquasiclassical theory of superconductivity to study the emergence of phase\ncrystals at edges of a nodal $d$-wave superconductor. We quantify the full\nphase diagram as a function of the impurity scattering energy and the\ntemperature, with full self-consistency in the impurity self energies, the\nsuperconducting order parameter, and the vector potential. We find that the\nphase crystal survives even up to $\\sim 40-50\\%$ of the superconducting\ncritical impurity strength in both the Born and unitary scattering limits.\nFinally, we show how mesoscopic finite-size effects induce a competition with a\nstate still breaking time-reversal symmetry but with translationally invariant\nedge currents.",

    "abstract": "The concern about global warming increased the interest in the energy\nefficiency of computer applications. Assuming power is constant, the general\ntrend is that faster programs consume less energy, thus optimizing a program\nfor speed would also improve its energy efficiency.\n  We investigate this tendency in a set of C++ and Java solutions mined from\nCode Submission Evaluation System (CSES), a popular programming competition\nsite, where each solution must give the correct answer under a given time\nlimit. In such context, we can consider that all correct solutions for a\nproblem were written with a speed concern, but not with energy efficiency in\nmind.\n  We selected 15 problems from CSES and for each of them we mined at least 30\nC++ and Java solutions, evaluating time and energy efficiency of each solution\nin at least two different machines. In our scenario, where there is a great\ndiversity of programming styles, execution speed, and memory usage, we could\nconfirm the general trend: faster programs consume less energy. Moreover, we\nwere able to use ordinary least squares to fit a linear function, with good\nprecision, that relates energy consumption of a program based on its execution\ntime, as well as to automatically identify programs with abnormal energy\nconsumption. A manual analysis of these programs revealed that often they\nperform a different amount of allocation and deallocation operations when\ncompared to programs with similar execution times.\n  We also calculated the energy consumption profile of sets of random C++\nsolutions for these 15 CSES problems, and we tried to associate each set with\nits corresponding CSES problem by using the energy consumption profiles\npreviously computed for each one of them. With this approach, we restricted,\nfor each set of random C++ solutions, the classification task to a subset of 7\nCSES problems, a reduction of more than 50% in the search space.",

Existing iterative or deep learning-based methods are either\ntime-consuming or require large training datasets, significantly limiting their\npractical application. Here, we propose Zero-Shot Artifact2Artifact (ZS-A2A), a\nzero-shot self-supervised artifact removal method based on a super-lightweight\nnetwork, which leverages the fact that reconstruction artifacts are sensitive\nto irregularities caused by data loss. By introducing random perturbations to\nthe acquired PA data, it spontaneously generates subset data, which in turn\nstimulates the network to learn the artifact patterns in the reconstruction\nresults, thus enabling zero-shot artifact removal. This approach requires\nneither training data nor prior knowledge of the artifacts, and is capable of\nartifact removal for 3D PAI. For maximum amplitude projection (MAP) images or\nslice images in 3D PAI acquired with arbitrarily sparse or angle-limited\ndetector arrays, ZS-A2A employs a self-incentive strategy to complete artifact\nremoval and improves the Contrast-to-Noise Ratio (CNR). We validated ZS-A2A in\nboth simulation study and $ in\\ vivo $ animal experiments. Results demonstrate\nthat ZS-A2A achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing\nzero-shot methods, and for the $ in\\ vivo $ rat liver, ZS-A2A improves CNR from\n17.48 to 43.46 in just 8 seconds.

These tasks are\nframed as two separate binary classification problems. By adding two layers to\nthe co-scale convolutional attention (CCA) classifier architecture, we\nintroduce a novel approach for ICH detection. In the first layer, after\nextracting features from different slices of computed tomography (CT) scan\nimages, we combine these features and select the 50 components that capture the\nhighest variance in the data, considering them as informative features. We then\nassess the discriminative power of these features using the bootstrap forest\nalgorithm, discarding those that lack sufficient discriminative ability between\ndifferent classes. This algorithm explicitly determines the contribution of\neach feature to the final prediction, assisting us in developing an explainable\nAI model.

    "abstract": "Rydberg atoms are used in a wide range of applications due to their peculiar\nproperties like strong dipolar and van der Waals interactions. The choice of\nRydberg state has a huge impact on the strength and angular dependence of the\ninteractions, and so a detailed understanding of the underlying processes and\nresulting properties of the interactions is therefore key to select the most\nsuitable states for experiments. We study the van der Waals interactions in\nalkali atoms in detail and highlight the structures which allow an\nunderstanding and exploitation of the various interaction properties. A\nparticular theme is the identification of F\\\"orster resonances with $n_1 \\neq\nn_2$, which offer interaction potentials with a wide range of properties that\nmake them particularly interesting for experimental applications. A second\ntheme is a focus on the underlying structures that shape the angular dependency\nand sign of the interactions. This understanding -- instead of brute-force\ncalculations -- allows for a much simpler and more systematic search for\nsuitable pair states. These insights can be used for the selection of tailored\ninteraction potentials subject to experimental constraints and requirements. We\nuse rubidium as an example species in this work and also provide data for\ncesium and pair states that are coupled via two- or three-photon transitions,\ni.e. up to F states, in the appendix.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) are promising agents to solve such complex\nconceptual problems due to their implications in advancing engineering and\nscience tasks like assisted problem-solving. But vanilla LLMs, trained on\nopen-world data, lack the necessary CI. In this work, we specifically explore\nshallow customization methods (SCMs) of LLMs for solving complex conceptual\nproblems. We propose two novel SCM algorithms for LLM, to augment LLMs with CI\nand enable LLMs to solve complex conceptual problems: Conceptual In-Context\nLearning (C-ICL) and Chain of Concepts (CoC). The problem tackled in this paper\nis generation of proprietary data models in the engineering/industry domain\nbased on conceptual information in data modelling guidelines. We evaluate our\nalgorithms on varied sizes of the OpenAI LLMs against four evaluation metrics\nrelated to syntactic and semantic correctness, time and cost incurred. The\nproposed algorithms perform better than currently popular LLM SCMs like\nIn-context Learning (ICL) and Chain of Thoughts (CoT). It was observed that as\ncompared to CoT, response correctness increased by 30.6% and 29.88% for the new\nSCMs C-ICL and CoC respectively. Qualitative analysis suggests that the\nproposed new SCMs activate emergent capabilities in LLMs, previously unobserved\nin the existing SCMs. They make problem-solving processes more transparent and\nreduce hallucinations and the tendency of model responses to copy examples from\nprompts (parroting).",

We find that at unit\ndensity ratio, this single parameter allows for the correct description of an\narbitrarily shaped interface with an error of less than 5%. For density\ncontrasts, accurate results are observed for lower evaporation flux magnitudes\nand density ratios. Our proposed method can be applied to isothermal\nreaction-limited scenarios, such as evaporation in pure vapor or under a gas\ndraft.

    "abstract": "Smart glasses with integrated eye tracking technology are revolutionizing\ndiverse fields, from immersive augmented reality experiences to cutting-edge\nhealth monitoring solutions. However, traditional eye tracking systems rely\nheavily on cameras and significant computational power, leading to high-energy\ndemand and privacy issues. Alternatively, systems based on electrooculography\n(EOG) provide superior battery life but are less accurate and primarily\neffective for detecting blinks, while being highly invasive. The paper\nintroduces ElectraSight, a non-invasive plug-and-play low-power eye tracking\nsystem for smart glasses. The hardware-software co-design of the system is\ndetailed, along with the integration of a hybrid EOG (hEOG) solution that\nincorporates both contact and contactless electrodes. Within 79 kB of memory,\nthe proposed tinyML model performs real-time eye movement classification with\n81% accuracy for 10 classes and 92% for 6 classes, not requiring any\ncalibration or user-specific fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that\nElectraSight delivers high accuracy in eye movement and blink classification,\nwith minimal overall movement detection latency (90% within 60 ms) and an\nultra-low computing time (301 {\\mu}s). The power consumption settles down to\n7.75 mW for continuous data acquisition and 46 mJ for the tinyML inference.\nThis efficiency enables continuous operation for over 3 days on a compact 175\nmAh battery. This work opens new possibilities for eye tracking in commercial\napplications, offering an unobtrusive solution that enables advancements in\nuser interfaces, health diagnostics, and hands-free control systems.",

The\nprecise astrometric measurements of the Gaia mission provide an unprecedented\nopportunity to detect and analyze these events, revealing properties of lensing\nobjects such as their mass and distance. We develop and test the Gaia\nAstrometric Microlensing Events (GAME) Filter, a software tool to identify\nastrometric microlensing events and derive lensing object properties. We\ngenerated mock Gaia observations for different magnitudes, number of Gaia\nvisits, and events extending beyond Gaia's observational run. We applied GAME\nFilter to these datasets and validated its performance. We also assessed the\nrate of false positives where binary astrometric systems are misidentified as\nmicrolensing events. GAME Filter successfully recovers microlensing parameters\nfor strong events. Parameters are more difficult to recover for short events\nand those extending beyond Gaia's run, where only a fraction of the events is\nobserved. The astrometric effect breaks the degeneracy in the microlensing\nparallax present in photometric microlensing. For fainter sources, the observed\nsignal weakens, reducing recovered events and increasing parameter errors.\nHowever, even for Gaia G-band magnitude 19, parameters can be recovered for\nEinstein radii above two mas. Observing regions with varying numbers of Gaia\nvisits has minimal impact on filter accuracy when the number of visits exceeds\n90. Additionally, even if the peak of a microlensing event lies outside Gaia's\nrun, microlensing parameters can still be recovered.

Developers routinely ask LLMs to generate code snippets, increasing\nproductivity but also potentially introducing ownership, privacy, correctness,\nand security issues. Previous work highlighted how code generated by mainstream\ncommercial LLMs is often not safe, containing vulnerabilities, bugs, and code\nsmells. In this paper, we present a framework that leverages testing and static\nanalysis to assess the quality, and guide the self-improvement, of code\ngenerated by general-purpose, open-source LLMs.\n  First, we ask LLMs to generate C code to solve a number of programming tasks.\nThen we employ ground-truth tests to assess the (in)correctness of the\ngenerated code, and a static analysis tool to detect potential safety\nvulnerabilities. Next, we assess the models ability to evaluate the generated\ncode, by asking them to detect errors and vulnerabilities. Finally, we test the\nmodels ability to fix the generated code, providing the reports produced during\nthe static analysis and incorrectness evaluation phases as feedback.\n  Our results show that models often produce incorrect code, and that the\ngenerated code can include safety issues. Moreover, they perform very poorly at\ndetecting either issue. On the positive side, we observe a substantial ability\nto fix flawed code when provided with information about failed tests or\npotential vulnerabilities, indicating a promising avenue for improving the\nsafety of LLM-based code generation tools.",

In this research, the spin-dependent Seebeck effects\nare studied in a zigzag ${\\alpha'}$-borophene nanoribbon with two leads\nmagnetized by ferromagnetic (FM) insulators. The thermoelectric calculations\nare performed for a ${\\alpha'}$-BNR FM/Normal/FM junction using the\ntight-binding (TB) formalism in combination with the non-equilibrium Green's\nfunction method (NEGF). A pure spin-dependent current due to the breaking of\nthe electron-hole symmetry is induced in the system by a temperature gradient\nso that it can act as a spin-Seebeck diode. Moreover, the negative differential\nspin-Seebeck effect can be observed in this device dueto the compensation of\nthermal spin in the spin-dependent currents. Finally, we have studied the\neffect of temperature on the charge and spin power factors in ${\\alpha'}$-BNR.\nA significant decline in power factor is primarily arises from a reduction in\nthe magnitude of thermopower near the Fermi level. Our findings demonstrate\nthat the ${\\alpha'}$-BNR has a higher power factor compared to its rivals e.g.,\ngraphene and silicene.

First, we study photoemission from metals,\ntraditionally analyzed in the frequency domain. Unexpectedly, the photoemission\nrate oscillates at high frequencies as it decays, with the oscillation\namplitude decaying faster than the average current. Analytical and numerical\nresults reveal this behavior arises from interference between two excitation\nprocesses: one decaying via the Doniach-Sunjic power law and the other\nfollowing the faster Nozi\\`eres-De Dominicis law. XPS experiments targeting\nthis feature could identify its frequency-domain counterpart. Second, we\nexamine adiabaticity in an electron gas subject to a localized potential\nramping up at a constant rate. Analytical and numerical findings map the\nparameter space where the system behaves adiabatically. Contrary to the Quantum\nAdiabatic Criterion, which links adiabaticity to slow ramp-up rates, we show\nthat the number of energy scales involved in screening the potential dictates\nnon-adiabaticity. Lastly, we investigate the collision of a neutral hydrogen\natom with a copper surface. Electron transfer ionizes the H atom, activating an\nimage-charge potential that pulls the ion toward the surface. Using a spinless\nmodel, we numerically track the atomic wave packets evolution and compute the\nsticking coefficient, the probability the atom remains near the surface.

    "abstract": "Multi-step multimodal reasoning tasks pose significant challenges for\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), and finding effective ways to enhance\ntheir performance in such scenarios remains an unresolved issue. In this paper,\nwe propose AR-MCTS, a universal framework designed to progressively improve the\nreasoning capabilities of MLLMs through Active Retrieval (AR) and Monte Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS). Our approach begins with the development of a unified\nretrieval module that retrieves key supporting insights for solving complex\nreasoning problems from a hybrid-modal retrieval corpus. To bridge the gap in\nautomated multimodal reasoning verification, we employ the MCTS algorithm\ncombined with an active retrieval mechanism, which enables the automatic\ngeneration of step-wise annotations. This strategy dynamically retrieves key\ninsights for each reasoning step, moving beyond traditional beam search\nsampling to improve the diversity and reliability of the reasoning space.\nAdditionally, we introduce a process reward model that aligns progressively to\nsupport the automatic verification of multimodal reasoning tasks. Experimental\nresults across three complex multimodal reasoning benchmarks confirm the\neffectiveness of the AR-MCTS framework in enhancing the performance of various\nmultimodal models. Further analysis demonstrates that AR-MCTS can optimize\nsampling diversity and accuracy, yielding reliable multimodal reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Offline meta-reinforcement learning aims to equip agents with the ability to\nrapidly adapt to new tasks by training on data from a set of different tasks.\nContext-based approaches utilize a history of state-action-reward transitions\n-- referred to as the context -- to infer representations of the current task,\nand then condition the agent, i.e., the policy and value function, on the task\nrepresentations. Intuitively, the better the task representations capture the\nunderlying tasks, the better the agent can generalize to new tasks.\nUnfortunately, context-based approaches suffer from distribution mismatch, as\nthe context in the offline data does not match the context at test time,\nlimiting their ability to generalize to the test tasks. This leads to the task\nrepresentations overfitting to the offline training data. Intuitively, the task\nrepresentations should be independent of the behavior policy used to collect\nthe offline data. To address this issue, we approximately minimize the mutual\ninformation between the distribution over the task representations and behavior\npolicy by maximizing the entropy of behavior policy conditioned on the task\nrepresentations. We validate our approach in MuJoCo environments, showing that\ncompared to baselines, our task representations more faithfully represent the\nunderlying tasks, leading to outperforming prior methods in both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.",

    "abstract": "Federated heavy hitter analytics enables service providers to better\nunderstand the preferences of cross-party users by analyzing the most frequent\nitems. As with federated learning, it faces challenges of privacy concerns,\nstatistical heterogeneity, and expensive communication. Local differential\nprivacy (LDP), as the de facto standard for privacy-preserving data collection,\nsolves the privacy challenge by letting each user perturb her data locally and\nreport the sanitized version. However, in federated settings, applying LDP\ncomplicates the other two challenges, due to the deteriorated utility by the\ninjected LDP noise or increasing communication/computation costs by\nperturbation mechanism. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel\ntarget-aligning prefix tree mechanism satisfying $\\epsilon$-LDP, for federated\nheavy hitter analytics. In particular, we propose an adaptive extension\nstrategy to address the inconsistencies between covering necessary prefixes and\nestimating heavy hitters within a party to enhance the utility. We also present\na consensus-based pruning strategy that utilizes noisy prior knowledge from\nother parties to further align the inconsistency between finding heavy hitters\nin each party and providing reasonable frequency information to identify the\nglobal ones.

In a previous work, we had identified bound\nstates of NH and Feshbach resonances in the e + NH+ system at a single\ngeometry, namely the NH+ equilibrium Re = 2.0205 a0 .

It is hoped that the\nbound and the new resonant states obtained here will open up other molecular\ndynamics studies, since for several dissociative processes, although\nexperimental data existed for more than a decade, these are still\nuncorroborated due to absence of molecular data, and hence subsequent\ntheoretical calculations.",

In this paper, we investigate the\npotential of the SQiSW gate in various synthesis problems by utilizing only the\nSQiSW gate along with arbitrary single-qubit gates, while optimizing the\noverall circuit size. For exact synthesis, the upper bound of SQiSW gates to\nsynthesize arbitrary 3-qubit and $n$-qubit gates are 24 and\n$\\frac{139}{192}4^n(1+o(1))$ respectively, which relies on the properties of\nSQiSW gate in Lie theory and quantum shannon decomposition.

Part of\nthis limitation arises on top of our ignorance on how such systematics actually\nimpact the observed galaxy/quasar fields. In this work we develop a generic,\nhybrid model for an arbitrary number of systematics that may modulate\nobservations in both an additive and a multiplicative way, after applying a\nnonlinear power law transformation. This model allows us devising a novel\nalgorithm that addresses the identification and correction for either additive\nand/or multiplicative contaminants. We test this model on galaxy mocks and\nsystematics templates inspired from data of the third data release of the {\\it\nJavalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey} (J-PLUS). We find that our method\nclearly outperforms standard methods that assume either an additive or\nmultiplicative character for all contaminants in scenarios where both\ncharacters are actually acting on the observed data. In simpler scenarios where\nonly an additive or multiplicative imprint on observations is considered, our\nhybrid method does not lie far behind the corresponding simplified,\nadditive/multiplicative methods. Nonetheless, in scenarios of mild/low impact\nof systematics, we find that our hybrid approach converges towards the standard\nmethod that assumes additive contamination, as predicted by our model\ndescribing systematics. Our methodology also allows for the estimation of\nbiases induced by systematics residuals on different angular scales and under\ndifferent observational configurations, although these predictions necessarily\nrestrict to the subset of {\\em known/identified} potential systematics, and say\nnothing about ``unknown unknowns\" possibly impacting the data.",

    "abstract": "Although multiview fusion has demonstrated potential in LiDAR segmentation,\nits dependence on computationally intensive point-based interactions, arising\nfrom the lack of fixed correspondences between views such as range view and\nBird's-Eye View (BEV), hinders its practical deployment. This paper challenges\nthe prevailing notion that multiview fusion is essential for achieving high\nperformance. We demonstrate that significant gains can be realized by directly\nfusing Polar and Cartesian partitioning strategies within the BEV space. Our\nproposed BEV-only segmentation model leverages the inherent fixed grid\ncorrespondences between these partitioning schemes, enabling a fusion process\nthat is orders of magnitude faster (170$\\times$ speedup) than conventional\npoint-based methods. Furthermore, our approach facilitates dense feature\nfusion, preserving richer contextual information compared to sparse point-based\nalternatives. To enhance scene understanding while maintaining inference\nefficiency, we also introduce a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture. Extensive\nevaluation on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets provides compelling\nevidence that our method outperforms previous multiview fusion approaches in\nterms of both performance and inference speed, highlighting the potential of\nBEV-based fusion for LiDAR segmentation.

    "abstract": "We demonstrate a technique for ultrastable optical frequency dissemination in\na branching passive optical network using code-division multiple access (CDMA).\nIn our protocol, each network user employs a unique pseudo-random sequence to\nrapidly change the optical frequency among many distinct frequencies. After\ntransmission through the optical network, each user correlates the received\nsequence with the transmitted one, thus establishing a frequency-hopping spread\nspectrum technique that helps reject optical signals transmitted by other users\nin the network. Our method, which builds on the work by Schediwy et al. [Opt.\nLett. {\\bf 38}, 2893 (2013)], improves the frequency distribution network's\ncapacity, helps reject phase noise caused by intermediate optical back\nscattering, and simplifies the operational requirements. Using this protocol,\nwe show that a frequency instability better than ~$10^{-18}$ while having more\nthan 100 users operating in the network should be possible. Finally, we\ntheoretically explore the limits of this protocol and show that the\ndemonstrated stability does not suffer from any fundamental limitation. In the\nfuture, the CDMA method presented here could be used in complex time-frequency\ndistribution networks, allowing more users while, at the same time, reducing\nthe network's complexity.",

Moreover, existing methods often overlook the\nproblem of increased computational and storage requirements when improving\nmodel performance. To handle these limitations, we propose a lightweight\nenhanced alignment network, called the Multi-Level Embedding and Alignment\nNetwork (MEAN). The MEAN network uses a progressive multi-level enhancement\nstrategy, global-to-local associations, and cross-domain alignment, enabling\nfeature communication across levels. This allows MEAN to effectively connect\nfeatures at different levels and learn robust cross-view consistent mappings\nand modality-invariant features. Moreover, MEAN adopts a shallow backbone\nnetwork combined with a lightweight branch design, effectively reducing\nparameter count and computational complexity. Experimental results on the\nUniversity-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that MEAN reduces parameter\ncount by 62.17% and computational complexity by 70.99% compared to\nstate-of-the-art models, while maintaining competitive or even superior\nperformance.

Such impact is considered desirable for the\nsociety -- the higher, the better. Our goal is to understand how to allocate\ngoods fairly from the agents' perspective while maintaining society as happy as\npossible. To this end, we measure the impact on society using the utilitarian\nsocial welfare and provide both possibility and impossibility results. Our\nfindings reveal that achieving good approximations, better than linear in the\nnumber of agents, is not possible while ensuring fairness to the agents. These\nimpossibility results can be attributed to the fact that agents are completely\nunconscious of their social impact. Consequently, we explore scenarios where\nagents are socially aware, by introducing related fairness notions, and\ndemonstrate that an appropriate definition of fairness aligns with the goal of\nmaximizing the social objective.",

Although existing methods can\ndetect the tampered text region, the interpretation of such detection remains\nunclear, making the prediction unreliable. To address this problem, we propose\nto explain the basis of tampered text detection with natural language via large\nmultimodal models. To fill the data gap for this task, we propose a\nlarge-scale, comprehensive dataset, ETTD, which contains both pixel-level\nannotations for tampered text region and natural language annotations\ndescribing the anomaly of the tampered text. Multiple methods are employed to\nimprove the quality of the proposed data. For example, elaborate queries are\nintroduced to generate high-quality anomaly descriptions with GPT4o. A fused\nmask prompt is proposed to reduce confusion when querying GPT4o to generate\nanomaly descriptions. To automatically filter out low-quality annotations, we\nalso propose to prompt GPT4o to recognize tampered texts before describing the\nanomaly, and to filter out the responses with low OCR accuracy. To further\nimprove explainable tampered text detection, we propose a simple yet effective\nmodel called TextSleuth, which achieves improved fine-grained perception and\ncross-domain generalization by focusing on the suspected region, with a\ntwo-stage analysis paradigm and an auxiliary grounding prompt.

We aim to quantify and provide simple\nobservational constraints on the photospheric driving of oscillating coronal\nloops in a few typical active region configurations: sunspot, plage, pores and\nenhanced-network regions. We then aim to investigate the possible interplay\nbetween photospheric driving and properties of kink oscillations in connected\ncoronal loops. We analyse two unique datasets of the corona and photosphere\ntaken at a high resolution during the first coordinated observation campaign\nbetween Solar Orbiter and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A local\ncorrelation tracking method is applied on the SST/CRISP data to quantify the\nphotospheric motions at the base of coronal loops. The same loops are then\nanalysed in the corona by exploiting data from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager\non Solar Orbiter, and by using a wavelet analysis to characterize the kink\noscillations. Each photospheric region shows dynamics with an overall increase\nin strength going from pore, plage, enhanced-network to sunspot regions.\nDifferences are also seen in the kink-mode amplitudes of the corresponding\ncoronal loops. This suggests the photosphere is involved in the driving of\ncoronal kink oscillations. However, the few samples available does not allow to\nfurther establish the excitation mechanism yet. Despite oscillating coronal\nloops being anchored in seemingly \"static\" strong magnetic field regions as\nseen from coronal EUV observations, photospheric observations provide evidence\nfor a continuous and significant driving at their base. The precise connection\nbetween photospheric driving and coronal kink oscillations remains to be\nfurther investigated. This study finally provides critical constraints on\nphotospheric driving that can be tested in existing numerical models of coronal\nloops.",

Recent advancements have highlighted the\nsuperiority of foundation models in this task, particularly for their ability\nto leverage large amounts of unlabeled data and demonstrate strong\ngeneralization to unseen data. However, existing methods that focus on\ntoken-level relationships fail to capture broader flow patterns, as tokens,\ndefined as sequences of hexadecimal digits, typically carry limited semantic\ninformation in encrypted traffic. These flow patterns, which are crucial for\ntraffic classification, arise from the interactions between packets within a\nflow, not just their internal structure. To address this limitation, we propose\na Multi-Instance Encrypted Traffic Transformer (MIETT), which adopts a\nmulti-instance approach where each packet is treated as a distinct instance\nwithin a larger bag representing the entire flow. This enables the model to\ncapture both token-level and packet-level relationships more effectively\nthrough Two-Level Attention (TLA) layers, improving the model's ability to\nlearn complex packet dynamics and flow patterns. We further enhance the model's\nunderstanding of temporal and flow-specific dynamics by introducing two novel\npre-training tasks: Packet Relative Position Prediction (PRPP) and Flow\nContrastive Learning (FCL). After fine-tuning, MIETT achieves state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) results across five datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nclassifying encrypted traffic and understanding complex network behaviors.

In this\npaper, a lottery scheme has been designed to randomly split a parent model into\ntwo child models. This allows the calculation to be carried out in care-free\nmanner. By chance, one child model may have higher amounts of \"good\" atoms than\nthe parent model. Thus, its expansion in the next cycle favors an improved\nmodel. These \"lucky\" results are carried onto the next cycles. while \"unlucky\"\nresults in which no improvements occur are discarded. Furthermore, unchanged\nmodels are carried onto the next cycles in those \"unlucky\" occasions. On\naverage a child model has the same fraction of \"good\" atoms as the parent. Only\na substantial statistical fluctuation results in appreciable deviation. This\nlottery scheme works because such fluctuations do happen.

In this theoretical paper, we propose such interrelated\npathological mechanisms, localized in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) of the\nbrainstem, that are based on classical mechanisms of Hebbian and associative\nplasticity known from classical conditioning. Specifically, our model proposes\nthat hyperacusis results from synaptic enhancement of cochlear input to the\nDCN, whereas chronic tinnitus results from synaptic enhancement of\nsomatosensory input to the DCN. Specific conditions leading to one or the other\ncondition are discussed. Our model predicts, that hearing loss leads to chronic\ntinnitus, while noise exposure (which may also cause hearing loss) leads to\nhyperacusis.",

    "abstract": "In large-scale software systems, there are often no fully-fledged bug reports\nwith human-written descriptions when an error occurs. In this case, developers\nrely on stack traces, i.e., series of function calls that led to the error.\nSince there can be tens and hundreds of thousands of them describing the same\nissue from different users, automatic deduplication into categories is\nnecessary to allow for processing. Recent works have proposed powerful deep\nlearning-based approaches for this, but they are evaluated and compared in\nisolation from real-life workflows, and it is not clear whether they will\nactually work well at scale.\n  To overcome this gap, this work presents three main contributions: a novel\nmodel, an industry-based dataset, and a multi-faceted evaluation. Our model\nconsists of two parts - (1) an embedding model with byte-pair encoding and\napproximate nearest neighbor search to quickly find the most relevant stack\ntraces to the incoming one, and (2) a reranker that re-ranks the most fitting\nstack traces, taking into account the repeated frames between them. To\ncomplement the existing datasets collected from open-source projects, we share\nwith the community SlowOps - a dataset of stack traces from IntelliJ-based\nproducts developed by JetBrains, which has an order of magnitude more stack\ntraces per category. Finally, we carry out an evaluation that strives to be\nrealistic: measuring not only the accuracy of categorization, but also the\noperation time and the ability to create new categories. The evaluation shows\nthat our model strikes a good balance - it outperforms other models on both\nopen-source datasets and SlowOps, while also being faster on time than most.

In order to\nfacilitate the analysis of knowledge graphs, Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs)\nhave been developed to automatically analyse KGs and predict new facts based on\nthe information in a KG, a task called \"link prediction\". Many existing studies\nhave documented that the structure of a KG, KGE model components, and KGE\nhyperparameters can significantly change how well KGEs perform and what\nrelationships they are able to learn. Recently, the Topologically-Weighted\nIntelligence Generation (TWIG) model has been proposed as a solution to\nmodelling how each of these elements relate. In this work, we extend the\nprevious research on TWIG and evaluate its ability to simulate the output of\nthe KGE model ComplEx in the cross-KG setting. Our results are twofold. First,\nTWIG is able to summarise KGE performance on a wide range of hyperparameter\nsettings and KGs being learned, suggesting that it represents a general\nknowledge of how to predict KGE performance from KG structure. Second, we show\nthat TWIG can successfully predict hyperparameter performance on unseen KGs in\nthe zero-shot setting. This second observation leads us to propose that, with\nadditional research, optimal hyperparameter selection for KGE models could be\ndetermined in a pre-hoc manner using TWIG-like methods, rather than by using a\nfull hyperparameter search.",

In arXiv:1604.07818 the linearised action\nwas derived from the soft mode contribution to the four-point function, and\nphysical arguments were presented for its nonlinear completion to the\nSchwarzian. In this paper, we give two derivations of the full nonlinear\neffective action in the large $p$ limit, where $p$ is the number of fermions in\nthe interaction terms of the Hamiltonian. The first derivation uses that the\ncollective field action of the large-$p$ SYK model is Liouville theory with a\nnon-conformal boundary condition that we study in conformal perturbation\ntheory. This derivation can be viewed as an explicit version of the\nrenormalisation group argument for the nonlinear soft mode action in\narXiv:1711.08467. The second derivation uses an Ansatz for how the soft mode\nembeds into the microscopic configuration space of the collective fields. We\ngeneralise our results for the large-$p$ SYK chain and obtain a \"Schwarzian\nchain\" effective action for it. These derivations showcase that the large-$p$\nSYK model is a rare system, in which there is sufficient control over the\nmicroscopic dynamics, so that an effective description can be derived for it\nwithout the need for extra assumptions or matching (in the effective field\ntheory sense).",

In condensed matter physics,\nthe fractional quantum Hall effect is a prominent example of strong\ncorrelation, with Landau level mixing being one of the most challenging aspects\nto address using traditional computational methods. Deep learning real-space\nneural network wavefunction methods have emerged as promising architectures to\ndescribe electron correlations in molecules and materials, but their power has\nnot been fully tested for exotic quantum states. In this work, we employ\nreal-space neural network wavefunction techniques to investigate fractional\nquantum Hall systems. On both $1/3$ and $2/5$ filling systems, we achieve\nenergies consistently lower than exact diagonalization results which only\nconsider the lowest Landau level. We also demonstrate that the real-space\nneural network wavefunction can naturally capture the extent of Landau level\nmixing up to a very high level, overcoming the limitations of traditional\nmethods. Our work underscores the potential of neural networks for future\nstudies of strongly correlated systems and opens new avenues for exploring the\nrich physics of the fractional quantum Hall effect.",

Experimental results on two datasets\nusing ten popular zero-shot LLMs show ToC remarkably boosts accuracy by nearly\n20% over CodeAct with less than 1/4 turns. Several LLMs even perform better on\none-turn CodeProgram than on multi-turn CodeAct.

    "abstract": "Automated Program Repair (APR) for introductory programming assignments\n(IPAs) is motivated by the large number of student enrollments in programming\ncourses each year. Since providing feedback on IPAs requires substantial time\nand effort from faculty, personalized feedback often involves suggesting fixes\nto students' programs. Formal Methods (FM)-based semantic repair approaches,\ncheck a program's execution against a test suite or reference solution, are\neffective but limited. These tools excel at identifying buggy parts but can\nonly fix programs if the correct implementation and the faulty one share the\nsame control flow graph. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for\nAPR but often make extensive instead of minimal rewrites. This leads to more\ninvasive fixes, making it harder for students to learn from their mistakes. In\nsummary, LLMs excel at completing strings, while FM-based fault localization\nexcel at identifying buggy parts of a program. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach that combines the strengths of both FM-based fault localization\nand LLMs, via zero-shot learning, to enhance APR for IPAs. Our method uses\nMaxSAT-based fault localization to identify buggy parts of a program, then\npresents the LLM with a program sketch devoid of these buggy statements. This\nhybrid approach follows a CEGIS loop to iteratively refine the program. We ask\nthe LLM to synthesize the missing parts, which are then checked against a test\nsuite. If the suggested program is incorrect, a counterexample from the test\nsuite is fed back to the LLM. Our experiments show that our counterexample\nguided approach, using MaxSAT-based bug-free program sketches, significantly\nimproves the repair capabilities of all six evaluated LLMs. This method allows\nLLMs to repair more programs with smaller fixes, outperforming other\nconfigurations and state-of-the-art symbolic program repair tools.",

We confirm previously described continuum features\nand elaborate further on filamentary features identified using the\nhigh-resolution (1') maps from these new observations. We investigate the\nabrupt change in sign of rotation measure (RM) across the SNR, using the linear\npolarization observations in the four bands around 1420 MHz. Following X. H.\nSun et al.'s (2011) investigation, we both confirm that the distribution of\nsigns of the RMs for extragalactic sources in the area appears to match that of\nthe shell, as well as combine the data from the four bands to estimate the\nrelative depolarization and the intrinsic rotation measure of the SNR. We do\nnot conclusively reject X. H. Sun et al.'s (2011) claim of a Faraday screen in\nthe foreground causing the distribution of RMs that we observe; however, we do\nsuggest an alternative explanation of a swept-up stellar wind from the\nprogenitor star with a toroidal magnetic field. Finally, we expand on the\nanalysis of the H I observations by applying the Rolling Hough Transform to\nisolate filamentary structure and better identify H I emission with the SNR.\nFurther constraining the H I velocity channels associated with CTA 1, we use\nmore recent Galactic rotation curves to calculate an updated kinematic distance\nof 1.09 +/- 0.2 kpc.",

We show that the\ncombination of local embedded stencils with these principles can be employed to\napproximate surface derivatives using polyharmonic spline kernels and\npolynomials (PHS+Poly) RBF-FD.

An extensive parameter\nanalysis is presented to test the dependence of the approach. We demonstrate\nhigh-order convergence rates on problems involving surface advection and\nsurface diffusion, and solve Turing pattern formations on surfaces defined\neither implicitly or by point clouds.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by using query pipelines to retrieve relevant external\ninformation and grounding responses in retrieved knowledge. However, query\npipeline optimization for cancer patient question-answering (CPQA) systems\nrequires separately optimizing multiple components with domain-specific\nconsiderations. We propose a novel three-aspect optimization approach for the\nRAG query pipeline in CPQA systems, utilizing public biomedical databases like\nPubMed and PubMed Central. Our optimization includes: (1) document retrieval,\nutilizing a comparative analysis of NCBI resources and introducing Hybrid\nSemantic Real-time Document Retrieval (HSRDR); (2) passage retrieval,\nidentifying optimal pairings of dense retrievers and rerankers; and (3)\nsemantic representation, introducing Semantic Enhanced Overlap Segmentation\n(SEOS) for improved contextual understanding. On a custom-developed dataset\ntailored for cancer-related inquiries, our optimized RAG approach improved the\nanswer accuracy of Claude-3-haiku by 5.24% over chain-of-thought prompting and\nabout 3% over a naive RAG setup. This study highlights the importance of\ndomain-specific query optimization in realizing the full potential of RAG and\nprovides a robust framework for building more accurate and reliable CPQA\nsystems, advancing the development of RAG-based biomedical systems.",

    "abstract": "We consider a massive vector Boson in a static patch of $D$-dimensional de\nSitter space (dS$_D$). We argue that this field is controlled by an effective\nphysical (squared) mass $\\mu_{\\mathrm{v}}^2 = m_{\\mathrm{v}}^2 +\n2(D-1)\\ell_{\\mathrm{dS}}^{-2}$ which differs from the naive \"Lagrangian\"\n(squared) mass $m_{\\mathrm{v}}^2$ that appears in the usual form of the Proca\nLagrangian/action. In particular, we conjecture that the theory remains\nwell-defined in the naively tachyonic Lagrangian mass range $-2(D-1) <\nm_{\\mathrm{v}}^2\\ell_{\\mathrm{dS}}^2 < 0$. We identify several interesting\nphysical features of the \"edge of stability\"\n$m_{\\mathrm{v}}^2\\ell_{\\mathrm{dS}}^2 = -2(D-1)$. Fixing a static patch breaks\nthe $D$-dimensional de Sitter isometries down to a \"static patch subgroup\",\nwhich explains why our theory may continue to be well-defined in the above mass\nrange despite not fitting into a unitary irreducible representation of\nSO$(D,1)$. We conjecture that for situations such as ours, the usual\n$\\mathrm{SO}(D,1)$ \"Higuchi bound\" on unitarity is replaced by the concept of\nthe edge of stability. In $D = 3$ spacetime dimensions, the $s$-wave sector of\nour theory remarkably simplifies, becoming equivalent to the $p$-wave sector of\nan ordinary massive scalar. In this case we can explicitly check that the $D =\n3$ $s$-wave sector remains well-defined -- both classically and quantum\nmechanically -- in the above mass range. In the course of our analysis, we will\nderive the general classical solution and the quasinormal frequency spectrum\nfor the massive vector Boson in the static patch of dS$_D$, generalizing\nprevious work by Higuchi [1], which was done for the special case $D = 4$.\nWhile this work was being completed, we became aware of upcoming work by\nGrewal, Law, and Lochab [2] which will contain a similar derivation.",

The observation period $T$ dictates if the full barriers or\nonly certain pieces can be recovered, and the sampling rate significantly\ninfluences the convergence rate as $T\\to \\infty$.

The distinct topological structure in the\nproximity of an EP gives rise to counterintuitive behaviors absent in Hermitian\nsystems, which emerge after encircling the EP either quasistatically or\ndynamically. However, experimental exploration of EP encirclement in quantum\nsystems, particularly those involving high-order EPs, remains challenging due\nto the difficulty of coherently controlling more degrees of freedom. In this\nwork, we experimentally investigate the eigenvalues braiding and state transfer\narising from the encirclement of EP in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian\nquantum system using superconducting circuits. We characterize the second- and\nthird-order EPs through the coalescence of eigenvalues. Then we reveal the\ntopological structure near the EP3 by quasistatically encircling it along\nvarious paths with three independent parameters, which yields the eigenvalues\nbraiding described by the braid group $B_3$. Additionally, we observe chiral\nstate transfer between three eigenstates under a fast driving scheme when no\nEPs are enclosed, while time-symmetric behavior occurs when at least one EP is\nencircled.

The growth of species $A$ is modelled using a\nnonlinear logistic term. Through linear stability analysis, we derive phase\ndiagrams illustrating the various dynamical regimes in parameter space. Our\nfindings indicate that an increase in the P\\'eclet number results in the\ndestabilisation of the uniform steady state. In contrast, counter-intuitively,\nan increase in the nonlinear growth parameter of $A$ actually stabilises the\nhomogeneous steady-state regime. Additionally, we observe that greater\nasymmetry between the species leads to three distinct dynamical phases, while\nlow asymmetry fails to produce oscillatory instability. Numerical simulations\nconducted in instability regimes show patterns that range from irregular,\narrhythmic configurations at high P\\'eclet numbers to both transient and robust\nsymmetry-breaking chimera states. Notably, these chimera patterns are more\nprevalent in the oscillatory instability regime, and our stability analysis\nindicates that this regime is the most extensive for high nonlinear growth\nparameters and moderately high P\\'eclet numbers. Further, we also find\nsoliton-like structures where aggregations of species $A$ merge, and new\naggregations spontaneously emerge, and these patterns are prevalent in the\nphase of stationary instability. Overall, our study illustrates that a diverse\narray of patterns can emerge in active matter influenced by nonlinear growth in\na chemical species, with chimeras being particularly dominant when the\nnonlinear growth parameter is elevated.",

The inherent random geometry of\nthe graphs and their dynamical spatial dimensionality, leads to various quantum\nchaotic and localized phases and transitions between them. Essentially the\nrandom geometry acts as disorder, whose strength is characterized by the ratio\nof edges over vertices R in the graphs. For dense graphs, with large ratio R,\nthe spacing between successive energy levels follows the Wigner-Dyson\ndistribution, leading to a quantum chaotic behavior and a metallic phase,\ncharacterized by level repulsion. For ratios near R=0.5, where a large\ndominating component in the graph appears, the level spacing follows the\nPoisson distribution with level crossings and a localized phase for the\nrespective wavefunctions lying on the graph. For intermediate ratios R we\nobserve a phase transition between the quantum chaotic and localized phases\ncharacterized by a semi-Poisson distribution. The values R of the critical\nregime where the phase transition occurs depend on the energy of the system.\nOur analysis shows that physical systems with random geometry, for example ones\nwith a fluctuating/dynamical spatial dimension, contain novel universal phase\ntransition properties, similar to those occuring in more traditional phase\ntransitions based on symmetry breaking mechanisms, whose universal properties\nare strongly determined by the dimensionality of the system.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used in graph data mining tasks.\nTraditional GNNs follow a message passing scheme that can effectively utilize\nlocal and structural information. However, the phenomena of over-smoothing and\nover-squashing limit the receptive field in message passing processes. Graph\nTransformers were introduced to address these issues, achieving a global\nreceptive field but suffering from the noise of irrelevant nodes and loss of\nstructural information. Therefore, drawing inspiration from fine-grained\ntoken-based representation learning in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we\npropose the Structure-aware Multi-token Graph Transformer (Tokenphormer), which\ngenerates multiple tokens to effectively capture local and structural\ninformation and explore global information at different levels of granularity.\nSpecifically, we first introduce the walk-token generated by mixed walks\nconsisting of four walk types to explore the graph and capture structure and\ncontextual information flexibly. To ensure local and global information\ncoverage, we also introduce the SGPM-token (obtained through the\nSelf-supervised Graph Pre-train Model, SGPM) and the hop-token, extending the\nlength and density limit of the walk-token, respectively. Finally, these\nexpressive tokens are fed into the Transformer model to learn node\nrepresentations collaboratively. Experimental results demonstrate that the\ncapability of the proposed Tokenphormer can achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance on node classification tasks.",

    "abstract": "Micro-Action Recognition (MAR) has gained increasing attention due to its\ncrucial role as a form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with\npromising potential for applications in human communication and emotion\nanalysis. However, current approaches often overlook the inherent ambiguity in\nmicro-actions, which arises from the wide category range and subtle visual\ndifferences between categories. This oversight hampers the accuracy of\nmicro-action recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel Prototypical\nCalibrating Ambiguous Network (PCAN) to unleash and mitigate the ambiguity of\nMAR. Firstly, we employ a hierarchical action-tree to identify the ambiguous\nsample, categorizing them into distinct sets of ambiguous samples of false\nnegatives and false positives, considering both body- and action-level\ncategories. Secondly, we implement an ambiguous contrastive refinement module\nto calibrate these ambiguous samples by regulating the distance between\nambiguous samples and their corresponding prototypes. This calibration process\naims to pull false negative (FN) samples closer to their respective prototypes\nand push false positive (FP) samples apart from their affiliated prototypes. In\naddition, we propose a new prototypical diversity amplification loss to\nstrengthen the model's capacity by amplifying the differences between different\nprototypes. Finally, we propose a prototype-guided rectification to rectify\nprediction by incorporating the representability of prototypes.

LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific\nmodules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a\nminimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps.

While missions like TESS and Kepler have studied\nregular and super-flares, their detection of flares with energies below\n$10^{30}$ erg remains incomplete. Extending flare studies to include these\nlow-energy events could enhance flare formation models and provide insight into\ntheir impacts on exoplanetary atmospheres. This study investigates CHEOPS's\ncapacity to detect low-energy flares in M dwarf light curves. Using its high\nphotometric precision and observing cadence, along with a tailored\nwavelet-based denoising algorithm, we aim to improve detection completeness and\nrefine flare statistics for low-energy events. We conducted a flare injection\nand recovery to optimise denoising parameters, applied it to CHEOPS light\ncurves to maximise detection rates, and used a flare breakdown algorithm to\nanalyse complex structures. We recovered 291 flares with energies ranging from\n$3.7\\times10^{26}$ to $8.9\\times10^{30}$ erg across 62 M dwarfs, with $\\sim$42%\nexhibiting complex, multi-peaked structures. The denoising improved flare\nrecovery by $\\sim$35%, although it marginally extended the lower boundary of\ndetectable energies. For the full sample, the power-law index $\\alpha$ was\n$1.99\\pm0.10$, but a log-normal distribution fitted better, suggesting multiple\npossible flare formation scenarios. While CHEOPS's observing mode is not ideal\nfor large-scale surveys, it captures weaker flares than TESS or Kepler,\nexpanding the observed energy range. Wavelet-based denoising enhances\nlow-energy event recovery, enabling exploration of the micro-flaring regime.\nExpanding low-energy flare observations could refine flare generation models\nand improve the understanding of their role in star-planet interactions.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks can be drastically shrunk in size by removing redundant\nparameters. While crucial for the deployment on resource-constraint hardware,\noftentimes, compression comes with a severe drop in accuracy and lack of\nadversarial robustness. Despite recent advances, counteracting both aspects has\nonly succeeded for moderate compression rates so far. We propose a novel\nmethod, HARP, that copes with aggressive pruning significantly better than\nprior work. For this, we consider the network holistically. We learn a global\ncompression strategy that optimizes how many parameters (compression rate) and\nwhich parameters (scoring connections) to prune specific to each layer\nindividually. Our method fine-tunes an existing model with dynamic\nregularization, that follows a step-wise incremental function balancing the\ndifferent objectives. It starts by favoring robustness before shifting focus on\nreaching the target compression rate and only then handles the objectives\nequally. The learned compression strategies allow us to maintain the\npre-trained model natural accuracy and its adversarial robustness for a\nreduction by 99% of the network original size. Moreover, we observe a crucial\ninfluence of non-uniform compression across layers.",

While optical surveys have been the primary\nsource for cosmic shear measurements, radio continuum surveys offer a promising\navenue. Relevant radio sources, principally star-forming galaxies, have\npopulations with higher mean redshifts and are less affected by dust extinction\ncompared to optical sources. We focus on the future mid frequency SKA radio\ntelescope and explore the cross-correlation between radio cosmic shear and CMB\nlensing convergence ($\\gamma_\\mathrm{R}\\times \\kappa_\\mathrm{CMB}$). We\ninvestigate its potential in constraining the redshift distribution of radio\ngalaxy samples and improving cosmological parameter constraints, including the\nneutrino sector. Using simulations of the first phase of the SKA and the Simons\nObservatory as a CMB experiment, we show how this $\\gamma_\\mathrm{R}\\times\n\\kappa_\\mathrm{CMB}$ cross-correlation can provide $\\sim1 - 10\\%$ calibration\nof the overall radio source redshift distribution, which in turn can\nsignificantly tighten otherwise degenerate measurements of radio galaxy bias.\nFor the case of the next-generation full SKA, we find that the\ncross-correlation becomes more powerful than the equivalent with a\n\\textit{Euclid}-like survey, with constraints $30\\%$ tighter on $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters and narrower bounds on sum of neutrino masses at the level of $\\sim\n24\\%$. These constraints are also driven by higher redshifts and larger scales\nthan other galaxy-CMB cross-correlations, potentially shedding light on\ndifferent physical models. Our findings demonstrate the potential of radio weak\nlensing in improving constraints, and establish the groundwork for future joint\nanalyses of CMB experiments and radio continuum surveys.",

We aim to characterise\nthe dual active galactic nuclei (AGN), the ionised gas outflows and the main\nproperties of the interstellar medium over a mapped area of 6.6\"x7.7\". We\nobtained integral field spectroscopic mid-infrared data of NGC6240, resolving\nboth nuclei for the first time in the full 5-28{\\mu}m spectral range. We\nmodelled the emission lines through a kinematic decomposition, finding that the\nfine-structure lines in the southern (S) nucleus are broader than for the\nnorthern (N) nucleus (full width at half maximum of $\\geq$1500 vs ~700 km\ns^{-1} on average). High excitation lines, such as [NeV], [NeVI], and [MgV],\nare clearly detected in the N nucleus. In the S nucleus, the same lines can be\ndetected but only after a decomposition of the PAH features in the integrated\nspectrum, due to a combination of a strong mid-IR continuum, the broad emission\nlines, and the intense star formation (SF). The SF is distributed all over the\nmapped FoV of 3.5kpc x 4.1kpc (projected), with the maximum located around the\nS nucleus. Both nuclear regions appear to be connected by a bridge region\ndetected with all the emission lines. Based on the observed MRS line ratios and\nthe high velocity dispersion ({\\sigma}~600 km s^{-1}), shocks are also\ndominating the emission in this system. We detected the presence of outflows as\na bubble north-west from the N nucleus and at the S nucleus. We estimated a\nionised mass outflow rate of 1.4$\\pm$0.3 M yr^{-1} and 1.8$\\pm$0.2 M yr^{-1},\nrespectively.

Our\naim is to assess the extent of confidence that LLMs have in their answers and\nhow it correlates with accuracy. Confidence is measured (i) qualitatively in\nterms of persistence in keeping their answer when prompted to reconsider, and\n(ii) quantitatively in terms of self-reported confidence score. We investigate\nthe performance of three LLMs -- GPT4o, GPT4-turbo and Mistral -- on two\nbenchmark sets of questions on causal judgement and formal fallacies and a set\nof probability and statistical puzzles and paradoxes. Although the LLMs show\nsignificantly better performance than random guessing, there is a wide\nvariability in their tendency to change their initial answers. There is a\npositive correlation between qualitative confidence and accuracy, but the\noverall accuracy for the second answer is often worse than for the first\nanswer. There is a strong tendency to overstate the self-reported confidence\nscore. Confidence is only partially explained by the underlying token-level\nprobability. The material effects of prompting on qualitative confidence and\nthe strong tendency for overconfidence indicate that current LLMs do not have\nany internally coherent sense of confidence.",

The latest methods for such\nproblems have commonly built document-level event graphs for global reasoning\nacross sentences.

    "abstract": "Merger events are thought to be an important phase in the assembly of massive\ngalaxies. At the same time, Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) play a fundamental\nrole in the evolution of their star formation histories. Both phenomena can be\nobserved at work in NGC 6240, a local prototypical merger, classified as an\nUltraLuminous InfraRed Galaxy (ULIRG) thanks to its elevated infrared\nluminosity. Interestingly, NGC 6240 hosts two AGN separated by 1.5''(~ 735 pc),\ndetected in both X-ray and radio band. Taking advantage of the unprecedented\nsensitivity and wavelength coverage provided by the Integral Field Unit (IFU)\nof the NIRSpec instrument onboard JWST, we observed the nuclear region of NGC\n6240 in a FoV of 3.7'' x 3.7''(1.9 x 1.9 kpc^2), to investigate gas kinematics\nand InterStellar Medium (ISM) properties with a high spatial resolution of ~\n0.1'' (or ~ 50 pc). We separated the different gas kinematic components through\nmulti-Gaussian fitting and studied the excitation properties of the ISM from\nthe NIR diagnostic diagram based on the H_2 1-0 S(1)/BrGamma and [Fe\nII]1.257micron/PaBeta lines ratios. We isolated the ionization cones of the two\nnuclei, and detected coronal lines emission from both of them. Using H_2 line\nratios, we found that the molecular hydrogen gas is excited mostly by thermal\nprocesses. We computed a hot molecular gas mass of 1.3 x 10^5 M_sun and an\nionized gas mass in the range of 10^5 - 10^7 M_sun. We studied with\nunprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity the kinematics of the\nmolecular and ionized gas phases. We revealed the complex structure of the\nmolecular gas and found a blueshifted outflow near the Southern nucleus,\ntogether with filaments connecting a highly redshifted H_2 cloud with the two\nnuclei. We speculate on the possible nature of this H_2 cloud and propose two\npossible scenarios: either outflowing gas, or a tidal cloud falling onto the\nnuclei.",

However, existing OSOD methods often fail to meet\nthe requirements of robotic applications due to their high computational burden\nand complex deployment. To address this issue, this paper proposes a\nlight-weight framework called Decoupled OSOD (DOSOD), which is a practical and\nhighly efficient solution to support real-time OSOD tasks in robotic systems.\nSpecifically, DOSOD builds upon the YOLO-World pipeline by integrating a\nvision-language model (VLM) with a detector. A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\nadaptor is developed to transform text embeddings extracted by the VLM into a\njoint space, within which the detector learns the region representations of\nclass-agnostic proposals. Cross-modality features are directly aligned in the\njoint space, avoiding the complex feature interactions and thereby improving\ncomputational efficiency. DOSOD operates like a traditional closed-set detector\nduring the testing phase, effectively bridging the gap between closed-set and\nopen-set detection. Compared to the baseline YOLO-World, the proposed DOSOD\nsignificantly enhances real-time performance while maintaining comparable\naccuracy. The slight DOSOD-S model achieves a Fixed AP of $26.7\\%$, compared to\n$26.2\\%$ for YOLO-World-v1-S and $22.7\\%$ for YOLO-World-v2-S, using similar\nbackbones on the LVIS minival dataset. Meanwhile, the FPS of DOSOD-S is\n$57.1\\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v1-S and $29.6\\%$ higher than YOLO-World-v2-S.\nMeanwhile, we demonstrate that the DOSOD model facilitates the deployment of\nedge devices.

Most NAS methods exploit an\nover-parameterized network (i.e., a supernet) containing all possible\narchitectures (i.e., subnets) in the search space. However, the subnets that\nshare the same set of parameters are likely to have different characteristics,\ninterfering with each other during training. To address this, few-shot NAS\nmethods have been proposed that divide the space into a few subspaces and\nemploy a separate supernet for each subspace to limit the extent of weight\nsharing. They achieve state-of-the-art performance, but the computational cost\nincreases accordingly. We introduce in this paper a novel few-shot NAS method\nthat exploits the number of nonlinear functions to split the search space. To\nbe specific, our method divides the space such that each subspace consists of\nsubnets with the same number of nonlinear functions. Our splitting criterion is\nefficient, since it does not require comparing gradients of a supernet to split\nthe space. In addition, we have found that dividing the space allows us to\nreduce the channel dimensions required for each supernet, which enables\ntraining multiple supernets in an efficient manner. We also introduce a\nsupernet-balanced sampling (SBS) technique, sampling several subnets at each\ntraining step, to train different supernets evenly within a limited number of\ntraining steps. Extensive experiments on standard NAS benchmarks demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at\nhttps://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/projects/EFS-NAS.",

In this study, we introduce a\nneural network approach to simultaneously handle multiple properties of\ngalaxies.

The network is trained\nwith galaxy samples from the VANDELS and MUSE spectroscopic surveys and\nachieves the performance of 77% true positive rate and 14% false positive rate.\nThe permutation feature importance method shows that $\\beta$, $M_\\mathrm{UV}$,\nand $M_*$ are important for the prediction of LAEs. As an independent\nvalidation, we find that 91% of LAEs spectroscopically confirmed by the James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) have a probability of LAE higher than 70% in this\nmodel. This prediction model enables the efficient construction of a large LAE\nsample in a wide and continuous redshift space using only photometric data.

To detect malicious intrusions in\nICN, intrusion detection systems have been deployed. However, in ICN, network\ntraffic data is equipped with characteristics of large scale, irregularity,\nmultiple features, temporal correlation and high dimensionality, which greatly\naffect the efficiency and performance. To properly solve the above problems, we\ndesign a new intrusion detection method for ICN.

Then, we adopt ARN to design a new intrusion\ndetection method that can efficiently and accurately detect malicious\nintrusions in ICN.

However, the\ntraditional FL with deep neural networks trained via backpropagation can hardly\nmeet the low-latency learning requirements in the sixth generation (6G) mobile\nnetworks. This challenge mainly arises from the high-dimensional model\nparameters to be transmitted and the numerous rounds of communication required\nfor convergence due to the inherent randomness of the training process. To\naddress this issue, we adopt the state-of-the-art principle of maximal coding\nrate reduction to learn linear discriminative features and extend the resultant\nwhite-box neural network into FL, yielding the novel framework of Low-Latency\nFederated Learning (LoLaFL) via forward-only propagation. LoLaFL enables\nlayer-wise transmissions and aggregation with significantly fewer communication\nrounds, thereby considerably reducing latency. Additionally, we propose two\n\\emph{nonlinear} aggregation schemes for LoLaFL. The first scheme is based on\nthe proof that the optimal NN parameter aggregation in LoLaFL should be\nharmonic-mean-like. The second scheme further exploits the low-rank structures\nof the features and transmits the low-rank-approximated covariance matrices of\nfeatures to achieve additional latency reduction. Theoretic analysis and\nexperiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of LoLaFL. In comparison\nwith traditional FL, the two nonlinear aggregation schemes for LoLaFL can\nachieve reductions in latency of over 91\\% and 98\\%, respectively, while\nmaintaining comparable accuracies.",

The latter can be a source of\nsystematics that affect the shear two-point correlation function. A key stake\nof weak lensing analysis is to forecast the systematics due to the PSF.\nCorrelation functions of galaxies and the PSF, the so-called $\\rho$- and\n$\\tau$-statistics, are used to evaluate the level of systematics coming from\nthe PSF model and PSF corrections, and contributing to the two-point\ncorrelation function used to perform cosmological inference. Our goal is to\nintroduce a fast and simple method to estimate this level of systematics and\nassess its agreement with state-of-the-art approaches. We introduce a new way\nto estimate the covariance matrix of the $\\tau$-statistics using analytical\nexpressions. The covariance allows us to estimate parameters directly related\nto the level of systematics associated with the PSF and provides us with a tool\nto validate the PSF model used in a weak-lensing analysis. We apply those\nmethods to data from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey\n(UNIONS). We show that the semi-analytical covariance yields comparable results\nthan using covariances obtained from simulations or jackknife resampling. It\nrequires less computation time and is therefore well suited for rapid\ncomparison of the systematic level obtained from different catalogs. We also\nshow how one can break degeneracies between parameters with a redefinition of\nthe $\\tau$-statistics.

In the case of an axion-like particle, this\nscattering imparts a parity violating effect. If this collective scattering\nwith axion-like particles is inserted into the one-loop quantum electrodynamics\ndiagram, the parity violation imparted by this scattering will convert the\nanomalous magnetic moment contribution into an electric dipole moment. This\ncontribution is quite large and leads to a prediction inconsistent with\nprecision measurements of the proton and electron electric dipole moments,\nunless their couplings to the axion-like particles are very weak.

EDoF is then calculated\nbased on such distribution of coupling coefficients. A numerical method is also\nprovided to obtain coupling coefficients via electromagnetic full-wave\nsimulations.

The main contributions\nare: (1) an optimized $k$-cluster algorithm achieving $O(l \\cdot k^2 \\cdot \\log\nn)$ complexity for greedy $k$-means++ initialization and $O(i \\cdot k \\cdot\n\\log n)$ for Lloyd's algorithm, where $l$ is the number of greedy $k$-means++\nlocal trials, and $i$ is the number of Lloyd's algorithm iterations, and (2) a\nbinary search-based two-cluster algorithm, achieving $O(\\log n)$ runtime with\ndeterministic convergence to a Lloyd's algorithm local minimum. Benchmarks\ndemonstrate over a 4500x speedup compared to scikit-learn for large datasets\nwhile maintaining clustering quality measured by within-cluster sum of squares\n(WCSS).

    "abstract": "Human-centric perceptions play a crucial role in real-world applications.\nWhile recent human-centric works have achieved impressive progress, these\nefforts are often constrained to the visual domain and lack interaction with\nhuman instructions, limiting their applicability in broader scenarios such as\nchatbots and sports analysis. This paper introduces Referring Human\nPerceptions, where a referring prompt specifies the person of interest in an\nimage. To tackle the new task, we propose RefHCM (Referring Human-Centric\nModel), a unified framework to integrate a wide range of human-centric\nreferring tasks. Specifically, RefHCM employs sequence mergers to convert raw\nmultimodal data -- including images, text, coordinates, and parsing maps --\ninto semantic tokens. This standardized representation enables RefHCM to\nreformulate diverse human-centric referring tasks into a sequence-to-sequence\nparadigm, solved using a plain encoder-decoder transformer architecture.\nBenefiting from a unified learning strategy, RefHCM effectively facilitates\nknowledge transfer across tasks and exhibits unforeseen capabilities in\nhandling complex reasoning. This work represents the first attempt to address\nreferring human perceptions with a general-purpose framework, while\nsimultaneously establishing a corresponding benchmark that sets new standards\nfor the field. Extensive experiments showcase RefHCM's competitive and even\nsuperior performance across multiple human-centric referring tasks.

Unlike existing techniques such as Context\nOptimization (CoOp) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT), which are constrained by\nstatic prompts or visual token reliance, the proposed approach leverages a\ncross-attention mechanism to dynamically refine text prompts for the image at\nhand.

To ensure these performance gains translate into trustworthy\npredictions, we integrate Monte-Carlo Dropout in our approach to improve the\nreliability of the model predictions and uncertainty estimates.

However, when quantized\ninto low-bit representations, there is often a significant performance drop\ncompared to their full-precision counterparts. To address this issue,\nreconstruction methods have been incorporated into the PTQ framework to improve\nperformance in low-bit quantization settings. Nevertheless, existing related\nmethods predefine the reconstruction granularity and seldom explore the\nprogressive relationships between different reconstruction granularities, which\nleads to sub-optimal quantization results in ViTs. To this end, in this paper,\nwe propose a Progressive Fine-to-Coarse Reconstruction (PFCR) method for\naccurate PTQ, which significantly improves the performance of low-bit quantized\nvision transformers. Specifically, we define multi-head self-attention and\nmulti-layer perceptron modules along with their shortcuts as the finest\nreconstruction units. After reconstructing these two fine-grained units, we\ncombine them to form coarser blocks and reconstruct them at a coarser\ngranularity level. We iteratively perform this combination and reconstruction\nprocess, achieving progressive fine-to-coarse reconstruction. Additionally, we\nintroduce a Progressive Optimization Strategy (POS) for PFCR to alleviate the\ndifficulty of training, thereby further enhancing model performance.\nExperimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod achieves the best Top-1 accuracy among state-of-the-art methods,\nparticularly attaining 75.61% for 3-bit quantized ViT-B in PTQ.

Quantization is a major technique to alleviate the\ninference cost and reduce the size of DM denoiser networks. However, as\ndenoisers evolve from variants of convolutional U-Nets toward newer Transformer\narchitectures, it is of growing importance to understand the quantization\nsensitivity of different weight layers, operations and architecture types to\nperformance. In this work, we address this challenge with Qua$^2$SeDiMo, a\nmixed-precision Post-Training Quantization framework that generates explainable\ninsights on the cost-effectiveness of various model weight quantization methods\nfor different denoiser operation types and block structures. We leverage these\ninsights to make high-quality mixed-precision quantization decisions for a\nmyriad of diffusion models ranging from foundational U-Nets to state-of-the-art\nTransformers. As a result, Qua$^2$SeDiMo can construct 3.4-bit, 3.9-bit,\n3.65-bit and 3.7-bit weight quantization on PixArt-${\\alpha}$,\nPixArt-${\\Sigma}$, Hunyuan-DiT and SDXL, respectively.

Specifically, we first train a face recognizer using the same\nbackbone as the Deepfake detector. The recognizer is then frozen and employed\nduring the detector's training to reduce facial identity information. This is\nachieved by feeding input images into both the recognizer and the detector, and\nminimizing the similarity of their feature embeddings through our Facial\nIdentity Attenuating loss. This process encourages the detector to generate\nembeddings distinct from the recognizer, effectively reducing the impact of\nfacial identity.

However, it remains unknown how the\ndiversity in SIDM dark-matter halos propagates to the more easily observed\nluminous matter at the center of the halo, especially the stellar component. In\nthis work, we use idealized N-body simulations with two species of particles\n(dark matter and stars) to study the response of the stellar properties of\nfield and satellite dwarf galaxies to SIDM evolution and orbital effects on\ntheir halos. Galaxies' stellar components, including galaxy size, mass-to-light\nratio, and stellar velocity dispersion, display a much larger scatter in SIDM\nthan the standard cold dark matter (CDM) model.

In this paper, we introduce an analytical\nnonlinear interference (NLI) power model-based shaping gain estimation method\nto enable a fast performance evaluation of various MD modulation formats in\ncoherent dual-polarization (DP) optical transmission system. In order to extend\nthe applicability of this method to a broader set of modulation formats, we\nextend the established NLI model to take the 4D joint distribution into account\nand thus able to analyze the complex interactions of non-iid signaling in DP\nsystems. With the help of the NLI model, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of\nthe state-of-the-art modulation formats and investigate their actual shaping\ngains in two types of optical fiber communication scenarios (multi-span and\nsingle-span). The numerical simulation shows that for arbitrary modulation\nformats, the NLI power and relative shaping gains in terms of signal-to-noise\nratio can be more accurately estimated by capturing the statistics of MD\nsymbols.

Solving the POMDP problem within the model-free paradigm is\nchallenging for agents due to the inherent difficulty in accurately identifying\nand distinguishing between states and observations. We define such a difficult\nproblem as a DETerministic Partially Observable Markov Decision Process\n(DET-POMDP) problem, which is a specific setting of POMDP. In this problem,\nstates and observations are in a many-to-one relationship. The state is\nobscured, and its relationship is less apparent to the agent. This creates\nobstacles for the agent to infer the state through observations. To effectively\naddress this problem, we convert DET-POMDP into a fully observable MDP using a\nmodel-free biomimetics algorithm called BIOMAP. BIOMAP is based on the MDP\nGraph Automaton framework to distinguish authentic environmental information\nfrom fraudulent data. Thus, it enhances the agent's ability to develop stable\npolicies against DET-POMDP. The experimental results highlight the superior\ncapabilities of BIOMAP in maintaining operational effectiveness and\nenvironmental reparability in the presence of environmental deceptions when\ncompared with existing POMDP solvers.

However, existing metrics for evaluating the quality of\ntext generated by VLMs typically focus on an overall evaluation for a specific\ntask, such as image captioning. While the overall evaluation is essential for\nany task, the criteria prioritized can differ depending on the task, making it\nchallenging for current metrics to adapt to multi-task scenarios. To address\nthis limitation, we propose HarmonicEval, a reference-free comprehensive\nevaluation metric that aggregates criterion-wise scores to produce the overall\nscore in a bottom-up manner. Furthermore, we construct the Multi-task\nMulti-criteria Human Evaluation (MMHE) dataset, which comprises 18,000 expert\nhuman judgments across four multi-modal tasks.

However, scaling them to large graphs is\nchallenging due to the high computational and storage costs of repeated feature\npropagation and non-linear transformation during training. One commonly\nemployed approach to address this challenge is model-simplification, which only\nexecutes the Propagation (P) once in the pre-processing, and Combine (C) these\nreceptive fields in different ways and then feed them into a simple model for\nbetter performance. Despite their high predictive performance and scalability,\nthese methods still face two limitations. First, existing approaches mainly\nfocus on exploring different C methods from the model perspective, neglecting\nthe crucial problem of performance degradation with increasing P depth from the\ndata-centric perspective, known as the over-smoothing problem. Second,\npre-processing overhead takes up most of the end-to-end processing time,\nespecially for large-scale graphs. To address these limitations, we present\nrandom walk with noise masking (RMask), a plug-and-play module compatible with\nthe existing model-simplification works. This module enables the exploration of\ndeeper GNNs while preserving their scalability. Unlike the previous\nmodel-simplification works, we focus on continuous P and found that the noise\nexisting inside each P is the cause of the over-smoothing issue, and use the\nefficient masking mechanism to eliminate them.

Since manual labels are\nimpossible, existing works rely on handcrafted methods to extract non-semantic\nfeatures. Handcrafted non-semantic features jeopardize IML model's\ngeneralization ability in unseen or complex scenarios. Therefore, for IML, the\nelephant in the room is: How to adaptively extract non-semantic features?\nNon-semantic features are context-irrelevant and manipulation-sensitive. That\nis, within an image, they are consistent across patches unless manipulation\noccurs. Then, spare and discrete interactions among image patches are\nsufficient for extracting non-semantic features. However, image semantics vary\ndrastically on different patches, requiring dense and continuous interactions\namong image patches for learning semantic representations. Hence, in this\npaper, we propose a Sparse Vision Transformer (SparseViT), which reformulates\nthe dense, global self-attention in ViT into a sparse, discrete manner. Such\nsparse self-attention breaks image semantics and forces SparseViT to adaptively\nextract non-semantic features for images. Besides, compared with existing IML\nmodels, the sparse self-attention mechanism largely reduced the model size (max\n80% in FLOPs), achieving stunning parameter efficiency and computation\nreduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without any handcrafted\nfeature extractors, SparseViT is superior in both generalization and efficiency\nacross benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "Predicting human mobility is crucial for urban planning, traffic control, and\nemergency response. Mobility behaviors can be categorized into individual and\ncollective, and these behaviors are recorded by diverse mobility data, such as\nindividual trajectory and crowd flow. As different modalities of mobility data,\nindividual trajectory and crowd flow have a close coupling relationship. Crowd\nflows originate from the bottom-up aggregation of individual trajectories,\nwhile the constraints imposed by crowd flows shape these individual\ntrajectories. Existing mobility prediction methods are limited to single tasks\ndue to modal gaps between individual trajectory and crowd flow. In this work,\nwe aim to unify mobility prediction to break through the limitations of\ntask-specific models. We propose a universal human mobility prediction model\n(named UniMob), which can be applied to both individual trajectory and crowd\nflow. UniMob leverages a multi-view mobility tokenizer that transforms both\ntrajectory and flow data into spatiotemporal tokens, facilitating unified\nsequential modeling through a diffusion transformer architecture. To bridge the\ngap between the different characteristics of these two data modalities, we\nimplement a novel bidirectional individual and collective alignment mechanism.\nThis mechanism enables learning common spatiotemporal patterns from different\nmobility data, facilitating mutual enhancement of both trajectory and flow\npredictions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the\nsuperiority of our model over state-of-the-art baselines in trajectory and flow\nprediction. Especially in noisy and scarce data scenarios, our model achieves\nthe highest performance improvement of more than 14% and 25% in MAPE and\nAccuracy@5.",

In this study, we systematically searched for all possible\nnear-infrared transitions of heavy elements using experimentally calibrated\nenergy levels. Our analysis reveals that most candidate elements with strong\nabsorption lines are lanthanides (Z=57-71) and actinides (Z=89-103). This is\ndue to their complex structures leading to many low-lying energy levels, which\nresults in strong transitions in the near-infrared range. Domoto et al.

While our results confirm that these two\nelements show strong infrared features, we additionally identify Gd III as the\nnext most promising species. Due to its unique atomic structure involving the\nhalf-filled 4f and the outer 5d orbitals, Gd III has one of the lowest-lying\nenergy levels, between which relatively strong transitions occur. We also find\nabsorption lines caused by Gd III in the near-infrared spectrum of a chemically\npeculiar star HR 465, which supports their emergence in kilonova spectra. By\nperforming radiative transfer simulations, we confirm that Gd III lines affect\nthe feature at $\\sim$ 12,000 A previously attributed to La III.

The\ndisorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the\nAubry-Andr\\'{e}-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated\ndisorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of\nthe energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent\ncurrent under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling\nfactors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents\nexhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This\namplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but\nvanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both\ndiamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate\naspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been\npreviously explored.

By applying the pseudospectral-time-domain (PSTD) algorithm\nto the spinor version of the Schr\\\"odinger equation, the evolution of the\nspin-state of the scattered wave can be solved in full space and time. This\nextra spin degree of freedom brings some unique new features absent in the\nnumerical theory on the scalar wave scatterings [1]. Different numerical\nstability condition has to be re-derived due to the coupling between the\ndifferent spin states. As the simplest application, the neutron scattering by\nthe magnetic field of a uniformly magnetized sphere is studied. The PSTD\npredictions are compared with those from the Born-approximation. This work not\nonly provides a systematic tool for analyzing spin-matter interactions, but\nalso builds the forward model for testing novel neutron imaging methodologies,\nsuch as the newly developed thermal neutron Fourier-transform ghost imaging.",

Diagnostics are performed in practice by measuring\nquantities, called biomarkers, that indicate the existence and progress of a\ndisease. In common cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, biomarkers\nthat are closely related to the clinical representation of a patient can be\npredicted using computational models. Personalizing computational models\ntranslates to considering patient-specific flow conditions, for example, the\ncompliance of blood vessels that cannot be a priori known and quantities such\nas the patient geometry that can be measured using imaging. Therefore, a\npatient is identified by a set of measurable and nonmeasurable parameters\nneeded to well-define a computational model; else, the computational model is\nnot personalized, meaning it is prone to large prediction errors. Therefore, to\npersonalize a computational model, sufficient information needs to be extracted\nfrom the data. The current methods by which this is done are either\ninefficient, due to relying on slow-converging optimization methods, or hard to\ninterpret, due to using `black box` deep-learning algorithms. We propose a\npersonalized diagnostic procedure based on a differentiable 0D-1D Navier-Stokes\nreduced order model solver and fast parameter inference methods that take\nadvantage of gradients through the solver. By providing a faster method for\nperforming parameter inference and sensitivity analysis through\ndifferentiability while maintaining the interpretability of well-understood\nmathematical models and numerical methods, the best of both worlds is combined.\nThe performance of the proposed solver is validated against a well-established\nprocess on different geometries, and different parameter inference processes\nare successfully performed.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that impairs\nmovement control, leading to symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and\nbradykinesia. Many researchers analyzing handwriting data for PD detection\ntypically rely on computing statistical features over the entirety of the\nhandwriting task. While this method can capture broad patterns, it has several\nlimitations, including a lack of focus on dynamic change, oversimplified\nfeature representation, lack of directional information, and missing\nmicro-movements or subtle variations. Consequently, these systems face\nchallenges in achieving good performance accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity.\nTo overcome this problem, we proposed an optimized PD detection methodology\nthat incorporates newly developed dynamic kinematic features and machine\nlearning (ML)-based techniques to capture movement dynamics during handwriting\ntasks. In the procedure, we first extracted 65 newly developed kinematic\nfeatures from the first and last 10% phases of the handwriting task rather than\nusing the entire task. Alongside this, we also reused 23 existing kinematic\nfeatures, resulting in a comprehensive new feature set. Next, we enhanced the\nkinematic features by applying statistical formulas to compute hierarchical\nfeatures from the handwriting data. This approach allows us to capture subtle\nmovement variations that distinguish PD patients from healthy controls. To\nfurther optimize the feature set, we applied the Sequential Forward Floating\nSelection method to select the most relevant features, reducing dimensionality\nand computational complexity. Finally, we employed an ML-based approach based\non ensemble voting across top-performing tasks, achieving an impressive 96.99\\%\naccuracy on task-wise classification and 99.98% accuracy on task ensembles,\nsurpassing the existing state-of-the-art model by 2% for the PaHaW dataset.",

    "abstract": "3D object detection is one of the fundamental perception tasks for autonomous\nvehicles. Fulfilling such a task with a 4D millimeter-wave radar is very\nattractive since the sensor is able to acquire 3D point clouds similar to Lidar\nwhile maintaining robust measurements under adverse weather. However, due to\nthe high sparsity and noise associated with the radar point clouds, the\nperformance of the existing methods is still much lower than expected. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Cross-modality Knowledge Distillation\n(SCKD) method for 4D radar-based 3D object detection. It characterizes the\ncapability of learning the feature from a Lidar-radar-fused teacher network\nwith semi-supervised distillation. We first propose an adaptive fusion module\nin the teacher network to boost its performance. Then, two feature distillation\nmodules are designed to facilitate the cross-modality knowledge transfer.\nFinally, a semi-supervised output distillation is proposed to increase the\neffectiveness and flexibility of the distillation framework. With the same\nnetwork structure, our radar-only student trained by SCKD boosts the mAP by\n10.38% over the baseline and outperforms the state-of-the-art works on the VoD\ndataset. The experiment on ZJUODset also shows 5.12% mAP improvements on the\nmoderate difficulty level over the baseline when extra unlabeled data are\navailable.

Tennenholtz (2004) proves a folk\ntheorem for program games, but the equilibria constructed are very brittle. We\ntherefore consider simulation-based programs -- i.e., programs that work by\nrunning opponents' programs.

Alternatively, the\nfuture lepton colliders offer a comparatively cleaner environment than the LHC\nwhich is advantageous to detect light exotic particles. Lepton colliders, like\nthe International Linear Collider, provide the opportunity to detect exotic\nparticles at energies below the TeV scale. The Muon Collider, once fully\noperational, will have the capability to observe exotic particles at and beyond\nthe TeV scale.

However, little to nothing is known\ntheoretically about AC in a federated manner, especially each agent interacts\nwith a potentially different environment. The lack of such results is\nattributed to various technical challenges: a two-level structure illustrating\nthe coupling effect between the actor and the critic, heterogeneous\nenvironments, Markovian sampling and multiple local updates. In response, we\nstudy \\textit{Single-loop Federated Actor Critic} (SFAC) where agents perform\nactor-critic learning in a two-level federated manner while interacting with\nheterogeneous environments. We then provide bounds on the convergence error of\nSFAC.

The phase\ntransition between the two regimes is studied. At each time step a node\naddition and preferential attachment step takes place with probability $P_{\\rm\nadd}$, and a random node deletion step takes place with probability $P_{\\rm\ndel} = 1 - P_{\\rm add}$. The balance between growth and contraction is captured\nby the parameter $\\eta = P_{\\rm add} - P_{\\rm del}$, which in the regime of\noverall network growth satisfies $0 < \\eta \\le 1$ and in the regime of overall\nnetwork contraction $-1 \\le \\eta < 0$. Using the master equation and computer\nsimulations we show that for $-1 < \\eta < 0$ the time-dependent degree\ndistribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary form $P_{\\rm st}(k)$ which\nexhibits an exponential tail. This is in contrast with the power-law tail of\nthe stationary degree distribution obtained for $0 < \\eta \\le 1$. Thus, the\nPARD model has a phase transition at $\\eta=0$, which separates between two\nstructurally distinct phases. At the transition, for $\\eta=0$, the degree\ndistribution exhibits a stretched exponential tail. While the stationary degree\ndistribution in the phase of overall growth represents an asymptotic state, in\nthe phase of overall contraction $P_{\\rm st}(k)$ represents an intermediate\nasymptotic state of a finite life span, which disappears when the network\nvanishes.",

Due to their structural similarities, it\nis often held that soft modes are some kind of asymptotic limit of edge modes.\nHere, we show in Maxwell theory that there is an arguably more interesting\nrelationship between the asymptotic symmetries and their charges, on one hand,\nand their finite-distance counterparts, on the other, without the need of a\nlimit. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global\nspacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical $\\rm{U}(1)$-reference frames for\ndressing subregion variables. Distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic frames,\naccording to whether they are built from field content in- or outside the\nregion, we find that non-trivial corner symmetries arise only for extrinsic\nframes. Further, the asymptotic-to-finite relation requires asymptotically\ncharged ones (like Wilson lines). Such frames, called soft edges, extend to\nasymptotia and, in fact, realize the corner charge algebra in multiple ways,\nfor example, by \"pulling in\" the asymptotic one from infinity, or physically\nthrough the addition of asymptotic soft and hard radiation. Realizing an\ninfinite-dimensional algebra requires a new set of soft boundary conditions,\nrelying on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic data. We identify\nthe subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and\nintrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy.

In this work we move beyond that and propose the\nhomogenization as a novel platform for quantum state stabilization and\ninformation protection. Using the Heisenberg exchange interactions formalism,\nwe extend the standard quantum homogenization protocol to the\ndynamically-equivalent ($\\mathtt{SWAP}$)$^\\alpha$ formulation. We then\ndemonstrate its applicability on available noisy intermediate-scale quantum\n(NISQ) processors by presenting a shallow quantum circuit implementation\nconsisting of a sequence of $\\mathtt{CNOT}$ and single-qubit gates. In light of\nthis, we employ the Beny-Oreshkov generalization of the Knill-Laflamme (KL)\nconditions for near-optimal recovery channels to show that our proposed\n($\\mathtt{SWAP}$)$^\\alpha$ quantum homogenization protocol yields a completely\npositive, trace preserving (CPTP) map under which the code subspace is\ncorrectable. Therefore, the protocol protects quantum information contained in\na subsystem of the reservoir Hilbert space under CPTP dynamics.",

Considering the effect of rotations, lattice QCD\ndata shows that the temperatures for deconfinement and chiral symmetry\nrestoration should increase with real angular velocity, and the dominant\neffects are related to gluonic degrees of freedom. These findings could be\nessential for quark models in rotating systems that lack gluonic interactions,\nwhich predicts the decreasing of the chiral temperature transition with the\nangular velocity. To address this issue properly, in this work we apply the\ntwo-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to explore the phase diagram in a rotating\nrigid cylinder with constant angular velocity in the mean field approximation.\nTo circumvent the absence of gluons, we propose the application of an effective\ncoupling dependent of the angular velocity, fitted to match the pseudocritical\ntemperature of chiral phase transition in the model through lattice QCD data.\nOur results indicate that the running coupling induces the enhancement of the\nchiral condensate as a function of angular velocity, strengthening the breaking\nof chiral symmetry, an effect previously dubbed as chiral vortical catalysis.\nFor the chiral susceptibility we observe stronger fluctuations around the\ntransition temperature when we consider the running coupling.

The lower bound arises from the intersection of two\ncompeting requirements: i) the equilibration sector of the model must be\nsufficiently heavy, at least several TeV, to avoid bounds from colliders, and\nii) the lightest dark meson (that may be the dark $\\eta'$, $\\sigma$, or the\nlightest glueball) has suppressed interactions with the SM, and must decay\nbefore BBN. The low energy dark sector consists of one flavor that is\nelectrically neutral and an almost electroweak singlet. The dark matter\ncandidate is the lightest baryon consisting of $N$ of these light flavors\nleading to a highly suppressed elastic scattering rate with the SM. The\nequilibration sector consists of vector-like dark quarks that transform under\nthe electroweak group, ensuring that the dark sector can reach thermal\nequilibrium with the SM in the early Universe.

In this work, we introduce a bias-informed conditional\ndiffusion model for statistical downscaling of precipitation.

In the first part, we\ninvestigate whether fluctuating intra-unit-cell loop currents can drive\nunconventional superconductivity. For general systems, we find that even-parity\nloop currents are not an effective pairing glue, whereas odd-parity loop\ncurrents, such as those proposed to explain the cuprates, are strong\npair-breakers, suppressing rather than enhancing Cooper pairing. By employing\nthe same methodology, we also analyze quantum-critical pairing due to other\nintra-unit-cell orders. For cuprates, we review the evidence for\nintra-unit-cell loop currents in the pseudogap, we classify the possible\nloop-current and particle-hole orders in the Emery model, and we analyze the\npairing due to the various possible loop-current orders. In the second part, we\npresent a novel electronic pairing mechanism that is based on electric\nmonopole-dipole interactions. We show that these interactions become enhanced\nin quasi-2D systems with strong parity-mixing and spin-orbit coupling, such as\ndoped Bi$_2$Se$_3$ or SnTe, and that they induce unconventional odd-parity\nsuperconductivity.

    "abstract": "Consistent human-centric image and video synthesis aims to generate images or\nvideos with new poses while preserving appearance consistency with a given\nreference image, which is crucial for low-cost visual content creation. Recent\nadvances based on diffusion models typically rely on separate networks for\nreference appearance feature extraction and target visual generation, leading\nto inconsistent domain gaps between references and targets. In this paper, we\nframe the task as a spatially-conditioned inpainting problem, where the target\nimage is inpainted to maintain appearance consistency with the reference. This\napproach enables the reference features to guide the generation of\npose-compliant targets within a unified denoising network, thereby mitigating\ndomain gaps. Additionally, to better maintain the reference appearance\ninformation, we impose a causal feature interaction framework, in which\nreference features can only query from themselves, while target features can\nquery appearance information from both the reference and the target. To further\nenhance computational efficiency and flexibility, in practical implementation,\nwe decompose the spatially-conditioned generation process into two stages:\nreference appearance extraction and conditioned target generation. Both stages\nshare a single denoising network, with interactions restricted to\nself-attention layers. This proposed method ensures flexible control over the\nappearance of generated human images and videos. By fine-tuning existing base\ndiffusion models on human video data, our method demonstrates strong\ngeneralization to unseen human identities and poses without requiring\nadditional per-instance fine-tuning. Experimental results validate the\neffectiveness of our approach, showing competitive performance compared to\nexisting methods for consistent human image and video synthesis.",

The present study examines shock velocity variations\nin double-diaphragm shock tubes and their impact on flow dynamics at the end of\nthe shock tube. Experiments were conducted using helium as the driver gas at 30\nbar and argon as the driven gas at 100 Torr, with two different mid-section\npressures (4.8 and 18.8 bar). A previous study highlighted two mechanisms\ngoverning the shock velocity profile: a higher peak shock velocity in the case\nof lower mid-section pressure due to stronger shock heating of the mid-section\ngas, and a second stage of acceleration of the shock wave resulting from the\nhigher mid-section pressure and delayed opening of the first diaphragm.\nPressure histories of the mid-section between the two diaphragms and high-speed\nimaging of the diaphragm-opening process helped validate the mechanisms\ninfluencing shock velocity. Additionally, numerical simulations were performed\n(i) to understand the effect of diaphragm-opening dynamics on the experimental\nshock profiles and (ii) to quantify the axial temperature as well as pressure\nprofiles within the shocked gas. The simulations revealed that while axial\npressure variations were not significantly affected by shock velocity\nvariation, there were large temperature gradients in the shocked gas, with up\nto 6.5 percent higher peak temperature in the case of lower mid-section\npressure compared to its counterpart. These pivotal findings underscore the\nneed to control the mid-section pressure to minimize temperature variations\nwithin the shocked gas region.",

In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Level Optimal Transport\n(MultiLevelOT), a novel approach that advances the optimal transport for\nuniversal cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation. Our method aligns the logit\ndistributions of the teacher and the student at both token and sequence levels\nusing diverse cost matrices, eliminating the need for dimensional or\ntoken-by-token correspondence. At the token level, MultiLevelOT integrates both\nglobal and local information by jointly optimizing all tokens within a sequence\nto enhance robustness. At the sequence level, we efficiently capture complex\ndistribution structures of logits via the Sinkhorn distance, which approximates\nthe Wasserstein distance for divergence measures. Extensive experiments on\ntasks such as extractive QA, generative QA, and summarization demonstrate that\nthe MultiLevelOT outperforms state-of-the-art cross-tokenizer KD methods under\nvarious settings.

    "abstract": "Educational data mining (EDM) is a part of applied computing that focuses on\nautomatically analyzing data from learning contexts. Early prediction for\nidentifying at-risk students is a crucial and widely researched topic in EDM\nresearch. It enables instructors to support at-risk students to stay on track,\npreventing student dropout or failure. Previous studies have predicted\nstudents' learning performance to identify at-risk students by using machine\nlearning on data collected from e-learning platforms. However, most studies\naimed to identify at-risk students utilizing the entire course data after the\ncourse finished. This does not correspond to the real-world scenario that\nat-risk students may drop out before the course ends. To address this problem,\nwe introduce an RNN-Attention-KD (knowledge distillation) framework to predict\nat-risk students early throughout a course. It leverages the strengths of\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling time-sequence data to predict\nstudents' performance at each time step and employs an attention mechanism to\nfocus on relevant time steps for improved predictive accuracy. At the same\ntime, KD is applied to compress the time steps to facilitate early prediction.\nIn an empirical evaluation, RNN-Attention-KD outperforms traditional neural\nnetwork models in terms of recall and F1-measure. For example, it obtained\nrecall and F1-measure of 0.49 and 0.51 for Weeks 1--3 and 0.51 and 0.61 for\nWeeks 1--6 across all datasets from four years of a university course. Then, an\nablation study investigated the contributions of different knowledge transfer\nmethods (distillation objectives). We found that hint loss from the hidden\nlayer of RNN and context vector loss from the attention module on RNN could\nenhance the model's prediction performance for identifying at-risk students.\nThese results are relevant for EDM researchers employing deep learning models.",

These galaxies\nhave a higher central stellar mass surface density than normal blue spirals.\nThe radial profiles of $D_{\\rm n}4000$ and [Mgb/Fe] show that red spirals and\nquiescent S0s have similar old central populations and high [Mgb/Fe] values,\nsuggesting rapid bulge formation, though red spirals exhibit a steeper gradient\npossibly due to residual star formation (SF) in outer regions. In contrast,\nstar-forming S0s exhibit profiles between quiescent S0s/red spirals and normal\nblue spirals, with relatively flat $D_{\\rm n}4000$ and [Mgb/Fe] gradients. More\nlong-term SF history causes normal blue spirals to have very flat $D_{\\rm\nn}4000$ and [Mgb/Fe] profiles, and the majority of them (79 $\\pm$ 5 $\\%$) have\nS$\\acute{\\rm e}$rsic index $<$ 2.

The YIG\nsphere hosts a magnon mode and a vibration mode induced by magnetostriction,\nwhereas the silica sphere has an optical whispering gallery mode and a\nmechanical mode coupled via optomechanical interaction. The mechanical modes of\nboth spheres are close in frequency and are coherently coupled by the\nstraightway physical contact between the two microspheres. We use a\nperturbation approach to solve the Heisenberg-Langevin equations, offering an\nanalytical framework for transmission rate and SSG. Using experimentally\nfeasible settings, we demonstrate that the transmission rate and SSG are\nstrongly dependent on the magnomechanical, optomechanical, and mechanics\nmechanics coupling strengths (MMCS) between the two microspheres. The numerical\nresults show that increasing the MMCS can enhance both the transmission rate\nand SSG efficiency, resulting in gain within our system. Our findings, in\nparticular, reveal that the efficiency of the SSG can be effectively controlled\nby cavity detuning, decay rate, and pump power.

This paper proposes a model predictive\ncontrol (MPC) approach integrated with a hysteresis inverse based on the\nHammerstein modeling structure of the PFSM. The MPC is designed to decouple the\nrate-dependent dual-axis linear components, with an augmented error integral\nvariable introduced in the state space to eliminate steady-state errors.\nMoreover, proofs of zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection are\nprovided. The hysteresis inverse model is then cascaded to compensate for the\nrate-independent nonlinear components. Finally, PFSM tracking experiments are\nconducted on step, sinusoidal, triangular, and composite trajectories. Compared\nto traditional model-free and existing model-based controllers, the proposed\nmethod significantly enhances tracking accuracy, demonstrating superior\ntracking performance and robustness to frequency variations.

When a\ngeneral-purpose LLM serves as the RAG generator, it often suffers from\ninadequate response informativeness, response robustness, and citation quality.\nPast approaches to tackle these limitations, either by incorporating additional\nsteps beyond generating responses or optimizing the generator through\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT), still failed to align with the RAG requirement\nthoroughly. Consequently, optimizing the RAG generator from multiple preference\nperspectives while maintaining its end-to-end LLM form remains a challenge. To\nbridge this gap, we propose Multiple Perspective Preference Alignment for\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (PA-RAG), a method for optimizing the generator\nof RAG systems to align with RAG requirements comprehensively. Specifically, we\nconstruct high-quality instruction fine-tuning data and multi-perspective\npreference data by sampling varied quality responses from the generator across\ndifferent prompt documents quality scenarios. Subsequently, we optimize the\ngenerator using SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive\nexperiments conducted on four question-answer datasets across three LLMs\ndemonstrate that PA-RAG can significantly enhance the performance of RAG\ngenerators.

    "abstract": "Radio galaxies can extend far beyond the stellar component of their\noriginating host galaxies, and their radio emission can consist of multiple\ndiscrete components. Furthermore, the apparent source structure will depend on\nsurvey sensitivity, resolution and the observing frequency. Associated discrete\nradio components and their originating host galaxy are typically identified\nthrough a visual comparison of radio and mid-infrared survey images. We present\nthe first data release of Radio Galaxy Zoo, an online citizen science project\nthat enlists the help of citizen scientists to cross-match extended radio\nsources from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST)\nand the Australia Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLAS) surveys, often with\ncomplex structure, to host galaxies in 3.6 um infrared images from the\nWide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Spitzer Space Telescope.\nThis first data release consists of 100,185 classifications for 99,146 radio\nsources from the FIRST survey and 583 radio sources from the ATLAS survey. We\ninclude two tables for each of the FIRST and ATLAS surveys: 1)the\nidentification of all components making up each radio source; and 2) the\ncross-matched host galaxies. These classifications have an average reliability\nof 0.83 based on the weighted consensus levels of our citizen scientists. The\nreliability of the DR1 catalogue has been further demonstrated through several\nparallel studies which used the pre-release versions of this catalogue to train\nand prototype machine learning-based classifiers. We also include a brief\ndescription of the radio source populations catalogued by RGZ DR1.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Claude\npresents new challenges for philosophy of language, particularly regarding the\nnature of linguistic meaning and representation. While LLMs have traditionally\nbeen understood through distributional semantics, this paper explores Robert\nBrandom's inferential semantics as an alternative foundational framework for\nunderstanding these systems. We examine how key features of inferential\nsemantics -- including its anti-representationalist stance, logical\nexpressivism, and quasi-compositional approach -- align with the architectural\nand functional characteristics of Transformer-based LLMs. Through analysis of\nthe ISA (Inference, Substitution, Anaphora) approach, we demonstrate that LLMs\nexhibit fundamentally anti-representationalist properties in their processing\nof language. We further develop a consensus theory of truth appropriate for\nLLMs, grounded in their interactive and normative dimensions through mechanisms\nlike RLHF. While acknowledging significant tensions between inferentialism's\nphilosophical commitments and LLMs' sub-symbolic processing, this paper argues\nthat inferential semantics provides valuable insights into how LLMs generate\nmeaning without reference to external world representations. Our analysis\nsuggests that LLMs may challenge traditional assumptions in philosophy of\nlanguage, including strict compositionality and semantic externalism, though\nfurther empirical investigation is needed to fully substantiate these\ntheoretical claims.",

    "abstract": "As AI systems are integrated into social networks, there are AI safety\nconcerns that AI-generated content may dominate the web, e.g. in popularity or\nimpact on beliefs. To understand such questions, this paper proposes the\nDigital Ecosystem of Beliefs (Digico), the first evolutionary framework for\ncontrolled experimentation with multi-population interactions in simulated\nsocial networks. The framework models a population of agents which change their\nmessaging strategies due to evolutionary updates following a Universal\nDarwinism approach, interact via messages, influence each other's beliefs\nthrough dynamics based on a contagion model, and maintain their beliefs through\ncognitive Lamarckian inheritance. Initial experiments with an abstract\nimplementation of Digico show that: a) when AIs have faster messaging,\nevolution, and more influence in the recommendation algorithm, they get 80% to\n95% of the views, depending on the size of the influence benefit; b) AIs\ndesigned for propaganda can typically convince 50% of humans to adopt extreme\nbeliefs, and up to 85% when agents believe only a limited number of channels;\nc) a penalty for content that violates agents' beliefs reduces propaganda\neffectiveness by up to 8%. We further discuss implications for control (e.g.\nlegislation) and Digico as a means of studying evolutionary principles.",

    "abstract": "Sensor data collected by Internet of Things (IoT) devices can reveal\nsensitive personal information about individuals, raising significant privacy\nconcerns when shared with semi-trusted service providers, as they may extract\nthis information using machine learning models. Data obfuscation empowered by\ngenerative models is a promising approach to generate synthetic data such that\nuseful information contained in the original data is preserved while sensitive\ninformation is obscured. This newly generated data will then be shared with\nservice providers instead of the original sensor data. In this work, we propose\nPrivDiffuser, a novel data obfuscation technique based on a denoising diffusion\nmodel that achieves a superior trade-off between data utility and privacy by\nincorporating effective guidance techniques. Specifically, we extract latent\nrepresentations that contain information about public and private attributes\nfrom sensor data to guide the diffusion model, and impose mutual\ninformation-based regularization when learning the latent representations to\nalleviate the entanglement of public and private attributes, thereby increasing\nthe effectiveness of guidance. Evaluation on three real-world datasets\ncontaining different sensing modalities reveals that PrivDiffuser yields a\nbetter privacy-utility trade-off than the state-of-the-art in data obfuscation,\ndecreasing the utility loss by up to $1.81\\%$ and the privacy loss by up to\n$3.42\\%$. Moreover, compared with existing obfuscation approaches, PrivDiffuser\noffers the unique benefit of allowing users with diverse privacy needs to\nprotect their privacy without having to retrain the generative model.",

While the architecture of the $\\textit{C. elegans}$\nconnectome has been extensively characterized, much less is known about the\norganization of causal signaling networks arising from functional interactions\nbetween neurons. Understanding how effective communication pathways relate to\nor diverge from the underlying structure is a central question in neuroscience.\nHere, we analyze the modular architecture of the $\\textit{C. elegans}$ signal\npropagation network, measured via calcium imaging and optogenetics, and compare\nit to the underlying anatomical wiring measured by electron microscopy.\nCompared to the connectome, we find that signaling modules are not aligned with\nthe modular boundaries of the anatomical network, highlighting an instance\nwhere function deviates from structure. However, we find that some of the most\nstriking features of the anatomical network are preserved, as exemplified by\nthe pharynx, which is delineated into a separate community in both anatomy and\nsignaling. We analyze the cellular compositions of the signaling architecture\nand find that its modules are enriched for specific cell types and functions,\nsuggesting that the network modules are neurobiologically relevant. Lastly, we\nidentify a \"rich club\" of hub neurons in the signaling network. The membership\nof the signaling rich club differs from the rich club detected in the\nanatomical network, challenging the view that structural hubs occupy positions\nof influence in functional (signaling) networks.

However, many widely used methods\nrely on the unconfoundedness assumption, which is often unrealistic due to the\ninability to observe all confounders, thereby overlooking the influence of\nlatent confounders. To address this limitation, recent approaches have utilized\nauxiliary network information to infer latent confounders, relaxing this\nassumption.

FedMUP trains the local model on their local dataset and transfers\ncomputed values rather than actual raw data to obtain an updated global model\nbased on averaging various local versions. This updated model is shared\nrepeatedly at regular intervals with the user for retraining to acquire a\nbetter, and more efficient model capable of predicting malicious users more\nprecisely. Extensive experimental work and comparison of the proposed model\nwith state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed\nwork.

This\npaper finds that existing reliable multimodal classification methods not only\nfail to provide robust estimation of data quality, but also lack dynamic\nnetworks for sample-specific depth and parameters to achieve reliable\ninference. To this end, a novel framework for multimodal reliable\nclassification termed \\textit{Multi-level Quality-Adaptive Dynamic multimodal\nnetwork} (Multi-QuAD) is proposed. Multi-QuAD first adopts a novel approach\nbased on noise-free prototypes and a classifier-free design to reliably\nestimate the quality of each sample at both modality and feature levels. It\nthen achieves sample-specific network depth via the \\textbf{\\textit{Global\nConfidence Normalized Depth (GCND)}} mechanism. By normalizing depth across\nmodalities and samples, \\textit{\\textbf{GCND}} effectively mitigates the impact\nof challenging modality inputs on dynamic depth reliability. Furthermore,\nMulti-QuAD provides sample-adaptive network parameters via the\n\\textbf{\\textit{Layer-wise Greedy Parameter (LGP)}} mechanism driven by\nfeature-level quality. The cross-modality layer-wise greedy strategy in\n\\textbf{\\textit{LGP}} designs a reliable parameter prediction paradigm for\nmultimodal networks with variable architecture for the first time.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider an unconstrained stochastic optimization problem\nwhere the objective function exhibits high-order smoothness. Specifically, we\npropose a new stochastic first-order method (SFOM) with multi-extrapolated\nmomentum, in which multiple extrapolations are performed in each iteration,\nfollowed by a momentum update based on these extrapolations. We demonstrate\nthat the proposed SFOM can accelerate optimization by exploiting the high-order\nsmoothness of the objective function $f$. Assuming that the $p$th-order\nderivative of $f$ is Lipschitz continuous for some $p\\ge2$, and under\nadditional mild assumptions, we establish that our method achieves a sample\ncomplexity of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-(3p+1)/p})$ for finding a\npoint $x$ such that $\\mathbb{E}[\\|\\nabla f(x)\\|]\\le\\epsilon$. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first SFOM to leverage arbitrary-order smoothness of\nthe objective function for acceleration, resulting in a sample complexity that\nimproves upon the best-known results without assuming the mean-squared\nsmoothness condition. Preliminary numerical experiments validate the practical\nperformance of our method and support our theoretical findings.",

To\nthe end, we propose a novel approach named Hypergraph Enhanced Cascading Graph\nConvolution Network for multi-behavior recommendation (HEC-GCN). To be\nspecific, we first explore both fine- and coarse-grained correlations among\nusers or items of each behavior by simultaneously modeling the\nbehavior-specific interaction graph and its corresponding hypergraph in a\ncascaded manner. Then, we propose a behavior consistency-guided alignment\nstrategy that ensures consistent representations between the interaction graph\nand its associated hypergraph for each behavior, while also maintaining\nrepresentation consistency across different behaviors. Extensive experiments\nand analyses on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed\napproach is consistently superior to previous state-of-the-art methods due to\nits capability to effectively attenuate the sparsity issue as well as preserve\nboth intra- and inter-behavior consistencies.

    "abstract": "Despite the rapidly growing demand for multimodal retrieval, progress in this\nfield remains severely constrained by a lack of training data. In this paper,\nwe introduce MegaPairs, a novel data synthesis method that leverages vision\nlanguage models (VLMs) and open-domain images, together with a massive\nsynthetic dataset generated from this method. Our empirical analysis shows that\nMegaPairs generates high-quality data, enabling the multimodal retriever to\nsignificantly outperform the baseline model trained on 70$\\times$ more data\nfrom existing datasets. Moreover, since MegaPairs solely relies on general\nimage corpora and open-source VLMs, it can be easily scaled up, enabling\ncontinuous improvements in retrieval performance. In this stage, we produced\nmore than 26 million training instances and trained several models of varying\nsizes using this data. These new models achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot\nperformance across 4 popular composed image retrieval (CIR) benchmarks and the\nhighest overall performance on the 36 datasets provided by MMEB. They also\ndemonstrate notable performance improvements with additional downstream\nfine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Benign overfitting refers to the phenomenon where an over-parameterized model\nfits the training data perfectly, including noise in the data, but still\ngeneralizes well to the unseen test data. While prior work provides some\ntheoretical understanding of this phenomenon under the in-distribution setup,\nmodern machine learning often operates in a more challenging\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) regime, where the target (test) distribution can be\nrather different from the source (training) distribution. In this work, we take\nan initial step towards understanding benign overfitting in the OOD regime by\nfocusing on the basic setup of over-parameterized linear models under covariate\nshift. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees proving that benign overfitting\noccurs in standard ridge regression, even under the OOD regime when the target\ncovariance satisfies certain structural conditions. We identify several vital\nquantities relating to source and target covariance, which govern the\nperformance of OOD generalization. Our result is sharp, which provably recovers\nprior in-distribution benign overfitting guarantee [Tsigler and Bartlett,\n2023], as well as under-parameterized OOD guarantee [Ge et al., 2024] when\nspecializing to each setup. Moreover, we also present theoretical results for a\nmore general family of target covariance matrix, where standard ridge\nregression only achieves a slow statistical rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$ for the\nexcess risk, while Principal Component Regression (PCR) is guaranteed to\nachieve the fast rate $O(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of samples.",

The current data augmentation methods for gigapixel images either\nintroduce additional computational costs or result in a loss of semantic\ninformation, which is hard to meet the requirements for efficiency and\nstability needed for WSI model training.

In this\npaper, we introduce Agent-SafetyBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to\nevaluate the safety of LLM agents. Agent-SafetyBench encompasses 349\ninteraction environments and 2,000 test cases, evaluating 8 categories of\nsafety risks and covering 10 common failure modes frequently encountered in\nunsafe interactions.

Through failure mode and helpfulness\nanalysis, we summarize two fundamental safety defects in current LLM agents:\nlack of robustness and lack of risk awareness. Furthermore, our findings\nsuggest that reliance on defense prompts alone may be insufficient to address\nthese safety issues, emphasizing the need for more advanced and robust\nstrategies.

While scaled dot-product attention\n(SDPA) exhibits token sparsity, i.e. only a few pivotal tokens significantly\ncontribute to output, exploiting this sparsity remains challenging. Existing\nmethods either suffer from quality degradation or require substantial\nadditional resources. We show that identifying pivotal tokens is a Maximum\nInner Product Search (MIPS) problem. However, existing MIPS solutions are not\nwell-suited for SDPA, as they are not GPU-friendly and often underperform due\nto the separated query and key distributions.

Given a query, HashAttention encodes keys and queries in Hamming\nspace, capturing the required semantic similarity, using learned mapping\nfunctions. HashAttention efficiently identifies pivotal tokens for a given\nquery using bitwise operations and computes attention using only these tokens,\nimproving the overall attention efficiency.

    "abstract": "As a common image editing operation, image composition involves integrating\nforeground objects into background scenes. In this paper, we expand the\napplication of the concept of Affordance from human-centered image composition\ntasks to a more general object-scene composition framework, addressing the\ncomplex interplay between foreground objects and background scenes. Following\nthe principle of Affordance, we define the affordance-aware object insertion\ntask, which aims to seamlessly insert any object into any scene with various\nposition prompts. To address the limited data issue and incorporate this task,\nwe constructed the SAM-FB dataset, which contains over 3 million examples\nacross more than 3,000 object categories. Furthermore, we propose the\nMask-Aware Dual Diffusion (MADD) model, which utilizes a dual-stream\narchitecture to simultaneously denoise the RGB image and the insertion mask. By\nexplicitly modeling the insertion mask in the diffusion process, MADD\neffectively facilitates the notion of affordance. Extensive experimental\nresults show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and\nexhibits strong generalization performance on in-the-wild images.

    "abstract": "Unstructured text data annotation and analysis are fundamental to management\nresearch, often relying on human annotators through crowdsourcing platforms.\nWhile Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to provide a cost-effective and\nefficient alternative to human annotation, there lacks a systematic workflow\nthat evaluate when LLMs are suitable or how to proceed with LLM-based text\nannotation in a reproducible manner. This paper addresses this methodological\ngap by introducing the ``SILICON\" (Systematic Inference with LLMs for\nInformation Classification and Notation) workflow. The workflow integrates\nestablished principles of human annotation with systematic prompt optimization\nand model selection, addressing challenges such as developing robust annotation\nguidelines, establishing high-quality human baselines, optimizing prompts, and\nensuring reproducibility across LLMs. We validate the SILICON workflow through\nseven case studies covering common management research tasks. Our findings\nhighlight the importance of validating annotation guideline agreement, the\nsuperiority of expert-developed human baselines over crowdsourced ones, the\niterative nature of prompt optimization, and the necessity of testing multiple\nLLMs. We also find that LLMs agree well with expert annotations in most cases\nbut show low agreement in more complex multi-label classification tasks.\nNotably, we propose a regression-based methodology to empirically compare LLM\noutputs across prompts and models. Our workflow advances management research by\nestablishing rigorous, transparent, and reproducible processes for LLM-based\nannotation.

By converting\nrecommendation tasks into natural language inputs called prompts, LLM-RSs can\nefficiently solve issues that have been difficult to address due to data\nscarcity but are crucial in applications such as cold-start and cross-domain\nproblems. However, when applying this in practice, selecting the prompt that\nmatches tasks and data is essential. Although numerous prompts have been\nproposed in LLM-RSs and representing the target user in prompts significantly\nimpacts recommendation accuracy, there are still no clear guidelines for\nselecting specific prompts.\n  In this paper, we categorize and analyze prompts from previous research to\nestablish practical prompt selection guidelines. Through 450 experiments with\n90 prompts and five real-world datasets, we examined the relationship between\nprompts and dataset characteristics in recommendation accuracy. We found that\nno single prompt consistently outperforms others; thus, selecting prompts on\nthe basis of dataset characteristics is crucial.

    "abstract": "Human drivers rely on commonsense reasoning to navigate diverse and dynamic\nreal-world scenarios. Existing end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving (AD) models\nare typically optimized to mimic driving patterns observed in data, without\ncapturing the underlying reasoning processes. This limitation constrains their\nability to handle challenging driving scenarios. To close this gap, we propose\nVLM-AD, a method that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) as teachers to\nenhance training by providing additional supervision that incorporates\nunstructured reasoning information and structured action labels. Such\nsupervision enhances the model's ability to learn richer feature\nrepresentations that capture the rationale behind driving patterns.\nImportantly, our method does not require a VLM during inference, making it\npractical for real-time deployment. When integrated with state-of-the-art\nmethods, VLM-AD achieves significant improvements in planning accuracy and\nreduced collision rates on the nuScenes dataset. It further improves route\ncompletion and driving scores under closed-loop evaluation, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in long-horizon, interactive driving scenarios and its potential\nfor safe and reliable real-world deployment.",

    "abstract": "Human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial in many computer vision applications;\nfrom health to arts and entertainment. HMR from monocular images has\npredominantly been addressed by deterministic methods that output a single\nprediction for a given 2D image. However, HMR from a single image is an\nill-posed problem due to depth ambiguity and occlusions. Probabilistic methods\nhave attempted to address this by generating and fusing multiple plausible 3D\nreconstructions, but their performance has often lagged behind deterministic\napproaches. In this paper, we introduce GenHMR, a novel generative framework\nthat reformulates monocular HMR as an image-conditioned generative task,\nexplicitly modeling and mitigating uncertainties in the 2D-to-3D mapping\nprocess. GenHMR comprises two key components: (1) a pose tokenizer to convert\n3D human poses into a sequence of discrete tokens in a latent space, and (2) an\nimage-conditional masked transformer to learn the probabilistic distributions\nof the pose tokens, conditioned on the input image prompt along with randomly\nmasked token sequence. During inference, the model samples from the learned\nconditional distribution to iteratively decode high-confidence pose tokens,\nthereby reducing 3D reconstruction uncertainties. To further refine the\nreconstruction, a 2D pose-guided refinement technique is proposed to directly\nfine-tune the decoded pose tokens in the latent space, which forces the\nprojected 3D body mesh to align with the 2D pose clues. Experiments on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that GenHMR significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.

However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature\nof the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle\nremains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an Ego\nvehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction.\nIn real-world driving, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not\nonly by its own historical trajectory, but also by the behavior of other\nvehicles. So, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle\nas an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between vehicles.\nFurthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large\nprediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we\npropose an endpoint prediction module for the target vehicle. This module\npredicts the target vehicle endpoints, refines them using a correction\nmechanism, and generates a multimodal predicted trajectory. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and\n30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of\n64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset.

Here we consider superconducting junctions with Rashba\nspin-orbit coupling and explore the signatures of Majorana and trivial Andreev\nbound states in the emergent superconducting correlations when the systems are\nsubjected to an external Zeeman field. We first show that robust zero-energy\nAndreev bound states naturally appear due to confinement and helicity when the\nnormal sector of the junction becomes helical. These Andreev states can evolve\ninto Majorana states, developing alike oscillations around zero energy as a\nfunction of Zeeman field. Unlike Majorana states located at both ends, helical\nAndreev states are located at the interface. We then demonstrate that the\nemergent superconducting correlations are locally composed of even-frequency\nspin-singlet even-parity and odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pair\namplitudes, which coexist due to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman\nfield, and spatial translation invariance breaking. In the helical regime,\ntrivial Andreev states enhance odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, which decays\nin the superconductor and has a homogeneous long-range profile in the normal\nregion. At zero frequency, however, odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing vanishes\nin the helical regime. In the topological phase, Majorana states enhance\nodd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, producing a long-range homogeneous leakage\ninto the normal region. Interestingly, we discover that when Majorana states\nare truly zero-energy modes, odd-frequency pairing develops a divergent\nlow-frequency profile, which we interpret as the unambiguous self-conjugated\nMajorana signature.

Unlike the periodic cosine fringes typically used in atom\ninterferometers, the fringe obtained by changing the tilt, referred to as the\ntilt-scanned fringe, is aperiodic and symmetric with respect to zero tilt. The\ntilt-scanned fringe is highly sensitive to asymmetries caused by non-zero tilt,\nenabling fast and precise determination of the Raman laser tilt in atom\ngravimeters.

We investigate the impact of dataset\nselection bias, particularly the practice of cherry-picking datasets, on the\nperformance evaluation of forecasting methods. Through empirical analysis with\na diverse set of benchmark datasets, our findings reveal that cherry-picking\ndatasets can significantly distort the perceived performance of methods, often\nexaggerating their effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Progress in AI is driven largely by the scale and quality of training data.\nDespite this, there is a deficit of empirical analysis examining the attributes\nof well-established datasets beyond text. In this work we conduct the largest\nand first-of-its-kind longitudinal audit across modalities--popular text,\nspeech, and video datasets--from their detailed sourcing trends and use\nrestrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual\nanalysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608\nlanguages, 798 sources, 659 organizations, and 67 countries. We find that\nmultimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to\nweb-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their\ntraining sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the\nchain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are\nrestrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text,\nspeech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter\nto the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI\ntraining datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and\nmultilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage\nsince 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically\nexamine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an\necosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to\nprogress in responsible AI.

Therefore, such a combination of the pruning decisions and the\nfinetuned weights may be suboptimal, leading to non-negligible performance\ndegradation. To address these limitations, we propose ATP: All-in-One Tuning\nand Structural Pruning, a unified one-stage structural pruning and fine-tuning\napproach that dynamically identifies the current optimal substructure\nthroughout the fine-tuning phase via a trainable pruning decision generator.\nMoreover, given the limited available data for domain-specific applications,\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) becomes a common technique to fine-tune the LLMs. In\nATP, we introduce LoRA-aware forward and sparsity regularization to ensure that\nthe substructures corresponding to the learned pruning decisions can be\ndirectly removed after the ATP process. ATP outperforms the state-of-the-art\ntwo-stage pruning methods on tasks in the legal and healthcare domains.

However, incoherent addition of different partial wave contributions\nto the integral cross sections (partial wave scrambling), commonly encountered\nin systems with complex collisional dynamics, poses a significant challenge,\noften limiting control. This work demonstrates that time-reversal symmetry can\novercome these limitations by constraining the relative phases of S-matrix\nelements, thereby protecting coherent control against partial wave scrambling,\neven for collisions mediated by highly anisotropic interactions. Using the\nexample of ultracold O$_2$-O$_2$ scattering, we show that coherent control is\nrobust against short-range dynamical complexity. Furthermore, the time-reversal\nsymmetry also protects the control against a distribution of collisional\nenergy. These findings show that ultracold scattering into the final states\nthat are time-reversal-invariant, such as the J = 0, M = 0 rotational state,\ncan always be optimally controlled by using time-reversal-invariant initial\nsuperpositions. Beyond the ultracold regime, we observe significant differences\nin the controllability of crossed-molecular beam vs. trap experiments with the\nformer being easier to control, emphasizing the cooperative role of\ntime-reversal and permutation symmetries in maintaining control at any\ntemperature.

However, collecting data from various sites,\nespecially in healthcare, is challenging due to strict privacy regulations. An\nalternative is to fine-tune these models on end-user devices, such as in\nmedical clinics, without sending data to a server. These local clients\ntypically have limited computing power and small datasets, which are not enough\nfor fully fine-tuning large VLMs on their own. A naive solution to these\nscenarios is to leverage parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies and\napply federated learning (FL) algorithms to combine the learned adapter\nweights, thereby respecting the resource limitations and data privacy. However,\nthis approach does not fully leverage the knowledge from multiple adapters\ntrained on diverse data distributions and for diverse tasks. The adapters are\nadversely impacted by data heterogeneity and task heterogeneity across clients\nresulting in suboptimal convergence. To this end, we propose a novel framework\ncalled FedPIA that improves upon the naive combinations of FL and PEFT by\nintroducing Permutation and Integration of the local Adapters in the server and\nglobal Adapters in the clients exploiting Wasserstein barycenters for improved\nblending of client-specific and client-agnostic knowledge.

    "abstract": "Significant progress has been made in photo-realistic scene reconstruction\nover recent years. Various disparate efforts have enabled capabilities such as\nmulti-appearance or large-scale modeling; however, there lacks a welldesigned\ndataset that can evaluate the holistic progress of scene reconstruction. We\nintroduce a collection of imagery of the Johns Hopkins Homewood Campus,\nacquired at different seasons, times of day, in multiple elevations, and across\na large scale. We perform a multi-stage calibration process, which efficiently\nrecover camera parameters from phone and drone cameras. This dataset can enable\nresearchers to rigorously explore challenges in unconstrained settings,\nincluding effects of inconsistent illumination, reconstruction from large scale\nand from significantly different perspectives, etc.",

    "abstract": "Automating object shaping by grinding with a robot is a crucial industrial\nprocess that involves removing material with a rotating grinding belt. This\nprocess generates removal resistance depending on such process conditions as\nmaterial type, removal volume, and robot grinding posture, all of which\ncomplicate the analytical modeling of shape transitions. Additionally, a\ndata-driven approach based on real-world data is challenging due to high data\ncollection costs and the irreversible nature of the process. This paper\nproposes a Cutting Sequence Diffuser (CSD) for object shaping by grinding. The\nCSD, which only requires simple simulation data for model learning, offers an\nefficient way to plan long-horizon action sequences transferable to the real\nworld. Our method designs a smooth action space with constrained small removal\nvolumes to suppress the complexity of the shape transitions caused by removal\nresistance, thus reducing the reality gap in simulations. Moreover, by using a\ndiffusion model to generate long-horizon action sequences, our approach reduces\nthe planning time and allows for grinding the target shape while adhering to\nthe constraints of a small removal volume per step. Through evaluations in both\nsimulation and real robot experiments, we confirmed that our CSD was effective\nfor grinding to different materials and various target shapes in a short time.",

    "abstract": "We analyze the stress tensor and the gyration tensor of an unentangled\npolymer melt under flow by using a Rouse-type single chain model. We employ the\nbead-spring type single chain model, in which beads interact each other via\nnonlinear potentials such as the finite-extensible nonlinear elasticity (FENE)\npotential. Beads are assumed to obey the Langevin equation with a constant\nfriction coefficient. We derive simple yet general relations between the stress\ntensor and the gyration tensor for this Rouse-type model, without any\nadditional approximations. Various formulae for rheological quantities in terms\nof the gyration tensor can be derived from the general relations. For example,\nthe steady shear viscosity is governed by the gyration radius in the shear\ngradient direction.",

We evaluate DriveGPT across different\nscales in a planning task, through both quantitative metrics and qualitative\nexamples, including closed-loop driving in complex real-world scenarios.
