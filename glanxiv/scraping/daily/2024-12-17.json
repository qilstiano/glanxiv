    "abstract": "The amount of articulatory data available for training deep learning models\nis much less compared to acoustic speech data. In order to improve\narticulatory-to-acoustic synthesis performance in these low-resource settings,\nwe propose a multimodal pre-training framework. On single-speaker speech\nsynthesis tasks from real-time magnetic resonance imaging and surface\nelectromyography inputs, the intelligibility of synthesized outputs improves\nnoticeably. For example, compared to prior work, utilizing our proposed\ntransfer learning methods improves the MRI-to-speech performance by 36% word\nerror rate. In addition to these intelligibility results, our multimodal\npre-trained models consistently outperform unimodal baselines on three\nobjective and subjective synthesis quality metrics.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the integration of Visual Code Assistants in Integrated\nDevelopment Environments (IDEs). In Software Engineering, whiteboard sketching\nis often the initial step before coding, serving as a crucial collaboration\ntool for developers. Previous studies have investigated patterns in SE sketches\nand how they are used in practice, yet methods for directly using these\nsketches for code generation remain limited. The emergence of visually-equipped\nlarge language models presents an opportunity to bridge this gap, which is the\nfocus of our research. In this paper, we built a first prototype of a Visual\nCode Assistant to get user feedback regarding in-IDE sketch-to-code tools. We\nconduct an experiment with 19 data scientists, most of whom regularly sketch as\npart of their job. We investigate developers' mental models by analyzing\npatterns commonly observed in their sketches when developing an ML workflow.\nAnalysis indicates that diagrams were the preferred organizational component\n(52.6%), often accompanied by lists (42.1%) and numbered points (36.8%). Our\ntool converts their sketches into a Python notebook by querying an LLM. We use\nan LLM-as-judge setup to score the quality of the generated code, finding that\neven brief sketching can effectively generate useful code outlines. We also\nfind a positive correlation between sketch time and the quality of the\ngenerated code. We conclude the study by conducting extensive interviews to\nassess the tool's usefulness, explore potential use cases, and understand\ndevelopers' needs. As noted by participants, promising applications for these\nassistants include education, prototyping, and collaborative settings. Our\nfindings signal promise for the next generation of Code Assistants to integrate\nvisual information, both to improve code generation and to better leverage\ndevelopers' existing sketching practices.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of pulsar timing array data has provided evidence for a\ngravitational wave background in the nanohertz band. This raises the question\nof what is the source of the signal, is it astrophysical or cosmological in\norigin? If the signal originates from a population of supermassive black hole\nbinaries, as is generally assumed, we can expect to see evidence for both\nanisotropy and to be able to resolve signals from individual binaries as more\ndata are collected. The anisotropy and resolvable systems are caused by a small\nnumber of loud signals that stand out from the crowd. Here we focus on the\njoint detection of individual signals and a stochastic background. While\nmethods have previously been developed to perform such an analysis, they are\ncurrently held back by the cost of computing the joint likelihood function.\nEach individual source is described by $N=8+2N_p$ parameters, where $N_p$ are\nthe number of pulsars in the array. With the latest combined data sets having\nover one hundred pulsars, the parameter space is very large, and consequently,\nit takes a large number of likelihood evaluations to explore these models. Here\nwe present a new approach that extends the Fourier basis method, previously\nintroduced to accelerate analyses for stochastic signals, to also include\ndeterministic signals. Key elements of the method are that the likelihood\nevaluations are per-pulsar, avoiding expensive operations on large matrices,\nand the templates for individual binaries can be computed analytically or using\nfast Fourier methods on a sparsely sampled grid of time samples. The net result\nis an analysis that is orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches.",

    "abstract": "Composite materials often exhibit mechanical anisotropy owing to the material\nproperties or geometrical configurations of the microstructure. This makes\ntheir inverse design a two-fold problem. First, we must learn the type and\norientation of anisotropy and then find the optimal design parameters to\nachieve the desired mechanical response. In our work, we solve this challenge\nby first training a forward surrogate model based on the macroscopic\nstress-strain data obtained via computational homogenization for a given\nmultiscale material. To this end, we use partially Input Convex Neural Networks\n(pICNNs) to obtain a polyconvex representation of the strain energy in terms of\nthe invariants of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor. The network architecture\nand the strain energy function are modified to incorporate, by construction,\nphysics and mechanistic assumptions into the framework. While training the\nneural network, we find the type of anisotropy, if any, along with the\npreferred directions. Once the model is trained, we solve the inverse problem\nusing an evolution strategy to obtain the design parameters that give a desired\nmechanical response. We test the framework against synthetic macroscale and\nalso homogenized data. For cases where polyconvexity might be violated during\nthe homogenization process, we present viable alternate formulations. The\ntrained model is also integrated into a finite element framework to invert\ndesign parameters that result in a desired macroscopic response. We show that\nthe invariant-based model is able to solve the inverse problem for a\nstress-strain dataset with a different preferred direction than the one it was\ntrained on and is able to not only learn the polyconvex potentials of\nhyperelastic materials but also recover the correct parameters for the inverse\ndesign problem.",

To alleviate this issue,\nwe propose to leverage recent advances in vision-language pretraining research.\nSpecifically, we introduce additional image-text alignment losses into deep\nmetric learning, which serve as constraints to the image-to-image matching\nloss. With additional alignments between the text (e.g., product title) and\nimage pairs, the model can learn concepts from both modalities explicitly,\nwhich avoids matching low-level visual features. We progressively develop two\nvariants, a 3-tower and a 4-tower model, where the latter takes one more short\ntext query input. Through extensive experiments, we show that this change leads\nto a substantial improvement to the image to image matching problem. We further\nleveraged this model for multimodal search, which takes both image and\nreformulation text queries to improve search quality. Both offline and online\nexperiments show strong improvements on the main metrics.

A dynamic algorithm for this problem is a\n$k$-stable $\\alpha$-approximation algorithm when it makes at most $k$ changes\nto \\cDalg upon each update to the set $P$ and the number of covered points at\ntime $t$ is always at least $\\alpha \\cdot \\opt(t)$, where $\\opt(t)$ is the\nmaximum number of points that can be covered by m disks at time $t$. We show\nthat for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, there is a $k_{\\varepsilon}$-stable\n$(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the dynamic Max Cover by Unit\nDisks problem, where $k_{\\varepsilon}=O(1/\\varepsilon^3)$. This improves the\nstability of $\\Theta(1/\\eps^4)$ that can be obtained by combining results of\nChaplick, De, Ravsky, and Spoerhase (ESA 2018) and De~Berg, Sadhukhan, and\nSpieksma (APPROX 2023). Our result extends to other fat similarly-sized objects\nused in the covering, such as arbitrarily-oriented unit squares, or\narbitrarily-oriented fat ellipses of fixed diameter.\n  We complement the above result by showing that the restriction to fat objects\nis necessary to obtain a SAS. To this end, we study the Max Cover by Unit\nSegments problem, where the goal is to place $m$ unit-length segments whose\nunion covers the maximum number of points from $P$. We show that there is a\nconstant $\\varepsilon^* > 0$ such that any $k$-stable $(1 +\n\\varepsilon^*)$-approximation algorithm must have $k=\\Omega(m)$, even when the\npoint set never has more than four collinear points.",

    "abstract": "With industrial and technological development and the increasing demand for\nelectric power, wind energy has gradually become the fastest-growing and most\nenvironmentally friendly new energy source. Nevertheless, wind power generation\nis always accompanied by uncertainty due to the wind speed's volatility. Wind\nspeed forecasting (WSF) is essential for power grids' dispatch, stability, and\ncontrollability, and its accuracy is crucial to effectively using wind\nresources. Therefore, this study proposes a novel WSF framework for stationary\ndata based on a hybrid decomposition method and the Bidirectional Long\nShort-term Memory (BiLSTM) to achieve high forecasting accuracy for the Dumat\nAl-Jandal wind farm in Al-Jouf, Saudi Arabia. The hybrid decomposition method\ncombines the Wavelet Packet Decomposition (WPD) and the Seasonal Adjustment\nMethod (SAM). The SAM method eliminates the seasonal component of the\ndecomposed subseries generated by WPD to reduce forecasting complexity. The\nBiLSTM is applied to forecast all the deseasonalized decomposed subseries. Five\nyears of hourly wind speed observations acquired from a location in the Al-Jouf\nregion were used to prove the effectiveness of the proposed model. The\ncomparative experimental results, including 27 other models, demonstrated the\nproposed model's superiority in single and multiple WSF with an overall average\nmean absolute error of 0.176549, root mean square error of 0.247069, and\nR-squared error of 0.985987.",

GADIC comprises three\nphases which are data reformatting phase which depends on DI concept, training\nphase where GA is applied on the reformatted training dataset, and testing\nphase where the instances of the reformatted testing dataset are being averaged\nbased on similar instances in the training dataset. GADIC is an approach that\nutilizes the exiting ML classifiers with involvement of data reformatting,\nusing GA to tune the inputs, and averaging the similar instances to the unknown\ninstance. The averaging of the instances becomes the unknown instance to be\nclassified in the stage of testing. GADIC has been tested on five existing ML\nclassifiers which are Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN),\nLogistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), and Na\\\"ive Bayes (NB). All were\nevaluated using seven open-source UCI ML repository and Kaggle datasets which\nare Cleveland heart disease, Indian liver patient, Pima Indian diabetes,\nemployee future prediction, telecom churn prediction, bank customer churn, and\ntech students. In terms of accuracy, the results showed that, with the\nexception of approximately 1% decrease in the accuracy of NB classifier in\nCleveland heart disease dataset, GADIC significantly enhanced the performance\nof most ML classifiers using various datasets. In addition, KNN with GADIC\nshowed the greatest performance gain when compared with other ML classifiers\nwith GADIC followed by SVM while LR had the lowest improvement. The lowest\naverage improvement that GADIC could achieve is 5.96%, whereas the maximum\naverage improvement reached 16.79%.",

There are alternative approaches to determine\nthe values of these non-perturbative quantities, some of them relying on the\nNeutral Current (NC) scattering of neutrinos off nucleons. In the presence of\nNC Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), such derivations must be revisited. The aim\nof the present paper is to discuss how information on NSI can be extracted by\ncombining alternative approaches for deriving the form factors. We discuss how\nthe KamLAND atmospheric neutrino data with $E_\\nu<{\\rm GeV}$ (used to determine\nthe axial strange form factor $g_A^s$) can already constrain the axial NSI of\n$\\nu_\\tau$ with nucleons. We also argue that if the precision measurement of\n$\\nu_\\mu$ NC QE scattering establishes unexpectedly large vector strange form\nfactor ({\\it e.g.,} $F_1^s(Q^2)\\sim 0.01$), it will be an indication for\nnonzero NSI coupling with $u$ and $d$ quarks ($\\epsilon_{\\mu\\mu}^{Au/d}\\sim\n0.01$). We study the QE and resonance scattering cross sections of $\\nu_\\tau$\nand $\\nu_e$ off Argon and show that if their axial NSI is of the order of (but\nof course below) the present bounds, the deviation of QE cross sections from\nthe SM prediction will be sizable and distinct from the uncertainties induced\nby the form factors.",

It is found that when the diffusion coefficients for single vacancies\nand interstitials become similar and the effective migration energies of\ndefects is minimum (maximum diffusivities), defect recombination becomes\noptimal, and the concentration of defects is significantly reduced. This is\nsupported by MD simulations indicating improved radiation resistance of V- and\nCr-based alloys, which satisfy the above-stated criteria. Furthermore,\nexperimental observations also reinforce the proposed approach. This study\nsheds light on the design criteria for improved radiation resistance and helps\nmaterial selection without the need of extensive experimental work.",

In\nthis paper, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting a comprehensive study on\nsupervised fine-tuning of LLMs using instruction-tuning datasets spanning\ndiverse knowledge domains and skills. We focus on small-sized LLMs (3B to 7B\nparameters) for their cost-efficiency and accessibility. We explore various\ntraining configurations and strategies across four open-source pre-trained\nmodels. We provide detailed documentation of these configurations, revealing\nfindings that challenge several common training practices, including\nhyperparameter recommendations from TULU and phased training recommended by\nOrca. Key insights from our work include: (i) larger batch sizes paired with\nlower learning rates lead to improved model performance on benchmarks such as\nMMLU, MTBench, and Open LLM Leaderboard; (ii) early-stage training dynamics,\nsuch as lower gradient norms and higher loss values, are strong indicators of\nbetter final model performance, enabling early termination of sub-optimal runs\nand significant computational savings; (iii) through a thorough exploration of\nhyperparameters like warmup steps and learning rate schedules, we provide\nguidance for practitioners and find that certain simplifications do not\ncompromise performance; and (iv) we observed no significant difference in\nperformance between phased and stacked training strategies, but stacked\ntraining is simpler and more sample efficient. With these findings holding\nrobustly across datasets and models, we hope this study serves as a guide for\npractitioners fine-tuning small LLMs and promotes a more inclusive environment\nfor LLM research.",

We introduce a method to expand the memory span of\nthe hybrid state by \"reserving\" a fraction of the Attention context for tokens\nretrieved from arbitrarily distant in the past, thus expanding the eidetic\nmemory span of the overall state. We call this reserved fraction of tokens the\n\"expansion span,\" and the mechanism to retrieve and aggregate it \"Span-Expanded\nAttention\" (SE-Attn). To adapt Hybrid models to using SE-Attn, we propose a\nnovel fine-tuning method that extends LoRA to Hybrid models (HyLoRA) and allows\nefficient adaptation on long spans of tokens. We show that SE-Attn enables us\nto efficiently adapt pre-trained Hybrid models on sequences of tokens up to 8\ntimes longer than the ones used for pre-training. We show that HyLoRA with\nSE-Attn is cheaper and more performant than alternatives like LongLoRA when\napplied to Hybrid models on natural language benchmarks with long-range\ndependencies, such as PG-19, RULER, and other common natural language\ndownstream tasks.",

    "abstract": "We show that the SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on two sites, where N is the\nnumber of flavors of each fermion, corresponds to an exactly solvable two-level\nmany-boson model that Richardson [J. Math. Phys. 9, 1327 (1968)] analytically\nsolved long ago. We express the Bethe ansatz solutions as a function of the\nphysical parameters of the SU(N) FHM, and recast its eigenvalues and\neigenstates in terms of the Richardson pair energies and creation operators. In\nthis context, the connection with the well-studied Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG)\nmodel, known as equivalent to the Richardson model, is established and serves\nas a guideline to the prediction of some N-body physics phenomena in the\ntwo-site SU(N) FHM with N particles. In particular, the LMG second-order\nquantum phase transition (QPT) is shown to occur in the SU(N) FHM for an\nattractive density-density interaction U equal to U_c=-1/(2N), in units of the\n(absolute value of the) tunneling amplitude between the two sites. We show the\nfinite-size energies, the gap, and the kinetic energy, which all reveal the\ntransition, as a function of U for values of N from N = 3 to N = 36, suggesting\nthat the QPT could be experimentally achieved with current technologies\ninvolving SU(N) ultracold atoms or molecules. Finally, we show the entanglement\nentropy of the first site with respect to the second, and it scales like N at\nthe transition, in contrast with several two-mode models.",

Specifically, the method aligns\nthe site-by-site growth process of the infinite-size part of the DMRG, in its\noriginal formulation, with the site-by-site construction of the SSYT (or\nGelfand-like) basis, based on the chain of unitary subgroups $U(1)\\subset U(2)\n\\subset U(3) \\subset U(4)\\cdots $. We give special emphasis to the calculation\nof the symmetry-resolved reduced matrix elements of the hopping terms between\nthe left and the right block, which makes direct use of the basis of SSYT and\nof the Gelfand-Tsetlin coefficients, offering a computational advantage in\nscaling with N compared to alternative methods that rely on summing over\nClebsch-Gordan coefficients. Focusing on the model with homogeneous hopping\nbetween nearest neighbors, we have calculated the ground state energy as a\nfunction of U, i.e the atom-atom interaction amplitude, up to N=6 for filling\n1/N (one particle per site in average), and for one atom (resp. hole) away from\nfilling 1/N, alllowing us to compute the charge gaps, and to estimate in the\nthermodynamical limit, the critical value $U_c$, separating the Mott insulator\nfrom the metallic phase. Central charges c are extracted from the entanglement\nentropy using the Calabrese-Cardy formula, and are consistent with the\ntheoretical predictions: c=N-1, expected from the $SU(N)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten\nCFTs in the spin sector for the Mott phase, and c=N in the metallic phase,\nreflecting the presence of one additional (charge) gapless critical mode.",

Solutions such as Temporal, Azure Durable Functions, and Beldi\nhide fault-tolerance complexity from developers by persisting execution state\nand resuming seamlessly from persisted state after failure. This pattern, often\ncalled durable execution, usually forces frequent and synchronous persistence\nand results in hefty latency overheads. In this paper, we propose distributed\nspeculative execution (DSE), a technique for implementing the durable execution\nabstraction without incurring this penalty. With DSE, developers write code\nassuming synchronous persistence, and a DSE runtime is responsible for\ntransparently bypassing persistence and reactively repairing application state\non failure. We present libDSE, the first DSE application framework that\nachieves this vision. The key tension in designing libDSE is between imposing\nrestrictions on user programs so the framework can safely and transparently\nchange execution behavior, and avoiding assumptions so libDSE can support more\nuse cases. We address this with a novel programming model centered around\nmessage-passing, atomic code blocks, and lightweight threads, and show that it\nallows developers to build a variety of speculative services, including\nwrite-ahead logs, key-value stores, event brokers, and fault-tolerant\nworkflows.

    "abstract": "In our project WatchPlant, we propose to use a decentralized network of\nliving plants as air-quality sensors by measuring their electrophysiology to\ninfer the environmental state, also called phytosensing. We conducted in-lab\nexperiments exposing ivy (Hedera helix) plants to ozone, an important pollutant\nto monitor, and measured their electrophysiological response. However, there is\nno well established automated way of detecting ozone exposure in plants. We\npropose a generic automatic toolchain to select a high-performance subset of\nfeatures and highly accurate models for plant electrophysiology. Our approach\nderives plant- and stimulus-generic features from the electrophysiological\nsignal using the tsfresh library. Based on these features, we automatically\nselect and optimize machine learning models using AutoML. We use forward\nfeature selection to increase model performance. We show that our approach\nsuccessfully classifies plant ozone exposure with accuracies of up to 94.6% on\nunseen data. We also show that our approach can be used for other plant species\nand stimuli. Our toolchain automates the development of monitoring algorithms\nfor plants as pollutant monitors. Our results help implement significant\nadvancements for phytosensing devices contributing to the development of\ncost-effective, high-density urban air monitoring systems in the future.",

Furthermore, we demonstrate the connection between the Total\nActive Reflection Coefficient (TARC) and the MPTT, proving that the TARC is\ninherently tied to the power conservation principle of the MPTT.

To measure the turnaround density, one\nmust locate the distance from the cluster center where turnaround occurs.\nEarlier work has shown that a turnaround radius can be readily identified in\nsimulations by analyzing the 3D dark matter velocity field.

At different operational resolutions, the\nvision encoder of a VLM can be optimized along two axes: reducing encoding\nlatency and minimizing the number of visual tokens passed to the LLM, thereby\nlowering overall latency.

In a typical spray, the drop size distribution\nevolves spatially, varying significantly between the near and far regions of\nthe spray. Studies so far have focused on either one of these regions and are\nunclear on the exact axial location of transition. In this work, we address\nthis crucial gap by considering a swirl atomizer and measuring the droplet\ncharacteristics for different liquid flow conditions of the ensuing spray at\nvarious radial and axial locations. Our results reveal an axial variation in\nthe scaled radial droplet velocity profiles, not followed by the radial drop\nsize profiles, from which we demarcate the near region as the zone which\nextends to 2.0 to 2.5 times film breakup length. Beyond this distance, the drop\nsize characteristics are influenced by external factors such as airflow and\nidentified as the far region. Further, we locate the point of origin of the\ndroplet high-velocity stream along the spray centreline to the end of film\nbreakup of the spray. We also find that the global probability density\nfunctions for droplet size and velocity which show a bimodal behavior in the\nnear-region and unimodal in the far-region being well represented by the double\nGaussian and Gamma distributions, respectively. We further quantify our results\nby number and volume flux distributions, global mean drop sizes, drop size\n($D_d$) axial velocity ($U_a$) correlations, axial velocity based on drop size\nclassification and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) to reveal the effect of drop\ninertia and air flow in determining the statistics in both the near and far\nregions.

This biases the model's predictions because the model learns\nfrom a dataset that does not follow the same data generating process as new\ndata. One way of accounting for this bias is to analytically map the resulting\npredictions to new values based on the sampling rate for the majority class,\nwhich was used to create the training dataset.

If the matter\ndistribution is symmetric relative to the neutrino production and detection\npoints, matter effects will not introduce any new TV. However, if there is\nintrinsic TV, matter effects can modify the size of the T-odd observable. On\nthe other hand, if the matter distribution is not symmetric, there is genuine\nmatter-induced TV. For Earth-bound long-baseline oscillation experiments, these\neffects are small. This remains true for unrealistically-asymmetric matter\npotentials (for example, we investigate the effects of ''hollowing out'' 50% of\nthe DUNE neutrino trajectory). More broadly, we explore consequences, or lack\nthereof, of asymmetric matter potentials on oscillation probabilities. While\nfascinating in their own right, T-odd observables are currently of limited\npractical use, due in no small part to a dearth of intense, well-characterized,\nhigh-energy electron-neutrino beams.

In analogy to\nthe original Yang-Mills instanton Floer theory, these groups are defined by the\nsolutions of the $\\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$ modulo instanton\nsolutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between them on the\nfive-dimensional cylinder $\\mathbb{R}_s \\times W^4$. The relation to knot\ninvariants arises when the four-manifold is the geometric blowup $W^4 = [X^3\n\\times \\mathbb{R}^+, K]$ along a knot $K \\subset X^3 \\times \\{0\\}$ embedded in\nits three-dimensional boundary. The boundaries and corners of this manifold\nrequire the specification of boundary conditions that preserve the topological\ninvariance of the construction and are fundamentally linked to various\ndimensional reductions of the Haydys-Witten equations. We provide a\ncomprehensive discussion of these dimensional reductions and relate them to\nwell-known gauge-theoretic equations in lower dimensions, including the\n$\\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations, twisted extended Bogomolny equations, and\ntwisted octonionic Nahm equations. Along the way, we record novel results on\nthe elliptic regularity of the Haydys-Witten equations with twisted Nahm pole\nboundary conditions. The upshot of the article is a tentative definition of\nHaydys-Witten Floer theory and a precise restatement of Witten's conjecture: an\nequality between the Haydys-Witten Floer homology $HF^\\bullet_{\\pi/2}([S^3\n\\times \\mathbb{R}^+, K])$ and Khovanov homology $Kh^\\bullet(K)$.",

This study addresses the\nchallenge of persona classification, a crucial component in dialogue\nunderstanding, by proposing a framework that combines text embeddings with\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) for effective persona classification. Given the\nabsence of dedicated persona classification datasets, we create a manually\nannotated dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation.

The GNN component uses this graph structure to\npropagate relevant information, thereby improving classification performance.\nExperimental results show that our approach, in particular the integration of\nGNNs, significantly improves classification performance, especially with\nlimited data.

To examine barriers to impact, this study\nextends recent work from laboratory and experimental settings to the wider\nonline information ecosystem present during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections.\nFrom analyses conducted within this context, we find that fact-checks as\ncurrently developed and distributed are severely inhibited in election contexts\nby constraints on their i. coverage, ii. speed, and, iii. reach. Specifically,\nwe provide evidence that fewer than half of all prominent election-related\nmisinformation narratives were fact-checked.

Using network analysis to estimate user\npartisanship and dynamics of information spread, we additionally find evidence\nthat fact-checks make up less than 1.2\\% of narrative conversations and that\neven when shared, fact-checks are nearly always shared within,rather than\nbetween, partisan communities.

Moreover, when the\nrequirement is for the algorithm to find a solution within a single day, we\nfind that only Grover's algorithm has the potential to outperform classical\nalgorithms, but only in a very limited regime and only when using $T$-depth.

One structure, the\nfinite-time Lyapunov field (FTLE), quantifies advective transport barriers of\nfluid parcels while the other structure highlights barriers of diffusive\nmomentum transport. These two complementary structures depend on large-scale\nand small-scale motion and are therefore associated with the growth of the\nturbulent region through engulfment or nibbling, respectively. We detect the\n\\tnti\\ from cluster analysis, where we divide the measured scalar field into\nfour clusters. Not only the \\tnti\\ can be found this way, but also the next,\ninternal, turbulent-turbulent interface. Conditional averages show that these\ninterfaces are correlated with barriers of advective and diffusive transport\nwhen the Lagrangian integration time is smaller than the integral time scale.\nDiffusive structures decorrelate faster since they have a smaller timescale.\nConditional averages of these structures at internal turbulent-turbulent\ninterfaces show the same pattern with a more pronounced jump at the interface\nindicative of a shear layer. This is quite an unexpected outcome, as the\ninternal interface is now defined not by the presence or absence of vorticity,\nbut by conditional vorticity corresponding to two uniform concentration zones.\nThe long-time diffusive momentum flux along Lagrangian paths represents the\ngrowth of the turbulent flow into the irrotational domain, a direct\ndemonstration of nibbling. The diffusive flux parallel to the \\tnti\\ appears to\nbe concentrated in a diffusive superlayer whose width is comparable with the\nTaylor microscale, which is relatively invariant in time.",

This allows us to design a new system named TETRIS,\nwhich solves the real-world use case of private functional exploration of large\ndatabases, where the statistical criteria remain private to the server owning\nthe patients' records. Our experiments show that TETRIS achieves practical\nperformance over a large dataset of patients even for the evaluation of\nelaborate statements composed of linear and nonlinear functions.

The paper introduces the notions of $\\Gamma$-operator\nsystems and $\\Gamma$-ucp maps and establishes a Webster-Winkler type\ncategorical duality between $\\Gamma$-operator systems and $\\Gamma$-convex sets.\nNext, a notion of an extreme point for $\\Gamma$-convex sets is defined,\nparalleling the concept of a free extreme point for a matrix convex set.

We achieve this by refining\nearlier methods and developing an algebraic procedure for determining HRT\nsurfaces in arbitrary Ba\\~nados-Vaidya geometries which are dual to quenches\ninvolving transitions between general quantum equilibrium states (e.g. thermal\nstates) where the QNEC is saturated. We also discuss results for the growth and\nthermalization of entanglement entropy for arbitrary initial and final\ntemperatures and momentum densities. The rate of quadratic growth of\nentanglement just after the quench depends only on the change in the energy\ndensity and is independent of the entangling length. For sufficiently large\nentangling lengths, the entanglement tsunami phenomenon can be established.\nFinally, we study recovery of the initial state from the evolving entanglement\nentropy and argue that the Renyi entropies should give us a refined\nunderstanding of scrambling of quantum information.",

This approach aims at breaking the 1% absolute photometric\naccuracy which limits current calibration methods for ground-based\nobservatories. We fit the transmission, as a function of wavelength, for each\nimage. The fit is done by comparing the instrumental fluxes of stars in the\nimage to the synthetic photometry of the stars given their spectrum and the\ntransmission function which have free parameters. A key element that enables\nthis approach is the set of about 220 million low-resolution spectra measured\nby Gaia, which provides a large number of stellar calibrators in the image. We\ndemonstrate the method using data from the Large Array Survey Telescope (LAST).\nWe show that the residuals between observations and synthetic photometry of the\nGaia spectra in the fitted transmission have a standard deviation $<$1% on an\nimage-by-image basis, with no spatial and color dependencies.

The average\ndistance between clusters and filaments is larger for low X-ray surface\nbrightness clusters than for those of high surface brightness, with\nintermediate brightness clusters being an intermediate case. Also the minimum\ndistance follows a similar trend, with rare cases of low surface brightness\nclusters found at distances smaller than 2 Mpc from the spine of filaments.\nHowever, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test is not able to exclude the\nnull hypothesis that the two distributions are coming from the same parent one.\nWe speculate that the position of galaxy clusters within the cosmic web could\nhave a direct impact in their gas mass fraction, hence on its X-ray surface\nbrightness, since the presence of a filament can oppose resistance to the\noutward flow of gas induced by the central AGN and reduce the time required for\nthis gas to fall inward after the AGN is shut. However, a larger sample of\nclusters is needed in order to derive a statistically-robust conclusion",

    "abstract": "Anomalous thermal relaxation is ubiquitous in nonequilibrium statistical\nmechanics. An emblematic example of this is the Mpemba effect, where an\ninitially ``hot'' system cools faster than an initially ``cooler'' one. This\neffect has recently been studied in a variety of different classical and\nquantum settings. In this Letter, we find a novel signature of the Mpemba\neffect in the context of quantum batteries. We identify situations where\nbatteries in higher charge states can discharge faster than less charged\nstates. Specifically, we consider a quantum battery encoded in a single bosonic\nmode that is charged using unitary Gaussian operations. We show that the\nergotropy, used here as a dynamical indicator of the energy stored in the\nbattery, can be recast as a phase space relative entropy between the system's\nstate and the unitarily connected passive state, at each time. Our formalism\nallows us to compute the ergotropy analytically under dissipative dynamics and\nallows us to understand the conditions which give rise to a Mpemba effect. We\nalso find situations where two batteries charged to the same value using\ndifferent operations can discharge at different rates.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we introduce the clus model, which has been newly implemented\nin the X-ray spectral fitting software package SPEX. Based on the 3D radial\nprofiles of the gas density, temperature, metal abundance, turbulent, and\ninflow/outflow velocities, the clus model creates spectra for a chosen\nprojected region on the sky. Additionally, it can also take into account the\nresonant scattering. We show a few applications of the clus model on simulated\nspectra of the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 4636, and galaxy clusters A383,\nA2029, A1795, A262, and the Perseus cluster. We quantify the effect of\nprojection, as well as resonant scattering on inferred profiles of the iron\nabundance and temperature, assuming the resolution similar to Chandra ACIS-S\nand XRISM Resolve. Our results show that, depending on the mass of the object,\nas well as the projected distance from its core, neither a single-temperature,\ndouble-temperature, nor the Gaussian-shaped differential emission measure\nmodels can accurately describe the input emission measure distribution of these\nmassive objects. The largest effect of projection as well as resonant\nscattering is seen for projected profiles of iron abundance of NGC 4636, where\nwe are able to reproduce the observed iron abundance drop in its inner-most few\nkiloparsecs. Furthermore, we find that projection effects also influence the\nbest-fit temperature, and the magnitude of this effect varies depending on the\nunderlying hydrodynamical profiles of individual objects. In the core, the\nprojection effects are the largest for A1795 and NGC 4636, while in the\noutskirts the largest difference between 2D and 3D temperature profiles are for\nPerseus and A1795, regardless of the instrumental resolution. These findings\nmight potentially have an impact on cross-calibration studies between different\ninstruments, as well as on the precision cosmology.",

This paper presents the largest spectroscopic\nsearch for exocomet transits to date, which overcomes the limitations of biased\nsamples of stars with debris discs, and instead looks through the $\\approx$7500\nstars in the HARPS archive for signs of exocomets in the CaII doublet\n(H:396.847nm and K:393.366nm). The search resulted in 155 candidate stars,\nwhich after filtering for false positives (e.g. binaries, stellar activity,\netc.), were cut down to 22 stars. These 22 stars are classified into Tier1, 2,\nand 3 exocomet candidates, reflecting the confidence level of their exocomet\ndetection. Our two best candidates (Tier1: Beta Pictoris, HD172555) and four\nlower confidence candidates (Tier2: Gl1, HIP5158, HD94771, HR1996) are\ndiscussed, yielding a detection rate of 0.03% (Tier1 only) and 0.1% (Tier1 & 2)\nin the HARPS sample. Both Tier1 stars are known exocomet host stars. These two\nyoung A-type stars correspond to 0.4% of all A-types in the sample, suggesting\nthat detecting signs of exocomet transits using CaII is more likely around\nyoung A-type stars.

A handful of close-in planets with\nmasses between those of Neptune and Saturn have now been discovered, and their\npuzzling properties have inspired a number of interesting theories on the\nformation and evolution of desert-dwellers. While some studies suggest that\nNeptune desert planets form and evolve similarly to longer-period Neptunes,\nothers argue that they are products of rare collisions between smaller planets,\nor that they are the exposed interiors of giant planets (i.e., ``hot Jupiters\ngone wrong''). These origin stories make different predictions for the\nmetallicities of Neptune desert host stars. In this paper, we use the\nhomogeneous catalog of stellar metallicities from Gaia Data Release 3 to\ninvestigate the origins of Neptune desert-dwellers. We find that planets in the\nNeptune desert orbit stars that are significantly more metal-rich than the\nhosts of longer-period Neptunes ($p = 0.0016$) and smaller planets ($p =\n0.00014$). In contrast, Neptune desert host star metallicities are\nstatistically indistinguishable from those of hot Jupiter host stars ($p =\n0.55$). Therefore, we find it relatively unlikely that Neptune desert planets\nformed and evolved similarly to longer-period Neptunes, or that they resulted\nfrom collisions between smaller planets, at least without another\nmetallicity-selective process involved. A more straightforward explanation for\nthis result is that planets in the desert truly are the exposed interiors of\nlarger planets. Atmospheric spectroscopy of Neptune desert worlds may therefore\nprovide a rare glimpse into the interiors of giant exoplanets.",

In the curvaton framework,\nthere is a conventional contribution to the local NG of $f_{\\rm NL} \\simeq\n-O(1)$. Additional positive local NG can result from either the\nself-interactions of axial field fluctuations, their interactions with a light\nradial partner, or kinetic mixing with the inflaton via $U(1)$\nsymmetry-breaking terms. We identify parameter regions where the interactions\nlead to cancellations, suppressing the overall local NG to $|f^{\\rm\nloc}_{\\mathrm{NL}}| \\lesssim O(0.1)$, while leaving the trispectrum largely\nunaffected. In the CDM scenario, these interactions enhance the NG in the\nisocurvature fluctuations.

    "abstract": "The vision of a broadly capable and goal-directed agent, such as an\nInternet-browsing agent in the digital world and a household humanoid in the\nphysical world, has rapidly advanced, thanks to the generalization capability\nof foundation models. Such a generalist agent needs to have a large and diverse\nskill repertoire, such as finding directions between two travel locations and\nbuying specific items from the Internet. If each skill needs to be specified\nmanually through a fixed set of human-annotated instructions, the agent's skill\nrepertoire will necessarily be limited due to the quantity and diversity of\nhuman-annotated instructions. In this work, we address this challenge by\nproposing Proposer-Agent-Evaluator, an effective learning system that enables\nfoundation model agents to autonomously discover and practice skills in the\nwild. At the heart of PAE is a context-aware task proposer that autonomously\nproposes tasks for the agent to practice with context information of the\nenvironment such as user demos or even just the name of the website itself for\nInternet-browsing agents. Then, the agent policy attempts those tasks with\nthoughts and actual grounded operations in the real world with resulting\ntrajectories evaluated by an autonomous VLM-based success evaluator. The\nsuccess evaluation serves as the reward signal for the agent to refine its\npolicies through RL. We validate PAE on challenging vision-based web\nnavigation, using both real-world and self-hosted websites from WebVoyager and\nWebArena.To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first effective\nlearning system to apply autonomous task proposal with RL for agents that\ngeneralizes real-world human-annotated benchmarks with SOTA performances.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating photorealistic\nimages but often fail to render accurate spatial relationships. We identify two\ncore issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of data\nconcerning spatial relationships in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of\ncurrent text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input\ndescriptions. We propose CoMPaSS, a versatile framework that enhances spatial\nunderstanding in T2I models. It first addresses data ambiguity with the Spatial\nConstraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates\nspatially-accurate training data via principled constraints. To leverage these\npriors, CoMPaSS also introduces the Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module,\nwhich preserves crucial token ordering information lost by text encoders,\nthereby reinforcing the prompt's linguistic structure. Extensive experiments on\nfour popular T2I models (UNet and MMDiT-based) show CoMPaSS sets a new state of\nthe art on key spatial benchmarks, with substantial relative gains on VISOR\n(+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%).

Motivated by these considerations,\nin this work we observe that all known stringy Standard Models support only\nlow-dimensional representations of the gauge group. While it is in principle\npossible to produce contrived models with higher-dimensional representations,\nthese generically appear in a tower of states with lighter ones in\nlower-dimensional representations, i.e., not in isolation.

This scenario is not realized in any\nknown string construction, and we conjecture that this is true of string theory\nin general. Detection of this scenario would thus amount to falsifying the\n(known) string landscape.

In this\npaper, we leverage novel data sources such as the Historical Settlement Data\nCompilation for the U.S. (HISDAC-US), and analyze the temporal scaling laws of\ndeveloped area, building indoor area, building footprint area, and road length\nand other road network statistics for nearly all metropolitan areas in the U.S.\nfrom 1900 to 2015. We find that scaling exponents vary dramatically between\ncities as a function of their size and location. Three notable patterns emerge.\nFirst, scaling law exponents imply many, but not all, metropolitan areas are\nbecoming less dense and indoor area per capita increases as cities grow, in\ncontrast to expectations. Second, larger cities tend to have a smaller scaling\nexponent than smaller cities. Third, scaling exponents (and growth patterns)\nare similar between nearby cities. These results show a long-term trend that\ncould harm urban sustainability as previously dense populations are rapidly\nspreading out into undeveloped land. Moreover, the regional similarity of\nlong-term urban growth patterns implies that city evolution and sustainability\npatterns are more interconnected than prior research has suggested. These\nresults help urban planners and scientists understand universal, long-term\npatterns of city growth across the US.",

    "abstract": "Recent works on accelerating Vision-Language Models achieve strong\nperformance across a variety of vision-language tasks despite highly\ncompressing visual information. In this work, we examine the popular\nacceleration approach of early pruning of visual tokens inside the language\nmodel. Surprisingly, we find that while strong performance is maintained across\nmany tasks, it exhibits drastically different behavior for a subset of\nvision-centric tasks such as localization. Upon further investigation, we\nuncover a core issue with the acceleration approach where most tokens towards\nthe top of the image are pruned away. Yet, on many benchmarks aiming to\nevaluate vision-centric capabilities, strong performance persists with the\nflawed pruning strategy, highlighting these benchmarks' limited ability to\nassess fine-grained visual capabilities. Based on these findings, we propose\nFEATHER (Fast and Effective Acceleration wiTH Ensemble cRiteria), a\nstraightforward approach that resolves the discovered early-layer pruning issue\nand further enhances the preservation of relevant tokens via multistage pruning\nwith early uniform sampling to ensure broad image coverage.

When a permanent hardware failure\noccurs in a systolic array, existing solutions include localizing and isolating\nthe faulty processing element (PE), using a redundant PE for re-execution, or\nin some extreme cases decommissioning the entire accelerator for further\ninvestigation. In this paper, we propose novel algorithmic approaches that\nmitigate permanent hardware faults in neural network (NN) accelerators by\nuniquely integrating the behavior of the faulty component instead of bypassing\nit. In doing so, we aim for a more sustainable use of the accelerator where\nfaulty hardware is neither bypassed nor discarded, instead being given a second\nlife. We first introduce a CUDA-accelerated systolic array simulator in\nPyTorch, which enabled us to quantify the impact of permanent faults appearing\non links connecting two PEs or in weight registers, where one bit is stuck at 0\nor 1 in the float32, float16, or bfloat16 representation. We then propose\nseveral algorithmic mitigation techniques for a subset of stuck-at faults, such\nas Invertible Scaling or Shifting of activations and weights, or fine tuning\nwith the faulty behavior. Notably, the proposed techniques do not require any\nhardware modification, instead relying on existing components of widely used\nsystolic array based accelerators, such as normalization, activation, and\nstorage units.

In addition, low texture surfaces in endoscopy videos\ncause photometric bundle adjustment of the existing SLAM frameworks to perform\npoorly compared to indoor/outdoor scenes.

Our\nfindings further reveal that the LLM performs better for supporters of\nleft-leaning parties like The Greens and The Left compared to other parties,\nand matches the least with the right-party AfD. Additionally, the inclusion or\nexclusion of specific variables in the prompts can significantly impact the\nmodels' predictions. These findings underscore the importance of aligning LLMs\nto more effectively model diverse public opinions while minimizing political\nbiases and enhancing robustness in representativeness.",

    "abstract": "In-the-wild dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) encounters a\nsignificant challenge in recognizing emotion-related expressions, which are\noften temporally and spatially diluted by emotion-irrelevant expressions and\nglobal context. Most prior DFER methods directly utilize coupled spatiotemporal\nrepresentations that may incorporate weakly relevant features with\nemotion-irrelevant context bias. Several DFER methods highlight dynamic\ninformation for DFER, but following explicit guidance that may be vulnerable to\nirrelevant motion. In this paper, we propose a novel Implicit Facial Dynamics\nDisentanglement framework (IFDD). Through expanding wavelet lifting scheme to\nfully learnable framework, IFDD disentangles emotion-related dynamic\ninformation from emotion-irrelevant global context in an implicit manner, i.e.,\nwithout exploit operations and external guidance. The disentanglement process\ncontains two stages. The first is Inter-frame Static-dynamic Splitting Module\n(ISSM) for rough disentanglement estimation, which explores inter-frame\ncorrelation to generate content-aware splitting indexes on-the-fly. We utilize\nthese indexes to split frame features into two groups, one with greater global\nsimilarity, and the other with more unique dynamic features. The second stage\nis Lifting-based Aggregation-Disentanglement Module (LADM) for further\nrefinement. LADM first aggregates two groups of features from ISSM to obtain\nfine-grained global context features by an updater, and then disentangles\nemotion-related facial dynamic features from the global context by a predictor.\nExtensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets have demonstrated that IFDD\noutperforms prior supervised DFER methods with higher recognition accuracy and\ncomparable efficiency.

    "abstract": "The aim of this article is to define and compare several distances (or\nmetrics) between operators acting on different (separable) Hilbert spaces. We\nconsider here three main cases of how to measure the distance between two\nbounded operators: first by taking the distance between their unitary orbits,\nsecond by isometric embeddings (this generalises a concept of Weidmann) and\nthird by quasi-unitary equivalence (using a concept of the first author of the\npresent article).\n  Our main result is that the unitary and isometric distances are equal\nprovided the operators are both self-adjoint and have $0$ in their essential\nspectra. Moreover, the quasi-unitary distance is equivalent (up to a universal\nconstant) with the isometric distance for any pair of bounded operators. The\nunitary distance gives an upper bound on the Hausdorff distance of their\nspectrum. If both operators have purely essential spectrum, then the unitary\ndistance equals the Hausdorff distance of their spectra. Using a finer spectral\ndistance respecting multiplicity of discrete eigenvalues, this spectral\ndistance equals the unitary distance also for operators with essential and\ndiscrete spectrum. In particular, all operator distances mentioned above are\nequal to this spectral distance resp. controlled by it in the quasi-unitary\ncase for self-adjoint operators with $0$ in the essential spectrum. We also\nshow that our results are sharp by presenting various (counter-)examples.\nFinally, we discuss related convergence concepts complementing results from our\nfirst article arXiv:2202.03234",

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has quickly become a feasible\nsolution for organizations looking to overcome the challenges of maintaining\nproprietary models and to help reduce LLM hallucinations in their query\nresponses. However, RAG comes with its own issues regarding scaling data\npipelines across tiered-access and disparate data sources.

Analyzing data sources within and across\norganizational trust boundaries is often limited by complex data-sharing\npolicies that prohibit centralized data storage, therefore, inhibit the fast\nand effective setup and scaling of RAG solutions.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence generative models exhibit remarkable capabilities in\ncontent creation, particularly in face image generation, customization, and\nrestoration. However, current AI-generated faces (AIGFs) often fall short of\nhuman preferences due to unique distortions, unrealistic details, and\nunexpected identity shifts, underscoring the need for a comprehensive quality\nevaluation framework for AIGFs. To address this need, we introduce FaceQ, a\nlarge-scale, comprehensive database of AI-generated Face images with\nfine-grained Quality annotations reflecting human preferences. The FaceQ\ndatabase comprises 12,255 images generated by 29 models across three tasks: (1)\nface generation, (2) face customization, and (3) face restoration. It includes\n32,742 mean opinion scores (MOSs) from 180 annotators, assessed across multiple\ndimensions: quality, authenticity, identity (ID) fidelity, and text-image\ncorrespondence. Using the FaceQ database, we establish F-Bench, a benchmark for\ncomparing and evaluating face generation, customization, and restoration\nmodels, highlighting strengths and weaknesses across various prompts and\nevaluation dimensions. Additionally, we assess the performance of existing\nimage quality assessment (IQA), face quality assessment (FQA), AI-generated\ncontent image quality assessment (AIGCIQA), and preference evaluation metrics,\nmanifesting that these standard metrics are relatively ineffective in\nevaluating authenticity, ID fidelity, and text-image correspondence. The FaceQ\ndatabase will be publicly available upon publication.",

    "abstract": "Tides are the main driving force behind the long-term evolution of planetary\nsystems. The associated energy dissipation and momentum exchanges are commonly\ndescribed by Love numbers, which relate the exciting potential to the tidally\nperturbed potential. These transfer functions are generally assumed to depend\nsolely on tidal frequency and body rheology, following the isotropic\nassumption, which presumes invariance of properties by rotation about the\ncentre of mass. We examine the limitations of the isotropic assumption for\nfluid bodies, where Coriolis acceleration breaks spherical symmetry, resulting\nin rotational scattering and complex tidal responses. Using angular momentum\ntheory, we derive a new formalism to calculate the tidal rates of energy and\nmomentum transfers in non-isotropic cases. We apply this formalism to the\nEarth-Moon system to assess the effects of anisotropy in planet-satellite\nsystems with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta. Our findings indicate\nthat the isotropic assumption can introduce significant errors in planetary\nevolution models, particularly in the dynamical tide regime. These errors stem\nfrom forced wave resonances, with inaccuracies in energy dissipation scaling in\nproportion to resonance amplification factors.",

However, they often require to maintain\noptimizer states throughout training, which can result in memory requirements\nseveral times greater than the model footprint. This overhead imposes\nconstraints on scalability and computational efficiency. Stochastic Gradient\nDescent (SGD), in contrast, is a stateless optimizer, as it does not track\nstate variables during training. Consequently, it achieves optimal memory\nefficiency. However, its capability in LLM training is limited (Zhao et al.,\n2024b). In this work, we show that pre-processing SGD in a stateless manner can\nachieve the same performance as the Adam optimizer for LLM training, while\ndrastically reducing the memory cost. Specifically, we propose to pre-process\nthe instantaneous stochastic gradients using normalization and whitening. We\nshow that normalization stabilizes gradient distributions, and whitening\ncounteracts the local curvature of the loss landscape. This results in SWAN\n(SGD with Whitening And Normalization), a stochastic optimizer that eliminates\nthe need to store any optimizer states. Empirically, SWAN has the same memory\nfootprint as SGD, achieving $\\approx 50\\%$ reduction on total end-to-end memory\ncompared to Adam. In language modeling tasks, SWAN demonstrates comparable or\neven better performance than Adam: when pre-training the LLaMA model with 350M\nand 1.3B parameters, SWAN achieves a 2x speedup by reaching the same evaluation\nperplexity using half as many tokens.",

In this paper, we propose the first\npracticable black-box evasion attack method that achieves effective attacks\nagainst the target LPDG model, within a limited amount of interactions and\nperturbations. To perform effective attacks under limited perturbations, we\ndevelop a graph sequential embedding model to find the desired state embedding\nof the dynamic graph sequences, under a deep reinforcement learning framework.\nTo overcome the scarcity of interactions, we design a multi-environment\ntraining pipeline and train our agent for multiple instances, by sharing an\naggregate interaction buffer. Finally, we evaluate our attack against three\nadvanced LPDG models on three real-world graph datasets of different scales and\ncompare its performance with related methods under the interaction and\nperturbation constraints.

Off-the-shelf toxicity\ndetectors are ineffective when applied to OSS communications, due to the\ndistinct nature of toxicity observed in these channels (e.g., entitlement and\narrogance are more frequently observed on GitHub than on Reddit or Twitter). In\nthis paper, we investigate a machine learning-based approach for the automatic\ndetection of toxic communications in OSS. We leverage psycholinguistic\nlexicons, and Moral Foundations Theory to analyze toxicity in two types of OSS\ncommunication channels; issue comments and code reviews. Our evaluation\nindicates that our approach can achieve a significant performance improvement\n(up to 7% increase in F1 score) over the existing domain-specific toxicity\ndetector. We found that using moral values as features is more effective than\nlinguistic cues, resulting in 67.50% F1-measure in identifying toxic instances\nin code review data and 64.83% in issue comments. While the detection accuracy\nis far from accurate, this improvement demonstrates the potential of\nintegrating moral and psycholinguistic features in toxicity detection models.\nThese findings highlight the importance of context-specific models that\nconsider the unique communication styles within OSS, where interpersonal and\nvalue-driven language dynamics differ markedly from general social media\nplatforms.

To ensure the reliability of these tests, it is essential\nto identify and address potential sources of error, particularly those arising\nfrom missing physics in the waveform models used in GW data analysis. This\npaper investigates potential biases in these tests arising from strong\ngravitational lensing, an effect not currently incorporated into the standard\nframework for GR tests. In the geometric optics approximation, strong lensing\nproduces three types of images: Type I, Type II, and Type III. While Type I and\nType III images do not distort the signal, Type II images introduce a\ncharacteristic phase shift that can mimic GR deviations for signals with\nhigher-order modes, precession, or eccentricity. We assess the response of four\nstandard GR tests on simulated Type II lensed BBH signals, including the two\nparameterized tests (TIGER and FTI), the modified dispersion relation test and\nthe inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test. We focus on precessing waveforms\nfor binaries with total masses of $20M_{\\odot}$ and $80M_{\\odot}$, and\ndimensionless spins of 0.5 and 0.95, considering a fixed signal-to-noise ratio\nof 25 using the design A+ sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo network. Our findings\nindicate that more mass-asymmetric and higher-spin binaries show larger false\ndeviations from GR in the TIGER and modified dispersion relation tests when\napplying GR tests to Type II lensed signals. These results highlight the risk\nof false GR violations as detector sensitivity improves in future observational\nruns.

However, existing models have\nbeen primarily data-driven and lack the incorporation of domain-specific\nknowledge, which limits their performance in cancer diagnosis, especially for\nrare tumor subtypes. To address this limitation, we establish a\nKnowledge-enhanced Pathology (KEEP) foundation model that harnesses disease\nknowledge to facilitate vision-language pre-training. Specifically, we first\nconstruct a disease knowledge graph (KG) that covers 11,454 human diseases with\n139,143 disease attributes, including synonyms, definitions, and hypernym\nrelations. We then systematically reorganize the millions of publicly available\nnoisy pathology image-text pairs, into 143K well-structured semantic groups\nlinked through the hierarchical relations of the disease KG. To derive more\nnuanced image and text representations, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced\nvision-language pre-training approach that integrates disease knowledge into\nthe alignment within hierarchical semantic groups instead of unstructured\nimage-text pairs. Validated on 18 diverse benchmarks with more than 14,000\nwhole slide images (WSIs), KEEP achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nzero-shot cancer diagnostic tasks. Notably, for cancer detection, KEEP\ndemonstrates an average sensitivity of 89.8% at a specificity of 95.0% across 7\ncancer types. For cancer subtyping, KEEP achieves a median balanced accuracy of\n0.456 in subtyping 30 rare brain cancers, indicating strong generalizability\nfor diagnosing rare tumors.",

Our measurements of the spectral index, star\nformation rate of the host galaxy and recently reported constraints on the\nphysical size strongly argue for our detected source to be a persistent radio\nsource (PRS) associated with the FRB 20240114A. For FRB~20220912A, we detect\nradio emission that is most likely due to star formation in the host galaxy.\nFor FRB 20240619D, we provide upper limits on the radio emission from an\nassociated PRS or the host galaxy. The detection of the PRS associated with\nFRB~20240114A is a useful addition to the PRSs known to be associated with only\nthree other FRBs so far, and further supports the origin of the PRS in the form\nof magnetoionic medium surrounding the FRB sources.",

The overall spectrum\nremains fairly consistent during quiescence and eruptions, with subtle changes\nin line-profile shapes and other details. Some narrow emission features\nindicate contamination from a nearby H~{\\sc ii} region in the host galaxy, NGC\n4559. Broader H$\\alpha$ profiles exhibit Lorentzian shapes with full width at\nhalf-maximum intensity (FWHM) values that vary significantly, showing no\ncorrelation with photometric outbursts or the 113 d phase.

These P Cygni\nabsorptions have high velocities compared to the FWHM of the H$\\alpha$ emission\nline, perhaps suggesting that the absorption component is not in the LBV's\nwind, but is instead associated with a companion. The lack of phase dependence\nin line-profile changes may point to interaction between a companion and a\nvariable or inhomogeneous primary wind, in an orbit with only mild\neccentricity.

    "abstract": "Quantitative requirements play an important role in the context of\nmulti-agent systems, where there is often a trade-off between the tasks of\nindividual agents and the constraints that the agents must jointly adhere to.\nWe study multi-agent systems whose requirements are formally specified in the\nquantitative temporal logic LTL[$\\mathcal{F}$] as a combination of local task\nspecifications for the individual agents and a shared safety constraint, The\nintricate dependencies between the individual agents entailed by their local\nand shared objectives make the design of multi-agent systems error-prone, and\ntheir verification time-consuming. In this paper we address this problem by\nproposing a novel notion of quantitative assume-guarantee contracts, that\nenables the compositional design and verification of multi-agent systems with\nquantitative temporal specifications. The crux of these contracts lies in their\nability to capture the coordination between the individual agents to achieve an\noptimal value of the overall specification under any possible behavior of the\nexternal environment. We show that the proposed framework improves the\nscalability and modularity of formal verification of multi-agent systems\nagainst quantitative temporal specifications.",

Nevertheless, we can extend the celestial sphere\nitself to a supermanifold -- the celestial supersphere.

Existing methods often rely on 3D motion capture data, which\nrequire special setups resulting in higher costs for data acquisition,\nultimately limiting the diversity and scope of human motion. In contrast, 2D\nhuman videos offer a vast and accessible source of motion data, covering a\nwider range of styles and activities. In this paper, we explore leveraging 2D\nhuman motion extracted from videos as an alternative data source to improve\ntext-driven 3D motion generation. Our approach introduces a novel framework\nthat disentangles local joint motion from global movements, enabling efficient\nlearning of local motion priors from 2D data. We first train a single-view 2D\nlocal motion generator on a large dataset of text-motion pairs. To enhance this\nmodel to synthesize 3D motion, we fine-tune the generator with 3D data,\ntransforming it into a multi-view generator that predicts view-consistent local\njoint motion and root dynamics. Experiments on the HumanML3D dataset and novel\ntext prompts demonstrate that our method efficiently utilizes 2D data,\nsupporting realistic 3D human motion generation and broadening the range of\nmotion types it supports.

    "abstract": "Random walks on expanders play a crucial role in Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithms, derandomization, graph theory, and distributed computing. A\ndesirable property is that they are rapidly mixing, which is equivalent to\nhaving a spectral gap $\\gamma$ (asymptotically) bounded away from $0$. Our work\nhas two main strands.\n  First, we establish a dichotomy for the robustness of mixing times on\nedge-weighted $d$-regular graphs (i.e., reversible Markov chains) subject to a\nLipschitz condition, which bounds the ratio of adjacent weights by $\\beta \\geq\n1$. If $\\beta \\ge 1$ is sufficiently small, then $\\gamma \\asymp 1$ and the\nmixing time is logarithmic in $n$. On the other hand, if $\\beta \\geq 2d$, there\nis an edge-weighting such that $\\gamma$ is polynomially small in $1/n$.\n  Second, we apply our robustness result to a time-dependent version of the\nso-called $\\varepsilon$-biased random walk, as introduced in Azar et al.\n[Combinatorica 1996]. We show that, for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, a bias\nstrategy can be chosen adaptively so that the $\\varepsilon$-biased random walk\ncovers any bounded-degree regular expander in $\\Theta(n)$ expected time,\nimproving the previous-best bound of $O(n \\log \\log n)$. We prove the first\nnon-trivial lower bound on the cover time of the $\\varepsilon$-biased random\nwalk, showing that, on bounded-degree regular expanders, it is $\\omega(n)$\nwhenever $\\varepsilon = o(1)$. We establish this by controlling how much the\nprobability of arbitrary events can be ``boosted'' by using a time-dependent\nbias strategy.",

Despite the extensive research into metasurfaces, a\nrigorous and comprehensive understanding of their angular dispersion remains\nvastly under-explored. Here, we use the generalized sheet transition conditions\n(GSTCs) to model and analyze the angular dispersive properties of metasurfaces.\nBased on this theoretical framework, we demonstrate that a metasurface may\nexhibit either partial or complete co- and cross-polarized transmission and\nreflection coefficients that are angle-invariant, meaning that their amplitude,\nphase, or both remain unchanged with varying incidence angles. We show that\nthese angle-independent responses exist only when specific conditions, given in\nterms of the metasurface effective susceptibilities, are met. Using the GSTCs\nformalism, we derive several of these conditions and illustrate their\nscattering properties. Among other findings, this analysis reveals that,\ncontrary to common assumptions, nonlocality (spatial dispersion) does not only\nincrease the angular dispersion of a metasurface, but may also be used to\nachieve complete angle-invariant scattering. Additionally, this work\ndemonstrates that fully efficient extrinsic chirality is possible with a\npseudochiral metasurface in a partially angle-invariant fashion.

An empirical regression for the electron\npressure gradient scale length, $\\lambda_{p_{e}}$, against a turbulence control\nparameter, $\\alpha_{t}$, and the poloidal fluid gyroradius, $\\rho_{s,p}$, for\nH-modes is constructed and found to require positive exponents for both\nregression parameters, indicating turbulence widening of near-SOL widths at\nhigh $\\alpha_{t}$ and an inverse scaling with $B_{p}$, consistent with results\non AUG. The SepOS model is also tested in the unfavorable drift direction and\nfound to apply well to all three boundaries, including the L-H transition as\nlong as a correction to the Reynolds energy transfer term, $\\alpha_\\mathrm{RS}\n< 1$ is applied. I-modes typically exist in the unfavorable drift direction for\nvalues of $\\alpha_{t} \\lesssim 0.35$. Finally, an experiment studying the\ntransition between the type-I ELMy and EDA H-mode is analyzed using the same\nframework. It is found that a recently identified boundary at $\\alpha_{t} =\n0.55$ excludes most EDA H-modes but that the balance of wavenumbers responsible\nfor the L-mode density limit, namely $k_\\mathrm{EM} = k_\\mathrm{RBM}$, may\nbetter describe the transition on C-Mod. The ensemble of boundaries validated\nand explored is then applied to project regime access and limit avoidance for\nthe SPARC primary reference discharge parameters.",

    "abstract": "Biometric systems are widely used for identity verification and\nidentification, including authentication (i.e., one-to-one matching to verify a\nclaimed identity) and identification (i.e., one-to-many matching to find a\nsubject in a database). The matching process relies on measuring similarities\nor dissimilarities between a fresh biometric template and enrolled templates.\nThe False Match Rate FMR is a key metric for assessing the accuracy and\nreliability of such systems. This paper analyzes biometric systems based on\ntheir FMR, with two main contributions. First, we explore untargeted attacks,\nwhere an adversary aims to impersonate any user within a database. We determine\nthe number of trials required for an attacker to successfully impersonate a\nuser and derive the critical population size (i.e., the maximum number of users\nin the database) required to maintain a given level of security. Furthermore,\nwe compute the critical FMR value needed to ensure resistance against\nuntargeted attacks as the database size increases. Second, we revisit the\nbiometric birthday problem to evaluate the approximate and exact probabilities\nthat two users in a database collide (i.e., can impersonate each other). Based\non this analysis, we derive both the approximate critical population size and\nthe critical FMR value needed to bound the likelihood of such collisions\noccurring with a given probability. These thresholds offer insights for\ndesigning systems that mitigate the risk of impersonation and collisions,\nparticularly in large-scale biometric databases. Our findings indicate that\ncurrent biometric systems fail to deliver sufficient accuracy to achieve an\nadequate security level against untargeted attacks, even in small-scale\ndatabases. Moreover, state-of-the-art systems face significant challenges in\naddressing the biometric birthday problem, especially as database sizes grow.",

Within the framework, we\nfurther introduce IOL with ridge regularization (-R) and IOL with forward\nregularization (-F). -R generates stepwise incremental updates without\nretrospective retraining and avoids catastrophic forgetting.

Reservoir computing presents an\nalternative, in which a recurrent layer is not trained, but rather has a set of\nfixed, sparse recurrent weights. The weights are scaled to produce stable\ndynamical behavior such that the reservoir state contains a high-dimensional,\nnonlinear impulse response function of the inputs. An output decoder network\ncan then be used to map the compressive history represented by the reservoir's\nstate to any outputs, including agent actions or predictions. In this study, we\nfind that reservoir computing greatly simplifies and speeds up reinforcement\nlearning on memory tasks by (1) eliminating the need for backpropagation of\ngradients through time, (2) presenting all recent history simultaneously to the\ndownstream network, and (3) performing many useful and generic nonlinear\ncomputations upstream from the trained modules.

One of the primary downsides of CNNs is that they work as a\n``black box\", where the user cannot necessarily know how the image data are\nanalyzed, and therefore needs to rely on empirical evaluation to test the\nefficacy of a trained CNN. This can lead to hidden biases that affect the\nperformance evaluation of neural networks, but are difficult to identify. Here\nwe discuss examples of such hidden biases in common and widely used benchmark\ndatasets, and propose techniques for identifying dataset biases that can affect\nthe standard performance evaluation metrics. One effective approach to identify\ndataset bias is to perform image classification by using merely blank\nbackground parts of the original images. However, in some situations a blank\nbackground in the images is not available, making it more difficult to separate\nforeground or contextual information from the bias. To overcome this, we\npropose a method to identify dataset bias without the need to crop background\ninformation from the images. That method is based on applying several image\ntransforms to the original images, including Fourier transform, wavelet\ntransforms, median filter, and their combinations. These transforms were\napplied to recover background bias information that CNNs use to classify\nimages. This transformations affect the contextual visual information in a\ndifferent manner than it affects the systemic background bias. Therefore, the\nmethod can distinguish between contextual information and the bias, and alert\non the presence of background bias even without the need to separate sub-images\nparts from the blank background of the original images.

We describe abstract frameworks for\nlinear elasticity, elasticity-perfect plasticity and elasticity-hardening\nplasticity in terms of adjoint linear operators and convert them to equivalent\nformulations in terms of differential inclusions (the sweeping process in\nparticular). Within such frameworks we consider several manually solvable\nexamples of discrete and continuous models. Despite their simplicity, the\nexamples show how for discrete models with perfect plasticity it is possible to\nfind the evolution of stress and strain (elongation), yet continuum models\nwithin the same framework may not possess a function-valued strain. Although\nsome examples with such phenomenon are already known, we demonstrate that it\nmay appear due to displacement loading. The central idea of the paper is to\nexplain the loss of strain regularity in the dual formulation by the lack of\nadditivity of the normal cones and the failure of Slater's constraint\nqualification.\n  In contrast to perfect plasticity, models with hardening are known to be\nwell-solvable for strains. We show that more advanced constraint qualifications\ncan help to distinguish between those cases and, in the case of hardening,\nensure the additivity of the normal cones, which means the existence of a\nfunction-valued strain rate.",

We\nshow that if $\\frac{2}{r} + \\frac{3}{s} < \\frac{3}{2}-\\frac{1}{2r}$, then for a\nBaire generic datum $u_0 \\in L^2_\\sigma$, no weak solution $u^\\nu$ belongs to\n$L^r(0,\\infty;X)$.

We consider a model featuring a massive dark\nphoton that mediates DM self-interactions and decays into massless dark\nfermions. The dark photon and dark fermions suppress linear matter\nperturbations, resulting in dark acoustic oscillations in $P(k)$, which\nultimately affect dwarf galaxy scales. The model also features a\nvelocity-dependent elastic self-interaction between DM particles (SIDM), with a\ncross section that can alleviate small-scale structure anomalies. For the first\ntime, our simulations test the impact of $P(k)$ suppression on gravothermal\nevolution in an SIDM scenario that leads to core collapse in (sub)halos with\npresent-day virial masses below $\\approx 10^9~M_{\\mathrm{\\odot}}$. In\nsimulations with $P(k)$ suppression and self-interactions, the lack of low-mass\n(sub)halos and the delayed growth of structure reduce the fraction of\ncore-collapsed systems relative to SIDM simulations without $P(k)$ suppression.\nIn particular, $P(k)$ suppression that saturates current warm DM constraints\nalmost entirely erases core collapse in isolated halos. Models with less\nextreme $P(k)$ suppression produce core collapse in $\\approx 20\\%$ of subhalos\nand $\\approx 5\\%$ of isolated halos above $10^8~M_{\\mathrm{\\odot}}$, and also\nincrease the abundance of extremely low-concentration isolated low-mass halos\nrelative to SIDM.

We find that 36% of Type\nII (down-bending) disks exhibit U-shaped color profiles with a minimum at or\nnear the disk break. In contrast, no Type I (single-exponential) disks and only\n9% of Type III (up-bending) disks show such a profile. The presence of U-shaped\ncolor profiles in Type II disks likely arises from the interplay between a\nstar-formation threshold and spiral- or bar-driven secular radial migration of\nolder stars outward. The fraction of Type II disks exhibiting a U-shaped color\nprofile remains almost consistent across two redshift bins, $z=1$-$2$ and\n$z=2$-$3$, but is significantly lower than that observed in the local Universe,\nlikely because the secular process of radial migration at high redshift may not\nhave had sufficient time to significantly influence the disk structure. The\nabsence of U-shaped color profiles in Type II disks could point to rapid rather\nthan secular radial star migration potentially caused by violent clump\ninstabilities, transporting both younger and older stars to the outer disk.

By integrating these advancements, VidTok achieves\nsubstantial improvements over existing methods, demonstrating superior\nperformance across multiple metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and FVD,\nunder standardized evaluation settings.",

In\ncontrast, we propose CondiMen, a method that outputs a joint parametric\ndistribution over likely poses, body shapes, intrinsics and distances to the\ncamera, using a Bayesian network. This approach offers several advantages.\nFirst, a probability distribution can handle some inherent ambiguities of this\ntask -- such as the uncertainty between a person's size and their distance to\nthe camera, or simply the loss of information when projecting 3D data onto the\n2D image plane. Second, the output distribution can be combined with additional\ninformation to produce better predictions, by using e.g. known camera or body\nshape parameters, or by exploiting multi-view observations. Third, one can\nefficiently extract the most likely predictions from the output distribution,\nmaking our proposed approach suitable for real-time applications. Empirically\nwe find that our model i) achieves performance on par with or better than the\nstate-of-the-art, ii) captures uncertainties and correlations inherent in pose\nestimation and iii) can exploit additional information at test time, such as\nmulti-view consistency or body shape priors.

However, less is known\nabout deeper neural networks, which exhibit substantially stronger capabilities\nin practice. In addition, the complexity of the discrete variant of the problem\n(D-NNT in short), in which the parameters are taken from a given finite set of\noptions, has remained less explored despite its theoretical and practical\nsignificance.\n  In this work, we show that the hardness of NNT is dramatically affected by\nthe network depth. Specifically, we show that, under standard complexity\nassumptions, D-NNT is not in the complexity class NP even for instances with\nfixed dimensions and dataset size, having a deep architecture. This separates\nD-NNT from any NP-complete problem. Furthermore, using a polynomial reduction\nwe show that the above result also holds for C-NNT, albeit with more structured\ninstances. We complement these results with a comprehensive list of NP-hardness\nlower bounds for D-NNT on two-layer networks, showing that fixing the number of\ndimensions, the dataset size, or the number of neurons in the hidden layer\nleaves the problem challenging.

This setting arises in flight planning, where air traffic control (ATC)\nauthorities are enforcing a set of traffic flow restrictions (TFRs) on aircraft\nroutes in order to increase safety and throughput. We propose a new branch and\nbound-based algorithm for the LCSPP. The resulting algorithm has three main\ndegrees of freedom: the node selection rule, the branching rule and the\nconflict. While node selection and branching rules have been long studied in\nthe MIP and SAT communities, most of them cannot be applied out of the box for\nthe LCSPP. We review the existing literature and develop tailored variants of\nthe most prominent rules. The conflict, the set of variables to which the\nbranching rule is applied, is unique to the LCSPP. We analyze its theoretical\nimpact on the B&B algorithm. In the second part of the paper, we show how to\nmodel the flight planning problem with TFRs as an LCSPP and solve it using the\nbranch and bound algorithm.

In recent\nyears, there has been a push to move these links to an Ethernet-based packet\nnetwork topology, leveraging existing standards and ongoing research for\nTime-Sensitive Networking (TSN).

To counter this, we design a\nMachine Learning (ML)-based monitoring solution capable of detecting various\nmalicious attacks with over 97.5% accuracy.",

For example, in a\nsmall-gap Dirac material the Berry curvature is strongly peaked, but cancels\nover the full Brillouin zone, while in semimetals and in nodal superconductors\nthere may be a lower-dimensional winding topology associated to the nodes.\nExperimentally, it is difficult to directly observe such topology. We consider\ngeneral bulk Hamiltonians with nodes and chiral symmetry, extending to them the\nmethod developed in Dutreix et al.

We apply our method to nodal superconductors in\n2d, in presence of a (non)magnetic impurity, measured by standard or\nspin-polarized STM tip. We derive general conditions on the impurity scattering\nand on the STM tip, expressed in terms of their preference among the two\nchiralities, for when the measurement near the impurity captures the winding\ndifference between any chosen pair of (Bogoliubon) Dirac cones. We emphasize\nthe robustness of observing vortices in momentum space, in contrast to\ndislocations in real space, in STM data. Testing the conditions on the\ntopological nodal superconductor proposed for monolayer NbSe2 under an in-plane\nmagnetic field, we find that spin-polarized STM on a magnetic impurity can\ndetect the winding of each of the 12 nodes.

However, most\nexisting DA methods are designed for scenarios where the source and target\ndomain data lie within the same feature space, which limits their applicability\nin real-world situations. Recently, heterogeneous DA (HeDA) methods have been\nintroduced to address the challenges posed by heterogeneous feature space\nbetween source and target domains. Despite their successes, current HeDA\ntechniques fall short when there is a mismatch in both feature and label\nspaces. To address this, this paper explores a new DA scenario called open-set\nHeDA (OSHeDA). In OSHeDA, the model must not only handle heterogeneity in\nfeature space but also identify samples belonging to novel classes. To tackle\nthis challenge, we first develop a novel theoretical framework that constructs\nlearning bounds for prediction error on target domain. Guided by this\nframework, we propose a new DA method called Representation Learning for OSHeDA\n(RL-OSHeDA). This method is designed to simultaneously transfer knowledge\nbetween heterogeneous data sources and identify novel classes. Experiments\nacross text, image, and clinical data demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nalgorithm. Model implementation is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/pth1993/OSHeDA}.",

However, asymptotic analysis alone\ncannot support a credible claim of quantum advantage. Here, we highlight the\nchallenges involved in benchmarking quantum and classical heuristics for\ncombinatorial optimization (CO), with a focus on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\nproblem. Whereas hope remains that a quadratic quantum advantage is\npossible,our numerical analysis casts doubt on the idea that current methods\nexhibit any quantum advantage at all. This doubt arises because even a simple\nclassical approach can match with quantum methods we investigated. We conclude\nthat more careful numerical investigations are needed to evaluate the potential\nfor quantum advantage in CO, and we give some possible future directions for\nsuch investigations.",

In some areas, like Baltimore, Maryland, there are only few regulatory\n(reference) devices but multiple low-cost networks. While there are many\navailable methods to calibrate data from each network individually, separate\ncalibration of each network leads to conflicting air quality predictions. We\ndevelop a general Bayesian spatial filtering model combining data from multiple\nnetworks and reference devices, providing dynamic calibrations (informed by the\nlatest reference data) and unified predictions (combining information from all\navailable sensors) for the entire region. This method accounts for\nnetwork-specific bias and noise (observation models), as different networks can\nuse different types of sensors, and uses a Gaussian process (state-space model)\nto capture spatial correlations. We apply the method to calibrate PM$_{2.5}$\ndata from Baltimore in June and July 2023 -- a period including days of\nhazardous concentrations due to wildfire smoke. Our method helps mitigate the\neffects of preferential sampling of one network in Baltimore, results in better\npredictions and narrower confidence intervals.

The model processes frequency-domain\nrepresentations of EEG signals, such as spectrograms, as image data to capture\nlong-range dependencies and complex patterns in the signal. The model\ndemonstrates high performance with an accuracy of 97% without requiring\nintensive data preprocessing, thus rendering it suitable for real-time clinical\napplications on a large scale.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive\nversatility across various tasks. To eliminate their hallucinations,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach,\nleveraging external knowledge sources like knowledge graphs (KGs). In this\npaper, we study the task of KG-driven RAG and propose a novel Similar Graph\nEnhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SimGRAG) method. It effectively\naddresses the challenge of aligning query texts and KG structures through a\ntwo-stage process: (1) query-to-pattern, which uses an LLM to transform queries\ninto a desired graph pattern, and (2) pattern-to-subgraph, which quantifies the\nalignment between the pattern and candidate subgraphs using a graph semantic\ndistance (GSD) metric. We also develop an optimized retrieval algorithm that\nefficiently identifies the top-k subgraphs within 1-second on a\n10-million-scale KG. Extensive experiments show that SimGRAG outperforms\nstate-of-the-art KG-driven RAG methods in both question answering and fact\nverification.

The generalized\nrobustness is one such quantifier, and enjoys an operational interpretation in\nthe setting of channel discrimination. It is a well studied resource monotone\nin finite-dimensional or convex resource theories, however as of yet it has not\nbeen studied in the setting of infinite-dimensional resource theories with a\nnon-convex set of free states. In this work, we define the generalized\nrobustness for an arbitrary resource theory, without restricting to convex sets\nor to finite dimensions.

Secondly, in many relevant theories, it quantifies\nthe worst-case advantage in single-copy channel discrimination when considering\na decomposition of the free states into convex subsets. Finally, we apply our\nresults to the resource theory of non-Gaussianity, thus showing that all\nnon-Gaussian states can provide an advantage in some channel discrimination\ntask, even those that are simply mixtures of Gaussian states.

Specifically, measuring the elbow\njoint space in ultrasound images is used to assess the valgus instability of\nthe elbow caused by UCL injuries. To automate this measurement, a model trained\non a precisely annotated dataset is necessary; however, no publicly available\ndataset exists to date. This study introduces a novel ultrasound medial elbow\ndataset to measure the joint space. The dataset comprises 4,201 medial elbow\nultrasound images from 22 subjects, with landmark annotations on the humerus\nand ulna, based on the expertise of three orthopedic surgeons. We evaluated\njoint space measurement methods on our proposed dataset using heatmap-based,\nregression-based, and token-based landmark detection methods. While\nheatmap-based landmark detection methods generally achieve high accuracy, they\nsometimes produce multiple peaks on a heatmap, leading to incorrect detection.\nTo mitigate this issue and enhance landmark localization, we propose Shape\nSubspace (SS) landmark refinement by measuring geometrical similarities between\nthe detected and reference landmark positions. The results show that the mean\njoint space measurement error is 0.116 mm when using HRNet. Furthermore, SS\nlandmark refinement can reduce the mean absolute error of landmark positions by\n0.010 mm with HRNet and by 0.103 mm with ViTPose on average. These highlight\nthe potential for high-precision, real-time diagnosis of UCL injuries by\naccurately measuring joint space.

Accurate detection of\nsarcasm aids in identifying and filtering undesirable information on the\nInternet, thereby reducing malicious defamation and rumor-mongering.\nNonetheless, the task of automatic sarcasm detection remains highly challenging\nfor machines, as it critically depends on intricate factors such as relational\ncontext. Most existing multimodal sarcasm detection methods focus on\nintroducing graph structures to establish entity relationships between text and\nimages while neglecting to learn the relational context between text and\nimages, which is crucial evidence for understanding the meaning of sarcasm. In\naddition, the meaning of sarcasm changes with the evolution of different\ncontexts, but existing methods may not be accurate in modeling such dynamic\nchanges, limiting the generalization ability of the models. To address the\nabove issues, we propose a relational context learning and multiplex fusion\nnetwork (RCLMuFN) for multimodal sarcasm detection. Firstly, we employ four\nfeature extractors to comprehensively extract features from raw text and\nimages, aiming to excavate potential features that may have been previously\noverlooked. Secondly, we utilize the relational context learning module to\nlearn the contextual information of text and images and capture the dynamic\nproperties through shallow and deep interactions. Finally, we employ a\nmultiplex feature fusion module to enhance the generalization of the model by\npenetratingly integrating multimodal features derived from various interaction\ncontexts.

We consider indeed a generalization of the\nclassical perimeter, what we call a nonlocal bi-axial discrete perimeter,\nwhere, not only the external boundary of a polyomino $\\mathcal{P}$ contributes\nto the perimeter, but all internal and external components of $\\mathcal{P}$.\nFurthermore, we find and characterize its minimizers in the class of\npolyominoes with fixed area $n$. Moreover, we explain how the solution of the\nnonlocal discrete isoperimetric problem is related to the rigorous study of the\nmetastable behavior of a long-range bi-axial Ising model.",

    "abstract": "Mixed-halide lead perovskites, with photoexcited charge-carrier properties\nsuitable for high-efficiency photovoltaics, hold significant promise for\nhigh-efficiency tandem solar cells. However, phase segregation under\nillumination, where an iodide-rich phase forms carrier trap states, remains a\nbarrier to applications. This study employs plunge-freeze cryogenic electron\nmicroscopy to visualize nanoscale phase segregation dynamics in CsPb(Br,I)\nfilms. By rapidly freezing the illuminated samples, we preserve transient\nphotoexcited ion distributions for high-resolution structural and compositional\nanalysis at the nanoscale. Cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy\ntechniques (EELS, 4D-STEM) captured the dynamics of photo-induced iodine\nmigration from grain boundaries to centers, identified the buildup of\nanisotropic strain, and captured the heterogeneous evolution of this process\nwithin a single grain. These findings provide new insights into microscopic\nphase segregation mechanisms and their dynamics, enhancing our understanding of\nmixed-halide perovskite photostability.",

    "abstract": "Despite empirical risk minimization (ERM) is widely applied in the machine\nlearning community, its performance is limited on data with spurious\ncorrelation or subpopulation that is introduced by hidden attributes. Existing\nliterature proposed techniques to maximize group-balanced or worst-group\naccuracy when such correlation presents, yet, at the cost of lower average\naccuracy. In addition, many existing works conduct surveys on different\nsubpopulation methods without revealing the inherent connection between these\nmethods, which could hinder the technology advancement in this area. In this\npaper, we identify important sampling as a simple yet powerful tool for solving\nthe subpopulation problem. On the theory side, we provide a new systematic\nformulation of the subpopulation problem and explicitly identify the\nassumptions that are not clearly stated in the existing works. This helps to\nuncover the cause of the dropped average accuracy. We provide the first\ntheoretical discussion on the connections of existing methods, revealing the\ncore components that make them different. On the application side, we\ndemonstrate a single estimator is enough to solve the subpopulation problem. In\nparticular, we introduce the estimator in both attribute-known and -unknown\nscenarios in the subpopulation setup, offering flexibility in practical use\ncases. And empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on commonly\nused benchmark datasets.",

    "abstract": "High-order entropy stable summation-by-parts (SBP) schemes are a class of\nrobust and accurate numerical methods for hyperbolic conservation laws that are\nnumerically stable at arbitrary order without the need for artificial\nstabilization. While SBP schemes are well-established on simplicial and\ntensor-product elements, they have not been extended to cut meshes. Cut meshes\nprovide a convenient and efficient means of mesh generation for domains with\nembedded boundaries but can be difficult to use due to their arbitrarily shaped\ncut elements. Using the skew-hybridized SBP formulation of Chan\n[\"Skew-symmetric entropy stable...\", JSC, 2019], we present a high-order\naccurate, entropy stable scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws on cut meshes.\nThe formulation requires positive/non-negative weight quadrature rules on cut\nelements, which we construct via explicit parameterizations, subtriangulations,\nand Caratheodory pruning. We numerically verify the accuracy and stability of\nour method using the shallow water and compressible Euler equations and note\npromising results for the use of state redistribution with entropy stable\nmethods.",

The practicality of this method\nis demonstrated by computing optimal performance bounds on several well-known\ncommunication tasks.

    "abstract": "As the Information Retrieval (IR) field increasingly recognizes the\nimportance of inclusivity, addressing the needs of low-resource languages\nremains a significant challenge. This paper introduces the first large-scale\nUrdu IR dataset, created by translating the MS MARCO dataset through machine\ntranslation. We establish baseline results through zero-shot learning for IR in\nUrdu and subsequently apply the mMARCO multilingual IR methodology to this\nnewly translated dataset. Our findings demonstrate that the fine-tuned model\n(Urdu-mT5-mMARCO) achieves a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@10) of 0.247 and a\nRecall@10 of 0.439, representing significant improvements over zero-shot\nresults and showing the potential for expanding IR access for Urdu speakers. By\nbridging access gaps for speakers of low-resource languages, this work not only\nadvances multilingual IR research but also emphasizes the ethical and societal\nimportance of inclusive IR technologies. This work provides valuable insights\ninto the challenges and solutions for improving language representation and\nlays the groundwork for future research, especially in South Asian languages,\nwhich can benefit from the adaptable methods used in this study.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based methods provide a promising approach to solving highly\nnon-linear control tasks that are often challenging for classical control\nmethods. To ensure the satisfaction of a safety property, learning-based\nmethods jointly learn a control policy together with a certificate function for\nthe property. Popular examples include barrier functions for safety and\nLyapunov functions for asymptotic stability. While there has been significant\nprogress on learning-based control with certificate functions in the white-box\nsetting, where the correctness of the certificate function can be formally\nverified, there has been little work on ensuring their reliability in the\nblack-box setting where the system dynamics are unknown. In this work, we\nconsider the problems of certifying and repairing neural network control\npolicies and certificate functions in the black-box setting. We propose a novel\nframework that utilizes runtime monitoring to detect system behaviors that\nviolate the property of interest under some initially trained neural network\npolicy and certificate. These violating behaviors are used to extract new\ntraining data, that is used to re-train the neural network policy and the\ncertificate function and to ultimately repair them. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach empirically by using it to repair and to boost\nthe safety rate of neural network policies learned by a state-of-the-art method\nfor learning-based control on two autonomous system control tasks.",

The predicted spectra exhibit\nnotable differences from those obtained using the commonly adopted Lang-Firsov\nmodels, with important implications for analyzing past and future experiments.\nOur results provide a deeper understanding of how RIXS probes $e$-ph\ninteractions and set the stage for a more realistic analysis of future\nexperiments.",

This complements results on exact encoding that\nmay be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account,\npossibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of\nthe spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as\nmay arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite\nperiods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of\na concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more\nsophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth\nmover's (Wassertein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.",

Finite element model updating can be computationally expensive for\ncomplex structures and surrogate models can be employed to reduce the\ncomputational burden. A novel approach for finite element model updating,\nnamely assembly-like, is proposed and validated using real experimental data.\nThe assembly-like model updating framework implies that the model is updated as\nparts are assembled. Benchmarking against the classical global, or one-shot,\napproach demonstrates that the proposed method is more computationally\nefficient since it takes 20% fewer iterations to obtain convergence, also using\nfewer parameters for the model evaluations.

    "abstract": "Many real-world decision-making problems in energy systems, transportation,\nand finance have uncertain parameters in their constraints. Wasserstein\ndistributionally robust joint chance constraints (WDRJCC) offer a promising\nsolution by explicitly guaranteeing the probability of the simultaneous\nsatisfaction of multiple constraints. WDRJCC are computationally demanding, and\nalthough manageable for small problems, practical applications often demand\nmore tractable approaches -- especially for large-scale and complex problems,\nsuch as power system unit commitment problems and multilevel problems with\nchance-constrained lower levels. To address this, this paper proposes a novel\ninner-approximation for a specific type of WDRJCC, namely WDRJCC with\nright-hand-side uncertainties (RHS-WDRJCC). We propose a Strengthened and\nFaster Linear Approximation (SFLA) by strengthening an existing convex\ninner-approximation that is equivalent to the worst-case conditional\nvalue-at-risk (W-CVaR) method under specific hyperparameters. This\nstrengthening process reduces the number of constraints and tightens the\nfeasible region for ancillary variables, leading to significant computational\nspeedup. Despite the tightening, we prove that the proposed SFLA does not\nintroduce additional conservativeness and can even lead to less\nconservativeness. The significance and superiority of the proposed SFLA are\nvalidated in two important real-world problems. In a power system unit\ncommitment problem, the proposed SFLA achieves up to 10x and on average 3.8x\ncomputational speedup compared to the strengthened and exact mixed-integer\nreformulation in finding comparable high-quality feasible solutions. In a\nbilevel strategic bidding problem where the exact reformulation is not\napplicable due to non-convexity, we show that the proposed SFLA can lead to 90x\nspeedup compared to existing convex approximation methods such as W-CVaR.",

Multi-wavelength coverage,\nspanning optical, UV, X-ray, and mid-infrared (MIR) bands, reveals a complex\nspectral energy distribution (SED) that includes MIR flaring indicative of dust\nechoes, suggesting a dust covering fraction consistent with typical TDEs.\nSpectral modeling indicates the presence of an extended, quiescent disk around\nthe central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a radius of\n$\\sim$$5.06^{+0.59}_{-0.77} \\times 10^4 \\; \\mathrm{R_g}$. The multi-component\nSED model, which includes a significant EUV component, suggests that the\nprimary emission from the TDE is reprocessed by this extended disk, producing\nthe observed optical and MIR features. The lack of strong AGN signatures in the\nhost galaxy, combined with the quiescent disk structure, highlights AT 2020nov\nas a rare example of a TDE occurring in a galaxy with a dormant but extended\npre-existing accretion structure.",

To accurately\npredict the behavior of such ultra-scaled devices, electron-electron (e-e)\ninteractions must be explicitly incorporated in their quantum transport\nsimulation. In this paper, we present an \\textit{ab initio} atomistic\nsimulation framework based on density functional theory, the non-equilibrium\nGreen's function formalism, and the self-consistent GW approximation to perform\nthis task. The implemented method is first validated with a carbon nanotube\ntest structure before being applied to calculate the transfer characteristics\nof a silicon nanowire MOSFET in a gate-all-around configuration. As a\nconsequence of e-e scattering, the energy and spatial distribution of the\ncarrier and current densities both significantly change, while the on-current\nof the transistor decreases owing to the Coulomb repulsion between the\nelectrons. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting bandgap modulation of\nthe nanowire channel as a function of the gate-to-source voltage could\npotentially improve the device performance. To the best of our knowledge, this\nstudy is the first one reporting large-scale atomistic quantum transport\nsimulations of nano-devices under non-equilibrium conditions and in the\npresence of e-e interactions within the GW approximation.",

On the other hand, existing\nclass-imbalanced learning methods in vision may overlook the rich graph\nsemantic substructures of the majority classes and excessively emphasize\nlearning from the minority classes. To address these challenges, we propose a\nsimple yet powerful approach called C$^3$GNN that integrates the idea of\nclustering into contrastive learning to enhance class-imbalanced graph\nclassification. Technically, C$^3$GNN clusters graphs from each majority class\ninto multiple subclasses, with sizes comparable to the minority class,\nmitigating class imbalance. It also employs the Mixup technique to generate\nsynthetic samples, enriching the semantic diversity of each subclass.\nFurthermore, supervised contrastive learning is used to hierarchically learn\neffective graph representations, enabling the model to thoroughly explore\nsemantic substructures in majority classes while avoiding excessive focus on\nminority classes.

In previous\nwork, a Bayesian framework was used to infer constitutive parameters from\nuniaxial stress-strain experiments on horse tendons, specifically the\nsuperficial digital flexor tendon (SDFT) and common digital extensor tendon\n(CDET), on a per-experiment basis. Here, we extend this analysis to investigate\nthe natural variation of these parameters across a population of horses. Using\na Bayesian mixed effects model, we infer population distributions of these\nparameters.

Avoiding ad hoc methods, we\nintroduce a hierarchical Bayesian data selection method. This two-stage\napproach selects data per experiment, and integrates data weightings into the\nBayesian mixed effects model. Our results indicate that the CDET is stiffer\nthan the SDFT, likely due to a higher collagen volume fraction. The modes of\nthe parameter distributions yield estimates of the product of the collagen\nvolume fraction and Young's modulus as 811.5 MPa for the SDFT and 1430.2 MPa\nfor the CDET.

    "abstract": "Among solar system objects, comets coming from the Oort Cloud are an elusive\npopulation, intrinsically rare and difficult to detect. Nonetheless, as the\nmore pristine objects we can observe, they encapsulate critical cues on the\nformation of planetary systems and are the focus of many scientific\ninvestigations and science missions. The Legacy Survey of Space and Time\n(LSST), which will start to operate from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in 2025,\nis expected to dramatically improve our detection ability of these comets by\nperforming regular monitoring of the Southern sky deep down to magnitude 24.5\nwith excellent astrometry. However, making straightforward predictions on\nfuture LSST detection rates is challenging due to our biased knowledge of the\nunderlying population. This is because identifications to date have been\nconducted by various surveys or individual observers, often without detailed\ninformation on their respective selection functions. Recent efforts to predict\nincoming flux of Long Period Comets still suffer of the lack of systematic,\nwell-characterized, homogeneous cometary surveys. Here, we adopt a different\npoint of view by asking how much earlier~on known comets on long-period or\nhyperbolic orbits would have been discovered by a LSST-like survey if it was\nalready in place 10 years prior to their perihelion epoch. In this case, we are\nnot simulating a real flux of incoming comet, as all comets in our sample reach\nthe perihelion simultaneously, but we can analyze the impact of a LSST-like\nsurvey on individual objects. We find that LSST would have found about 40% of\ncomets in our sample at least 5 years prior to their perihelion epoch, and at\ndouble (at least) the distance at which they were actually discovered. Based on\nthis approach, we find that LSST has the potentiality to at least twofold the\ncurrent discovery rate of long-period and hyperbolic comets.",

However, when\nemployed for object removal tasks, they still encounter issues such as\ngenerating random artifacts and the incapacity to repaint foreground object\nareas with appropriate content after remova1l. To tackle these problems, we\npropose Attentive Eraser, a tuning-free method to empower pre-trained diffusion\nmodels for stable and effective object removal. Firstly, in light of the\nobservation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape\ndetails of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and\nSuppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the\npre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the\nbackground over the foreground object during the reverse generation process.\nMoreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which\nutilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process,\neffectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously\ngenerating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate\nthe stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a\nvariety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based\nmethods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion\nmodel architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

Deep learning weather forecasting models trained with\nthe next state prediction objective on ERA5 have shown great success compared\nto numerical global circulation models. However, for a wide range of\napplications, being able to provide representative samples from the\ndistribution of possible future weather states is critical. In this paper, we\npropose a methodology to leverage deterministic weather models in the design of\nprobabilistic weather models, leading to improved performance and reduced\ncomputing costs. We first introduce \\textbf{ArchesWeather}, a transformer-based\ndeterministic model that improves upon Pangu-Weather by removing\noverrestrictive inductive priors. We then design a probabilistic weather model\ncalled \\textbf{ArchesWeatherGen} based on flow matching, a modern variant of\ndiffusion models, that is trained to project ArchesWeather's predictions to the\ndistribution of ERA5 weather states. ArchesWeatherGen is a true stochastic\nemulator of ERA5 and surpasses IFS ENS and NeuralGCM on all WeatherBench\nheadline variables (except for NeuralGCM's geopotential). Our work also aims to\ndemocratize the use of deterministic and generative machine learning models in\nweather forecasting research, with academic computing resources. All models are\ntrained at 1.5{\\deg} resolution, with a training budget of $\\sim$9 V100 days\nfor ArchesWeather and $\\sim$45 V100 days for ArchesWeatherGen.

In this\nstudy, we examine three Swiss energy policies, analyzing their impacts on both\nthe national energy system and the cross-border electricity flows.

The results indicate that a renewable\ngeneration target leads to a reduction in net imports and electricity prices.\nAdditionally, reduced market integration impacts both Swiss and European energy\ntransitions by limiting trade benefits, underutilizing Variable Renewable\nEnergy Sources (VRES), and increasing electricity supply costs. Lastly, we\nobserve that limiting Swiss winter imports adversely affects electricity\ntrading, driving up both supply costs and electricity prices.",

    "abstract": "Endpoint dilution (TCID50) assays cannot count the number of infectious\nvirions (IVs), and instead are limited to counting the number of Specific\nINfections caused by the sample (SIN). The latter depends not only on whether\nvirions are infectious, but also on the cells and the experimental conditions\nunder which they interact. These interactions are random and controlled by\nparameters such as the rates at which IVs lose infectivity, enter cells, or\nfail to replicate following cell entry. Here, stochastic TCID50 assays are\nsimulated to determine how the random number of infected wells relates to the\nparameters and the number of IVs in a sample. We introduce a new parameter\nestimation method based on the likelihood of observing a given TCID50 assay\noutcome given the model-predicted number of IVs in the sample. We then\nsuccessively evaluate how parameter estimates are affected by the use of: 1)\nthe new likelihood function vs the typical assumption of Gaussian-distributed\nmeasurement errors; 2) IV vs SIN units to express virus in the model; and 3) a\nstochastic vs an ODE model to simulate the course of a virus infection. Unlike\nprevious methods, the new likelihood correctly handles measurements beyond the\ndetection limits, and results in non-Gaussian distributions. Expressing virus\nusing IV units makes it possible to impose physical constraints (e.g. one IV\ncannot infect more than one cell), and yields more biologically useful\nparameters (e.g. mutation emergence likelihood depends on the number of IVs,\nnot SIN, produced). Using a stochastic rather than an ODE model we show that\nthe variability observed between replicate in vitro virus infections is\nconsistent with the level of stochasticity introduced by the TCID50 assay,\nwhich can be reduced through better assay design. The framework introduced\nherein offers several important improvements over current methods and should be\nwidely adopted.",

An alternative is on-the-fly\nsample reweighting during the training process to decrease the negative impact\nof incorrect or ambiguous labels, but this typically requires clean seed data.\nIn this work we propose unsupervised on-the-fly meta loss rescaling to reweight\ntraining samples. Crucially, we rely only on features provided by the model\nbeing trained, to learn a rescaling function in real time without knowledge of\nthe true clean data distribution. We achieve this via a novel meta learning\nsetup that samples validation data for the meta update directly from the noisy\ntraining corpus by employing the rescaling function being trained.

Our strategy is robust in the face of\nnoisy and clean data, handles class imbalance, and prevents overfitting to\nnoisy labels.

As models are becoming larger to capture more complex capabilities,\ntheir computational demands increase, as shown by recent scaling laws.\nTherefore, continuing with the current architectures will present a\ncomputational roadblock. To address this gap, we propose Mixture-of-Denoising\nExperts (MoDE) as a novel policy for Imitation Learning. MoDE surpasses current\nstate-of-the-art Transformer-based Diffusion Policies while enabling\nparameter-efficient scaling through sparse experts and noise-conditioned\nrouting, reducing both active parameters by 40% and inference costs by 90% via\nexpert caching. Our architecture combines this efficient scaling with\nnoise-conditioned self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective denoising\nacross different noise levels. MoDE achieves state-of-the-art performance on\n134 tasks in four established imitation learning benchmarks (CALVIN and\nLIBERO).

    "abstract": "Early detection of illnesses and pest infestations in fruit cultivation is\ncritical for maintaining yield quality and plant health. Computer vision and\nrobotics are increasingly employed for the automatic detection of such issues,\nparticularly using data-driven solutions. However, the rarity of these problems\nmakes acquiring and processing the necessary data to train such algorithms a\nsignificant obstacle. One solution to this scarcity is the generation of\nsynthetic high-quality anomalous samples. While numerous methods exist for this\ntask, most require highly trained individuals for setup.\n  This work addresses the challenge of generating synthetic anomalies in an\nautomatic fashion that requires only an initial collection of normal and\nanomalous samples from the user - a task that is straightforward for farmers.\nWe demonstrate the approach in the context of table grape cultivation.\nSpecifically, based on the observation that normal berries present relatively\nsmooth surfaces, while defects result in more complex textures, we introduce a\nDual-Canny Edge Detection (DCED) filter. This filter emphasizes the additional\ntexture indicative of diseases, pest infestations, or other defects. Using\nsegmentation masks provided by the Segment Anything Model, we then select and\nseamlessly blend anomalous berries onto normal ones. We show that the proposed\ndataset augmentation technique improves the accuracy of an anomaly classifier\nfor table grapes and that the approach can be generalized to other fruit types.",

    "abstract": "How emotions are expressed depends on the context and domain. On X (formerly\nTwitter), for instance, an author might simply use the hashtag #anger, while in\na news headline, emotions are typically written in a more polite, indirect\nmanner. To enable conditional text generation models to create emotionally\nconnotated texts that fit a domain, users need to have access to a parameter\nthat allows them to choose the appropriate way to express an emotion. To\nachieve this, we introduce MOPO, a Multi-Objective Prompt Optimization\nmethodology. MOPO optimizes prompts according to multiple objectives (which\ncorrespond here to the output probabilities assigned by emotion classifiers\ntrained for different domains). In contrast to single objective optimization,\nMOPO outputs a set of prompts, each with a different weighting of the multiple\nobjectives. Users can then choose the most appropriate prompt for their\ncontext. We evaluate MOPO using three objectives, determined by various\ndomain-specific emotion classifiers. MOPO improves performance by up to 15 pp\nacross all objectives with a minimal loss (1-2 pp) for any single objective\ncompared to single-objective optimization. These minor performance losses are\noffset by a broader generalization across multiple objectives - which is not\npossible with single-objective optimization. Additionally, MOPO reduces\ncomputational requirements by simultaneously optimizing for multiple\nobjectives, eliminating separate optimization procedures for each objective.",

We identified 27 eligible articles suggesting 24 alternative\nmeta-analysis models based on long-tail and skewed distributions, on mixtures\nof distributions, and on Dirichlet process priors. Subsequently, we performed a\nsimulation study to evaluate the performance of these models and to compare\nthem with the standard normal model. We considered 22 scenarios varying the\namount of between-study variance, the shape of the true distribution, and the\nnumber of included studies. We compared 15 models implemented in the\nFrequentist or in the Bayesian framework. We found small differences with\nrespect to bias between the different models but larger differences in the\nlevel of coverage probability. In scenarios with large between-study variance,\nall models were substantially biased in the estimation of the mean treatment\neffect.

    "abstract": "Traditional CMOS sensors suffer from restricted dynamic range and sub optimal\nperformance under extreme lighting conditions. They are affected by electronic\nnoise in low light conditions and pixel saturation while capturing high\nillumination. Recent High Dynamic Range (HDR) Imaging methods, often designed\nfor CMOS Sensors, attempt to address these issues by fusing multiple exposures.\nHowever, they frequently introduce artifacts like ghosting and light flickering\nin dynamic scenarios and non-uniform signal-to-noise ratio in extreme dynamic\nrange conditions. Recently, Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs), also known\nas Single Photon Camera (SPC) sensors, have surpassed CMOS sensors due to their\ncapability to capture individual photons with high timing precision. Unlike\ntraditional digital cameras that first convert light energy into analog\nelectrical currents and then digitize them, SPAD sensors perform direct photon\ndetection, making them less susceptible to extreme illumination conditions.\nTheir distinctive non-linear response curve aids in capturing photons across\nboth low-light and high-illumination environments, making them particularly\neffective for High Dynamic Range Imaging. Despite their advantages, images from\nSPAD Sensors are often noisy and visually unappealing. To address these\nchallenges, we evaluate state-of-the-art architectures for converting\nmonochromatic SPAD images into Color HDR images at various resolutions.

This\nthesis serves as a comprehensive guide that elucidates a multi-faceted approach\nfor empowering LLMs with the capability to leverage Application Programming\nInterfaces (APIs). We present a 7-step methodology that begins with the\nselection of suitable LLMs and the task decomposition that is necessary for\ncomplex problem-solving. This methodology includes techniques for generating\ntraining data for API interactions and heuristics for selecting the appropriate\nAPI among a plethora of options. These steps eventually lead to the generation\nof API calls that are both syntactically and semantically aligned with the\nLLM's understanding of a given task. Moreover, we review existing frameworks\nand tools that facilitate these processes and highlight the gaps in current\nattempts. In this direction, we propose an on-device architecture that aims to\nexploit the functionality of carry-on devices by using small models from the\nHugging Face community. We examine the effectiveness of these approaches on\nreal-world applications of various domains, including the generation of a piano\nsheet.

In this paper, we experimentally\nanalyze that existing transformer-based MTM methods encounter with two\nunder-explored issues when dealing with time series data: (1) they encode\nfeatures by performing long-dependency ensemble averaging, which easily results\nin rank collapse and feature homogenization as the layer goes deeper; (2) they\nexhibit distinct priorities in fitting different frequency components contained\nin the time-series, inevitably leading to spectrum energy imbalance of encoded\nfeature. To tackle these issues, we propose an auxiliary content-aware balanced\ndecoder (CBD) to optimize the encoding quality in the spectrum space within\nmasked modeling scheme. Specifically, the CBD iterates on a series of\nfundamental blocks, and thanks to two tailored units, each block could\nprogressively refine the masked representation via adjusting the interaction\npattern based on local content variations of time-series and learning to\nrecalibrate the energy distribution across different frequency components.\nMoreover, a dual-constraint loss is devised to enhance the mutual optimization\nof vanilla decoder and our CBD. Extensive experimental results on ten\ntime-series classification datasets show that our method nearly surpasses a\nbunch of baselines. Meanwhile, a series of explanatory results are showcased to\nsufficiently demystify the behaviors of our method.",

The central challenge of text sanitization is to\nstrike a balance between privacy protection (avoiding the leakage of personal\ninformation) and utility preservation (retaining as much as possible of the\ndocument's original content). To this end, we introduce a novel text\nsanitization method based on generalizations, that is, broader but still\ninformative terms that subsume the semantic content of the original text spans.\nThe approach relies on the use of instruction-tuned large language models\n(LLMs) and is divided into two stages. Given a document including text spans\nexpressing personally identifiable information (PII), the LLM is first applied\nto obtain truth-preserving replacement candidates for each text span and rank\nthose according to their abstraction level. Those candidates are then evaluated\nfor their ability to protect privacy by conducting inference attacks with the\nLLM. Finally, the system selects the most informative replacement candidate\nshown to be resistant to those attacks. This two-stage process produces\nreplacements that effectively balance privacy and utility.\n  We also present novel metrics to evaluate these two aspects without needing\nto manually annotate documents. Results on the Text Anonymization Benchmark\nshow that the proposed approach, implemented with Mistral 7B Instruct, leads to\nenhanced utility, with only a marginal (< 1 p.p.) increase in re-identification\nrisk compared to fully suppressing the original spans.

The approach provides a rigorous yet\nstraightforward method to define and implement prediction-based control barrier\nfunctions for complex dynamical systems to ensure safety with bounded inputs.\nThis is accomplished by introducing a prediction-based term into the CBF that\nallows for the required margin needed to null the CBF rate of change given the\nspecified input constraints.

In this work, we introduce BOIDS, a novel\nhigh-dimensional BO algorithm that guides optimization by a sequence of\none-dimensional direction lines using a novel tailored line-based optimization\nprocedure. To improve the efficiency, we also propose an adaptive selection\ntechnique to identify most optimal lines for each round of line-based\noptimization.

Node representation\nlearning for signed graphs is a well-studied task with important applications\nsuch as sign prediction.

We propose a novel\nmessage-passing layer architecture called Graph Spring Network (GSN) modeled\nafter spring forces.

Once the dynamics is learned, embedding\ngeneration for novel datasets is done by solving the ODEs in time using a\nnumerical integration scheme. Our GSN layer leverages the fast-to-compute edge\nvector directions and learnable scalar functions that only depend on nodes'\ndistances in latent space to compute the nodes' positions. Conversely, Graph\nConvolution and Graph Attention Network layers rely on learnable vector\nfunctions that require the full positions of input nodes in latent space.

    "abstract": "Sidorenko's conjecture states that the number of copies of any given\nbipartite graph in another graph of given density is asymptotically minimized\nby a random graph. The forcing conjecture further strengthens this, claiming\nthat any minimizer in fact needs to be quasi-random. Here we extend the family\nof bipartite graphs for which the forcing conjecture is known to hold to\ninclude balanced blow-ups of Sidorenko graphs and subdivisions of Sidorenko\ngraphs by a forcing graph. This partially generalizes results by Conlon et al.\n(2018) and Conlon and Lee (2021). We also show that the box product of a\nSidorenko graph with an edge is forcing, partially generalizing results of Kim,\nLee, and Lee (2016) and, in particular, showing that cubes are forcing. We\nachieve these results through algebraic arguments building on Razborov's flag\nalgebra framework (2007). This approach additionally allows us to construct\nSidorenko hypergraphs from known 2-uniform Sidorenko graphs and to study\nforcing pairs.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new design method for a stochastic control policy using\na normalizing flow (NF). In reinforcement learning (RL), the policy is usually\nmodeled as a distribution model with trainable parameters. When this\nparameterization has less expressiveness, it would fail to acquiring the\noptimal policy. A mixture model has capability of a universal approximation,\nbut it with too much redundancy increases the computational cost, which can\nbecome a bottleneck when considering the use of real-time robot control. As\nanother approach, NF, which is with additional parameters for invertible\ntransformation from a simple stochastic model as a base, is expected to exert\nhigh expressiveness and lower computational cost. However, NF cannot compute\nits mean analytically due to complexity of the invertible transformation, and\nit lacks reliability because it retains stochastic behaviors after deployment\nfor robot controller. This paper therefore designs a restricted NF (RNF) that\nachieves an analytic mean by appropriately restricting the invertible\ntransformation. In addition, the expressiveness impaired by this restriction is\nregained using bimodal student-t distribution as its base, so-called Bit-RNF.\nIn RL benchmarks, Bit-RNF policy outperformed the previous models. Finally, a\nreal robot experiment demonstrated the applicability of Bit-RNF policy to real\nworld. The attached video is uploaded on youtube: https://youtu.be/R_GJVZDW9bk",

Previous methods often employ a\nsimple voting strategy to diminish such label uncertainty or impose a strong\nassumption of labels with a pre-defined distribution, e.g., Gaussian. In this\nwork, we unveil that the segment anything model (SAM) provides strong prior\nknowledge to model the uncertainty in edge labels. Our key insight is that the\nintermediate SAM features inherently correspond to object edges at various\ngranularities, which reflects different edge options due to uncertainty.\nTherefore, we attempt to align uncertainty with granularity by regressing\nintermediate SAM features from different layers to object edges at\nmulti-granularity levels. In doing so, the model can fully and explicitly\nexplore diverse ``uncertainties'' in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we\ninject a lightweight module (~ 1.5% additional parameters) into the frozen SAM\nto progressively fuse and adapt its intermediate features to estimate edges\nfrom coarse to fine. It is crucial to normalize the granularity level of human\nedge labels to match their innate uncertainty. For this, we simply perform\nlinear blending to the real edge labels at hand to create pseudo labels with\nvarying granularities. Consequently, our uncertainty-aligned edge detector can\nflexibly produce edges at any desired granularity (including an optimal one).\nThanks to SAM, our model uniquely demonstrates strong generalizability for\ncross-dataset edge detection.

To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose an effective\nsolution, named Suppressing Uncertainty in Gaze Estimation (SUGE), which\nintroduces a novel triplet-label consistency measurement to estimate and reduce\nthe uncertainties. Specifically, for each training sample, we propose to\nestimate a novel ``neighboring label'' calculated by a linearly weighted\nprojection from the neighbors to capture the similarity relationship between\nimage features and their corresponding labels, which can be incorporated with\nthe predicted pseudo label and ground-truth label for uncertainty estimation.\nBy modeling such triplet-label consistency, we can measure the qualities of\nboth images and labels, and further largely reduce the negative effects of\nunqualified images and wrong labels through our designed sample weighting and\nlabel correction strategies.

To the best of our knowledge,\nArtAug is the first one that improves image synthesis models via model\ninteractions with understanding models. In the interactions, we leverage human\npreferences implicitly learned by image understanding models to provide\nfine-grained suggestions for image synthesis models. The interactions can\nmodify the image content to make it aesthetically pleasing, such as adjusting\nexposure, changing shooting angles, and adding atmospheric effects. The\nenhancements brought by the interaction are iteratively fused into the\nsynthesis model itself through an additional enhancement module. This enables\nthe synthesis model to directly produce aesthetically pleasing images without\nany extra computational cost. In the experiments, we train the ArtAug\nenhancement module on existing text-to-image models. Various evaluation metrics\nconsistently demonstrate that ArtAug enhances the generative capabilities of\ntext-to-image models without incurring additional computational costs.

    "abstract": "Magnitude Pruning is a staple lightweight network design method which seeks\nto remove connections with the smallest magnitude. This process is either\nachieved in a structured or unstructured manner. While structured pruning\nallows reaching high efficiency, unstructured one is more flexible and leads to\nbetter accuracy, but this is achieved at the expense of low computational\nperformance. In this paper, we devise a novel coarse-to-fine (CTF) method that\ngathers the advantages of structured and unstructured pruning while discarding\ntheir inconveniences to some extent. Our method relies on a novel CTF\nparametrization that models the mask of each connection as the Hadamard product\ninvolving four parametrizations which capture channel-wise, column-wise,\nrow-wise and entry-wise pruning respectively. Hence, fine-grained pruning is\nenabled only when the coarse-grained one is disabled, and this leads to highly\nefficient networks while being effective. Extensive experiments conducted on\nthe challenging task of skeleton-based recognition, using the standard SBU and\nFPHA datasets, show the clear advantage of our CTF approach against different\nbaselines as well as the related work.",

    "abstract": "Irregularly sampled multivariate time series (ISMTS) are prevalent in\nreality. Due to their non-uniform intervals between successive observations and\nvarying sampling rates among series, the channel-independent (CI) strategy,\nwhich has been demonstrated more desirable for complete multivariate time\nseries forecasting in recent studies, has failed. This failure can be further\nattributed to the sampling sparsity, which provides insufficient information\nfor effective CI learning, thereby reducing its capacity. When we resort to the\nchannel-dependent (CD) strategy, even higher capacity cannot mitigate the\npotential loss of diversity in learning similar embedding patterns across\ndifferent channels. We find that existing work considers CI and CD strategies\nto be mutually exclusive, primarily because they apply these strategies to the\nglobal channel. However, we hold the view that channel strategies do not\nnecessarily have to be used globally. Instead, by appropriately applying them\nlocally and globally, we can create an opportunity to take full advantage of\nboth strategies. This leads us to introduce the Channel Harmony ISMTS\nTransformer (TimeCHEAT), which utilizes the CD locally and the CI globally.\nSpecifically, we segment the ISMTS into sub-series level patches. Locally, the\nCD strategy aggregates information within each patch for time embedding\nlearning, maximizing the use of relevant observations while reducing long-range\nirrelevant interference. Here, we enhance generality by transforming embedding\nlearning into an edge weight prediction task using bipartite graphs,\neliminating the need for special prior knowledge. Globally, the CI strategy is\napplied across patches, allowing the Transformer to learn individualized\nattention patterns for each channel. Experimental results indicate our proposed\nTimeCHEAT demonstrates competitive SOTA performance across three mainstream\ntasks.",

To address this issue, existing mainstreaming\ngraph rationalization methods first identify rationale and environment\nsubgraphs from input graphs, and then diversify training distributions by\naugmenting the environment subgraphs. However, these methods merely combine the\nlearned rationale subgraphs with environment subgraphs in the representation\nspace to produce augmentation samples, failing to produce sufficiently diverse\ndistributions. Thus, in this paper, we propose to achieve an effective Graph\nRationalization by Boosting Environmental diversity, a GRBE approach that\ngenerates the augmented samples in the original graph space to improve the\ndiversity of the environment subgraph. Firstly, to ensure the effectiveness of\naugmentation samples, we propose a precise rationale subgraph extraction\nstrategy in GRBE to refine the rationale subgraph learning process in the\noriginal graph space. Secondly, to ensure the diversity of augmented samples,\nwe propose an environment diversity augmentation strategy in GRBE that mixes\nthe environment subgraphs of different graphs in the original graph space and\nthen combines the new environment subgraphs with rationale subgraphs to\ngenerate augmented graphs.

Unlike most existing CSI\nfeedback schemes, which rely on instantaneous CSI only, the proposed CovNet\nleverages CSI covariance information to achieve high-performance CSI\nreconstruction, primarily consisting of convolutional neural network (CNN) and\nTransformer architecture. To efficiently utilize covariance information, we\npropose a covariance information processing procedure and sophisticatedly\ndesign the covariance information processing network (CIPN) to further process\nit. Moreover, the feed-forward network (FFN) in CovNet is designed to jointly\nleverage the 2D characteristics of the CSI matrix in the angle and delay\ndomains. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed network effectively\nleverages covariance information and outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nscheme across the full compression ratio (CR) range.",

At the theoretical and software levels, numerous approaches have been\nproposed for benchmarking quantum devices, ranging from, inter alia, quantum\nvolume to randomized benchmarking. In this work, we utilize the quantum\ninformation-theoretic properties of multipartite maximally-entangled quantum\nstates, in addition to their correspondence with quantum error correction\ncodes, permitting us to quantify the entanglement generated on near-term\nbilinear spin-qubit architectures. For this aim, we introduce four metrics\nwhich ascertain the quality of genuine multipartite quantum entanglement, along\nwith circuit-level fidelity measures. As part of the task of executing a\nquantum circuit on a device, we devise simulations which combine expected\nhardware characteristics of spin-qubit devices with appropriate compilation\ntechniques; we then analyze three different architectural choices of varying\nlattice sizes for bilinear arrays, under three increasingly realistic noise\nmodels. We find that if the use of a compiler is assumed, sparsely-connected\nspin-qubit lattices can approach comparable values of our metrics to those of\nthe most highly-connected device architecture. Even more surprisingly, by\nincorporating crosstalk into our last noise model, we find that, as error rates\nfor crosstalk approach realistic values, the benefits of utilizing a bilinear\narray with advanced connectivity vanish. Our results highlight the limitations\nof adding local connectivity to near-term spin-qubit devices, and can be\nreadily adapted to other qubit technologies. The framework developed here can\nbe used for analyzing quantum entanglement on a device before fabrication,\ninforming experimentalists on concomitant realistic expectations.",

Approximation algorithms offer\npractical solutions, but they present trade-offs involving throughput, memory\nusage, and accuracy. Moreover, modern applications further complicate these\ntrade-offs by demanding capabilities beyond sequential processing that require\nboth parallel scaling and support for concurrent queries and updates.\n  Analysis of these trade-offs led us to the key idea behind our proposed\nstreaming algorithm, Cuckoo Heavy Keeper (CHK). The approach introduces an\ninverted process for distinguishing frequent from infrequent items, which\nunlocks new algorithmic synergies that were previously inaccessible with\nconventional approaches. By further analyzing the competing metrics with a\nfocus on parallelism, we propose an algorithmic framework that balances\nscalability aspects and provides options to optimize query and insertion\nefficiency based on their relative frequencies. The framework is capable of\nparallelizing any heavy-hitter detection algorithm.\n  Besides the algorithms' analysis, we present an extensive evaluation on both\nreal-world and synthetic data across diverse distributions and query\nselectivity, representing the broad spectrum of application needs. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods, CHK improves throughput by 1.7-5.7$\\times$ and\naccuracy by up to four orders of magnitude even under low-skew data and tight\nmemory constraints. These properties allow its parallel instances to achieve\nnear-linear scale-up and low latency for heavy-hitter queries, even under a\nhigh query rate.

Reconstructing accurate 3D hand meshes from monocular\nvideos is a crucial task for understanding human behaviour, with significant\napplications in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). However, existing\nmethods for monocular hand reconstruction typically rely on a weak perspective\ncamera model, which simulates hand motion within a limited camera frustum. As a\nresult, these approaches struggle to recover the full 3D global trajectory and\noften produce noisy or incorrect depth estimations, particularly when the video\nis captured by dynamic or moving cameras, which is common in egocentric\nscenarios. Our Dyn-HaMR consists of a multi-stage, multi-objective optimization\npipeline, that factors in (i) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to\nrobustly estimate relative camera motion, (ii) an interacting-hand prior for\ngenerative infilling and to refine the interaction dynamics, ensuring plausible\nrecovery under (self-)occlusions, and (iii) hierarchical initialization through\na combination of state-of-the-art hand tracking methods.

Recent studies adopting this\napproach have demonstrated SNNs' effectiveness in speech command recognition,\nachieving high performance by employing large time steps for long time\nsequences. However, the large time steps lead to increased deployment burdens\nfor edge computing applications. Thus, it is important to balance high\nperformance and low energy consumption when detecting temporal patterns in edge\ndevices. Our solution comprises two key components. 1). We propose a\nhigh-performance fully spike-driven framework termed SpikeSCR, characterized by\na global-local hybrid structure for efficient representation learning, which\nexhibits long-term learning capabilities with extended time steps. 2). To\nfurther fully embrace low energy consumption, we propose an effective knowledge\ndistillation method based on curriculum learning (KDCL), where valuable\nrepresentations learned from the easy curriculum are progressively transferred\nto the hard curriculum with minor loss, striking a trade-off between power\nefficiency and high performance. We evaluate our method on three benchmark\ndatasets: the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands\n(SSC), and the Google Speech Commands (GSC) V2. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that SpikeSCR outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\nacross these three datasets with the same time steps.

With the\ncontinuous monitoring of the Gamma-ray sky by the Fermi Large Area Telescope\n(LAT), leading to deeper sensitivity, the high-energy Gamma-ray emission has\nnow been detected from a diverse class of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nHere, we present the results of a multiwavelength study of the radio source\nDA~362, which was reported to be a blazar candidate of uncertain type. However,\nit was recently identified as a bona fide compact symmetric object (CSO) based\non its sub-kpc, bi-polar radio morphology, and lack of radio variability. This\nmakes DA~362 the only fourth Gamma-ray emitting object of this enigmatic class\nof radio-loud AGN. Using five very long baseline interferometry observations\ncovering 1996-2018, we found the jet separation velocity to be subluminal\n($v_{\\rm app}\\sim 0.2c$), thus supporting its CSO nature. Its Fermi-LAT\nobservations revealed a Gamma-ray flaring activity, a phenomenon never detected\nfrom the other three Gamma-ray detected CSOs. This object is bright in the\nnear-infrared band but extremely faint in the optical-ultraviolet filters,\nhinting at possible obscuration. The Swift X-Ray Telescope observation of DA\n362 reveals an extremely hard X-ray spectrum, though a strong claim cannot be\nmade due to large uncertainties.

Such networks are substrates for social contagion\nprocesses like the diffusion of information and opinions. In this work, we\nconsider eight temporal higher-order networks derived from human face-to-face\ninteractions in various contexts and the Susceptible-Infected threshold process\non each of these networks: whenever a hyperlink is active and the number of\ninfected nodes in the hyperlink exceeds a threshold $\\Theta$, each susceptible\nnode in the hyperlink is infected independently with probability $\\beta$. The\nobjective is to understand (1) the contribution of each hyperlink to the\ndiffusion process, namely, the average number of nodes that are infected\ndirectly via the activation of the hyperlink when the diffusion starts from an\narbitrary seed node, and (2) hyperlinks with what network properties tend to\ncontribute more. We first propose to construct the diffusion backbone. The\nbackbone is a weighted higher-order network, where the weight of each hyperlink\ndenotes the contribution of the hyperlink to a given diffusion process.\nSecondly, we find that the backbone, or the contribution of hyperlinks, is\ndependent on the parameters $\\beta$ and $\\Theta$ of the diffusion process,\nwhich is also supported by our theoretical analysis of the backbone when\n$\\beta\\rightarrow 0$. Thirdly, we systematically design centrality metrics for\nhyperlinks in a temporal higher-order network, and each centrality metric is\nused to estimate the ranking of hyperlinks by the weight in the backbone.\nFinally, we find and explain why different centrality metrics can better\nestimate the contributions of hyperlinks for different parameters of the\ndiffusion process.",

Conventionally, its mass and width in normal\ndecay processes have been estimated as $M=990\\pm20$~MeV/$c^2$ and\n$\\Gamma=40-100$~MeV, respectively. Theoretical explanations regarding the\ninternal structure of $f_{0}(980)$ range from it being a conventional\nquark-antiquark meson to a tetraquark state, a $K\\overline{K}$ molecule, or\neven a quark-antiquark gluon hybrid. However, a definitive consensus has\nremained elusive over a considerable duration. Recent observations by the\nBESIII experiment have unveiled anomalously narrow widths of $f_{0}(980)$ in\nfive independent isospin-symmetry-breaking decay channels. Harnessing these\nexperimental findings, we performed a simultaneous fit to the $\\pi\\pi$\ninvariant mass distributions, resulting in a refined determination of the mass\nand width in isospin-symmetry-breaking decays as\n$M=990.0\\pm0.4(\\text{stat})\\pm0.1(\\text{syst})$~MeV/$c^2$ and\n$\\Gamma=11.4\\pm1.1(\\text{stat})\\pm0.9(\\text{syst})$~MeV, respectively. Here,\nthe first errors are statistical and the second are systematic. Furthermore, by\nemploying the parameterized Flatt\\'{e} formula to fit the same $\\pi\\pi$\ninvariant mass distributions, we ascertained the values of the two coupling\nconstants, $g_{f\\pi\\pi}$ and $g_{fK\\overline{K}}$, as $g_{f\\pi\\pi}=0.46\\pm0.03$\nand $g_{fK\\overline{K}}=1.24\\pm0.32$, respectively. Based on the joint\nconfidence regions of $g_{f\\pi\\pi}$ and $g_{fK\\overline{K}}$, we draw the\nconclusion that the experimental data exhibit a propensity to favor the\n$K\\overline{K}$ molecule model and the quark-antiquark ($q\\bar{q}$) model,\nwhile offering relatively less support for the tetraquarks ($q^{2}\\bar{q}^{2}$)\nmodel and the quark-antiquark gluon ($q\\bar{q}g$) hybrid model.",

Furthermore, these segmentation methods perform poorly in\nsegmenting the end-systole (ES) phase images, where the left ventricle deforms\nto the smallest irregular shape, and the boundary between the blood chamber and\nmyocardium becomes inconspicuous.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification is not yet widely adapted in the design process of\nengineering components despite its importance for achieving sustainable and\nresource-efficient structures. This is mainly due to two reasons: 1) Tracing\nthe effect of uncertainty in engineering simulations is a computationally\nchallenging task. This is especially true for inelastic simulations as the\nwhole loading history influences the results. 2) Implementations of efficient\nschemes in standard finite element software are lacking. In this paper, we are\ntackling both problems. We are proposing a \\rev{weakly}-intrusive\nimplementation of the time-separated stochastic mechanics in the finite element\nsoftware Abaqus. The time-separated stochastic mechanics is an efficient and\naccurate method for the uncertainty quantification of structures with inelastic\nmaterial behavior. The method effectivly separates the stochastic but\ntime-independent from the deterministic but time-dependent behavior. The\nresulting scheme consists only two deterministic finite element simulations for\nhomogeneous material fluctuations in order to approximate the stochastic\nbehavior. This brings down the computational cost compared to standard Monte\nCarlo simulations by at least two orders of magnitude while ensuring accurate\nsolutions. In this paper, the implementation details in Abaqus and numerical\ncomparisons are presented for the example of damage simulations.",

Unfortunately, current artificial\nneural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational\ndemands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption,\nlimiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile\nplatforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven\nlightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic\nsegmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven\nconvolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the\nmodel's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature\ninteraction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with\nbinary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a\nhigh-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy\nconsumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments\non DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU,\nrespectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS\ninference speed.

Our key finding, which to the best of our\nknowledge we are the first to report, is that the vulnerability to MIA is\nheavily correlated to (i) the local model mixing strategy performed by each\nnode upon reception of models from neighboring nodes and (ii) the global mixing\nproperties of the communication graph.

    "abstract": "Domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) aims to generalize an object detector\ntrained on labeled source-domain data to a target domain without annotations,\nthe core principle of which is \\emph{source-target feature alignment}.\nTypically, existing approaches employ adversarial learning to align the\ndistributions of the source and target domains as a whole, barely considering\nthe varying significance of distinct regions, say instances under different\ncircumstances and foreground \\emph{vs} background areas, during feature\nalignment. To overcome the shortcoming, we investigates a differential feature\nalignment strategy. Specifically, a prediction-discrepancy feedback instance\nalignment module (dubbed PDFA) is designed to adaptively assign higher weights\nto instances of higher teacher-student detection discrepancy, effectively\nhandling heavier domain-specific information. Additionally, an\nuncertainty-based foreground-oriented image alignment module (UFOA) is proposed\nto explicitly guide the model to focus more on regions of interest. Extensive\nexperiments on widely-used DAOD datasets together with ablation studies are\nconducted to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method and reveal its\nsuperiority over other SOTA alternatives.

Unlike the\ncase of videos depicting all the same activity, the temporal order of actions\nis not roughly shared among all videos, making the task even more challenging.\nWe propose to use activity labels to learn, in a weakly-supervised fashion,\naction representations suitable for global action segmentation. For this\npurpose, we introduce a triadic learning approach for video pairs, to ensure\nintra-video action discrimination, as well as inter-video and inter-activity\naction association. For the backbone architecture, we use a Siamese network\nbased on sparse transformers that takes as input video pairs and determine\nwhether they belong to the same activity.

With\nmultiple variations in layout and templates across several banks, extracting\ntransactional level information from different table categories is an arduous\ntask. Existing table structure recognition approaches produce sub optimal\nresults for long, complex tables and are unable to capture all transactions\naccurately. This paper proposes TabSniper, a novel approach for efficient table\ndetection, categorization and structure recognition from bank statements. The\npipeline starts with detecting and categorizing tables of interest from the\nbank statements. The extracted table regions are then processed by the table\nstructure recognition model followed by a post-processing module to transform\nthe transactional data into a structured and standardised format. The detection\nand structure recognition architectures are based on DETR, fine-tuned with\ndiverse bank statements along with additional feature enhancements. Results on\nchallenging datasets demonstrate that TabSniper outperforms strong baselines\nand produces high-quality extraction of transaction information from bank and\nother financial documents across multiple layouts and templates.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a deep MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS)\ncovering the rest-frame optical spectrum of the GN-z11 galaxy. The [OIII]5008\nand H$\\alpha$ emission lines are detected and spectroscopically resolved. The\nline profiles are well-modeled by a narrow Gaussian component with intrinsic\nFWHMs of 189$\\pm$25 and 231$\\pm$52 kms$^{-1}$, respectively. We do not find any\nevidence of a dominant broad H$\\alpha$ emission line component tracing a Broad\nLine Region in a type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). However, a broad\n($\\sim$430-470 kms$^{-1}$) and weak ($<$ 20-30%) H$\\alpha$ line component,\ntracing a minor AGN contribution in the optical, cannot be ruled out completely\nwith the sensitivity of the present data. The physical and excitation\nproperties of the ionized gas are consistent with a low-metallicity starburst\nforming stars at a rate of SFR(H$\\alpha$)$=$24 $\\pm$3$M_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. The\nelectron temperature of the ionized gas is\n$T_{\\mathrm{e}}$(O$^{++}$)$=$14000$\\pm$2100K, while the direct-$T_{\\mathrm{e}}$\ngas-phase metallicity is 12+$\\log$(O/H)$=$7.91$\\pm$0.07\n(Z=0.17$\\pm$0.03Z$_{\\odot}$). The optical line ratios locate GN-z11 in the\nstarburst or AGN region but more consistent with those of local low-metallicity\nstarbursts and high-$z$ luminous galaxies detected at redshifts similar to\nGN-z11. We conclude that the MRS optical spectrum of GN-z11 is consistent with\nthat of a massive, compact, and low-metallicity starburst galaxy. Due to its\nhigh SFR and stellar mass surface densities, close to that of the densest\nstellar clusters, we speculate that GN-z11 could be undergoing a feedback-free,\nhighly efficient starburst phase. Additional JWST data are needed to validate\nthis scenario, and other recently proposed alternatives, to explain the\nexistence of bright compact galaxies in the early Universe.",

Upcoming\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs are expected to detect a subpopulation of\neccentric signals, making it vital to develop accurate waveform models for\neccentric orbits. Here, employing recent analytical results through the third\npost-Newtonian order, we develop SEOBNRv5EHM: a new time-domain,\neffective-one-body, multipolar waveform model for eccentric binary black holes\nwith spins aligned (or antialigned) with the orbital angular momentum. Besides\nthe dominant (2,2) mode, the model includes the (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), (4,4) and\n(4,3) modes. We validate the model's accuracy by computing its unfaithfulness\nagainst 99 (28 public and 71 private) eccentric numerical-relativity (NR)\nsimulations, produced by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes Collaboration.\nImportantly, for NR waveforms with initial GW eccentricities below 0.5, the\nmaximum (2,2)-mode unfaithfulness across the total mass range 20-200 $M_\\odot$\nis consistently below or close to $1 \\%$, with a median value of $ \\sim 0.02 \\%\n$, reflecting an accuracy improvement of approximately an order of magnitude\ncompared to the previous-generation SEOBNRv4EHM and the state-of-the-art\nTEOBResumS-Dal\\'i eccentric model. In the quasi-circular-orbit limit,\nSEOBNRv5EHM is in excellent agreement with the highly accurate SEOBNRv5HM\nmodel. The accuracy, robustness, and speed of SEOBNRv5EHM make it suitable for\ndata analysis and astrophysical studies. We demonstrate this by performing a\nset of recovery studies of synthetic NR-signal injections, and\nparameter-estimation analyses of the events GW150914 and GW190521, which we\nfind to have no eccentricity signatures.",

    "abstract": "MADMAX, an axion dark matter search experiment, is currently in the prototype\ntesting phase. Its working principle is based on the conversion of axions in a\nmagnetic field into photons. This signal is then enhanced by a booster made of\ndielectric disks placed in front of a mirror. In order to test MADMAX\nprototypes at cryogenic temperatures in a magnetic field parallel to the disks,\na new G-10 glass-fiber cryostat of 0.06 m$^3$ inner volume was designed, tested\nand used in a CERN magnet. The design allows to minimise cost as well as\ncooling down and warming up times. Using continuous circulation flow of gaseous\nhelium, the MADMAX prototype was cooled down reproducibly to temperatures below\n10 K for more than 24 hours. This procedure allowed, for the first time, to\nperform a calibration of the booster response and to run a dark matter axion\nsearch in a magnetic field at low temperatures. This novel type of cryostat,\nwith a low manufacturing cost, fast and easy to operate, could be used for\nother purposes beyond MADMAX.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain\nthe existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the\none-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state\nremains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction,\nparticularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can\ndiffer by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This\ndiscrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this\nissue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$\npole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and\nthe $\\rho$- and $\\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out,\nleaving the coupling constant of the $\\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown\nparameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound\nstates exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\\bar{D}^*/\\bar{D}D^*$\nlocated within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the\nthree-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more\nthan $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on\nthe $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other\nstate. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters\ncalibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and\n$Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters\nprovide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving\nfew-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence\nof the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination\nof the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.",

This work aims at clarifying the nature of HaTr 5, which has also\npreviously been proposed to be a possible planetary nebula. Intermediate- and\nhigh-dispersion long-slit spectra of HaTr\\,5 have been obtained and analyzed in\nconjunction with archival optical and infrared images to investigate its\nspectral properties using photoionization models, to derive its H-alpha flux\nand ionized mass, and to determine its spatio-kinematic by means of 3D models\nto clarify its true nature. The H-alpha flux of HaTr 5 implies an ionized mass\nof 0.059 M_Sun at the 0.99 kpc distance of J170228, i.e., about 1000 times the\ntypical ejecta of a nova. If HaTr\\,5 were actually an unrelated planetary\nnebula, its H-alpha flux implies a distance of 2.25 kpc and an ionized mass of\n0.47 M_Sun. The expansion velocity of HaTr 5 is found to be of 27 km/s, with a\nheliocentric radial velocity of -1 km/. The ionized mass of HaTr 5 and its\nexpansion velocity (and associated kinematic age) are clearly inconsistent with\nthose expected for a nova remnant, which all strongly support a planetary\nnebula nature. The association of J170228 with HaTr 5 is further called into\nquestion by their differing radial velocities and almost orthogonal motions on\nthe plane of the sky. It is concluded that HaTr 5 is an old, evolved planetary\nnebula unrelated to the remnant of Nova Sco 1437 and to the cataclysmic\nvariable J170228, the latter being by chance projected onto HaTr 5.",

They can be described by hidden\nMarkov models (HMMs) or by their quantum extensions (QHMMs). These models\nexplain and give rise to process outputs in terms of an observed system\ninteracting with an unobserved memory. Although there are infinitely many\nmodels that can generate a given process, they can vary greatly in their memory\nrequirements. It is therefore of great fundamental and practical importance to\nidentify memory-minimal models. This task is complicated due to both the number\nof generating models, and the lack of invariant features that determine\nelements of the set. In general, it is forbiddingly difficult to ascertain that\na given model is minimal. Addressing this challenge, we here identify spectral\ninvariants of a process that can be calculated from any model that generates\nit. This allows us to determine strict bounds on the quantum generative\ncomplexity of the process -- its minimal memory requirement. We then show that\nthe bound is raised quadratically when we restrict to classical operations.\nThis is an entirely quantum-coherent effect, as we express precisely, using the\nresource theory of coherence. Finally, we demonstrate that the classical bound\ncan be violated by quantum models.",

Given a target\nclassification accuracy, our goal is to minimize the number of indecisions,\nwhich are observations that we do not automate. For problems that are hard, the\ntarget accuracy may not be achievable without using indecisions. In contrast,\nby using indecisions, we are able to control the misclassification rate to any\nuser-specified level, even below the Bayes optimal error rate, while minimizing\nthe frequency of identifying an indecision.

    "abstract": "A large amount of local and culture-specific knowledge (e.g., people,\ntraditions, food) can only be found in documents written in dialects. While\nthere has been extensive research conducted on cross-lingual information\nretrieval (CLIR), the field of cross-dialect retrieval (CDIR) has received\nlimited attention. Dialect retrieval poses unique challenges due to the limited\navailability of resources to train retrieval models and the high variability in\nnon-standardized languages. We study these challenges on the example of German\ndialects and introduce the first German dialect retrieval dataset, dubbed\nWikiDIR, which consists of seven German dialects extracted from Wikipedia.\nUsing WikiDIR, we demonstrate the weakness of lexical methods in dealing with\nhigh lexical variation in dialects. We further show that commonly used\nzero-shot cross-lingual transfer approach with multilingual encoders do not\ntransfer well to extremely low-resource setups, motivating the need for\nresource-lean and dialect-specific retrieval models. We finally demonstrate\nthat (document) translation is an effective way to reduce the dialect gap in\nCDIR.",

Our cerebral architecture\nseamlessly integrates sequential data through intricate feed-forward and\nfeedback mechanisms. In stark contrast, traditional methods struggle to\ngeneralize effectively when confronted with data spanning diverse domains,\nhighlighting the need for innovative strategies that can mimic the brain's\nadaptability and dynamic integration capabilities.

The structured Hebbian plasticity reshapes the structure of\nweights to express the high correlation between view representations,\nfacilitating a fine-grained fusion of view representations. Moreover, synaptic\npartition learning is efficient in alleviating drastic changes in weights and\nalso retaining old knowledge by inhibiting partial synapses.

To\nsolve this, we introduce a novel query-based detection method named\nRadar-Camera Transformer (RCTrans).

By doing this, we can fully explore the 3D information of\neach interest region and reduce the interference of empty tokens during the\nfusing stage. We then design a Pruning Sequential Decoder to predict 3D boxes\nbased on the obtained tokens and random initialized queries. To alleviate the\neffect of elevation ambiguity in radar point clouds, we gradually locate the\nposition of the object via a sequential fusion structure. It helps to get more\nprecise and flexible correspondences between tokens and queries. A pruning\ntraining strategy is adopted in the decoder, which can save much time during\ninference and inhibit queries from losing their distinctiveness.

Challenges arise when classifying aerial\ncategories with high inter-class similarity and intra-class variance. Besides,\nthe domain gap between vision-language models' pretraining datasets and remote\nsensing datasets hinders the zero-shot capabilities of the pretrained model\nwhen it is directly applied to remote sensing images.

In this paper, I\nwill adopt three idealized perspectives -- computational, theoretical, and\nexperimental -- to focus on two fundamental issues that lend partial support to\nPiantadosi's critique: (a) the evidence challenging the Poverty of Stimulus\n(PoS) hypothesis and (b) the notion of simplicity as conceived within\nmainstream Minimalism. In conclusion, I argue that, to reclaim a central role\nin language studies, generative linguistics -- representing a prototypical\ntheoretical perspective on language -- needs a serious update leading to (i)\nmore precise, consistent, and complete formalizations of foundational\nintuitions and (ii) the establishment and utilization of a standardized dataset\nof crucial empirical evidence to evaluate the theory's adequacy.

How to enhance domain\ngeneralization of CLIP on noisy data within FSL tasks is a critical challenge.\nIn this paper, we provide a novel view to mitigate the influence of noisy\nlabels, CLIP-based Robust Few-shot learning (CRoF). CRoF is a general plug-in\nmodule for CLIP-based models. To avoid misclassification and confused label\nembedding, we design the few-shot task-oriented prompt generator to give more\ndiscriminative descriptions of each category. The proposed prompt achieves\nlarger distances of inter-class textual embedding. Furthermore, rather than\nfully trusting zero-shot classification by CLIP, we fine-tune CLIP on noisy\nfew-shot data in a new domain with a weighting strategy like label-smooth. The\nweights for multiple potentially correct labels consider the relationship\nbetween CLIP's prior knowledge and original label information to ensure\nreliability. Our multiple label loss function further supports robust training\nunder this paradigm.

    "abstract": "Weakly-Supervised Dense Video Captioning (WSDVC) aims to localize and\ndescribe all events of interest in a video without requiring annotations of\nevent boundaries. This setting poses a great challenge in accurately locating\nthe temporal location of event, as the relevant supervision is unavailable.\nExisting methods rely on explicit alignment constraints between event locations\nand captions, which involve complex event proposal procedures during both\ntraining and inference. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel implicit\nlocation-caption alignment paradigm by complementary masking, which simplifies\nthe complex event proposal and localization process while maintaining\neffectiveness. Specifically, our model comprises two components: a dual-mode\nvideo captioning module and a mask generation module. The dual-mode video\ncaptioning module captures global event information and generates descriptive\ncaptions, while the mask generation module generates differentiable positive\nand negative masks for localizing the events. These masks enable the implicit\nalignment of event locations and captions by ensuring that captions generated\nfrom positively and negatively masked videos are complementary, thereby forming\na complete video description. In this way, even under weak supervision, the\nevent location and event caption can be aligned implicitly. Extensive\nexperiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting weakly-supervised methods and achieves competitive results compared to\nfully-supervised methods.",

    "abstract": "Hash Chemistry, a minimalistic artificial chemistry model of open-ended\nevolution, has recently been extended to non-spatial and cellular versions. The\nnon-spatial version successfully demonstrated continuous adaptation and\nunbounded growth of complexity of self-replicating entities, but it did not\nsimulate multiscale ecological interactions among the entities. On the\ncontrary, the cellular version explicitly represented multiscale spatial\necological interactions among evolving patterns, yet it failed to show\nmeaningful adaptive evolution or complexity growth. It remains an open question\nwhether it is possible to create a similar minimalistic evolutionary system\nthat can exhibit all of those desired properties at once within a\ncomputationally efficient framework. Here we propose an improved version called\nStructural Cellular Hash Chemistry (SCHC). In SCHC, individual identities of\nevolving patterns are explicitly represented and processed as the connected\ncomponents of the nearest neighbor graph of active cells. The neighborhood\nconnections are established by connecting active cells with other active cells\nin their Moore neighborhoods in a 2D cellular grid. Evolutionary dynamics in\nSCHC are simulated via pairwise competitions of two randomly selected patterns,\nfollowing the approach used in the non-spatial Hash Chemistry. SCHC's\ncomputational cost was significantly less than the original and non-spatial\nversions. Numerical simulations showed that these model modifications achieved\nspontaneous movement, self-replication and unbounded growth of complexity of\nspatial evolving patterns, which were clearly visible in space in a highly\nintuitive manner. Detailed analysis of simulation results showed that there\nwere spatial ecological interactions among self-replicating patterns and their\ndiversity was also substantially promoted in SCHC, neither of which was present\nin the non-spatial version.",

An established measure for quantifying data freshness is the\nAge-of-Information (AoI), which has been the subject of extensive research.\nRecently, there has been increased interest in multi-sensor systems: redundant\nsensors producing samples of the same physical process, sensors such as cameras\nproducing overlapping views, or distributed sensors producing correlated\nsamples. When the information from a particular sensor is outdated, fresh\nsamples from other correlated sensors can be helpful. To quantify the utility\nof distant but correlated samples, we put forth a two-dimensional (2D) model of\nAoI that takes into account the sensor distance in an age-equivalent\nrepresentation. Since we define 2D-AoI as equivalent to AoI, it can be readily\nlinked to existing AoI research, especially on parallel systems. We consider\nphysical phenomena modeled as spatio-temporal processes and derive the 2D-AoI\nfor different Gaussian correlation kernels. For a basic exponential product\nkernel, we find that spatial distance causes an additive offset of the AoI,\nwhile for other kernels the effects of spatial distance are more complex and\nvary with time. Using our methodology, we evaluate the 2D-AoI of different\nspatial topologies and sensor densities.",

These challenges lead to a bias towards head predicates in\nSGG models, favoring dominant general predicates while overlooking fine-grained\npredicates. In this paper, we address the challenges of SGG by framing it as\nmulti-label classification problem with partial annotation, where relevant\nlabels of fine-grained predicates are missing. Under the new frame, we propose\nRetrieval-Augmented Scene Graph Generation (RA-SGG), which identifies potential\ninstances to be multi-labeled and enriches the single-label with multi-labels\nthat are semantically similar to the original label by retrieving relevant\nsamples from our established memory bank. Based on augmented relations (i.e.,\ndiscovered multi-labels), we apply multi-prototype learning to train our SGG\nmodel. Several comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that RA-SGG\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 3.6% on VG and 5.9% on GQA,\nparticularly in terms of F@K, showing that RA-SGG effectively alleviates the\nissue of biased prediction caused by the long-tailed distribution and semantic\nambiguity of predicates.",

    "abstract": "An ordered graph is a graph with a total order over its vertices. A linear\nlayout of an ordered graph is a partition of the edges into sets of either\nnon-crossing edges, called stacks, or non-nesting edges, called queues. The\nstack (queue) number of an ordered graph is the minimum number of required\nstacks (queues). Mixed linear layouts combine these layouts by allowing each\nset of edges to form either a stack or a queue. The minimum number of stacks\nplus queues is called the mixed page number. It is well known that ordered\ngraphs with small stack number are characterized, up to a function, by the\nabsence of large twists (that is, pairwise crossing edges). Similarly, ordered\ngraphs with small queue number are characterized by the absence of large\nrainbows (that is, pairwise nesting edges). However, no such characterization\nvia forbidden patterns is known for mixed linear layouts.\n  We address this gap by introducing patterns similar to twists and rainbows,\nwhich we call thick patterns; such patterns allow a characterization, again up\nto a function, of mixed linear layouts of bounded-degree graphs. That is, we\nshow that a family of ordered graphs with bounded maximum degree has bounded\nmixed page number if and only if the size of the largest thick pattern is\nbounded. In addition, we investigate an exact characterization of ordered\ngraphs whose mixed page number equals a fixed integer $ k $ via a finite set of\nforbidden patterns. We show that for every $ k \\ge 2 $, there is no such\ncharacterization, which supports the nature of our first result.",

Existing approaches typically develop independent\nhierarchy-aware models based on shared features extracted from a common base\nencoder. However, because coarse-grained levels are inherently easier to learn\nthan finer ones, the base encoder tends to prioritize coarse feature\nabstractions, which impedes the learning of fine-grained features. To overcome\nthis challenge, we propose a novel framework called the Bidirectional Logits\nTree (BiLT) for Granularity Reconcilement. The key idea is to develop\nclassifiers sequentially from the finest to the coarsest granularities, rather\nthan parallelly constructing a set of classifiers based on the same input\nfeatures. In this setup, the outputs of finer-grained classifiers serve as\ninputs for coarser-grained ones, facilitating the flow of hierarchical semantic\ninformation across different granularities. On top of this, we further\nintroduce an Adaptive Intra-Granularity Difference Learning (AIGDL) approach to\nuncover subtle semantic differences between classes within the same\ngranularity.

In this context, we trained a machine learning model to predict the\ndirection of change in an individual's time production. The model's training\ndata was collected using an ecologically valid setup. We moved closer to an\necological setting by conducting an online experiment with 995 participants\nperforming a time production task that used naturalistic videos (no audio) as\nstimuli. The model achieved an accuracy of 61%. This was 10 percentage points\nhigher than the baseline models derived from cognitive theories of timing. The\nmodel performed equally well on new data from a second experiment, providing\nevidence of its generalization capabilities. The model's output analysis\nrevealed that it also contained information about the magnitude of change in\ntime production. The predictions were further analysed at both population and\nindividual level. It was found that a participant's previous timing performance\nplayed a significant role in determining the direction of change in time\nproduction.

While we expect the former mechanism\nto increase the prevalence of performance incentives, the latter is likely to\ndecrease it. Our doubly robust ATE estimates show that companies using business\nsoftware and certain key technologies of Industry 4.0 increasingly resort to\nperformance incentives, suggesting that the improved measurement effect\ndominates the employee substitution effect. In addition, we find that companies\nemerging as technology-friendly use performance incentives more frequently than\ntheir technology-averse counterparts.

For instance, fundus fluorescein\nangiography (FFA) can accurately identify eye diseases. However, traditional\ninvasive FFA involves the injection of sodium fluorescein, which can cause\ndiscomfort and risks. Generating corresponding FFA images from non-invasive\nfundus images holds significant practical value but also presents challenges.\nFirst, limited datasets constrain the performance and effectiveness of models.\nSecond, previous studies have primarily focused on generating FFA for single\ndiseases or single modalities, often resulting in poor performance for patients\nwith various ophthalmic conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nlatent diffusion model-based framework, Diffusion, which introduces a\nfine-tuning protocol to overcome the challenge of limited medical data and\nunleash the generative capabilities of diffusion models. Furthermore, we\ndesigned a new approach to tackle the challenges of generating across different\nmodalities and disease types. On limited datasets, our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results compared to existing methods, offering significant\npotential to enhance ophthalmic diagnostics and patient care. Our code will be\nreleased soon to support further research in this field.",

    "abstract": "Code-switching automatic speech recognition (ASR) aims to transcribe speech\nthat contains two or more languages accurately. To better capture\nlanguage-specific speech representations and address language confusion in\ncode-switching ASR, the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and an additional\nlanguage diarization (LD) decoder are commonly employed. However, most\nresearches remain stagnant in simple operations like weighted summation or\nconcatenation to fuse languagespecific speech representations, leaving\nsignificant opportunities to explore the enhancement of integrating language\nbias information. In this paper, we introduce CAMEL, a cross-attention-based\nMoE and language bias approach for code-switching ASR. Specifically, after each\nMoE layer, we fuse language-specific speech representations with\ncross-attention, leveraging its strong contextual modeling abilities.\nAdditionally, we design a source attention-based mechanism to incorporate the\nlanguage information from the LD decoder output into text embeddings.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the SEAME, ASRU200, and ASRU700+LibriSpeech460 Mandarin-English\ncode-switching ASR datasets.",

Many quality metrics concerning\ndata pattern, perception, and aesthetics are proposed, and respective\noptimization algorithms are developed. However, the optimization problems\nrelated to ordering are often difficult to solve (e.g., TSP is NP-complete),\nand developing specialized optimization algorithms is costly. In this paper, we\npropose Versatile Ordering Network (VON), which automatically learns the\nstrategy to order given a quality metric. VON uses the quality metric to\nevaluate its solutions, and leverages reinforcement learning with a greedy\nrollout baseline to improve itself. This keeps the metric transparent and\nallows VON to optimize over different metrics. Additionally, VON uses the\nattention mechanism to collect information across scales and reposition the\ndata points with respect to the current context. This allows VONs to deal with\ndata points following different distributions. We examine the effectiveness of\nVON under different usage scenarios and metrics. The results demonstrate that\nVON can produce comparable results to specialized solvers. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/sysuvis/VON.",

The introduced decoherence effects\ncreate a distinction between micro- and macrosystems, determined by a\ncharacteristic mass-dependent decoherence timescale, $\\tau(m)$. For\nmacrosystems, $QT^\\ast$ can be approximated by classical statistical mechanics\n(CSM), while for microsystems, the conventional quantum theory $QT$ remains\napplicable. The quantum measurement process is analyzed within the framework of\n$QT^\\ast$, where Galilean decoherence enables the transition from entangled\nstates to proper mixtures. This transition supports an ignorance-based\ninterpretation of measurement outcomes, aligning with the ensemble\ninterpretation of quantum states. To illustrate the theory's application, the\nStern-Gerlach spin measurement is explored.

Consequently, efficient security testing of MCU firmware has\nproved to be a resource- and engineering-heavy endeavor.\n  EmbedFuzz introduces an efficient end-to-end fuzzing framework for MCU\nfirmware. Our novel firmware transplantation technique converts binary MCU\nfirmware to a functionally equivalent and fuzzing-enhanced version of the\nfirmware which executes on a compatible high-end device at native performance.\nBesides the performance gains, our system enables advanced introspection\ncapabilities based on tooling for typical Linux user space processes, thus\nsimplifying analysis of crashes and bug triaging. In our evaluation against\nstate-of-the-art MCU fuzzers, EmbedFuzz exhibits up to eight-fold fuzzing\nthroughput while consuming at most a fourth of the energy thanks to its native\nexecution.",

    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis is an essential component of natural language processing,\nused to analyze sentiments, attitudes, and emotional tones in various contexts.\nIt provides valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and user\nexperiences. Researchers have developed various classical machine learning and\nneuro-fuzzy approaches to address the exponential growth of data and the\ncomplexity of language structures in sentiment analysis. However, these\napproaches often fail to determine the optimal number of clusters, interpret\nresults accurately, handle noise or outliers efficiently, and scale effectively\nto high-dimensional data. Additionally, they are frequently insensitive to\ninput variations. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for\nsentiment analysis called the Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (QFNN), which\nleverages quantum properties and incorporates a fuzzy layer to overcome the\nlimitations of classical sentiment analysis algorithms. In this study, we test\nthe proposed approach on two Twitter datasets: the Coronavirus Tweets Dataset\n(CVTD) and the General Sentimental Tweets Dataset (GSTD), and compare it with\nclassical and hybrid algorithms. The results demonstrate that QFNN outperforms\nall classical, quantum, and hybrid algorithms, achieving 100% and 90% accuracy\nin the case of CVTD and GSTD, respectively. Furthermore, QFNN demonstrates its\nrobustness against six different noise models, providing the potential to\ntackle the computational complexity associated with sentiment analysis on a\nlarge scale in a noisy environment. The proposed approach expedites sentiment\ndata processing and precisely analyses different forms of textual data, thereby\nenhancing sentiment classification and insights associated with sentiment\nanalysis.",

We\nconsider a comprehensive range of interfacial flow regimes from waveless\nthrough to three-dimensional (3D) waves, and for previously unexplored\ninertia-dominated conditions that have practical relevance. The transition\nbetween these regimes is categorised within a phase map based on two governing\nparameters that correspond to modified inverse Weber ($\\lambda$) and Ekman\nnumbers ($r_{disc}$). Our findings show that stationary two-dimensional (2D)\nspiral waves, which unfold in the direction of rotation from the Coriolis\neffect, transition to 3D waves with the emergence of small perturbations on the\nwavefronts. These non-stationary structures grow asymmetrically in the 2D-3D\ntransitional region, and detach from the parent spiral wave to form wavelets or\nso-called $\\Lambda$ solitons. We show that during and after this wave formation\nprocess, flow circulations unique to the spinning disc arrangement are present\nwithin the main wave hump. Furthermore, when combined with observations of wall\nstrain rates and topology within the film, these findings elucidate the\nmechanisms that underpin the apparent wave-induced interfacial turbulence\neffects observed for spinning disc flows.",

The Radar-Camera fusion in\noutdoor 3D scene perception is capped by the image-to-BEV transformation--if\nthe depth of pixels is not accurately estimated, the naive combination of BEV\nfeatures actually integrates unaligned visual content. To avoid this problem,\nwe propose a query-based framework that enables adaptive sampling of\ninstance-relevant features from both the bird's-eye view (BEV) and the original\nimage view. Furthermore, we enhance system performance by two key designs:\noptimizing query initialization and strengthening the representational capacity\nof BEV. For the former, we introduce an adaptive circular distribution in polar\ncoordinates to refine the initialization of object queries, allowing for a\ndistance-based adjustment of query density. For the latter, we initially\nincorporate a radar-guided depth head to refine the transformation from image\nview to BEV. Subsequently, we focus on leveraging the Doppler effect of radar\nand introduce an implicit dynamic catcher to capture the temporal elements\nwithin the BEV. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD)\ndatasets validate the merits of our design. Remarkably, our method achieves\nsuperior results of 64.9% mAP and 70.2% NDS on nuScenes.

Existing solutions, such as oversampling,\nautomatic gain control (AGC), and compander-based methods, have limitations in\nhandling high-DR signals. Recently, the Unlimited Sampling Framework (USF) has\nemerged as a promising alternative. It uses a non-linear modulo operator to map\nhigh-DR signals within the ADC range. Existing recovery algorithms, such as\nhigher-order differences (HODs), prediction-based methods, and beyond bandwidth\nresidual recovery (B2R2), have shown potential but are either noise-sensitive,\nrequire high sampling rates, or are computationally intensive. To address these\nchallenges, we propose LASSO-B2R2, a fast and robust recovery algorithm.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate that the first-order difference of the residual\n(the difference between the folded and original samples) is sparse, and we\nderive an upper bound on its sparsity. This insight allows us to formulate the\nrecovery as a sparse signal reconstruction problem using the least absolute\nshrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Numerical simulations show that\nLASSO-B2R2 outperforms prior methods in terms of speed and robustness, though\nit requires a higher sampling rate at lower DR. To overcome this, we introduce\nthe bits distribution mechanism, which allocates 1 bit from the total bit\nbudget to identify modulo folding events. This reduces the recovery problem to\na simple pseudo-inverse computation, significantly enhancing computational\nefficiency. Finally, we validate our approach through numerical simulations and\na hardware prototype that captures 1-bit folding information, demonstrating its\npractical feasibility.",

However, these modifications often result in partial\nimages and distort the semantics, which reduces response quality on clean\nimages after voting.

Experimental evidence suggests that a larger selection can\ncomplicate the decision-making process. Consequently, choice satisfaction may\ndiminish when the costs of making a choice outweigh its benefits, indicating\nthat satisfaction follows an inverted U-shaped relationship with the size of\nthe choice set. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon\nremain underexplored. Here, we present a theoretical framework based on\nrelative entropy and effective information to elucidate the inverted U-shaped\nrelationship between satisfaction and choice set size. We begin by positing\nthat individuals assign a probability distribution to a choice set based on\ntheir preferences, characterized by an observed Shannon entropy. We then define\na maximum entropy that corresponds to a worst-case scenario where individuals\nare indifferent among options, leading to equal probabilities for all\nalternatives. We hypothesized that satisfaction is related to the probability\nof identifying an ideal choice within the set. By comparing observed entropy to\nmaximum entropy, we derive the effective information of choice probabilities,\ndemonstrating that this metric reflects satisfaction with the options\navailable. For smaller choice sets, individuals can more easily identify their\nbest option, resulting in a sharper probability distribution around the\npreferred choice and, consequently, minimum entropy, which signifies maximum\ninformation and satisfaction. Conversely, in larger choice sets, individuals\nstruggle to compare and evaluate all alternatives, leading to missed\nopportunities and increased entropy. This smooth probability distribution\nultimately reduces choice satisfaction, thereby producing the observed inverted\nU-shaped trend.",

To remedy this issue, this work\ntargets to advance the semantic alignment learning to promote this task.\nParticularly, we utilize the off-the-shelf Multimodal Large-Language Models\n(MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct paired image-text pairs,\nespecially for the manipulated instances. Subsequently, a cross-modal alignment\nlearning is performed to enhance the semantic alignment. Besides the explicit\nauxiliary clues, we further design a Manipulation-Guided Cross Attention (MGCA)\nto provide implicit guidance for augmenting the manipulation perceiving. With\nthe grounding truth available during training, MGCA encourages the model to\nconcentrate more on manipulated components while downplaying normal ones,\nenhancing the model's ability to capture manipulations.

Compact dust disks ($\\lesssim$50 au) are\nsuggested to have a higher (cold) H$_2$O flux than more extended disks, likely\ndue to efficient radial drift bringing H$_2$O-rich material to the inner disk,\nwhere it can be observed with JWST. We present JWST MIRI/MRS observations of\nthe disk CX Tau taken as a part of the Mid-INfrared Disk Survey (MINDS) GTO\nprogram, a prime example of a drift-dominated disk. This compact disk seems\npeculiar: the source possesses a bright CO$_2$ feature instead of the bright\nH$_2$O expected based on its efficient radial drift. We aim to provide an\nexplanation for this finding. We detect molecular emission from H$_2$O,\n$^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and OH in this disk, and even\ndemonstrate a potential detection of CO$^{18}$O. Analysis of the $^{12}$CO$_2$\nand $^{13}$CO$_2$ emission shows the former to be tracing a temperature of\n$\\sim$450 K, whereas the $^{13}$CO$_2$ traces a significantly colder\ntemperature ($\\sim$200 K). H$_2$O is also securely detected both at shorter and\nlonger wavelengths, tracing a similar temperature of $\\sim$500-600 K as the\nCO$_2$ emission. We also find evidence for a colder, $\\sim$200 K H$_2$O\ncomponent at longer wavelengths, which is in line with this disk having strong\nradial drift. The cold $^{13}$CO$_2$ and H$_2$O emission indicate that radial\ndrift of ices likely plays an important role in setting the chemistry of the\ninner disk of CX Tau. Potentially, the H$_2$O-rich gas has already advected\nonto the central star, which is now followed by an enhancement of comparatively\nCO$_2$-rich gas reaching the inner disk, explaining the enhancement of CO$_2$\nemission in CX Tau. The comparatively weaker H$_2$O emission can be explained\nby the source's low accretion luminosity. (abridged)",

This model seamlessly\nintegrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object\nclassification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach\nto strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1)\nthe probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a\nsingular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius\n($\\theta_\\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds\nusing a single CPU.

To identify new\nlensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80\nmillion sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from\nvarious surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating\n$z>1.5$ sources, the number of candidates was reduced to 710,966.

By leveraging\nquantum algorithms, specifically $UU^{\\dagger}$ and variational $UU^{\\dagger}$,\nin conjunction with quantum image encoding methods such as Flexible\nRepresentation of Quantum Images (FRQI) and Novel Enhanced Quantum\nRepresentation (NEQR), we propose an optimized Quantum Neural Network (QNN).\nThis QNN features adjustments in its entangled layer structure and training\nduration to better handle the complexities of traffic data processing.\nEmpirical evaluations on two traffic datasets show that our model achieves\nsuperior classification accuracies of 97.42% and 84.08% and demonstrates\nremarkable robustness in various noise conditions. This study underscores the\npotential of quantum-enhanced 6G solutions in streamlining complex\ntransportation systems, highlighting the pivotal role of quantum technologies\nin advancing intelligent transportation solutions.",

However, many real-world tasks are non-Markovian, which has\nlong-term memory and dependency. The reward sparseness problem is further\namplified in non-Markovian scenarios.

While this approach\nensures alignment between the vocabulary distributions of the SLM and LLM, it\nsuffers from low token throughput due to uplink transmission and the\ncomputation costs of running both language models. To address this, we propose\na novel HLM structure coined Uncertainty-aware opportunistic HLM (U-HLM),\nwherein the SLM locally measures its output uncertainty and skips both uplink\ntransmissions and LLM operations for tokens that are likely to be accepted.\nThis opportunistic skipping is enabled by our empirical finding of a linear\ncorrelation between the SLM's uncertainty and the LLM's rejection probability.\nWe analytically derive the uncertainty threshold and evaluate its expected risk\nof rejection.

    "abstract": "Analog circuits are crucial in modern electronic systems, and automating\ntheir design has attracted significant research interest. One of major\nchallenges is topology synthesis, which determines circuit components and their\nconnections. Recent studies explore large language models (LLM) for topology\nsynthesis. However, the scenarios addressed by these studies do not align well\nwith practical applications. Specifically, existing work uses vague design\nrequirements as input and outputs an ideal model, but detailed structural\nrequirements and device-level models are more practical. Moreover, current\napproaches either formulate topology synthesis as graph generation or Python\ncode generation, whereas practical topology design is a complex process that\ndemands extensive design knowledge. In this work, we propose AnalogXpert, a\nLLM-based agent aiming at solving practical topology synthesis problem by\nincorporating circuit design expertise into LLMs. First, we represent analog\ntopology as SPICE code and introduce a subcircuit library to reduce the design\nspace, in the same manner as experienced designers. Second, we decompose the\nproblem into two sub-task (i.e., block selection and block connection) through\nthe use of CoT and incontext learning techniques, to mimic the practical design\nprocess. Third, we introduce a proofreading strategy that allows LLMs to\nincrementally correct the errors in the initial design, akin to human designers\nwho iteratively check and adjust the initial topology design to ensure\naccuracy. Finally, we construct a high-quality benchmark containing both real\ndata (30) and synthetic data (2k). AnalogXpert achieves 40% and 23% success\nrates on the synthetic dataset and real dataset respectively, which is markedly\nbetter than those of GPT-4o (3% on both the synthetic dataset and the real\ndataset).",

    "abstract": "With their increase in performance, neural network architectures also become\nmore complex, necessitating explainability. Therefore, many new and improved\nmethods are currently emerging, which often generate so-called saliency maps in\norder to improve interpretability. Those methods are often evaluated by visual\nexpectations, yet this typically leads towards a confirmation bias. Due to a\nlack of a general metric for explanation quality, non-accessible ground truth\ndata about the model's reasoning and the large amount of involved assumptions,\nmultiple works claim to find flaws in those methods. However, this often leads\nto unfair comparison metrics. Additionally, the complexity of most datasets\n(mostly images or text) is often so high, that approximating all possible\nexplanations is not feasible. For those reasons, this paper introduces a test\nfor saliency map evaluation: proposing controlled experiments based on all\npossible model reasonings over multiple simple logical datasets. Using the\ncontained logical relationships, we aim to understand how different saliency\nmethods treat information in different class discriminative scenarios (e.g. via\ncomplementary and redundant information). By introducing multiple new metrics,\nwe analyse propositional logical patterns towards a non-informative attribution\nscore baseline to find deviations of typical expectations.

    "abstract": "When bidders bid on complex objects, they might be unaware of characteristics\neffecting their valuations. We assume that each buyer's valuation is a sum of\nindependent random variables, one for each characteristic. When a bidder is\nunaware of a characteristic, he omits the random variable from the sum. We\nstudy the seller's decision to raise bidders' awareness of characteristics\nbefore a second-price auction with entry fees. Optimal entry fees capture an\nadditional unawareness rent due to unaware bidders misperceiving their\nprobability of winning and the price to be paid upon winning. When raising a\nbidder's individual awareness of a characteristic with positive expected value,\nthe seller faces a trade-off between positive effects on the expected first\norder statistic and unawareness rents of remaining unaware bidders on one hand\nand the loss of the unawareness rent from the newly aware bidder on the other.\nWe present characterization results on raising public awareness together with\nno versus full information. We discuss the winner's curse due to unawareness of\ncharacteristics.",

However, many applications require\nhigher precision at the frame level. In this work, we propose a novel task,\nBestShot, which aims to locate highlight frames within human-centric videos via\nlanguage queries. This task demands not only a deep semantic comprehension of\nhuman actions but also precise temporal localization. To support this task, we\nintroduce the BestShot Benchmark. %The benchmark is meticulously constructed by\ncombining human detection and tracking, potential frame selection based on\nhuman judgment, and detailed textual descriptions crafted by human input to\nensure precision. The benchmark is meticulously constructed by combining\nhuman-annotated highlight frames, detailed textual descriptions and duration\nlabeling. These descriptions encompass three critical elements: (1) Visual\ncontent; (2) Fine-grained action; and (3) Human Pose Description. Together,\nthese elements provide the necessary precision to identify the exact highlight\nframes in videos.\n  To tackle this problem, we have collected two distinct datasets: (i)\nShotGPT4o Dataset, which is algorithmically generated by GPT-4o and (ii)\nImage-SMPLText Dataset, a dataset with large-scale and accurate per-frame pose\ndescription leveraging PoseScript and existing pose estimation datasets. Based\non these datasets, we present a strong baseline model, ShotVL, fine-tuned from\nInternVL, specifically for BestShot. We highlight the impressive zero-shot\ncapabilities of our model and offer comparative analyses with existing SOTA\nmodels. ShotVL demonstrates a significant 52% improvement over InternVL on the\nBestShot Benchmark and a notable 57% improvement on the THUMOS14 Benchmark, all\nwhile maintaining the SOTA performance in general image classification and\nretrieval.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, semantic segmentation has flourished in various\napplications. However, the high computational cost remains a significant\nchallenge that hinders its further adoption. The filter pruning method for\nstructured network slimming offers a direct and effective solution for the\nreduction of segmentation networks. Nevertheless, we argue that most existing\npruning methods, originally designed for image classification, overlook the\nfact that segmentation is a location-sensitive task, which consequently leads\nto their suboptimal performance when applied to segmentation networks. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach, denoted as\nSpatial-aware Information Redundancy Filter Pruning~(SIRFP), which aims to\nreduce feature redundancy between channels. First, we formulate the pruning\nprocess as a maximum edge weight clique problem~(MEWCP) in graph theory,\nthereby minimizing the redundancy among the remaining features after pruning.\nWithin this framework, we introduce a spatial-aware redundancy metric based on\nfeature maps, thus endowing the pruning process with location sensitivity to\nbetter adapt to pruning segmentation networks. Additionally, based on the\nMEWCP, we propose a low computational complexity greedy strategy to solve this\nNP-hard problem, making it feasible and efficient for structured pruning. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive comparative\nexperiments on various challenging datasets. The results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of SIRFP for semantic segmentation tasks.",

In this work, Barkhausen noise in the organic\nferroelectric copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene)\n(P(VDF:TrFE)) is experimentally investigated under different electric fields,\nincreasing at various rates. A weak dependence of the structure of the\nBarkhausen noise on both the magnitude and rise time of the applied electric\nfield is observed, which manifests as a trend in the probability density\nfunction power-law exponents. Specifically, an increase in maximum electric\nfield leads to an increase of the power-law exponent; increasing the rise time\ncauses a parallel shift towards lower exponents. While these findings do not\nallow to conclusively confirm or refute universal self-organized critical\nbehavior of the polarization reversal avalanches in P(VDF:TrFE), the exponents\nwere found to seemingly converge to the universal value of 1.5 for fast and\nstrong driving, suggesting the system is close to this limit.",

However,\nthey overlook a critical issue: in CISS, the representation of class knowledge\nis updated continuously through incremental learning, whereas prototype replay\nmethods maintain fixed prototypes. This mismatch between updated representation\nand fixed prototypes limits the effectiveness of the prototype replay strategy.\nTo address this issue, we propose the Adaptive prototype replay (Adapter) for\nCISS in this paper.

Specifically, the ADC\nstrategy dynamically updates the stored prototypes based on the estimated\nrepresentation shift distance to match the updated representation of old class.\nThe UAC loss reduces prediction uncertainty, aggregating discriminative\nfeatures to aid in generating compact prototypes. Additionally, we introduce a\ncompensation-based prototype similarity discriminative (CPD) loss to ensure\nadequate differentiation between similar prototypes, thereby enhancing the\nefficiency of the adaptive prototype replay strategy.

    "abstract": "Recently, developing unified medical image segmentation models gains\nincreasing attention, especially with the advent of the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM). SAM has shown promising binary segmentation performance in natural\ndomains, however, transferring it to the medical domain remains challenging, as\nmedical images often possess substantial inter-category overlaps. To address\nthis, we propose the SEmantic-Guided SAM (SEG-SAM), a unified medical\nsegmentation model that incorporates semantic medical knowledge to enhance\nmedical segmentation performance. First, to avoid the potential conflict\nbetween binary and semantic predictions, we introduce a semantic-aware decoder\nindependent of SAM's original decoder, specialized for both semantic\nsegmentation on the prompted object and classification on unprompted objects in\nimages. To further enhance the model's semantic understanding, we solicit key\ncharacteristics of medical categories from large language models and\nincorporate them into SEG-SAM through a text-to-vision semantic module,\nadaptively transferring the language information into the visual segmentation\ntask. In the end, we introduce the cross-mask spatial alignment strategy to\nencourage greater overlap between the predicted masks from SEG-SAM's two\ndecoders, thereby benefiting both predictions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SEG-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art SAM-based methods in\nunified binary medical segmentation and task-specific methods in semantic\nmedical segmentation, showcasing promising results and potential for broader\nmedical applications.",

However, the above operation often causes the backbone to\noverfit to base classes while overlooking the novel ones, leading to severe\nconfusion between them. To address this issue, we propose Class-Aware Logit\nAdapter (CALA). Our method involves a lightweight adapter that learns to\nrectify biased predictions through a pseudo-incremental learning paradigm. In\nthe real FSCIL process, we use the learned adapter to dynamically generate\nrobust balancing factors.

Notably, CALA\noperates on the classifier level, preserving the original feature space, thus\nit can be flexibly plugged into most of the existing FSCIL works for improved\nperformance.

Among existing methods, autoregressive\napproaches are prone to error accumulation, while simple conditional diffusion\nmodels fail to adequately capture the spatiotemporal relationships between\nobserved and missing data. To address these issues, we propose a novel\ntwo-stage Refined Diffusion Probability Impuation (RDPI) framework based on an\ninitial network and a conditional diffusion model. In the initial stage,\ndeterministic imputation methods are used to generate preliminary estimates of\nthe missing data. In the refinement stage, residuals are treated as the\ndiffusion target, and observed values are innovatively incorporated into the\nforward process. This results in a conditional diffusion model better suited\nfor spatiotemporal data imputation, bridging the gap between the preliminary\nestimates and the true values.

    "abstract": "The advent of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has enabled significant\nperformance gains in the field of natural language processing. However, recent\nstudies have found PLMs to suffer from miscalibration, indicating a lack of\naccuracy in the confidence estimates provided by these models. Current\nevaluation methods for PLM calibration often assume that lower calibration\nerror estimates indicate more reliable predictions. However, fine-tuned PLMs\noften resort to shortcuts, leading to overconfident predictions that create the\nillusion of enhanced performance but lack generalizability in their decision\nrules. The relationship between PLM reliability, as measured by calibration\nerror, and shortcut learning, has not been thoroughly explored thus far. This\npaper aims to investigate this relationship, studying whether lower calibration\nerror implies reliable decision rules for a language model. Our findings reveal\nthat models with seemingly superior calibration portray higher levels of\nnon-generalizable decision rules. This challenges the prevailing notion that\nwell-calibrated models are inherently reliable. Our study highlights the need\nto bridge the current gap between language model calibration and generalization\nobjectives, urging the development of comprehensive frameworks to achieve truly\nrobust and reliable language models.",

To mitigate this privacy leakage, existing\nlightweight defenses restrict the sharing of gradients, such as encrypting the\nfinal-layer gradients or locally updating the parameters within.

Inspired by the\nchain of evidence (CoE), we characterize that the knowledge preferred by LLMs\nshould maintain both relevance to the question and mutual support among the\ntextual pieces. Accordingly, we propose a CoE discrimination approach and\nconduct a comparative analysis between CoE and Non-CoE samples across\nsignificance, deceptiveness, and robustness, revealing the LLM's preference for\nexternal knowledge that aligns with CoE features. Furthermore, we selected\nthree representative tasks (RAG-based multi-hop QA, external knowledge\npoisoning and poisoning defense), along with corresponding SOTA or prevalent\nbaselines. By integrating CoE features, the variants achieved significant\nimprovements over the original baselines.",

This paper focuses on the more practical Dense Audio-Visual\nEvent Localization (DAVEL) task, advancing audio-visual scene understanding for\nlonger, untrimmed videos. This task seeks to identify and temporally pinpoint\nall events simultaneously occurring in both audio and visual streams.\nTypically, each video encompasses dense events of multiple classes, which may\noverlap on the timeline, each exhibiting varied durations. Given these\nchallenges, effectively exploiting the audio-visual relations and the temporal\nfeatures encoded at various granularities becomes crucial. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a novel CCNet, comprising two core modules: the\nCross-Modal Consistency Collaboration (CMCC) and the Multi-Temporal Granularity\nCollaboration (MTGC). Specifically, the CMCC module contains two branches: a\ncross-modal interaction branch and a temporal consistency-gated branch. The\nformer branch facilitates the aggregation of consistent event semantics across\nmodalities through the encoding of audio-visual relations, while the latter\nbranch guides one modality's focus to pivotal event-relevant temporal areas as\ndiscerned in the other modality. The MTGC module includes a coarse-to-fine\ncollaboration block and a fine-to-coarse collaboration block, providing\nbidirectional support among coarse- and fine-grained temporal features.\nExtensive experiments on the UnAV-100 dataset validate our module design,\nresulting in a new state-of-the-art performance in dense audio-visual event\nlocalization.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models for point clouds have shown to be vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks, which have received increasing attention in various\nsafety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and\nsurveillance. Existing 3D attackers generally design various attack strategies\nin the white-box setting, requiring the prior knowledge of 3D model details.\nHowever, real-world 3D applications are in the black-box setting, where we can\nonly acquire the outputs of the target classifier. Although few recent works\ntry to explore the black-box attack, they still achieve limited attack success\nrates (ASR). To alleviate this issue, this paper focuses on attacking the 3D\nmodels in a transfer-based black-box setting, where we first carefully design\nadversarial examples in a white-box surrogate model and then transfer them to\nattack other black-box victim models. Specifically, we propose a novel\nSpectral-aware Admix with Augmented Optimization method (SAAO) to improve the\nadversarial transferability. In particular, since traditional Admix strategy\nare deployed in the 2D domain that adds pixel-wise images for perturbing, we\ncan not directly follow it to merge point clouds in coordinate domain as it\nwill destroy the geometric shapes. Therefore, we design spectral-aware fusion\nthat performs Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) to get spectral features of the\npoint clouds and add them in the spectral domain. Afterward, we run a few steps\nwith spectral-aware weighted Admix to select better optimization paths as well\nas to adjust corresponding learning weights. At last, we run more steps to\ngenerate adversarial spectral feature along the optimization path and perform\nInverse-GFT on the adversarial spectral feature to obtain the adversarial\nexample in the data domain. Experiments show that our SAAO achieves better\ntransferability compared to existing 3D attack methods.",

To address\nthese gaps, we propose a Reverse Embedded Defense Attack (REDA) mechanism that\ndisguises the attack intention as the \"defense\". intention against harmful\ncontent. Specifically, REDA starts from the target response, guiding the model\nto embed harmful content within its defensive measures, thereby relegating\nharmful content to a secondary role and making the model believe it is\nperforming a defensive task. The attacking model considers that it is guiding\nthe target model to deal with harmful content, while the target model thinks it\nis performing a defensive task, creating an illusion of cooperation between the\ntwo. Additionally, to enhance the model's confidence and guidance in\n\"defensive\" intentions, we adopt in-context learning (ICL) with a small number\nof attack examples and construct a corresponding dataset of attack examples.\nExtensive evaluations demonstrate that the REDA method enables cross-model\nattacks without the need to redesign attack strategies for different models,\nenables successful jailbreak in one iteration, and outperforms existing methods\non both open-source and closed-source models.",

In this letter, we propose a\nmulti-domain features guided supervised contrastive learning (MDFG_SCL) method,\nwhich integrates statistical features derived from multi-domain differences\nwith deep features obtained through supervised contrastive learning, thereby\ncapturing both low-level domain-specific variations and high-level semantic\ninformation. This comprehensive feature integration enables the model to\neffectively distinguish between small targets and sea clutter, even under\nchallenging conditions. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed shallow-to-deep detector not only achieves\neffective identification of small maritime targets but also maintains superior\ndetection performance across varying sea conditions, outperforming the\nmainstream unsupervised contrastive learning and supervised contrastive\nlearning methods.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in text-to-speech and speech conversion technologies have\nenabled the creation of highly convincing synthetic speech. While these\ninnovations offer numerous practical benefits, they also cause significant\nsecurity challenges when maliciously misused. Therefore, there is an urgent\nneed to detect these synthetic speech signals. Phoneme features provide a\npowerful speech representation for deepfake detection. However, previous\nphoneme-based detection approaches typically focused on specific phonemes,\noverlooking temporal inconsistencies across the entire phoneme sequence. In\nthis paper, we develop a new mechanism for detecting speech deepfakes by\nidentifying the inconsistencies of phoneme-level speech features. We design an\nadaptive phoneme pooling technique that extracts sample-specific phoneme-level\nfeatures from frame-level speech data. By applying this technique to features\nextracted by pre-trained audio models on previously unseen deepfake datasets,\nwe demonstrate that deepfake samples often exhibit phoneme-level\ninconsistencies when compared to genuine speech. To further enhance detection\naccuracy, we propose a deepfake detector that uses a graph attention network to\nmodel the temporal dependencies of phoneme-level features. Additionally, we\nintroduce a random phoneme substitution augmentation technique to increase\nfeature diversity during training. Extensive experiments on four benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing\nstate-of-the-art detection methods.",

Current efforts\nfocus on devising reconstruction tasks, such as acquiring normal data\nrepresentations by restoring normal samples from altered, pseudo-anomalous\ncounterparts. Our findings reveal that distributing attention equally across\nnormal and pseudo-anomalous data tends to dilute the model's focus on anomalous\ndeviations. The challenge is further compounded by the inherently disordered\nand sparse nature of 3D point cloud data. In response to those predicaments, we\nintroduce an innovative approach that emphasizes learning point offsets,\ntargeting more informative pseudo-abnormal points, thus fostering more\neffective distillation of normal data representations.

In particular, the initial locations\nof Li dendrite formation are still ambiguous: do Li clusters form directly at\nthe Li anode surface, or inside the bulk solid electrolyte (SE), or within the\nsolid-electrolyte interphase (SEI)? Here, based on the deep-potential molecular\ndynamics simulations combined with enhanced sampling techniques, we investigate\nthe atomic-level mechanism of Li cluster nucleation and formation at the Li\nanode/SE interface. We observe that an isolated Li cluster initially forms\ninside the SEI between the Li6PS5Cl SE and the Li metal anode, located ~1 nm\naway from the Li anode/SEI boundary. The local electronic structure of the\nspontaneously formed SEI is found to be a key factor enabling the Li cluster\nformation within SEI, in which a significantly decreased bandgap could\nfacilitate electronic conduction through the SEI and reduce Li+ ions to\nmetallic Li atoms therein.

    "abstract": "The rapidly developing field of large multimodal models (LMMs) has led to the\nemergence of diverse models with remarkable capabilities. However, existing\nbenchmarks fail to comprehensively, objectively and accurately evaluate whether\nLMMs align with the diverse needs of humans in real-world scenarios. To bridge\nthis gap, we propose the Multi-Dimensional Insights (MDI) benchmark, which\nincludes over 500 images covering six common scenarios of human life. Notably,\nthe MDI-Benchmark offers two significant advantages over existing evaluations:\n(1) Each image is accompanied by two types of questions: simple questions to\nassess the model's understanding of the image, and complex questions to\nevaluate the model's ability to analyze and reason beyond basic content. (2)\nRecognizing that people of different age groups have varying needs and\nperspectives when faced with the same scenario, our benchmark stratifies\nquestions into three age categories: young people, middle-aged people, and\nolder people. This design allows for a detailed assessment of LMMs'\ncapabilities in meeting the preferences and needs of different age groups. With\nMDI-Benchmark, the strong model like GPT-4o achieve 79% accuracy on age-related\ntasks, indicating that existing LMMs still have considerable room for\nimprovement in addressing real-world applications. Looking ahead, we anticipate\nthat the MDI-Benchmark will open new pathways for aligning real-world\npersonalization in LMMs. The MDI-Benchmark data and evaluation code are\navailable at https://mdi-benchmark.github.io/",

The keys can\nbe numeric or symbol strings, or indeed any labels drawn from a given linearly\nordered set. We discuss various ways in which the cost of comparing two keys\ncan be measured, and we can measure the efficiency of the algorithm by the\ntotal cost of such comparisons.\n  We define and discuss a closely related algorithm known as QuickVal and a\nnatural probabilistic model for the input to this algorithm; QuickVal searches\n(almost surely unsuccessfully) for a specified population quantile $\\alpha \\in\n[0, 1]$ in an input sample of size $n$. Call the total cost of comparisons for\nthis algorithm $S_n$. We discuss a natural way to define the random variables\n$S_1, S_2, \\ldots$ on a common probability space. For a general class of cost\nfunctions, Fill and Nakama (2013) proved under mild assumptions that the scaled\ncost $S_n / n$ of QuickVal converges in $L^p$ and almost surely to a limit\nrandom variable $S$. For a general cost function, we consider what we term the\nQuickVal residual: \\[\\rho_n := \\frac{S_n}n - S.\\] The residual is of natural\ninterest, especially in light of the previous analogous work on the sorting\nalgorithm QuickSort. In the case $\\alpha = 0$ of QuickMin with unit cost per\nkey-comparison, we are able to calculate -- \\`a la Bindjeme and Fill (2012) for\nQuickSort -- the exact (and asymptotic) $L^2$-norm of the residual. We take the\nresult as motivation for the scaling factor $\\sqrt{n}$ for the QuickVal\nresidual for general population quantiles and for general cost.

Recently, a number of works\nfurther explored how to employ the power of large diffusion models as zero-shot\nclassifiers. While recent zero-shot diffusion-based classifiers have made\nperformance advancement on benchmark datasets, they still suffered badly from\nextremely slow classification speed (e.g., ~1000 seconds per classifying single\nimage on ImageNet). The extremely slow classification speed strongly prohibits\nexisting zero-shot diffusion-based classifiers from practical applications. In\nthis paper, we propose an embarrassingly simple and efficient zero-shot\nGaussian Diffusion Classifiers (GDC) via pretrained text-to-image diffusion\nmodels and DINOv2. The proposed GDC can not only significantly surpass previous\nzero-shot diffusion-based classifiers by over 10 points (61.40% - 71.44%) on\nImageNet, but also accelerate more than 30000 times (1000 - 0.03 seconds)\nclassifying a single image on ImageNet. Additionally, it provides probability\ninterpretation of the results. Our extensive experiments further demonstrate\nthat GDC can achieve highly competitive zero-shot classification performance\nover various datasets and can promisingly self-improve with stronger diffusion\nmodels. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed GDC is the first zero-shot\ndiffusionbased classifier that exhibits both competitive accuracy and practical\nefficiency.",

    "abstract": "The mode pairing quantum key distribution (MP-QKD) protocol has attracted\nconsiderable attention for its capability to ensure high secure key rates over\nlong distances without requiring global phase locking. However, ensuring\nsymmetric channels for the MP-QKD protocol is challenging in practical quantum\ncommunication networks. Previous studies on the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol have\nrelied on ideal decoy state assumptions and infinite-key analysis, which are\nunattainable for real-world deployment. In this paper, we conduct a security\nanalysis of asymmetric MP-QKD protocol with the finite-key analysis, where we\ndiscard the previously impractical assumptions made in the decoy-state method.\nCombined with statistical fluctuation analysis, we globally optimized the 12\nindependent parameters in the asymmetric MP-QKD protocol by employing our\nmodified particle swarm optimization. The simulation results demonstrate that\nour work can achieve significantly enhanced secure key rates and transmission\ndistances compared to the original strategy with adding extra attenuation. We\nfurther investigate the relationship between the intensities and probabilities\nof signal, decoy, and vacuum states with transmission distance, facilitating\nits more efficient deployment in future quantum networks.",

This survey provides an\nin-depth overview of this transition, beginning with foundational techniques\nbefore the LLM era, followed by LLM-based embedding models through two main\nstrategies to derive embeddings from LLMs. 1) Direct prompting: We mainly\ndiscuss the prompt designs and the underlying rationale for deriving\ncompetitive embeddings. 2) Data-centric tuning: We cover extensive aspects that\naffect tuning an embedding model, including model architecture, training\nobjectives, data constructions, etc. Upon the above, we also cover advanced\nmethods for producing embeddings from longer texts, multilingual, code,\ncross-modal data, as well as reasoning-aware and other domain-specific\nscenarios. Furthermore, we discuss factors affecting choices of embedding\nmodels, such as performance/efficiency comparisons, dense vs sparse embeddings,\npooling strategies, and scaling law.

    "abstract": "Apart from forming the backbone of compiler optimization, static dataflow\nanalysis has been widely applied in a vast variety of applications, such as bug\ndetection, privacy analysis, program comprehension, etc. Despite its\nimportance, performing interprocedural dataflow analysis on large-scale\nprograms is well known to be challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndistributed analysis framework supporting the general interprocedural dataflow\nanalysis. Inspired by large-scale graph processing, we devise dedicated\ndistributed worklist algorithms for both whole-program analysis and incremental\nanalysis. We implement these algorithms and develop a distributed framework\ncalled BigDataflow running on a large-scale cluster. The experimental results\nvalidate the promising performance of BigDataflow -- BigDataflow can finish\nanalyzing the program of millions lines of code in minutes. Compared with the\nstate-of-the-art, BigDataflow achieves much more analysis efficiency.",

Despite the potential, the complex model\narchitectures and dynamic network conditions will introduce numerous bubbles\n(\\ie, idle waiting time) in pipeline execution, resulting in inefficient\nresource utilization and degraded QoS. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a novel framework named COACH, designed for near bubble-free pipeline\ncollaborative inference, thereby achieving low inference latency and high\nsystem throughput. Initially, COACH employs an \\textit{offline} component that\nutilizes an efficient recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm to optimize both\nmodel partitioning and transmission quantization, aiming to minimize the\noccurrence of pipeline bubbles. Subsequently, the \\textit{online} component in\nCOACH employs an adaptive quantization adjustment and a context-aware caching\nstrategy to further stabilize pipeline execution. Specifically, COACH analyzes\nthe correlation between intermediate data and label semantic centers in the\ncache, along with its influence on the quantization adjustment, thereby\neffectively accommodating network fluctuations. Our experiments demonstrate the\nefficacy of COACH in reducing inference latency and enhancing system\nthroughput. Notably, while maintaining comparable accuracy, COACH achieves up\nto 1.7x faster inference and 2.1x higher system throughput than baselines.",

We probe the\nenvironmental dependence of Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) properties in the redshift\nrange of $3$ to $5$ using marked correlation function statistics with galaxy\nsamples from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program and the\nCanada--France--Hawaii Telescope U-band surveys. We find that the UV magnitude\nand color of magnitude-selected LBG samples are strongly correlated with their\nenvironment, making these properties effective tracers of it. In contrast, the\nstar formation rate and stellar mass of LBGs exhibit a weak environmental\ndependence. For UV magnitudes and color, the correlation is stronger in\nbrighter galaxy samples across all redshifts and extends to scales far beyond\nthe size of typical dark matter halos. This suggests that within a given\nsample, LBGs with high UV magnitudes or colors are more likely to form pairs at\nthese scales than predicted by the two-point angular correlation function.\nMoreover, the amplitude of the marked correlation function is generally higher\nfor LBG samples compared to that of $z \\sim 0$ galaxies from previous\nstudies.We also find that for LBG samples selected by the same absolute\nthreshold magnitude or average halo mass, the correlation between UV magnitudes\nand the environment generally becomes more pronounced as the redshift\ndecreases. On the other hand, for samples with the same effective large-scale\nbias at $z\\sim 4$ and $5$, the marked correlation functions are similar on\nlarge scales.",

Consequently, the\nproblem of identifying satellite occultation events is simplified to searching\nfor points of intersection between two ellipses: the satellite orbit and the\nshadow.

Generally electric and magnetic field measurements require\nconductive elements which significantly distort the field. However,\nelectromagnetic fields can be measured without altering the field via the shift\nthey induce on Rydberg states of alkali atoms in atomic vapor, which are highly\nsensitive to electric fields. Previous field measurements using Rydberg atoms\nutilized electromagnetically induced transparency to read out the shift on the\nstates induced by the fields, but did not provide spatial resolution. In this\nwork, we demonstrate that electromagnetically induced transparency can be\nspatially resolved by imaging the fluorescence of the atoms. We demonstrate\nthat this can be used to image $\\sim$ V/cm scale electric fields in the DC-GHz\nrange and $\\sim$ mT scale static magnetic fields, with minimal distortion to\nthe fields. We also demonstrate the ability to image $\\sim$ 5 mV/cm scale\nfields for resonant microwave radiation and measure standing waves generated by\nthe partial reflection of the vapor cell walls in this regime.

    "abstract": "Real-world decision-making often requires integrating and reasoning over\ninformation from multiple modalities. While recent multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) have shown promise in such tasks, their ability to perform\nmulti-hop reasoning across diverse sources remains insufficiently evaluated.\nExisting benchmarks, such as MMQA, face challenges due to (1) data\ncontamination and (2) a lack of complex queries that necessitate operations\nacross more than two modalities, hindering accurate performance assessment. To\naddress this, we present Financial Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning (FCMR), a\nbenchmark created to analyze the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs by urging them\nto combine information from textual reports, tables, and charts within the\nfinancial domain. FCMR is categorized into three difficulty levels-Easy,\nMedium, and Hard-facilitating a step-by-step evaluation. In particular,\nproblems at the Hard level require precise cross-modal three-hop reasoning and\nare designed to prevent the disregard of any modality. Experiments on this new\nbenchmark reveal that even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle, with the\nbest-performing model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) achieving only 30.4% accuracy on the\nmost challenging tier. We also conduct analysis to provide insights into the\ninner workings of the models, including the discovery of a critical bottleneck\nin the information retrieval phase.",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliable\ndeployment of deep models in real-world scenarios. Recently, from the\nperspective of over-parameterization, a series of methods leveraging weight\nsparsification techniques have shown promising performance. These methods\ntypically focus on selecting important parameters for in-distribution (ID) data\nto reduce the negative impact of redundant parameters on OOD detection.\nHowever, we empirically find that these selected parameters may behave\noverconfidently toward OOD data and hurt OOD detection. To address this issue,\nwe propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method called Instance-aware Test\nPruning (ITP), which performs OOD detection by considering both coarse-grained\nand fine-grained levels of parameter pruning. Specifically, ITP first estimates\nthe class-specific parameter contribution distribution by exploring the ID\ndata. By using the contribution distribution, ITP conducts coarse-grained\npruning to eliminate redundant parameters. More importantly, ITP further adopts\na fine-grained test pruning process based on the right-tailed Z-score test,\nwhich can adaptively remove instance-level overconfident parameters. Finally,\nITP derives OOD scores from the pruned model to achieve more reliable\npredictions. Extensive experiments on widely adopted benchmarks verify the\neffectiveness of ITP, demonstrating its competitive performance.",

Current RAG systems often struggle when retrieval\nmodels fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of\nmore context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive\ncompression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token\ngeneration process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely,\nexisting extractive methods reduce latency but rely on independent,\nnon-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual\ninformation.

Unfortunately, current methods for knowledge\ndistillation in one-time retrieval are ineffective for multi-hop QA due to two\nissues: 1) Posterior information is often defined as the response (i.e. the\nanswer), which may not clearly connect to the query without intermediate\nretrieval; and 2) The large knowledge gap between prior and posterior\nretrievals makes existing distillation methods unstable, even resulting in\nperformance loss.

    "abstract": "Land-use and land cover (LULC) analysis is critical in remote sensing, with\nwide-ranging applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, utilities,\nand urban planning. However, automating LULC map generation using machine\nlearning is rendered challenging due to noisy labels. Typically, the ground\ntruths (e.g. ESRI LULC, MapBioMass) have noisy labels that hamper the model's\nability to learn to accurately classify the pixels. Further, these erroneous\nlabels can significantly distort the performance metrics of a model, leading to\nmisleading evaluations. Traditionally, the ambiguous labels are rectified using\nunsupervised algorithms. These algorithms struggle not only with scalability\nbut also with generalization across different geographies. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a zero-shot approach using the foundation model, Segment\nAnything Model (SAM), to automatically delineate different land parcels/regions\nand leverage them to relabel the unsure pixels by using the local label\nstatistics within each detected region. We achieve a significant reduction in\nlabel noise and an improvement in the performance of the downstream\nsegmentation model by $\\approx 5\\%$ when trained with denoised labels.",

    "abstract": "Toxicity detection is crucial for maintaining the peace of the society. While\nexisting methods perform well on normal toxic contents or those generated by\nspecific perturbation methods, they are vulnerable to evolving perturbation\npatterns. However, in real-world scenarios, malicious users tend to create new\nperturbation patterns for fooling the detectors. For example, some users may\ncircumvent the detector of large language models (LLMs) by adding `I am a\nscientist' at the beginning of the prompt. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nproblem, i.e., continual learning jailbreak perturbation patterns, into the\ntoxicity detection field. To tackle this problem, we first construct a new\ndataset generated by 9 types of perturbation patterns, 7 of them are summarized\nfrom prior work and 2 of them are developed by us. We then systematically\nvalidate the vulnerability of current methods on this new perturbation\npattern-aware dataset via both the zero-shot and fine tuned cross-pattern\ndetection. Upon this, we present the domain incremental learning paradigm and\nthe corresponding benchmark to ensure the detector's robustness to dynamically\nemerging types of perturbed toxic text.

We first obtain the full reduced density matrix\n(tomography) of subregions that have at most 4 sites via quantum Monte Carlo,\nexact diagonalization, and the exact solution in 1d. We then analyze both\nbipartite and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) among the sites in the\nsubregion. To do so, we use a variety of measures including the negativity, as\nwell as a true measure of GME: the genuinely multipartite concurrence (or GME\nconcurrence), and its computationally cheaper lower bound, $I_2$. We provide a\ncomplete proof that $I_2$ bounds the GME concurrence, and show how the\nsymmetries of the state simplify its evaluation. For adjacent sites, we find 3-\nand 4-spin GME present across large portions of the phase diagram, reaching\nmaximum near the quantum critical point. In 1d, we identify the singular\nscaling of the derivative $dI_2/dh$ approaching the critical point. We observe\na sharp decrease of GME with increasing dimensionality, coherent with the\nmonogamous nature of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that GME disappears for\nsubregions consisting of non-adjacent sites in both 2d and 3d, offering a stark\nillustration of the short-ranged nature of entanglement in equilibrium quantum\nmatter arXiv:2402.06677.

By rapidly switching\nbetween two states, a dynamic radiation pattern is generated, resulting in\ndirectional modulation. The current distribution on the arms of the dipole\nantenna are made asymmetric by the balun, which changes the relative phase\nbetween the feed currents. By rapidly switching between two mirrored states,\nthe relative phase shift changes sign, causing the current distribution to\nmanifest asymmetrically on the arms of the dipole antenna. The resultant far\nfield radiation pattern is therefore asymmetric in both states, but mirrored\nbetween the two states. Rapid switching between the two states results in a\nfar-field pattern that is dynamic in amplitude at all angles except for a\nnarrow region of space, which is referred to as the information beam. The\ndynamic radiation pattern causes additional modulation on any transmitted or\nreceived signals, thereby obscuring the information at all angles outside the\ninformation beam. The proposed directional modulation technique is separate\nfrom both the antenna and the rest of the wireless system, and can thus be\nimplemented in a black box form in wireless communications or sensing systems.\nWe demonstrate the concept in a 1.86 GHz printed dipole antenna, demonstrating\nthe transmission of 256-QAM signals.",

The goal is to characterize the dynamics of the system and identify\nthe signatures left by the boson cloud on the gravitational waves emitted by\nthe binary. The predictions can be tested with current and future\ninterferometers, such as LISA, LIGO, DECIGO, Einstein Telescope and TianQin.\nFirst, I demonstrate that the cloud catalyzes the binary formation by\nincreasing the dynamical capture cross section.

After that, I\nexamine the accretion of the cloud on the companion black hole.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising for event-based object\nrecognition and detection due to their spiking nature but lack efficient\ntraining methods, leading to gradient vanishing and high computational\ncomplexity, especially in deep SNNs. Additionally, existing SNN frameworks\noften fail to effectively handle multi-scale spatiotemporal features, leading\nto increased data redundancy and reduced accuracy. To address these issues, we\npropose CREST, a novel conjointly-trained spike-driven framework to exploit\nspatiotemporal dynamics in event-based object detection. We introduce the\nconjoint learning rule to accelerate SNN learning and alleviate gradient\nvanishing. It also supports dual operation modes for efficient and flexible\nimplementation on different hardware types. Additionally, CREST features a\nfully spike-driven framework with a multi-scale spatiotemporal event integrator\n(MESTOR) and a spatiotemporal-IoU (ST-IoU) loss. Our approach achieves superior\nobject recognition & detection performance and up to 100X energy efficiency\ncompared with state-of-the-art SNN algorithms on three datasets, providing an\nefficient solution for event-based object detection algorithms suitable for SNN\nhardware implementation.",

Firstly, we examine the application\nof both image-space and latent-space watermarking methods on a single image,\nwhere we propose a custom watermark remover network which preserves one of the\nwatermarking modalities while completely removing the other during decoding.\nThen, we investigate localized blurring attacks (LBA) on watermarked images\nbased on the GradCAM heatmap acquired from the watermark decoder in order to\nreduce the amount of degradation to the target image. Our evaluation suggests\nthat 1) implementing the watermark remover model to preserve one of the\nwatermark modalities when decoding the other modality slightly improves on the\nbaseline performance, and that 2) LBA degrades the image significantly less\ncompared to uniform blurring of the entire image.

MBTI personality detection has garnered considerable research\ninterest and has evolved significantly over the years. However, this task tends\nto be overly optimistic, as it currently does not align well with the natural\ndistribution of population personality traits. Specifically, (1) the\nself-reported labels in existing datasets result in incorrect labeling issues,\nand (2) the hard labels fail to capture the full range of population\npersonality distributions. In this paper, we optimize the task by constructing\nMBTIBench, the first manually annotated high-quality MBTI personality detection\ndataset with soft labels, under the guidance of psychologists. As for the first\nchallenge, MBTIBench effectively solves the incorrect labeling issues, which\naccount for 29.58% of the data. As for the second challenge, we estimate soft\nlabels by deriving the polarity tendency of samples. The obtained soft labels\nconfirm that there are more people with non-extreme personality traits.\nExperimental results not only highlight the polarized predictions and biases in\nLLMs as key directions for future research, but also confirm that soft labels\ncan provide more benefits to other psychological tasks than hard labels.

Building upon the concept of\nLLM-as-a-judge, we introduce a novel framework for rigorously evaluating the\nreliability of LLM judgments, leveraging McDonald's omega. We evaluate the\nreliability of LLMs when judging the outputs of other LLMs on standard\nsingle-turn and multi-turn benchmarks, simultaneously investigating the impact\nof temperature on reliability. By analyzing these results, we demonstrate the\nlimitations of fixed randomness and the importance of considering multiple\nsamples, which we show has significant implications for downstream\napplications.

This is usually done through the process of\nfine-tuning LLMs on specifically annotated datasets to determine the relevance\nbetween queries and items. However, there are two limitations when LLMs are\nnaively employed for relevance modeling through fine-tuning and inference.\nFirst, it is not inherently efficient for performing nuanced tasks beyond\nsimple yes or no answers, such as assessing search relevance. It may therefore\ntend to be overconfident and struggle to distinguish fine-grained degrees of\nrelevance (e.g., strong relevance, weak relevance, irrelevance) used in search\nengines.

In this paper, we propose a flow-matching based\nemotional TTS framework with a novel approach for emotion intensity modeling to\nfacilitate fine-grained control over emotion rendering at the phoneme, word,\nand utterance levels. We introduce a hierarchical emotion distribution (ED)\nextractor that captures a quantifiable ED embedding across different speech\nsegment levels. Additionally, we explore various acoustic features and assess\ntheir impact on emotion intensity modeling. During TTS training, the\nhierarchical ED embedding effectively captures the variance in emotion\nintensity from the reference audio and correlates it with linguistic and\nspeaker information. The TTS model not only generates emotional speech during\ninference, but also quantitatively controls the emotion rendering over the\nspeech constituents. Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework in terms of speech quality, emotional\nexpressiveness, and hierarchical emotion control.",

The core of our framework\nis first to construct a safety reference model from an initially aligned model\nto amplify safety-related features in neurons. We then utilize this reference\nmodel to identify safety-critical neurons, which we prepare as patches.\nFinally, we selectively restore only those neurons that exhibit significant\nsimilarity differences by transplanting these prepared patches, thereby\nminimally altering the fine-tuned model. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nsignificant safety enhancements in fine-tuned models across multiple downstream\ntasks, while greatly maintaining task-level accuracy.

However, the limited\ncoverage and energy of UAVs make it difficult to provide timely wireless\nservice for large-scale sensor networks, which also exist in multiple UAVs. To\nthis end, the advanced collaboration mechanism of UAVs urgently needs to be\ndesigned. In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV collaborative scheme for\nseamless data collection and transmission, where UAVs are dispatched to\ncollection points (CPs) to collect and transmit the time-critical data to the\nground base station (BS) simultaneously through the cooperative backhaul link.\nSpecifically, the mission completion time is minimized by optimizing the\ntrajectories, task allocation, collection time scheduling, and transmission\ntopology of UAVs while ensuring backhaul link to the BS. However, the\nformulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve directly. To tackle\nthis problem, the CP locations and transmission topology of UAVs are obtained\nby sensor node (SN) clustering and region division. Next, the transmission\nconnectivity condition between UAVs is derived to facilitate the trajectory\ndiscretization and thus reduce the dimensions of variables. This simplifies the\nproblem to optimizing the UAV hovering locations, hovering time, and CP serving\nsequence. Then, we propose a point-matching-based trajectory planning algorithm\nto solve the problem efficiently.

It nevertheless faces the cross-modal problem: the obtained\nmessages tend to correspond to multiple targets. To address aforementioned\nproblems, we propose a Dual Semantic Similarity-Supervised VLM (DuSSS) for\nSSMIS.

Furthermore, a novel VLM-based SSMIS\nnetwork is designed to compensate for the quality deficiencies of\npseudo-labels.

We focus on the multi-scalar\nmultiplication (MSM) that accounts for the majority of computation time spent\nin zk-SNARK systems. The MSM calculations extensive rely on modular arithmetic\nso highly optimized Intel IP Libraries for modular arithmetic are used. The\nproposed architecture exploits the parallelism inherent to MSM and is\nimplemented using the Intel OneAPI framework for FPGAs.

In this work, we employ the TNG50-1 numerical simulation to classify\nsatellite systems into plane and non-plane structures, based on their geometric\nand dynamical properties. We focus on comparing the characteristics of these\nplane and non-plane structures. The plane structures in TNG50-1 exhibit a mean\nheight of 5.24 kpc, with most of them found in galaxy groups with intermediate\nhalo virial masses within the narrow range of $10^{11.5}$ to $10^{12.5}$\n$M_\\odot$. Statistical analyses reveal that plane structures of satellite\ngalaxies constitute approximately 11.30% in TNG50-1, with this proportion\nincreasing to 27.11% in TNG100-1, aligning closely with previous observations.\nAdditionally, central galaxies in clusters and groups hosting co-rotating plane\nstructures are intermediate massive and slightly metal-poorer than those in\nnon-plane structures. Significant difference are found between in-plane and\nout-of-plane satellite galaxies, suggesting that in-plane satellites exhibit\nslightly longer formation times, and more active interstellar matter cycles.\nThe satellites within these plane structures in TNG50-1 exhibit similar radial\ndistributions with observations, but are fainter and more massive than those in\nobservational plane structures, due to the over- or under-estimation of galaxy\nproperties in simulations. Our analysis also shows that the satellite plane\nstructures might be effected by some low- or high-mass galaxies temporarily\nentered the plane structures due to the gravitational potential of the clusters\nand groups after the plane structures had formed.",

In total, we identify nine pulsar candidates\ntowards six Fermi sources that are worthy of follow-up for pulsation searches.\nWe also report 41 steep spectrum radio galaxy candidates that may be of\ninterest in searches for high-redshift radio galaxies. We show that MALS due to\nits excellent continuum sensitivity can detect 80 percent of the known pulsar\npopulation. This exhibits the promise of identifying exotic pulsar candidates\nwith future image-based surveys with the Square Kilometre and its precursors.",

However, when the context length L becomes very large (e.g.,\n128K), the amount of potentially redundant information in the context tends to\nincrease. The redundant context not only hampers the modeling representation\nperformance but also incurs unnecessary computational and storage overhead. In\nthis paper, we propose a plug-and-play Core Context Aware (CCA) Attention for\nefficient long-context modeling, comprising two complementary modules: 1)\nGlobality-aware pooling module groups input tokens and dynamically compresses\neach group into one core token based on their significance. In this way, our\nmethod automatically focuses and strengthens core context while diminishing\nredundancy during the learning process, leading to effective long-term\ndependency modeling. 2) Locality-preserving module incorporates neighboring\ntokens to preserve local context for detailed representation. Notably, our\nCCA-Attention is able to replace the self-attention module in existing LLMs\nwith minimal fine-tuning cost.

On the other hand, Large Language Models\n(LLMs) can be considered databases with a wealth of knowledge learned from the\nweb data, and they have recently gained attention due to their potential\napplication as recommendation systems. Although approaches that treat LLMs as\nrecommendation systems can leverage LLMs' high recommendation literacy, their\ninput token limitations make it impractical to consider the entire\nrecommendation domain dataset and result in scalability issues. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a LLM's Intuition-aware Knowledge graph Reasoning\nmodel (LIKR). Our main idea is to treat LLMs as reasoners that output intuitive\nexploration strategies for KGs. To integrate the knowledge of LLMs and KGs, we\ntrained a recommendation agent through reinforcement learning using a reward\nfunction that integrates different recommendation strategies, including LLM's\nintuition and KG embeddings. By incorporating temporal awareness through prompt\nengineering and generating textual representations of user preferences from\nlimited interactions, LIKR can improve recommendation performance in cold-start\nscenarios. Furthermore, LIKR can avoid scalability issues by using KGs to\nrepresent recommendation domain datasets and limiting the LLM's output to KG\nexploration strategies.

Recently, multi-modal fusion and knowledge distillation methods for\n3D object detection have been proposed to solve this problem, which are\ntime-consuming during the training phase and not friendly to memory cost.

Our proposed framework, PromptDet, comprises two integral\ncomponents: a general camera-based detection module, exemplified by models like\nBEVDet and BEVDepth, and a LiDAR-assisted prompter. The LiDAR-assisted prompter\nleverages the LiDAR points as a complementary signal, enriched with a minimal\nset of additional trainable parameters. Notably, our framework is flexible due\nto our prompt-like design, which can not only be used as a lightweight\nmulti-modal fusion method but also as a camera-only method for 3D object\ndetection during the inference phase. Extensive experiments on nuScenes\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed PromptDet.

The core of this new graph learning paradigm lies in the synergistic\ncombination of GNNs' ability to capture complex structural relationships and\nLLMs' proficiency in understanding informative contexts from the rich textual\ndescriptions of graphs. Therefore, we can leverage graph description texts with\nrich semantic context to fundamentally enhance Data quality, thereby improving\nthe representational capacity of model-centric approaches in line with\ndata-centric machine learning principles.

    "abstract": "In the Cluster Editing problem, sometimes known as (unweighted) Correlation\nClustering, we must insert and delete a minimum number of edges to achieve a\ngraph in which every connected component is a clique. Owing to its applications\nin computational biology, social network analysis, machine learning, and\nothers, this problem has been widely studied for decades and is still\nundergoing active research. There exist several parameterized algorithms for\ngeneral graphs, but little is known about the complexity of the problem on\nspecific classes of graphs.\n  Among the few important results in this direction, if only deletions are\nallowed, the problem can be solved in polynomial time on cographs, which are\nthe $P_4$-free graphs. However, the complexity of the broader editing problem\non cographs is still open. We show that even on a very restricted subclass of\ncographs, the problem is NP-hard, W[1]-hard when parameterized by the number\n$p$ of desired clusters, and that time $n^{o(p/\\log p)}$ is forbidden under the\nETH. This shows that the editing variant is substantially harder than the\ndeletion-only case, and that hardness holds for the many superclasses of\ncographs (including graphs of clique-width at most $2$, perfect graphs, circle\ngraphs, permutation graphs). On the other hand, we provide an almost tight\nupper bound of time $n^{O(p)}$, which is a consequence of a more general\n$n^{O(cw \\cdot p)}$ time algorithm, where $cw$ is the clique-width. Given that\nforbidding $P_4$s maintains NP-hardness, we look at $\\{P_4, C_4\\}$-free graphs,\nalso known as trivially perfect graphs, and provide a cubic-time algorithm for\nthis class.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal intent understanding is a significant research area that requires\neffective leveraging of multiple modalities to analyze human language. Existing\nmethods face two main challenges in this domain. Firstly, they have limitations\nin capturing the nuanced and high-level semantics underlying complex\nin-distribution (ID) multimodal intents. Secondly, they exhibit poor\ngeneralization when confronted with unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) data in\nreal-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for\nboth ID classification and OOD detection (MIntOOD). We first introduce a\nweighted feature fusion network that models multimodal representations. This\nnetwork dynamically learns the importance of each modality, adapting to\nmultimodal contexts. To develop discriminative representations for both tasks,\nwe synthesize pseudo-OOD data from convex combinations of ID data and engage in\nmultimodal representation learning from both coarse-grained and fine-grained\nperspectives. The coarse-grained perspective focuses on distinguishing between\nID and OOD binary classes, while the fine-grained perspective not only enhances\nthe discrimination between different ID classes but also captures\ninstance-level interactions between ID and OOD samples, promoting proximity\namong similar instances and separation from dissimilar ones. We establish\nbaselines for three multimodal intent datasets and build an OOD benchmark.\nExtensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves OOD detection performance with a 3~10% increase in AUROC\nscores while achieving new state-of-the-art results in ID classification.

The uniformity of resistive\nswitching is strongly dependent on the interplay between these transport\nproperties. We identify two distinct pathways for achieving optimal High\nResistance State (HRS) uniformity with standard deviation-to-mean ratios as low\nas 0.045, each governed by different balances of electrical and thermal\ntransport mechanisms.

To overcome this, we\npropose a differentiable surrogate loss that is computed on large batches,\nnearly equivalent to the entire training set. This computationally intensive\nprocess is made feasible through an implementation that bypasses the GPU memory\nlimitations.

    "abstract": "The copper metaborate CuB2O4 (CBO) has been studied within the parametric\nspace of magnetic field (B) and temperature (T), showing a series of distinct\nphases, including commensurate and incommensurate magnetic orders, as well as\nmagnetic soliton phases. However, no single study has simultaneously\ndemonstrated all these phases. This work presents the first comprehensive\nconstruction of the complex B vs T phase diagram for B = 0-9 T (B perpendicular\nto the c axis) and T = 0.1-25 K, utilizing thermodynamic probes, magnetic\nmeasurements, and neutron scattering on a single batch of CBO crystals. Our\nfindings elucidate new magnetic phases and regimes. First-principles\ncalculations help to gain a deeper and intricate understanding of this complex\nphase diagram. The emergence of various phases within such a narrow B and T\nregime is attributed to two primary mechanisms: the delicate competition\nbetween ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions, and the weak exchange\nand superexchange interactions within and between the Cu(A) and Cu(B)\nsublattices. This competition also leads to a magnetically frustrated ground\nstate at absolute zero where the total magnetic entropy release from high to\nlow temperatures is only 0.76Rln2, lower than Rln2 expected for copper spin\n1/2. Taking CBO as an example, the present work elucidates the mechanisms\nunderlying the formation of complex magnetic phases.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents CLIP-RLDrive, a new reinforcement learning (RL)-based\nframework for improving the decision-making of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in\ncomplex urban driving scenarios, particularly in unsignalized intersections. To\nachieve this goal, the decisions for AVs are aligned with human-like\npreferences through Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)-based reward\nshaping. One of the primary difficulties in RL scheme is designing a suitable\nreward model, which can often be challenging to achieve manually due to the\ncomplexity of the interactions and the driving scenarios. To deal with this\nissue, this paper leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs), particularly CLIP,\nto build an additional reward model based on visual and textual cues.",

    "abstract": "State Space Models (SSMs) are powerful tools for modeling sequential data in\ncomputer vision and time series analysis domains. However, traditional SSMs are\nlimited by fixed, one-dimensional sequential processing, which restricts their\nability to model non-local interactions in high-dimensional data. While methods\nlike Mamba and VMamba introduce selective and flexible scanning strategies,\nthey rely on predetermined paths, which fails to efficiently capture complex\ndependencies. We introduce Graph-Generating State Space Models (GG-SSMs), a\nnovel framework that overcomes these limitations by dynamically constructing\ngraphs based on feature relationships. Using Chazelle's Minimum Spanning Tree\nalgorithm, GG-SSMs adapt to the inherent data structure, enabling robust\nfeature propagation across dynamically generated graphs and efficiently\nmodeling complex dependencies. We validate GG-SSMs on 11 diverse datasets,\nincluding event-based eye-tracking, ImageNet classification, optical flow\nestimation, and six time series datasets. GG-SSMs achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance across all tasks, surpassing existing methods by significant\nmargins. Specifically, GG-SSM attains a top-1 accuracy of 84.9% on ImageNet,\noutperforming prior SSMs by 1%, reducing the KITTI-15 error rate to 2.77%, and\nimproving eye-tracking detection rates by up to 0.33% with fewer parameters.\nThese results demonstrate that dynamic scanning based on feature relationships\nsignificantly improves SSMs' representational power and efficiency, offering a\nversatile tool for various applications in computer vision and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Verifying and attributing factual claims is essential for the safe and\neffective use of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare. A core component\nof factuality evaluation is fact decomposition, the process of breaking down\ncomplex clinical statements into fine-grained atomic facts for verification.\nRecent work has proposed fact decomposition, which uses LLMs to rewrite source\ntext into concise sentences conveying a single piece of information, to\nfacilitate fine-grained fact verification. However, clinical documentation\nposes unique challenges for fact decomposition due to dense terminology and\ndiverse note types and remains understudied. To address this gap and explore\nthese challenges, we present FactEHR, an NLI dataset consisting of document\nfact decompositions for 2,168 clinical notes spanning four types from three\nhospital systems, resulting in 987,266 entailment pairs. We assess the\ngenerated facts on different axes, from entailment evaluation of LLMs to a\nqualitative analysis. Our evaluation, including review by the clinicians,\nreveals substantial variability in LLM performance for fact decomposition. For\nexample, Gemini-1.5-Flash consistently generates relevant and accurate facts,\nwhile Llama-3 8B produces fewer and less consistent outputs. The results\nunderscore the need for better LLM capabilities to support factual verification\nin clinical text.",

In this method, optical\nvariations of AGNs are monitored and CL-AGNs may appear to have a pattern of\nbeing bluer when in brightening flare-like events. Applying this method,\npreviously-classified type 2 AGNs that show the bluer-when-brighter (BWB)\npattern are selected. Among more than ten thousands type 2 AGNs classified in\nthe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we find 73 candidates with possibly the\nstrongest BWB pattern. We note that 13 of them have previously been reported as\nCL-AGNs. We have observed nine candidates, and found that five among them\nshowed the CL transition from type 2 to type 1. In addition, we also test\nextending the selection to previously-classified type 1 AGNs in the SDSS by\nfinding sources with a possible redder-when-brighter pattern, but none of the\nthree sources observed by us is found to show the transition from type 1 to\ntype 2. We discuss the variation properties in both the success and failure\ncases, and plan to observe more candidates selected with the method. From the\nobservational results, a detailed comparison between the CL-AGNs and none\nCL-AGNs will help quantitatively refine the selection criteria and in turn\nallow us to configure the general properties of CLAGNs.",
