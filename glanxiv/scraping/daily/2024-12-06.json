    "abstract": "Subtracting the changing sky contribution from the near-infrared (NIR)\nspectra of faint astronomical objects is challenging and crucial to a wide\nrange of science cases such as estimating the velocity dispersions of dwarf\ngalaxies, studying the gas dynamics in faint galaxies, measuring accurate\nredshifts, and any spectroscopic studies of faint targets. Since the sky\nbackground varies with time and location, NIR spectral observations, especially\nthose employing fiber spectrometers and targeting extended sources, require\nfrequent sky-only observations for calibration. However, sky subtraction can be\noptimized with sufficient a priori knowledge of the sky's variability. In this\nwork, we explore how to optimize sky subtraction by analyzing 1075\nhigh-resolution NIR spectra from the CFHT's SPIRou on Maunakea, and we estimate\nthe variability of 481 hydroxyl (OH) lines. These spectra were collected during\ntwo sets of three nights dedicated to obtaining sky observations every five and\na half minutes. During the first set, we observed how the Moon affects the NIR,\nwhich has not been accurately measured at these wavelengths. We suggest\naccounting for the Moon contribution at separation distances less than 10\ndegrees when 1) reconstructing the sky using principal component analysis 2)\nobserving targets at Y JHK mags fainter than ~15 and 3) attempting a sky\nsubtraction better than 1%. We also identified 126 spectral doublets, or OH\nlines that split into at least two components, at SPIRou's resolution. In\naddition, we used Lomb-Scargle Periodograms and Gaussian process regression to\nestimate that most OH lines vary on similar timescales, which provides a\nvaluable input for IR spectroscopic survey strategies. The data and code\ndeveloped for this study are publicly available.",

The physics of cryogenic flows are highly\ncomplex due to the sensitive nature of phase transformation from liquid to\nbubbly liquid and vapor, eventually resulting in cavitating flows at the\nambient temperature owing to the very low boiling point of cryogenic fluids,\nwhich asserts us to classify such flows under multi-phase flow physics regime.\nThis work elucidates the modeling of bubbly flow for cryogenic fluids such as\nliquid nitrogen in a converging-diverging venturi-like flow device known as\ncavitating venturi, a passive flow control metering device. The numerical works\nin literature are usually limited to modeling iso-thermal bubbly flows such as\nwater devoid of involving energy equations because there is no occurrence of\ninterface heat transfer as latent heat of vaporization of water is higher,\nunlike cryogenic fluids which are sensitive to phase change at ambient\nconditions. So, to realize an appropriate model for modeling cryogenic bubbly\nflows such as liquid nitrogen flow, the effect of heat transfer at the\ninterface and convective heat transfer from the surrounding liquid to the\ntraversing bubble needs to be included. Numerical modeling using an in-house\ncode involving a finite-difference method The numerical results showed the\nimportance of including the heat transport equation due to convection and at\nthe interface of bubble-fluid as a significant source term for the bubble\ndynamics. The work is supported by computational simulation using a commercial\nCFD package for 2-dimensional simulations to predict a characterizing\nparameter, namely cavitation length.

The primary difference is that the NV probes\nlong-wavelength magnetic noise outside the sample, while the nuclear spin\nprobes local hyperfine noise inside the sample.

The test is based on the shape\nparameters of the Power generalized Weibull (PgW) distribution. When both shape\nparameters are equal to one, the PgW distribution reduces to an exponential\ndistribution, i.e. a constant hazard function. This is interpreted as no\ntemporal association between drug and adverse event. The Bayesian PgWSP test\ninvolves comparing a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) around one\nreflecting the null hypothesis with estimated credibility intervals reflecting\nthe posterior means of the shape parameters. The decision to raise a signal is\nbased on the outcomes of the ROPE test and the selected combination rule for\nthese outcomes.

The kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$ ($T_{\\rm c}$ ${\\simeq}$\n6.5 K) exhibits a hierarchy of charge order transitions: primary ($T_{\\rm\nco,I}$ ${\\simeq}$ 400 K), secondary ($T_{\\rm co,II}$ ${\\simeq}$ 80 K), and an\nadditional transition at ($T^{*}$ $\\simeq$ 35 K). The transitions at $T_{\\rm\nco,II}$ and $T^{*}$ are linked to electronic and magnetic responses as revealed\nby muon-spin rotation and magnetotransport experiments. However, the connection\nbetween superconductivity, charge order, and electronic responses has remained\nelusive. By employing magnetotransport and X-ray diffraction techniques under\npressures of up to 40 GPa, we observe that $T_{\\rm c}$ rises to 9 K at 2 GPa,\nremains nearly constant up to 12 GPa, and then decreases to 2 K at 40 GPa,\nresulting in a dome-shaped phase diagram. The resistivity anomaly at $T^{*}$\nand magnetoresistance also exhibit a similar dome-shaped pressure dependence.\nFurthermore, we find that charge order transitions from long-range to\nshort-range above 12 GPa, correlating with the suppression of $T_{\\rm c}$,\nsuggesting superconductivity is closely tied to the charge-ordered state.\nSpecifically, $T_{\\rm c}$ peaks when charge order and the normal-state\nelectronic responses are optimized. In contrast to systems like the cuprates,\ntransition metal dichalcogenides, and other kagome materials, where\nsuperconductivity typically competes with charge order, LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$\ndisplays a pronounced interdependence between these two phenomena. This\ndistinctive behavior sheds new light on the connection between\nsuperconductivity and charge order, offering avenues for theoretical\nadvancements in understanding superconductivity.",

By analyzing the (local) weak values for any given run of a quantum\ncircuit, we present evidence for a localized account of any circuit's behavior.\nSpecifically, even if the state is massively entangled, the weak values are\nfound to evolve only when they pass through a local circuit element. They\notherwise remain constant and do not evolve when other qubits pass through\ntheir circuit elements. A further surprise is found when two qubits are brought\ntogether in an exchange interaction, as their weak values then evolve according\nto a simple classical equation. The weak values are subject to both past and\nfuture constraints, so they can only be determined by considering the entire\ncircuit \"all-at-once\", as in action principles. In the context of a few basic\nquantum gates, we show how an all-at-once model of a complete circuit could\ngenerate weak values without using state vectors as an intermediate step. Since\nthese gates comprise a universal quantum gate set, this lends support to the\nclaim that any quantum circuit can plausibly be underpinned by localized\nvariables, providing a realistic, lower-level account of generic quantum\nsystems.",

We show\nthat in the NANOGrav 15-yr data set, the integrated pulse profile of PSR\nJ1022+1001 as seen by the Arecibo radio telescope at 430, 1380, and 2030 MHz\nvaries considerably in its shape from observation to observation.

Time-dependent deviations\nin the feed's polarimetric response (PR) could cause mixing between the\nintensity I and the other Stokes parameters, leading to the observed\nvariability. We calibrate the PR using a mixture of Measurement Equation\nModeling and Measurement Equation Template Matching techniques. The resulting\nprofiles are no less variable than those calibrated using the IFA method, nor\ndo they provide an improvement in the timing quality of this pulsar.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore classical electromagnetic radiation using a dual\nfour-dimensional potential $\\Theta^\\mu$ approach. Our focus is on the Planar\nDipole Blade Antenna (PDBA), a system consisting of two flat conductive regions\non the $xy$-plane, separated by a gap $\\mathcal{G}$, with alternating\npotentials applied to the conductors. This method emphasizes the use of the\nscalar magnetic potential $\\Psi(\\boldsymbol{r},t)$ and the electric vector\npotential $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$, which generates the electric field\n$\\boldsymbol{E}(\\boldsymbol{r},t)=\\nabla\\times\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}(\\boldsymbol{r},t)$\nin free space. These potentials replace the standard magnetic vector potential\n$\\boldsymbol{A}$ and the scalar electric potential $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ in our\nanalysis. For harmonic radiation, the electromagnetic field can be expressed in\nterms of the electric vector potential $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}(\\boldsymbol{r},t)$.\nWe derive a corresponding retarded vector potential for $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}$\nin terms of a two-dimensional vector field\n$\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{W}}(\\boldsymbol{r},t)$, which flows through the gap\nregion $\\mathcal{G}$. This dual analytical approach yields mathematically\nequivalent expressions for modeling Planar Blade Antennas, analogous to those\nused for ribbons in the region $\\mathcal{G}$, simplifying the mathematical\nproblem. In the gapless limit, this approach reduces the two-dimensional\nradiator (PDBA) to a one-dimensional wire-loop-like antenna, significantly\nsimplifying the problem's dimensionality. This leads to a dual version of\nJefimenko's equations for the electric field, where $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{W}}$\nbehaves like a surface current in the gap region and satisfies a continuity\ncondition. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we provide an\nanalytical solution for a PDBA with a thin annular gap at low frequency.",

This report addresses these challenges by presenting a\ncomprehensive evaluation of coordination and routing capabilities in a novel\nmulti-agent collaboration framework. We evaluate two key operational modes: (1)\na coordination mode enabling complex task completion through parallel\ncommunication and payload referencing, and (2) a routing mode for efficient\nmessage forwarding between agents. We benchmark on a set of handcrafted\nscenarios from three enterprise domains, which are publicly released with the\nreport. For coordination capabilities, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\ninter-agent communication and payload referencing mechanisms, achieving\nend-to-end goal success rates of 90%. Our analysis yields several key findings:\nmulti-agent collaboration enhances goal success rates by up to 70% compared to\nsingle-agent approaches in our benchmarks; payload referencing improves\nperformance on code-intensive tasks by 23%; latency can be substantially\nreduced with a routing mechanism that selectively bypasses agent orchestration.\nThese findings offer valuable guidance for enterprise deployments of\nmulti-agent systems and advance the development of scalable, efficient\nmulti-agent collaboration frameworks.",

Thorium dioxide is a\ndiamagnet whose thermal properties are governed by lattice vibration. The\naddition of paramagnetic uranium ion leads to the emergence of magnetic effects\nthat alter the thermophysical properties noticeably even at room temperature.\nThe interaction of phonons with magnetic moments of uranium 5f electrons\nmediated by magnetoelastic coupling results in an anomalous low-temperature\nthermal conductivity profile. Analysis of the magnetic susceptibility\nmeasurements indicates a uranium-concentration-dependent reduction in effective\nmagnetic moment previously associated with the dynamic Jahn-Teller (DJT)\neffect. The T2g Raman peak position follows a nonlinear trend as a function of\nuranium concentration and hints that these Raman active optical modes play a\nrole in either DJT or mediating quadrupole-quadrupole interactions. A first\nprinciple-based thermal transport model is implemented to explain the\nlow-temperature transport measurements, where the anomalous reduction is\nattributed to phonon-spin resonant scattering. The interplay between spins and\nphonons is also captured using high-resolution inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS)\nmeasurements of phonon linewidths. Our results provide new insights into the\nphonon interactions with the magnetic excitations governing DJT effect and\nimpacting the low-temperature thermal transport processes in this material\nsystem.

While\nthermal convection schemes using two-phase cooling in microfluidic networks or\nliquid immersion are proving effective, further progress requires tackling the\nintrinsic thermal resistance of a liquid/solid (L/S) interface, quantified by\nthe thermal slip length. Theoretical models and experimental tools for\nestimating this length have been developed for superfluid/metal interfaces but\nno comparable tools exist for systems at non-cryogenic temperatures.\nResearchers have therefore come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular\ndynamics simulations to understand the influence of various parameters. But\ndespite considerable effort, no actual relations have been proposed. Our study\nof 180 systems describing a liquid layer confined between identical crystals at\ndifferent temperatures highlights the influence of correlated behavior\nthroughout the L/S contact zone. When rescaled by key variables in the zone,\nthe data for the thermal slip length exhibit excellent collapse onto two power\nlaw relations dependent on the peak value of the in-plane structure factor of\nthe first liquid layer and the ratio of dominant frequencies pegged to the\nmaxima in the vibrational density of states of the first liquid and solid\nlayer.

Specifically, it\nconsiders a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean\nthermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both\nhorizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified\nvariant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale\ninstabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to\nmodel mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability.\n  The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is\nderived from an Euler--Poincar\\'e variational principle, culminating in a\nKelvin--Noether theorem, previously established solely for the\nprimitive-equation parent model. The model's Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian\nstructure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from\na Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the\nrelevant momentum map.\n  Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the\nCasimirs of the Lie--Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir\nfamily forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket, which results in\npotential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects\nunder the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry\nare explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler--Poincar\\'e\nprinciple when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration\nendpoints.\n  The dual Euler--Poincar\\'e/Lie--Poisson formalism provides a unified\nframework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal\nflow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.",

While\npromising in modeling the geo-semantics, road network-based models overlooked\nthe service-semantic goals (e.g., workload equality) in LBS service. In this\npaper, we point out that the AOI segmentation problem can be naturally\nformulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), which gradually chooses a nearby\nAOI for each grid in the current AOI's border.

    "abstract": "Generating high-fidelity, controllable, and annotated training data is\ncritical for autonomous driving. Existing methods typically generate a single\ndata form directly from a coarse scene layout, which not only fails to output\nrich data forms required for diverse downstream tasks but also struggles to\nmodel the direct layout-to-data distribution. In this paper, we introduce\nUniScene, the first unified framework for generating three key data forms -\nsemantic occupancy, video, and LiDAR - in driving scenes. UniScene employs a\nprogressive generation process that decomposes the complex task of scene\ngeneration into two hierarchical steps: (a) first generating semantic occupancy\nfrom a customized scene layout as a meta scene representation rich in both\nsemantic and geometric information, and then (b) conditioned on occupancy,\ngenerating video and LiDAR data, respectively, with two novel transfer\nstrategies of Gaussian-based Joint Rendering and Prior-guided Sparse Modeling.\nThis occupancy-centric approach reduces the generation burden, especially for\nintricate scenes, while providing detailed intermediate representations for the\nsubsequent generation stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniScene\noutperforms previous SOTAs in the occupancy, video, and LiDAR generation, which\nalso indeed benefits downstream driving tasks.

Further, we provide a novel model dubbed\nSwap Path Net (SPNet) which implements both query-centric and object-centric\ntraining objectives, and can swap between the two while using the same weights.\nUsing SPNet, we show that query-centric pre-training, followed by\nobject-centric fine-tuning, achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard\nPRW and CUHK-SYSU person search benchmarks, with 96.4% mAP on CUHK-SYSU and\n61.2% mAP on PRW.

In this work, we use both SWIFT and NuSTAR\nobservations in order to derive the most accurate yet Compton-thick AGN\nluminosity function. We, first, compile a sample of candidate Compton-thick AGN\n(logN_H(cm^-2)= 24-25) detected in the Swift BAT all-sky survey in the 14-195\nkeV band. We confirm that they are Compton-thick sources by using the follow-up\nNuSTAR observations already presented in the literature. Our sample is composed\nof 44 sources, consistent with a column density of logN_H(cm^-2)=24-25 at the\n90% confidence level. These have intrinsic luminosities higher than L(10-50\nkeV) ~ 3x10^41 erg/s and are found up to a redshift of z=0.05 (200 Mpc). We\nderive the luminosity function of Compton-thick AGN using a Bayesian\nmethodology where both the full column density and the luminosity distributions\nare taken into account. The faint end of the luminosity function is flat,\nhaving a slope of 0.01(+0.51,-0.74), rather arguing against a numerous\npopulation of low luminosity Compton-thick AGN.

In this paper, we\nsystematically investigate the potential of including a broad stock market\nindex LETF in long-term, dynamically-optimal investment strategies designed to\nmaximize the outperformance over standard investment benchmarks in the sense of\nthe information ratio (IR). Our results exploit the observation that positions\nin a LETF deliver call-like payoffs, so that the addition of a LETF to a\nportfolio can be a convenient way to add inexpensive leverage while providing\ndownside protection. Under stylized assumptions, we present and analyze\nclosed-form IR-optimal investment strategies using either a LETF or\nstandard/vanilla ETF (VETF) on the same equity index, which provides the\nnecessary intuition for the potential and benefits of LETFs. In more realistic\nsettings, we use a neural network-based approach to determine the IR-optimal\nstrategies, trained on bootstrapped historical data. We find that IR-optimal\nstrategies with a broad stock market LETF are not only more likely to\noutperform the benchmark than IR-optimal strategies derived using the\ncorresponding VETF, but are able to achieve partial stochastic dominance over\nthe benchmark and VETF-based strategies in terms of terminal wealth.",

Despite its widespread\noccurrence, a unified theory of chaotic mixing across these diverse systems\nremains to be developed. Furthermore, previous studies have focused on fluid\nstretching mechanisms but the folding mechanisms are largely unknown. We\naddress these shortcomings by presenting a unified theory of mixing in porous\nmedia. We thus show that fluid stretching and folding (SF) arise through the\nsame fundamental kinematics driven by the topological complexity of the medium.\nWe find that mixing in continuous porous media manifests as discontinuous\nmixing through a combination of SF and cutting and shuffling (CS) actions, but\nthe rate of mixing is governed by SF only. Conversely, discrete porous media\ninvolves SF motions only. We unify these diverse systems and mechanisms by\nshowing that continuous media represents an analog of discrete media with\nfinite-sized grain contacts. This unified theory provides insights into the\ngeneration of pore-scale chaotic mixing and points to design of novel porous\narchitectures with tuneable mixing and transport properties.",

These\nsalient points serve as anchor points to predict waypoints for long-range\nmovement, such as reaching target poses in free-space. Once near a salient\npoint, SPHINX learns to switch to predicting dense end-effector movements given\nclose-up wrist images for precise phases of a task.

    "abstract": "We investigate the detectability of gamma-ray emission from long-lived\nradioactive isotopes in r-process-enriched remnants, focusing on how\nassumptions about their spatial distribution introduce uncertainty into\ndetection prospects. Using a suite of physically motivated models for the\nGalactic distribution of kilonova and supernova remnants, we simulate synthetic\nremnant populations and compute their time-evolving gamma-ray spectra. We then\ncompare these flux predictions to the sensitivity limits of next-generation\ninstruments such as COSI and HEX-P. We find that even under optimistic\nassumptions, detection probabilities with COSI are extremely low ($\\ll 1\\%$),\nand that marginal improvements are only possible with instruments like HEX-P if\nprior localization is available. The choice of spatial distribution model can\nlead to more than an order-of-magnitude variation in expected line fluxes at\nlow instrument sensitivities, underscoring the role of spatial modeling as a\ndominant source of uncertainty. Nevertheless, instrumental capability remains\nthe fundamental bottleneck, and a hybrid mission combining COSI-like sky\ncoverage with HEX-P-level line sensitivity would be required to make detection\nmore probable than not.",

Phase behavior of purely repulsive\nhard-sphere (PRHS) colloids is frequently modeled following atomic theory. But\nsuch theory predicts phase transitions with no internal energy, in conflict\nwith fundamental phase transition theory. A second paradox is that no PRHS\nsimulations have explicitly produced spontaneous phase coexistence. We\nspeculated that Frenkel's assertion could clear things up: that long-range and\nshort-range entropy are the competing forces during free-energy minimization\nthat cause phase separation - which would require a very large model system.\nOur large-scale Brownian dynamics model of solvent-suspended PRHS colloids\nproduced liquid states, crystalline states, and a spontaneously formed\ncoexistence phase with macroscopic crystalline and liquid-structure domains. We\nfound freezing and melting points at $\\phi_F\\approx0.502$ and\n$\\phi_M\\approx0.550$, respectively. Osmotic pressure plots give liquid and\ncrystal lines that qualitatively match atomic models, with quantitative\ndifferences corresponding to $kT/2$, the thermal energy driving Brownian motion\nsubsequently dissipated viscously back into the fluid, lowering osmotic\npressure in the colloidal-liquid phase and setting the phase boundaries.\nCoexisting crystal structure drives osmotic pressure up, due to surface tension\nrequired to maintain crystal/liquid interfaces, reflecting an increase in the\nchemical potential's cost to insert a diffusing particle into a crystalline\ninterface. Brownian motion seeks to randomize the interfaces, requiring\nincreased osmotic pressure to maintain them. These effects on osmotic pressure\nlessen as crystal fraction grows, owing to the decreasing importance of\nBrownian motion.",

Here we argue,\nthat the original ideas of Eliashberg are applicable to such a pseudogap phase\nand that with exposure to radiation the fermions are redistributed to higher\nenergies where they are less deleterious to pairing. What results then is a\nphoto-induced state with dramatically enhanced number of nearly condensed\nfermion pairs. In this phase, because the a.c. conductivity, $\\sigma(\\omega) =\n\\sigma_1(\\omega) + i \\sigma_2(\\omega)$, is dominated by the bosonic\ncontribution, it can be computed using conventional (Aslamazov Larkin)\nfluctuation theory. We, thereby, observe the expected fingerprint of this\nphotoinduced ``superconducting\" state which is a $1/\\omega$ dependence in\n$\\sigma_2$ with fits to the data of the same quality as found for the so-called\nphoto-enhanced (Drude) conductivity scenario. Here, however, we have a\nmicroscopic understanding of the characteristic low energy scale which appears\nin transport and which is necessarily temperature dependent. This approach also\nprovides insight into recent observations of concomitant diamagnetic\nfluctuations.

Of particular\ninterest is whether porous media naturally induce chaotic advection at the\nDarcy scale, as these stirring kinematics profoundly impact basic processes\nsuch as solute transport and mixing, colloid transport and deposition and\nchemical, geochemical and biological reactivity. While many studies report\ncomplex transport phenomena characteristic of chaotic advection in\nheterogeneous Darcy flow, it has also been shown that chaotic dynamics are\nprohibited in a large class of Darcy flows. In this study we rigorously\nestablish that chaotic advection is inherent to steady 3D Darcy flow in all\nrealistic models of heterogeneous porous media. Anisotropic and heterogenous 3D\nhydraulic conductivity fields generate non-trivial braiding of stream-lines,\nleading to both chaotic advection and (purely advective) transverse dispersion.\nWe establish that steady 3D Darcy flow has the same topology as unsteady 2D\nflow, and so use braid theory to establish a quantitative link between\ntransverse dispersivity and Lyapunov exponent in heterogeneous Darcy flow. We\nshow that chaotic advection and transverse dispersion occur in both anisotropic\nweakly heterogeneous and in heterogeneous weakly anisotropic conductivity\nfields, and that the quantitative link between these phenomena persists across\na broad range of conductivity anisotropy and heterogeneity. The ubiquity of\nmacroscopic chaotic advection has profound implications for the myriad of\nprocesses hosted in heterogeneous porous media and calls for a re-evaluation of\ntransport and reaction methods in these systems.",

    "abstract": "The Branch Target Buffer (BTB) plays a critical role in efficient CPU branch\nprediction. Understanding the design and implementation of the BTB provides\nvaluable insights for both compiler design and the mitigation of hardware\nattacks such as Spectre. However, the proprietary nature of dominant CPUs, such\nas those from Intel, AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm, means that specific BTB\nimplementation details are not publicly available. To address this limitation,\nseveral previous works have successfully reverse-engineered BTB information,\nincluding capacity and associativity, primarily targeting Intel's x86\nprocessors. However, to our best knowledge, no research has attempted to\nreverse-engineer and expose the BTB implementation of ARM processors.\n  This project aims to fill the gap by exploring the BTB of ARM processors.\nSpecifically, we investigate whether existing reverse-engineering techniques\ndeveloped for Intel BTB can be adapted for ARM. We reproduce the x86\nmethodology and identify specific PMU events for ARM to facilitate the reverse\nengineering process. In our experiment, we investigated our ARM CPU, i.e., the\nquad-core Cortex-A72 of the Raspberry Pi 4B. Our results show that the BTB\ncapacity is 4K, the set index starts from the 5th bit and ends with the 15th\nbit of the PC (11 bits in total), and there are 2 ways in each set.

    "abstract": "Shared control systems aim to combine human and robot abilities to improve\ntask performance. However, achieving optimal performance requires that the\nrobot's level of assistance adjusts the operator's cognitive workload in\nresponse to the task difficulty. Understanding and dynamically adjusting this\nbalance is crucial to maximizing efficiency and user satisfaction. In this\npaper, we propose a novel benchmarking method for shared control systems based\non Fitts' Law to formally parameterize the difficulty level of a\ntarget-reaching task. With this we systematically quantify and model the effect\nof task difficulty (i.e. size and distance of target) and robot autonomy on\ntask performance and operators' cognitive load and trust levels. Our empirical\nresults (N=24) not only show that both task difficulty and robot autonomy\ninfluence task performance, but also that the performance can be modelled using\nthese parameters, which may allow for the generalization of this relationship\nacross more diverse setups. We also found that the users' perceived cognitive\nload and trust were influenced by these factors. Given the challenges in\ndirectly measuring cognitive load in real-time, our adapted Fitts' model\npresents a potential alternative approach to estimate cognitive load through\ndetermining the difficulty level of the task, with the assumption that greater\ntask difficulty results in higher cognitive load levels. We hope that these\ninsights and our proposed framework inspire future works to further investigate\nthe generalizability of the method, ultimately enabling the benchmarking and\nsystematic assessment of shared control quality and user impact, which will aid\nin the development of more effective and adaptable systems.",

We present FogROS2-FT (Fault Tolerant) to mitigate these issues by\nintroducing a multi-cloud extension that automatically replicates independent\nstateless robotic services, routes requests to these replicas, and directs the\nfirst response back. With replication, robots can still benefit from cloud\ncomputations even when a cloud service provider is down or there is low QoS.\nAdditionally, many cloud computing providers offer low-cost spot computing\ninstances that may shutdown unpredictably. Normally, these low-cost instances\nwould be inappropriate for cloud robotics, but the fault tolerance nature of\nFogROS2-FT allows them to be used reliably. We demonstrate FogROS2-FT fault\ntolerance capabilities in 3 cloud-robotics scenarios in simulation (visual\nobject detection, semantic segmentation, motion planning) and 1 physical robot\nexperiment (scan-pick-and-place).

Using data from both the\nMontreal White Dwarf Database and a 20 pc volume-limited sample from Gaia DR2,\nwe find that the fossil field mechanism overpredicts the number of magnetic\nwhite dwarfs, which suggests, as supported by theoretical arguments, that the\nfield is not actually frozen into the progenitor cores but diffuses before the\nwhite dwarf forms. Crystallization dynamos, occur too late to explain the bulk\nof magnetic white dwarfs. And with the progenitor envelope dynamos impeded by\nthe theoretical challenge of depositing a field from envelope to white dwarf\ncore, the two disk dynamo mechanisms emerge as the field origin mechanisms most\nresilient to present constraints, with mergers best able to explain the high\nmass, strongly magnetized young MWDs.

    "abstract": "In this work we explore the fidelity of numerical approximations to the\nanalytic spectra of hyperbolic partial differential equation systems with\nvariable coefficients. We are particularly interested in the ability of\ndiscrete methods to accurately discover sources of physical instabilities. By\nconsidering the perturbed equations that arise in linearized problems, we study\nsystems in which a lower-order term can act as a source of internal energy\nwithin the system. We apply high-order accurate summation-by-parts finite\ndifference operators, with weak enforcement of boundary conditions through the\nsimultaneous-approximation-term technique, which leads to a provably stable\nnumerical discretization with formal order of accuracy given by $p = 2, 3, 4$\nand $5$. We derive analytic solutions using Laplace transform methods, which\nprovide important ground truth to ensure numerical convergence at the correct\ntheoretical rate. We derive the analytic spectrum and find that it is better\ncaptured with mesh refinement, although dissipative strict stability (where the\ngrowth rate of the discrete problem is bounded above by the analytic) is not\nobtained. We also find that sole reliance on mesh refinement can be a\nproblematic means for determining physical growth rates as some eigenvalues\nemerge (and persist with mesh refinement) based on spatial order of accuracy\nbut are non-physical. We suggest that numerical methods be used to approximate\nthe spectra when numerical stability is guaranteed and convergence of the\nnumerical spectra is evident with both mesh refinement and increasing order of\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the overlooked risk of false negative errors arising\nfrom eliminations in forensic firearm comparisons. While recent reforms in\nforensic science have focused on reducing false positives, eliminations--often\nbased on class characteristics or intuitive judgments--receive little empirical\nscrutiny despite their potential to exclude true sources. In cases involving a\nclosed pool of suspects, eliminations can function as de facto identifications,\nintroducing serious risk of error. A review of existing validity studies\nreveals that many report only false positive rates, failing to provide a\ncomplete assessment of method accuracy. This asymmetry is reinforced by\nprofessional guidelines, such as those from AFTE, and echoed in major\ngovernment reports, including those from NAS and PCAST. The article argues that\neliminations, like identifications, must be validated through rigorous testing\nand reported with transparent error rates. It further cautions against the use\nof \"common sense\" eliminations in the absence of empirical support and\nhighlights the dangers of contextual bias when examiners are aware of\ninvestigative constraints. Five policy recommendations are proposed to improve\nthe scientific treatment and legal interpretation of eliminations, including\nbalanced reporting of false positive and false negative rates, validation of\nintuitive judgments, and clear warnings against using eliminations to infer\nguilt in closed-pool scenarios. Without reform, eliminations will continue to\nescape scrutiny, perpetuating unmeasured error and undermining the integrity of\nforensic conclusions.",

    "abstract": "The RNA World hypothesis predicts that self-replicating RNAs evolved before\nDNA genomes and coded proteins. Despite widespread support for the RNA World,\nself-replicating RNAs have yet to be identified in a natural context, leaving a\nkey 'missing link' for this explanation of the origin of life. Inspired by\nrecent work showing that condensates of charged polymers are capable of\ncatalyzing chemical reactions, we consider a catalytic RNA condensate as a\ncandidate for the self-replicating RNA. Specifically, we propose that short,\nlow-complexity RNA polymers formed catalytic condensates capable of templated\nRNA polymerization. Because the condensate properties depend on the RNA\nsequences, RNAs that formed condensates with improved polymerization and\ndemixing capacity would be amplified, leading to a 'condensate chain reaction'\nand evolution by natural selection. Many of the needed properties of this\nself-replicating RNA condensate have been realized experimentally in recent\nstudies and our predictions could be tested with current experimental and\ntheoretical tools. Our theory addresses central problems in the origins of\nlife: (i) the origin of compartmentalization, (ii) the error threshold for the\naccuracy of templated replication, (iii) the free energy cost of maintaining an\ninformation-rich population of replicating RNA polymers. Furthermore, we note\nthat the extant nucleolus appears to satisfy many of the requirements of an\nevolutionary relic for the model we propose. More generally, we suggest that\nfuture work on the origin of life would benefit from condensate-centric\nbiophysical models of RNA evolution.",

While direct observations provide the strongest evidence\nfor these distributions, they also manifest indirectly through their influence\non processes and quantities that strongly depend on the energy distribution,\nsuch as reaction rates. In this paper, we investigate reaction rates in the\ngeneral context of quasiequilibrium systems, which exhibit only local\nequilibrium. The hierarchical structure of these systems allows their\nstatistical properties to be represented as a superposition of statistics,\ni.e., superstatistics. Focusing on the three universality classes of\nsuperstatistics--$\\chi^2$, inverse-$\\chi^2$, and log-normal--we examine how\nthese nonequilibrium distributions influence reaction rates. We analyze, both\nanalytically and numerically, reaction rates for processes involving tunneling\nphenomena, such as fusion, and identify conditions under which quasiequilibrium\ndistributions outperform Maxwellian distributions in enhancing fusion\nreactivities. To provide a more detailed quantitative analysis, we further\nemploy semi-empirical cross sections to evaluate the effect of these\nnonequilibrium distributions on ionization and recombination rates in a plasma.",

This study\naims to identify and classify star clusters in the Milky Way as part of double\nor multiple systems. Specifically, we seek to detect clusters that form\ngravitationally bound pairs or groups of clusters and distinguish between\ndifferent types of interactions based on their physical properties and spatial\ndistributions. Methods. We used the extensive star cluster database of Hunt &\nReffert (2023, 2024), which includes 7167 clusters. By estimating the tidal\nforces acting on each cluster through the tidal factor (TF), and considering\nonly close neighbours (within 50 pc), we identified a total of 2170 star\nclusters forming part of double and multiple systems. Pairs were classified as\nBinaries (B), Capture pairs (C), or Optical pairs (O/Oa) based on proper motion\ndistributions, cluster ages, and color-magnitude diagrams. Results. Our\nanalysis identified 617 paired systems, which were successfully classified\nusing our scheme. Additionally, we found 261 groups of star clusters, each with\nthree or more members, further supporting the presence of multiple systems\nwithin the Milky Way that exhibit significant tidal interactions. Conclusions.\nThe method presented provides an improved approach for identifying star\nclusters that share the same spatial volume and experience notable tidal\ninteractions.",

The data have been inspected in a\nsearch for one-year periodic patterns. Variations on timescales below one year\nhave been isolated through a de-trending algorithm and analysed, looking for\ncorrelations with the Sun's position relative to the sources. Objects at\necliptic latitude below ~20deg show one-year periodic drops in flux densities,\ncentred close to the time of minimum solar elongation; both interplanetary\nscintillation and instrumental effects may contribute to these events. However,\nin some cases the drops extend to much larger angular distances, affecting\nsources at high ecliptic latitudes, and causing variability on timescales of\nmonths. Three different kinds of such events have been identified in the data;\ntheir exact nature is not yet known. These events significantly alter the\nsources' variability characteristics estimated at GHz frequencies. In\nparticular, we found that many extreme scattering events previously identified\nin the GBI monitoring program are the consequence of Sun-related effects;\nothers occur simultaneously in several objects, which excludes interstellar\nscattering as their possible cause. These discoveries have a severe impact on\nour understanding of extreme scattering events. Furthermore, Sun-related\nvariability can significantly alter results of variability studies, which are\nvery powerful tools for the investigation of active galactic nuclei.

Direct radiative cooling from a\nhot wind significantly underestimates the luminosities of both broad and VB\ncomponents.

    "abstract": "Most observed neutron stars have masses around 1.4 $M_\\odot$, consistent with\ncurrent formation mechanisms. To date, no sub-solar mass neutron star has been\nobserved. Observing a low-mass neutron star would be a significant milestone,\nproviding crucial constraints on the nuclear equation of state, unveiling a new\npopulation of neutron stars, and advancing the study of their formation\nprocesses and underlying mechanisms. We present the first targeted search for\ntidally deformed sub-solar mass binary neutron stars (BNS), with primary masses\nranging from 0.1 to 2 $M_\\odot$ and secondary masses from 0.1 to 1 $M_\\odot$,\nusing data from the third observing run of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo\ngravitational-wave detectors. We account for the tidal deformabilities of up to\n$O(10^4)$ of these systems, as low-mass neutron stars are more easily distorted\nby their companions' gravitational forces. Previous searches that neglect tidal\ndeformability lose sensitivity to low-mass sources, potentially missing more\nthan $\\sim30\\%$ of detectable signals from a system with a chirp mass of 0.6\n$M_\\odot$ binaries. No statistically significant detections were made. In the\nabsence of a detection, we place a $90\\%$ confidence upper limit on the local\nmerger rate for sub-solar mass BNS systems, constraining it to be $<\n6.4\\times10^4$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for a chirp mass of 0.2 $M_\\odot$ and $<\n2.2\\times 10^3$ Gpc$^{-3}$Yr$^{-1}$ for 0.7 $M_\\odot$. With future upgrades to\ndetector sensitivity, development of next-generation detectors, and ongoing\nimprovements in search pipelines, constraints on the minimum mass of neutron\nstars will improve, providing the potential to constrain the nuclear equation\nof state, reveal new insights into neutron star formation channels, and\npotentially identify new classes of stars.",

Utilising the Zwicky Transient Facility live transient alerts, we\ndeveloped criteria to select YSNe while minimising the sample's contamination\nrate to 28 percent. The developed criteria were applied to LSST simulations,\nyielding a sample of 1167 Deep Drilling Field survey SNe and 67388 Wide Fast\nDeep survey SNe for follow-up with 4MOST.

A population of these stars\nwas recently observed for the first time, but their prevalence remains unknown.\nIn preparation for such measurements, we estimate the mass distribution of hot,\nstripped stars using a population synthesis code that interpolates over\ndetailed single and binary stellar evolution tracks. We predict that for a\nconstant star formation rate of $1 \\,M_\\odot$/yr and regardless of metallicity,\na scalable model population contains ~30,000 stripped stars with mass $M_{\\rm\nstrip}>1M_\\odot$ and ~4,000 stripped stars that are sufficiently massive to\nexplode ($M_{\\rm strip}>2.6M_\\odot$). Below $M_{\\rm strip}=5M_\\odot$, the\ndistribution is metallicity-independent and can be described by a power law\nwith the exponent $\\alpha \\sim -2$. At higher masses and lower metallicity ($Z\n\\lesssim 0.002$), the mass distribution exhibits a drop. This originates from\nthe prediction, frequently seen in evolutionary models, that massive\nlow-metallicity stars do not expand substantially until central helium burning\nor later and therefore cannot form long-lived stripped stars. With weaker\nline-driven winds at low metallicity, this suggests that neither binary\ninteraction nor wind mass loss can efficiently strip massive stars at low\nmetallicity. As a result, a \"helium-star desert\" emerges around $M_{\\rm strip}\n=15\\, M_\\odot$ at $Z=0.002$, covering an increasingly large mass range with\ndecreasing metallicity.

    "abstract": "4D driving simulation is essential for developing realistic autonomous\ndriving simulators. Despite advancements in existing methods for generating\ndriving scenes, significant challenges remain in view transformation and\nspatial-temporal dynamic modeling. To address these limitations, we propose a\nSpatial-Temporal simulAtion for drivinG (Stag-1) model to reconstruct\nreal-world scenes and design a controllable generative network to achieve 4D\nsimulation. Stag-1 constructs continuous 4D point cloud scenes using\nsurround-view data from autonomous vehicles. It decouples spatial-temporal\nrelationships and produces coherent keyframe videos. Additionally, Stag-1\nleverages video generation models to obtain photo-realistic and controllable 4D\ndriving simulation videos from any perspective. To expand the range of view\ngeneration, we train vehicle motion videos based on decomposed camera poses,\nenhancing modeling capabilities for distant scenes. Furthermore, we reconstruct\nvehicle camera trajectories to integrate 3D points across consecutive views,\nenabling comprehensive scene understanding along the temporal dimension.\nFollowing extensive multi-level scene training, Stag-1 can simulate from any\ndesired viewpoint and achieve a deep understanding of scene evolution under\nstatic spatial-temporal conditions. Compared to existing methods, our approach\nshows promising performance in multi-view scene consistency, background\ncoherence, and accuracy, and contributes to the ongoing advancements in\nrealistic autonomous driving simulation.

    "abstract": "The 3D contrastive learning paradigm has demonstrated remarkable performance\nin downstream tasks through pretraining on point cloud data. Recent advances\ninvolve additional 2D image priors associated with 3D point clouds for further\nimprovement. Nonetheless, these existing frameworks are constrained by the\nrestricted range of available point cloud datasets, primarily due to the high\ncosts of obtaining point cloud data. To this end, we propose SimC3D, a simple\nbut effective 3D contrastive learning framework, for the first time,\npretraining 3D backbones from pure RGB image data. SimC3D performs contrastive\n3D pretraining with three appealing properties. (1) Pure image data: SimC3D\nsimplifies the dependency of costly 3D point clouds and pretrains 3D backbones\nusing solely RBG images. By employing depth estimation and suitable data\nprocessing, the monocular synthesized point cloud shows great potential for 3D\npretraining. (2) Simple framework: Traditional multi-modal frameworks\nfacilitate 3D pretraining with 2D priors by utilizing an additional 2D\nbackbone, thereby increasing computational expense. In this paper, we\nempirically demonstrate that the primary benefit of the 2D modality stems from\nthe incorporation of locality information. Inspired by this insightful\nobservation, SimC3D directly employs 2D positional embeddings as a stronger\ncontrastive objective, eliminating the necessity for 2D backbones and leading\nto considerable performance improvements. (3) Strong performance: SimC3D\noutperforms previous approaches that leverage ground-truth point cloud data for\npretraining in various downstream tasks. Furthermore, the performance of SimC3D\ncan be further enhanced by combining multiple image datasets, showcasing its\nsignificant potential for scalability.

To address this, various memory-efficient\noptimizers have been proposed to reduce optimizer memory usage. However, they\nface critical challenges: (i) reliance on costly SVD operations; (ii)\nsignificant performance trade-offs compared to AdamW; and (iii) still\nsubstantial optimizer memory overhead to maintain competitive performance.\n  In this work, we identify that AdamW's learning rate adaptation rule can be\neffectively coarsened as a structured learning rate update. Based on this\ninsight, we propose Approximated Gradient Scaling for Memory-Efficient LLM\nOptimization (APOLLO), which approximates learning rate scaling using an\nauxiliary low-rank optimizer state based on pure random projection. This\nstructured learning rate update rule makes APOLLO highly tolerant to further\nmemory reductions while delivering comparable pre-training performance. Even\nits rank-1 variant, APOLLO-Mini, achieves superior pre-training performance\ncompared to AdamW with SGD-level memory costs.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the APOLLO series performs on-par with\nor better than AdamW, while achieving greater memory savings by nearly\neliminating the optimization states of AdamW. These savings provide significant\nsystem-level benefits: (1) Enhanced Throughput: 3x throughput on an 8xA100-80GB\nsetup compared to AdamW by supporting 4x larger batch sizes.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we are concerned with the study of statistical equilibria for\nfocusing nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger and Hartree equations on the d-dimensional\ntorus when d=1,2,3. Due to the focusing nature of the nonlinearity in these\nPDEs, Gibbs measures have to be appropriately localized. First, we show that\nthese local Gibbs measures are stationary solutions for the Liouville\nprobability density equation and that they satisfy a local equilibrium\nKubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition. Secondly, under some natural\nassumptions, we characterize all possible local KMS equilibrium states for\nthese PDEs as local Gibbs measures.\n  Our methods are based on Malliavin calculus in Gross-Stroock Sobolev spaces\nand on a suitable Gaussian integration by parts formula. To handle the\ntechnical problems due to localization, we rely on the works of Aida and\nKusuoka on irreducibility of Dirichlet forms over infinite-dimensional domains.\nThis leads us to the study of sublevel sets of the renormalized mass and their\nconnectedness properties. In this paper, we also revisit Bourgain's proof of\nthe normalizability of the local Gibbs measure for the focusing Hartree\nequation on the d-dimensional torus with d=2,3 by using concentration\ninequalities.",

Compared to shape correspondence, semantic\ncorrespondence is more effective in generalizing across different object\ncategories. To this end, we present DenseMatcher, a method capable of computing\n3D correspondences between in-the-wild objects that share similar structures.\nDenseMatcher first computes vertex features by projecting multiview 2D features\nonto meshes and refining them with a 3D network, and subsequently finds dense\ncorrespondences with the obtained features using functional map. In addition,\nwe craft the first 3D matching dataset that contains colored object meshes\nacross diverse categories. In our experiments, we show that DenseMatcher\nsignificantly outperforms prior 3D matching baselines by 43.5%. We demonstrate\nthe downstream effectiveness of DenseMatcher in (i) robotic manipulation, where\nit achieves cross-instance and cross-category generalization on long-horizon\ncomplex manipulation tasks from observing only one demo; (ii) zero-shot color\nmapping between digital assets, where appearance can be transferred between\ndifferent objects with relatable geometry.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive transformer language models (LMs) possess strong syntactic\nabilities, often successfully handling phenomena from agreement to NPI\nlicensing. However, the features they use to incrementally process language\ninputs are not well understood. In this paper, we fill this gap by studying the\nmechanisms underlying garden path sentence processing in LMs. We ask: (1) Do\nLMs use syntactic features or shallow heuristics to perform incremental\nsentence processing? (2) Do LMs represent only one potential interpretation, or\nmultiple? and (3) Do LMs reanalyze or repair their initial incorrect\nrepresentations? To address these questions, we use sparse autoencoders to\nidentify interpretable features that determine which continuation - and thus\nwhich reading - of a garden path sentence the LM prefers. We find that while\nmany important features relate to syntactic structure, some reflect\nsyntactically irrelevant heuristics. Moreover, while most active features\ncorrespond to one reading of the sentence, some features correspond to the\nother, suggesting that LMs assign weight to both possibilities simultaneously.\nFinally, LMs do not re-use features from garden path sentence processing to\nanswer follow-up questions.",

    "abstract": "In A&A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS)\nslightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent\nfit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe,\nbypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of\n$H_0\\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\\sim67-73$.\nHowever, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\\approx46$ achieved\nby BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in\nanalyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae\n(SNeIa). In Phys. Lett. B 862, 139357 (2025) we uncovered a hidden aspect in a\ngeneric class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can\ninduce a variation in the speed of light as $c\\propto\\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$\nto vary alongside $\\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying\n$c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant\nSNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre\nredshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a\nfit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces\n$H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\\approx46$. Hence,\nBDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$\nanalysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts:\n(i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to\n$\\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe,\nwithout requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the\nlate-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an\nexpanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.",

This tool can be seamlessly integrated into package vetting\npipelines and has the capability to flag entire packages, not just malicious\nfunction calls.

    "abstract": "Hydrodynamic outflows, such as those observed escaping close-in gas giant\nplanets, are not isothermal in structure. Their highly ionized nature allows\nthem to cool adiabatically at distances beyond several planetary radii. The\ncontrast between the hottest gas temperatures at around 10,000K and the coldest\nat around 1,000K triggers an excess population of the observable helium\ntriplet. This excess is caused by the suppression of collisional de-excitation\nfrom the triplet state at cool temperatures. Using radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations, we show that this helium triplet excess may explain the excess\nbroadening seen in HD 189733b's observed transmission spectrum, demonstrating\nadiabatic cooling of its outflow, confirming its hydrodynamic nature on scales\nof several planetary radii. However, further observations are required to\nconfirm this conclusion. Furthermore, we explore a range of electron\ntransitions for neutral helium which were not considered in the previous\nliterature. We find that the He$2^1$S state is unavailable as a potential\nreservoir for He$2^3$S electrons. Additionally, the de-excitation to the ground\nstate must be considered for stellar spectra later than K2 in predicting the\ncorrect helium triplet population. Importantly, since triplet helium inherits\nmomentum from ionized helium as it is generated by recombination, it is\nsignificantly less prone to fractionation than ground-state neutral helium.\nHowever at separations of $\\gtrsim 0.05$~au, ionization at the flow base and\ndrag on helium weaken, leading to significant fractionation of the then mostly\nneutral helium. This in turn, can cause a suppression of the Helium transit\ndepth, even though the helium line width remains large.",

While networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons have been\nwidely studied, systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively\nexplored due to the piecewise complexity of the nonchaotic Rulkov map. Here, we\nfind that rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular-spiking\nRulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, synchronized chaotic bursting, and\nsynchronized hyperchaos. By systematically varying the electrical coupling\nstrength between neurons, we also uncover general trends in the maximal\nLyapunov exponent across the system's dynamical regimes. By means of the\nKaplan-Yorke conjecture, we examine the fractal geometry of the ring system's\nhigh-dimensional chaotic attractors and find that these attractors can occupy\nas many as 45 of the 60 dimensions of state space. We further explore how\nvariations in chaotic behavior - quantified by the full Lyapunov spectra -\ncorrespond to changes in the attractors' fractal dimensions.

Meanwhile, we noticed that previous studies\nmainly focused on parsing and often treated preprocessing as an ad hoc step\n(e.g., masking numbers). However, we argue that both preprocessing and parsing\nare essential for log parsers to identify dynamic variables: the lack of\nunderstanding of preprocessing may hinder the optimal use of parsers and future\nresearch. Therefore, our work studied existing log preprocessing approaches\nbased on Loghub, a popular log parsing benchmark. We developed a general\npreprocessing framework with our findings and evaluated its impact on existing\nparsers. Our experiments show that the preprocessing framework significantly\nboosts the performance of four state-of-the-art statistic-based parsers. Drain,\nthe best statistic-based parser, obtained improvements across all four parsing\nmetrics (e.g., F1 score of template accuracy, FTA, increased by 108.9%).\nCompared to semantic-based parsers, it achieved a 28.3% improvement in grouping\naccuracy (GA), 38.1% in FGA, and an 18.6% increase in FTA.

These recollections involve four pieces: (a) analyzing aspects of\nthe theory of fiber bundles, as it impinges on algebraic geometry, (b)\nunderstanding the rise of homological techniques in algebraic topology, (c)\ndescribing the influence of category-theoretic ideas in topology and algebra\nand (d) revisiting the story of the percolation of sheaf-theoretic ideas\nthrough algebraic geometry.\n  We will then argue that it was this unique confluence of mathematical events\nthat allowed projective modules to emerge as objects of central mathematical\nimportance. More precisely, we will first argue that, in the context of social\ncurrents of the time, projective modules initially were isolated as objects of\npurely technical convenience reflecting the aesthetic sensibilities of the\ncreators of the fledgling theory of homological algebra. Only later did they\ntranscend this limited role to become objects of \"mainstream importance\" due to\ninfluence from the theory of algebraic fiber bundles and the theory of sheaves.\nAlong the way, we aim to show how strong personal ties emanating from the\nBourbaki movement and its connections in mathematical centers including Paris,\nPrinceton and Chicago were essential to the entrance, propagation and\nmainstream mathematical acceptance of the theory.",

Tokenization is a crucial consideration in this\neffort: what is an effective discrete vocabulary for a real-valued sequential\ninput? To address this question, we develop WaveToken, a wavelet-based\ntokenizer that allows models to learn complex representations directly in the\nspace of time-localized frequencies. Our method first scales and decomposes the\ninput time series, then thresholds and quantizes the wavelet coefficients, and\nfinally pre-trains an autoregressive model to forecast coefficients for the\nforecast horizon. By decomposing coarse and fine structures in the inputs,\nwavelets provide an eloquent and compact language for time series forecasting\nthat simplifies learning. Empirical results on a comprehensive benchmark,\nincluding 42 datasets for both in-domain and zero-shot settings, show that\nWaveToken: i) provides better accuracy than recently proposed foundation models\nfor forecasting while using a much smaller vocabulary (1024 tokens), and\nperforms on par or better than modern deep learning models trained specifically\non each dataset; and ii) exhibits superior generalization capabilities,\nachieving the best average rank across all datasets for three complementary\nmetrics. In addition, we show that our method can easily capture complex\ntemporal patterns of practical relevance that are challenging for other recent\npre-trained models, including trends, sparse spikes, and non-stationary time\nseries with varying frequencies evolving over time.",

Besides, the plausible existence of a stable\nstratification layer below the mantle influences the columnar convection. These\nadditional symmetry-breaking constraints, motivated from geophysical scenario\nof the Earth's thermal core--mantle interaction, modulate the otherwise\nperiodic and axially invariant convection flow patterns.

The scatter associated with $H(z)$ is seen\nto grow markedly with redshift. This behaviour, which is deduced directly from\nthe SNe Hubble diagram, raises the question of whether the universe is\nundergoing a stochastic expansion, which scenario can offer an explanation for\nthe Hubble tension in cosmology. From the estimated $H(z)$ values, the present\nvalue of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ is evaluated for each of these models\nthrough regression, and the scatter using the Monte Carlo method. Bayesian\ncomparison between these models is carried out using the data of 35 cosmic\nchronometers (CC). The comparative study favours the $\\Lambda$CDM model, with\nsome strong evidence. However, exclusion of four outlier CC data points with\nsmall errorbars leads to large reduction in the Bayes factor value. The\nunusually large value of Bayes factor obtained while using the full set of CC\ndata raises some concerns about its tension with other data, such as that of\nthe SNe Ia. While using the remaining 31 CC data points, it is observed that\nthe resulting Bayes factor still favours the $\\Lambda$CDM model, but with a\nmuch smaller value of the Bayes factor.

In such cases, the\nexpectation value of $B$ is conserved and the system at least partially\ncollapses with respect to eigenstates of $B$.

This paper\ninvestigates the underlying physics behind this energy dependence in Pythia,\nrevealing that it arises from an interplay between two non-perturbative\nprocesses: the internal transverse motion of partons and non-perturbative soft\ngluon emissions. These contributions are most constrained in the production of\nDrell-Yan pairs with very low transverse momentum, where soft gluon effects\nbecome increasingly prominent with rising collision energy-contrary to initial\nexpectations.

To address the challenges faced by hardware\nprefetching, architects have proposed to detect and exploit the spatial\nlocality at the granularity of spatial region. When a new region is activated,\nthey try to find similar previously accessed regions for footprint prediction\nbased on system-level environmental features such as the trigger instruction or\ndata address. However, we find that such context-based prediction cannot\ncapture the essential characteristics of access patterns, leading to limited\nflexibility, practicality and suboptimal prefetching performance.\n  In this paper, inspired by the temporal property of memory accessing, we note\nthat the temporal correlation exhibited within the spatial footprint is a key\nfeature of spatial patterns. To this end, we propose Gaze, a simple and\nefficient hardware spatial prefetcher that skillfully utilizes\nfootprint-internal temporal correlations to efficiently characterize spatial\npatterns. Meanwhile, we observe a unique unresolved challenge in utilizing\nspatial footprints generated by spatial streaming, which exhibit extremely high\naccess density. Therefore, we further enhance Gaze with a dedicated two-stage\napproach that mitigates the over-prefetching problem commonly encountered in\nconventional schemes.

The RIS is\nenvisioned as a dynamically controllable surface that is capable of\ntransforming impinging electromagnetic waves in terms of angles and\npolarization. Many models has been proposed to predict the wave-transformation\ncapabilities of potential RISs, where power conservation is ensured by\nenforcing that the scattered power equals the power impinging upon the aperture\nof the RIS, without considering whether the scattered field adds coherently of\ndestructively with the source field. In effect, this means that power is not\nconserved, as elaborated in this paper. With the goal of investigating the\nimplications of global and local power conservation in RISs, work considers a\nsingle-layer metasurface based RIS. A complete end-to-end communications\nchannel is given through polarizability modeling and conditions for power\nconservation and channel reciprocity are derived.

It provides an implicit\nrepresentation of continuous and differentiable shapes, which can seamlessly be\ncombined with control, optimization, and learning techniques. While standard\ndistance fields rely on the Euclidean metric, many robotic tasks inherently\ninvolve non-Euclidean structures. To this end, we generalize the use of\nEuclidean distance fields to more general metric spaces by solving a Riemannian\neikonal equation, a first-order partial differential equation, whose solution\ndefines a distance field and its associated gradient flow on the manifold,\nenabling the computation of geodesics and globally length-minimizing paths. We\nshow that this \\emph{geodesic distance field} can also be exploited in the\nrobot configuration space. To realize this concept, we exploit physics-informed\nneural networks to solve the eikonal equation for high-dimensional spaces,\nwhich provides a flexible and scalable representation without the need for\ndiscretization. Furthermore, a variant of our neural eikonal solver is\nintroduced, which enables the gradient flow to march across both task and\nconfiguration spaces. As an example of application, we validate the proposed\napproach in an energy-aware motion generation task. This is achieved by\nconsidering a manifold defined by a Riemannian metric in configuration space,\neffectively taking the property of the robot's dynamics into account.

Each LTS search is assigned a rerooting weight by a\n(user-defined or learnt) rerooter, and the search effort is shared between all\nLTS searches proportionally to their weights.

RHESSI X-ray images show double\ncoronal sources (``loop-top\" and higher coronal sources) located at both ends\nof the flare current/plasma sheet. Moreover, we detected an additional\ntransient faint X-ray source (6-12 keV) located between the double coronal\nsources, which was co-spatial with multiple plasmoids in the flare current\nsheet.

In this study, we\nemployed a musculoskeletal head-neck model to understand the effect of impact\nlocations, characteristics, and neck strength on head and neck injury severity.\nThree types of impact forces were studied: low-velocity impact (LVI),\nintermediate-velocity impact (IVI), and high-velocity impact (HVI). We\ninvestigated six parameters: linear and rotational accelerations, the\nGeneralized Acceleration Model For Brain Injury Threshold (GAMBIT), neck force,\nneck moment, and Neck Injury Criteria (NIC). We consider seven impact\nlocations, three neck strengths, and three impact characteristics. We studied a\ntotal of 63 cases. It was found that the linear accelerations do not change\nmuch with different neck strengths and impact locations. The impact locations\nhave a significant effect on head and neck injury parameters, and anterolateral\nimpact is the most risky impact location for both head and neck. The maximum\naverage rotational acceleration is for anterolateral eccentric impact which is\n4.75 times more than the average anterior central impact. The lateral impacts\ngenerate about 10% more linear accelerations than anterior and posterior\nimpacts. Neck forces do not vary more than 20% with impact locations and neck\nstrength. The average head and neck injury parameters do not vary more than 10%\nbased on neck strength. Impact characteristics have a significant role in\nGAMBIT and NIC. The average GAMBIT for IVI and HVI were 1.44 and 1.54 times\nhigher than LVI.

We first introduce the\nwell-posedness of general forward-backward stochastic differential equations\n(FBSDEs) defined on some suitably chosen Hilbert spaces under the\n$\\beta$-monotonicity. We then propose a monotonicity condition for the MFG,\nnamely partitioning the running cost functional into two parts, so that both\nparts still depend on the control and the state distribution, yet one satisfies\na strong convexity and a small mean field effect condition, while the other has\na newly introduced displacement quasi-monotonicity. To the best of our\nknowledge, the latter quasi type condition has not yet been discussed in the\ncontemporary literature, and it can be considered as a bit more general\nmonotonicity condition than those commonly used. Besides, for the MFG, we show\nthat convexity and small mean field effect condition for the first part of\nrunning cost functional and the quasi-monotonicity condition for the second\npart together imply the $\\beta$-monotonicity and thus the well-posedness for\nthe associated FBSDEs. For the MFTC problem, we show that the\n$\\beta$-monotonicity for the corresponding FBSDEs is simply the convexity\nassumption on the cost functional.

Yet, simulations\nindicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of\nnitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation\n(XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line\ncooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents\na novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic\nframework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres,\npositioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial\nstructure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law\nrelationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our\napproach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates\nhow ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially,\nhydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the\natmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly\nwith XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a\ncollisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is\ndetermined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the\nstar's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and\nrevival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and\nEarth, LHS 1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b.

    "abstract": "One-shot Federated learning (FL) is a powerful technology facilitating\ncollaborative training of machine learning models in a single round of\ncommunication. While its superiority lies in communication efficiency and\nprivacy preservation compared to iterative FL, one-shot FL often compromises\nmodel performance. Prior research has primarily focused on employing data-free\nknowledge distillation to optimize data generators and ensemble models for\nbetter aggregating local knowledge into the server model. However, these\nmethods typically struggle with data heterogeneity, where inconsistent local\ndata distributions can cause teachers to provide misleading knowledge.\nAdditionally, they may encounter scalability issues with complex datasets due\nto inherent two-step information loss: first, during local training (from data\nto model), and second, when transferring knowledge to the server model (from\nmodel to inversed data). In this paper, we propose FedSD2C, a novel and\npractical one-shot FL framework designed to address these challenges. FedSD2C\nintroduces a distiller to synthesize informative distillates directly from\nlocal data to reduce information loss and proposes sharing synthetic\ndistillates instead of inconsistent local models to tackle data heterogeneity.\nOur empirical results demonstrate that FedSD2C consistently outperforms other\none-shot FL methods with more complex and real datasets, achieving up to 2.6\nthe performance of the best baseline.

    "abstract": "We present a deep-learning Variational Encoder-Decoder (VED) framework for\nlearning data-driven low-dimensional representations of the relationship\nbetween high-dimensional parameters of a physical system and the system's\nhigh-dimensional observable response. The framework consists of two deep\nlearning-based probabilistic transformations: An encoder mapping parameters to\nlatent codes and a decoder mapping latent codes to the observable response. The\nhyperparameters of these transformations are identified by maximizing a\nvariational lower bound on the log-conditional distribution of the observable\nresponse given parameters. To promote the disentanglement of latent codes, we\nequip this variational loss with a penalty on the off-diagonal entries of the\naggregate distribution covariance of codes. This regularization penalty\nencourages the pushforward of a standard Gaussian distribution of latent codes\nto approximate the marginal distribution of the observable response.\n  Using the proposed framework we successfully model the hydraulic pressure\nresponse at observation wells of a groundwater flow model as a function of its\ndiscrete log-hydraulic transmissivity field. Compared to the canonical\ncorrelation analysis encoding, the VED model achieves a lower-dimensional\nlatent representation, with as low as $r = 50$ latent dimensions without a\nsignificant loss of reconstruction accuracy. We explore the impact of\nregularization on model performance, finding that KL-divergence and covariance\nregularization improve feature disentanglement in latent space while\nmaintaining reconstruction accuracy.

    "abstract": "While many classical algorithms rely on Laplace transforms, it has remained\nan open question whether these operations could be implemented efficiently on\nquantum computers.

In\nmany cases, the associated quantum circuits have a depth that scales with $N$\nas $O(\\log(\\log(N)))$ and a size that scales as $O(\\log(N))$, requiring\nexponentially fewer operations and double-exponentially less computational time\nthan their classical counterparts.

In contrast,\nqubit control based on hopping spins has recently emerged as a compelling\nprimitive for high-fidelity baseband control in sparse two-dimensional hole\narrays in germanium. In this work, we commission a $^{28}$Si/SiGe 2x2 quantum\ndot array both as a four-qubit device with pairwise exchange interactions using\nestablished EDSR techniques and as a two-qubit device using baseband hopping\ncontrol. In this manner, we can evaluate the two modes of operation in terms of\nfidelity, coherence, and crosstalk. We establish a lower bound on the fidelity\nof the hopping gate of 99.50(6)%, which is similar to the average fidelity of\nthe resonant gate of 99.54(4)%. Lowering the external field to reach the\nhopping regime nearly doubles the measured $T_2^{\\mathrm{H}}$, suggesting a\nreduced coupling to charge noise. Finally, the hopping gate circumvents the\ntransient pulse-induced resonance shift.

    "abstract": "Recently, sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a promising\nmethod to improve generalization by minimizing sharpness, which is known to\ncorrelate well with generalization ability. Since the original proposal of SAM,\nmany variants of SAM have been proposed to improve its accuracy and efficiency,\nbut comparisons have mainly been restricted to the i.i.d. setting. In this\npaper we study SAM for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. First, we\nperform a comprehensive comparison of eight SAM variants on zero-shot OOD\ngeneralization, finding that the original SAM outperforms the Adam baseline by\n$4.76\\%$ and the strongest SAM variants outperform the Adam baseline by\n$8.01\\%$ on average. We then provide an OOD generalization bound in terms of\nsharpness for this setting. Next, we extend our study of SAM to the related\nsetting of gradual domain adaptation (GDA), another form of OOD generalization\nwhere intermediate domains are constructed between the source and target\ndomains, and iterative self-training is done on intermediate domains, to\nimprove the overall target domain error. In this setting, our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the original SAM outperforms the baseline of Adam on\neach of the experimental datasets by $0.82\\%$ on average and the strongest SAM\nvariants outperform Adam by $1.52\\%$ on average. We then provide a\ngeneralization bound for SAM in the GDA setting. Asymptotically, this\ngeneralization bound is no better than the one for self-training in the\nliterature of GDA. This highlights a further disconnection between the\ntheoretical justification for SAM versus its empirical performance, with recent\nwork finding that low sharpness alone does not account for all of SAM's\ngeneralization benefits. For future work, we provide several potential avenues\nfor obtaining a tighter analysis for SAM in the OOD setting.",

The Kaplan-Meier estimator is widely used in\nsurvival analysis to estimate survival functions over time, yet applying it to\nsensitive datasets, such as clinical records, risks revealing private\ninformation. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm that applies\ntime-indexed Laplace noise, dynamic clipping, and smoothing to produce a\nprivacy-preserving survival curve while maintaining the cumulative structure of\nthe Kaplan-Meier estimator. By scaling noise over time, the algorithm accounts\nfor decreasing sensitivity as fewer individuals remain at risk, while dynamic\nclipping and smoothing prevent extreme values and reduce fluctuations,\npreserving the natural shape of the survival curve.\n  Our results, evaluated on the NCCTG lung cancer dataset, show that the\nproposed method effectively lowers root mean squared error (RMSE) and enhances\naccuracy across privacy budgets ($\\epsilon$). At $\\epsilon = 10$, the algorithm\nachieves an RMSE as low as 0.04, closely approximating non-private estimates.\nAdditionally, membership inference attacks reveal that higher $\\epsilon$ values\n(e.g., $\\epsilon \\geq 6$) significantly reduce influential points, particularly\nat higher thresholds, lowering susceptibility to inference attacks.

This alignment\nensures that the embeddings are semantically and syntactically meaningful for\nthe specific code translation task. Our methodology involves constructing a\ndataset of 25,000 Fortran code snippets sourced from Stack-V2 dataset and\ngenerating their corresponding C++ translations using the LLaMA 3.1-8B language\nmodel.

We advance the development of object-centric occupancy\nperception from both data and algorithm perspectives.

From the algorithmic standpoint, we introduce a novel\nobject-centric occupancy completion network equipped with an implicit shape\ndecoder that manages dynamic-size occupancy generation. This network accurately\npredicts the complete object-centric occupancy volume for inaccurate object\nproposals by leveraging temporal information from long sequences. Our method\ndemonstrates robust performance in completing object shapes under noisy\ndetection and tracking conditions.

To answer these questions, we introduce Explingo, which consists\nof two LLM-based subsystems, a Narrator and Grader.

In this work, we\nintroduce the concept of $\\epsilon$-rank, a novel metric quantifying the\neffective feature of neuron functions in the terminal hidden layer. Through\nextensive experiments across diverse tasks, we observe a universal staircase\nphenomenon: during training process implemented by the standard stochastic\ngradient descent methods, the decline of the loss function is accompanied by an\nincrease in the $\\epsilon$-rank and exhibits a staircase pattern.\nTheoretically, we rigorously prove a negative correlation between the loss\nlower bound and $\\epsilon$-rank, demonstrating that a high $\\epsilon$-rank is\nessential for significant loss reduction. Moreover, numerical evidences show\nthat within the same deep neural network, the $\\epsilon$-rank of the subsequent\nhidden layer is higher than that of the previous hidden layer. Based on these\nobservations, to eliminate the staircase phenomenon, we propose a novel\npre-training strategy on the initial hidden layer that elevates the\n$\\epsilon$-rank of the terminal hidden layer. Numerical experiments validate\nits effectiveness in reducing training time and improving accuracy across\nvarious tasks. Therefore, the newly introduced concept of $\\epsilon$-rank is a\ncomputable quantity that serves as an intrinsic effective metric characteristic\nfor deep neural networks, providing a novel perspective for understanding the\ntraining dynamics of neural networks and offering a theoretical foundation for\ndesigning efficient training strategies in practical applications.",

Utilizing cyclic data from additively manufactured Hastelloy X\nspecimens at 500 degree-F, the BO framework, integrated with a Gaussian process\nsurrogate model, significantly reduces the number of required simulations. A\nnovel objective function is developed to match experimental stress-strain data\nacross different strain amplitudes.

Sensitivity analysis reveals the influence of CP parameters at\nvarious loading points on the stress-strain curve. The results show that the\nstress-strain response is predominantly controlled by parameters related to\nyield, with increased influence from backstress parameters during compressive\nloading. In addition, the effect of introducing twins into the synthetic\nmicrostructure on fatigue behavior is studied, and a relationship between\nmicrostructural features and the fatigue indicator parameter is established.\nResults show that larger diameter grains, which exhibit a higher Schmid factor\nand an average misorientation of approximately 42 degrees +/- 1.67 degree, are\nidentified as probable sites for failure.

    "abstract": "Big data is transforming scientific progress by enabling the discovery of\nnovel models, enhancing existing frameworks, and facilitating precise\nuncertainty quantification, while advancements in scientific machine learning\ncomplement this by providing powerful tools to solve inverse problems to\nidentify the complex systems where traditional methods falter due to sparse or\nnoisy data. We introduce two innovative neural operator frameworks tailored for\ndiscovering hidden physics and identifying unknown system parameters from\nsparse measurements. The first framework integrates a popular neural operator,\nDeepONet, and a physics-informed neural network to capture the relationship\nbetween sparse data and the underlying physics, enabling the accurate discovery\nof a family of governing equations. The second framework focuses on system\nparameter identification, leveraging a DeepONet pre-trained on sparse sensor\nmeasurements to initialize a physics-constrained inverse model. Both frameworks\nexcel in handling limited data and preserving physical consistency.\nBenchmarking on the Burgers' equation and reaction-diffusion system\ndemonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving average $L_2$ errors of\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ for hidden physics discovery and absolute errors of\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ for parameter identification. These results underscore\nthe frameworks' robustness, efficiency, and potential for solving complex\nscientific problems with minimal observational data.",

    "abstract": "Topological signals are variables or features associated with both nodes and\nedges of a network. Recently, in the context of Topological Machine Learning,\ngreat attention has been devoted to signal processing of such topological\nsignals. Most of the previous topological signal processing algorithms treat\nnode and edge signals separately and work under the hypothesis that the true\nsignal is smooth and/or well approximated by a harmonic eigenvector of the\nHodge-Laplacian, which may be violated in practice. Here we propose\nDirac-equation signal processing, a framework for efficiently reconstructing\ntrue signals on nodes and edges, also if they are not smooth or harmonic, by\nprocessing them jointly. The proposed physics-inspired algorithm is based on\nthe spectral properties of the topological Dirac operator. It leverages the\nmathematical structure of the topological Dirac equation to boost the\nperformance of the signal processing algorithm. We discuss how the relativistic\ndispersion relation obeyed by the topological Dirac equation can be used to\nassess the quality of the signal reconstruction. Finally, we demonstrate the\nimproved performance of the algorithm with respect to previous algorithms.\nSpecifically, we show that Dirac-equation signal processing can also be used\nefficiently if the true signal is a non-trivial linear combination of more than\none eigenstate of the Dirac equation, as it generally occurs for real signals.",

I argue that efforts to promote responsible and ethical AI can\ninadvertently contribute to and seemingly legitimize this disregard for\nestablished contextual norms.

    "abstract": "Intrinsic within-type neuronal heterogeneity is a ubiquitous feature of\nbiological systems, with well-documented computational advantages. Recent works\nin machine learning have incorporated such diversities by optimizing neuronal\nparameters alongside synaptic connections and demonstrated state-of-the-art\nperformance across common benchmarks. However, this performance gain comes at\nthe cost of significantly higher computational costs, imposed by a larger\nparameter space. Furthermore, it is unclear how the neuronal parameters,\nconstrained by the biophysics of their surroundings, are globally orchestrated\nto minimize top-down errors. To address these challenges, we postulate that\nneurons are intrinsically diverse, and investigate the computational\ncapabilities of such heterogeneous neuronal parameters. Our results show that\nintrinsic heterogeneity, viewed as a fixed quenched disorder, often\nsubstantially improves performance across hundreds of temporal tasks. Notably,\nsmaller but heterogeneous networks outperform larger homogeneous networks,\ndespite consuming less data. We elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving\nthis performance boost and illustrate its applicability to both rate and\nspiking dynamics. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that heterogeneous\nnetworks are highly resilient to severe alterations in their recurrent synaptic\nhyperparameters, and even recurrent connections removal does not compromise\nperformance. The remarkable effectiveness of heterogeneous networks with small\nsizes and relaxed connectivity is particularly relevant for the neuromorphic\ncommunity, which faces challenges due to device-to-device variability.\nFurthermore, understanding the mechanism of robust computation with\nheterogeneity also benefits neuroscientists and machine learners.",

    "abstract": "Despite their remarkable success in language modeling, transformers trained\nto predict the next token in a sequence struggle with long-term planning. This\nlimitation is particularly evident in tasks requiring foresight to plan\nmultiple steps ahead such as maze navigation. The standard next single token\nprediction objective, however, offers no explicit mechanism to predict multiple\nsteps ahead - or revisit the path taken so far. Consequently, in this work we\nstudy whether explicitly predicting multiple steps ahead (and backwards) can\nimprove transformers' maze navigation. We train parameter-matched transformers\nfrom scratch, under identical settings, to navigate mazes of varying types and\nsizes with standard next token prediction and MLM-U, an objective explicitly\npredicting multiple steps ahead and backwards. We find that MLM-U considerably\nimproves transformers' ability to navigate mazes compared to standard next\ntoken prediction across maze types and complexities. We also find MLM-U\ntraining is 4x more sample efficient and converges 2x faster in terms of GPU\ntraining hours relative to next token training. Finally, for more complex mazes\nwe find MLM-U benefits from scaling to larger transformers. Remarkably, we find\ntransformers trained with MLM-U outperform larger transformers trained with\nnext token prediction using additional supervision from A* search traces. We\nhope these findings underscore the promise of learning objectives to advance\ntransformers' capacity for long-term planning.

However, windowed decoding schemes require that some\ndecoding tasks be delayed until others have completed, which can be problematic\nduring time-sensitive operations such as T gate teleportation, leading to\nsuboptimal program runtimes. To alleviate this, we introduce a speculative\nwindow decoding scheme.

We model the chemical composition of gas and\nices in a self-gravitating disc on timescales of 0.5\\,Myr since its formation\nto study the evolution of C/O ratio due to dust dynamics and growth, and phase\ntransitions of the volatile species. We use the thin-disc hydrodynamic code\nFEOSAD, which includes disc self-gravity, thermal balance, dust evolution and\nturbulent diffusion, and treats dust as a dynamically different and evolving\ncomponent interacting with the gas. It also describes freeze-out, sublimation\nand advection of four volatile species: H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO. We\ndemonstrate the effect of gas and dust substructures on the distribution of\nvolatiles and C/O ratios, including the formation of multiple snowlines of one\nspecies, and point out the anticorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and total\nC/O ratio emerging due to the contribution of oxygen-rich ice mantles. We\nidentify time and spatial locations where two distinct trigger mechanisms for\nplanet formation are operating and differentiate them by C/O ratio range: wide\nrange of the C/O ratios of $0-1.4$ for streaming instability, and a much\nnarrower range $0.3-0.6$ for gravitational instability (with the initial value\nof 0.34). This conclusion is corroborated by observations, showing that\ntransiting exoplanets, which possibly experienced migration through a variety\nof disc conditions, have significantly larger spread of C/O in comparison with\ndirectly imaged exoplanets likely formed in gravitationally unstable outer disk\nregions.

In this second paper, we utilize this wave function to derive the BO\nevolution of partonic distributions in the hadron -- the gluon transverse\nmomentum and integrated parton distributions (TMD and PDF respectively). The\nevolution equation for the TMD contains a linear and a nonlinear term. The\nlinear term reproduces the Collins-Soper-Sterman (CSS) equation with a physical\nrelation between the transverse and longitudinal resolution scales. We explain\nhow this equivalence arises, even though the BO and CSS cascades are somewhat\ndifferent in structures. The nonlinear term in the evolution has a very\nappealing physical meaning: it is a correction due to stimulated emission,\nwhich enhances emission of gluons (bosons) into states with a nonzero\noccupation.\n  For the evolution of the PDF we again find a linear and nonlinear term. At\nnot very small Bjorken $x$, the linear term recovers the DGLAP equation in the\nleading logarithmic approximation. At small $x$ however there are contributions\nfrom gluon splittings which are in the BFKL kinematics leading to a\nmodification of the DGLAP equation. The nonlinear terms have the same physical\norigin as in the equation for the TMD -- the stimulated emission corrections.\nInterestingly the nonlinear corrections are the most important for the virtual\nterms, so that the net correction to the DGLAP is negative and mimics\nshadowing, although the physical origin of the nonlinearity is very different.",

However, due to the black box nature of LLMs,\nit is unclear whether LLM agents actually execute the intended semantics that\nare encoded in their natural language instructions and, if the resulting\ndynamics of interactions are meaningful.

Our\nresults show that, while it is possible to engineer prompts that approximate\nthe intended dynamics, the quality of these simulations is highly sensitive to\nthe particular choice of prompts. Importantly, simulations are even sensitive\nto arbitrary variations such as minor wording changes and whitespace.

These matching conditions can be derived from initial data given on\na Cauchy hypersurface by integrating forward and backward in time the field\nequations to leading order in an asymptotic expansion, all the way to future\nand past null infinities. The standard matching conditions considered in the\nliterature are valid only in the case when the expansion near null infinity\n(which is generically polylogarithmic) has no dominant logarithmic term.\n  This paper is the first in a series in which we derive the matching\nconditions for a massless scalar field with initial conditions leading to\ndominant logarithms at null infinity. We prove that these involve the opposite\nsign with respect to the usual matching conditions. We also analyse the\nmatching of the angle-dependent conserved charges that follow from the\nasymptotic decay and Lorentz invariance. We show in particular that these are\nwell defined and finite at null infinity even in the presence of leading\nlogarithmic terms provided one uses the correct definitions.\n  The free massless scalar field has the virtue of presenting the\npolylogarithmic features in a particularly clear setting that shows their\ninevitability, since there is no subtle gauge fixing issue or nonlinear\nintrincacies involved in the problem. We also consider the case of higher\nspacetime dimensions where fractional powers of $r$ (odd spacetime dimensions)\nor subdominant logarithmic terms (even spacetime dimensions) are present. Mixed\nmatching conditions are then relevant. In subsequent papers, we will extend the\nanalysis to the electromagnetic and the gravitational fields.",

In galactic and accretion discs, large-scale magnetic\nfields are thought to arise from mean-field dynamo action, particularly the\n$\\alpha^2\\Omega$-dynamo. Using non-ideal MHD equations, we model a section of\nthe galactic disc where the large-scale magnetic field is generated by an\nimposed $\\alpha$-effect and differential rotation. We extend our previous study\nof the interplay between magnetic buoyancy and the mean-field dynamo by\nincorporating differential rotation, which enhances the dynamo, and cosmic\nrays, which amplify magnetic buoyancy.We construct a simple 1D model which\nreplicates all significant features of the 3D simulations. Simulations confirm\nthat magnetic buoyancy can lead to oscillatory magnetic fields and reveal that\nit can change the magnetic field parity between quadrupolar and dipolar states.\nDifferential rotation facilitates this switch in parity, suggesting that the\nlarge-scale magnetic field can adopt a dipolar parity within a few kiloparsecs\nof the galactic centre. In contrast, quadrupolar parity may remain predominant\nin the outer parts of a galactic disc. Cosmic rays accelerate both the dynamo\nand the MBI, supporting oscillatory non-linear states and a spatial magnetic\nfield structure similar to the alternating magnetic field directions observed\nin {the haloes of} some edge-on galaxies.",

    "abstract": "To shorten the door-to-puncture time for better treating patients with acute\nischemic stroke, it is highly desired to obtain quantitative cerebral perfusion\nimages using C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) equipped in the\ninterventional suite. However, limited by the slow gantry rotation speed, the\ntemporal resolution and temporal sampling density of typical C-arm CBCT are\nmuch poorer than those of multi-detector-row CT in the diagnostic imaging\nsuite. The current quantitative perfusion imaging includes two cascaded steps:\ntime-resolved image reconstruction and perfusion parametric estimation. For\ntime-resolved image reconstruction, the technical challenge imposed by poor\ntemporal resolution and poor sampling density causes inaccurate quantification\nof the temporal variation of cerebral artery and tissue attenuation values. For\nperfusion parametric estimation, it remains a technical challenge to\nappropriately design the handcrafted regularization for better solving the\nassociated deconvolution problem. These two challenges together prevent\nobtaining quantitatively accurate perfusion images using C-arm CBCT. The\npurpose of this work is to simultaneously address these two challenges by\ncombining the two cascaded steps into a single joint optimization problem and\nreconstructing quantitative perfusion images directly from the measured\nsinogram data. In the developed direct cerebral perfusion parametric image\nreconstruction technique, TRAINER in short, the quantitative perfusion images\nhave been represented as a subject-specific conditional generative model\ntrained under the constraint of the time-resolved CT forward model, perfusion\nconvolutional model, and the subject's own measured sinogram data. Results\nshown in this paper demonstrated that using TRAINER, quantitative cerebral\nperfusion images can be accurately obtained using C-arm CBCT in the\ninterventional suite.",

Our method shows high accuracy, particularly in identifying\nlandmarks on the anterior part of the vertebra with an average distance of 2.24\nmm for anterior longitudinal ligament and 1.26 mm for posterior longitudinal\nligament landmarks. The landmark detection requires approximately 3.0 seconds\nper vertebra, providing a substantial improvement over existing methods.\nClinical relevance: using the proposed method, the required landmarks that\nrepresent origin and insertion points for forces in the biomechanical spine\nmodels can be localized automatically in an accurate and time-efficient manner.",

    "abstract": "Fourier pricing methods such as the Carr-Madan formula or the COS method are\nclassic tools for pricing European options for advanced models such as the\nHeston model. These methods require tuning parameters such as a damping factor,\na truncation range, a number of terms, etc. Estimating these tuning parameters\nis difficult or computationally expensive. Recently, machine learning\ntechniques have been proposed for fast pricing: they are able to learn the\nfunctional relationship between the parameters of the Heston model and the\noption price. However, machine learning techniques suffer from error control\nand require retraining for different error tolerances. In this research, we\npropose to learn the tuning parameters of the Fourier methods (instead of the\nprices) using machine learning techniques. As a result, we obtain very fast\nalgorithms with full error control: Our approach works with any error tolerance\nwithout retraining, as demonstrated in numerical experiments using the Heston\nmodel.",

Despite advancements in imaging technologies, the\nreconstruction of complete 3D spine models often faces challenges due to\nlimitations in imaging modalities such as planar X-Ray and missing certain\nspinal structures, such as the spinal or transverse processes, in volumetric\nmedical images and resulting segmentations. In this study, we present a novel\naccurate and time-efficient method to reconstruct complete 3D lumbar spine\nmodels from incomplete 3D vertebral bodies obtained from segmented magnetic\nresonance images (MRI). In our method, we use an affine transformation to align\nartificial vertebra models with patient-specific incomplete vertebrae. The\ntransformation matrix is derived from vertebra landmarks, which are\nautomatically detected on the vertebra endplates. The results of our evaluation\ndemonstrate the high accuracy of the performed registration, achieving an\naverage point-to-model distance of 1.95 mm. Additionally, in assessing the\nmorphological properties of the vertebrae and intervertebral characteristics,\nour method demonstrated a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.4{\\deg} in the angles\nof functional spine units (FSUs), emphasizing its effectiveness in maintaining\nimportant spinal features throughout the transformation process of individual\nvertebrae.

Photoevaporation models can explain this \"two-timescale\"\nnature of disc evolution through the removal of inner regions of discs after a\nfew million years. However, they also predict the existence of a population of\nnon-accreting discs with large cavities. Such discs are scarce within the\nobserved population, suggesting the models are incomplete. We explore whether\nradiation-pressure-driven outflows are able to remove enough dust to fit\nobservations. We simulate these outflows using cuDisc, including dust dynamics,\ngrowth/fragmentation, radiative transfer and a parameterisation of internal\nphotoevaporation. We find that, in most cases, dust mass-loss rates are around\n5-10 times too small to meet observational constraints. Particles are launched\nfrom the disc inner rim, however grains larger than around a micron do not\nescape in the outflow, meaning mass-loss rates are too low for the initial dust\nmasses at gap-opening. Only systems that have smooth photoevaporation profiles\nwith gas mass-loss rates $>\\sim 5 \\times 10^{-9}$ $M_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and disc\ndust masses $<\\sim$1 $M_\\oplus$ at the time of gap opening can meet\nobservational constraints; in the current models these manifest as EUV winds\ndriven by atypically large high-energy photon fluxes.

    "abstract": "Time-to-Collision (TTC) estimation lies in the core of the forward collision\nwarning (FCW) functionality, which is key to all Automatic Emergency Braking\n(AEB) systems. Although the success of solutions using frame-based cameras\n(e.g., Mobileye's solutions) has been witnessed in normal situations, some\nextreme cases, such as the sudden variation in the relative speed of leading\nvehicles and the sudden appearance of pedestrians, still pose significant risks\nthat cannot be handled. This is due to the inherent imaging principles of\nframe-based cameras, where the time interval between adjacent exposures\nintroduces considerable system latency to AEB. Event cameras, as a novel\nbio-inspired sensor, offer ultra-high temporal resolution and can\nasynchronously report brightness changes at the microsecond level. To explore\nthe potential of event cameras in the above-mentioned challenging cases, we\npropose EvTTC, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first multi-sensor\ndataset focusing on TTC tasks under high-relative-speed scenarios. EvTTC\nconsists of data collected using standard cameras and event cameras, covering\nvarious potential collision scenarios in daily driving and involving multiple\ncollision objects. Additionally, LiDAR and GNSS/INS measurements are provided\nfor the calculation of ground-truth TTC. Considering the high cost of testing\nTTC algorithms on full-scale mobile platforms, we also provide a small-scale\nTTC testbed for experimental validation and data augmentation. All the data and\nthe design of the testbed are open sourced, and they can serve as a benchmark\nthat will facilitate the development of vision-based TTC techniques.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the complex dynamics of trust and distrust in digital\ngovernment technologies by approaching the cancellation of machine voting in\nthe Netherlands (2006-07). This case describes how a previously trusted system\ncan collapse, how paradoxical the relationship between trust and distrust is,\nand how it interacts with adopting and managing electoral technologies. The\nanalysis stresses how, although being a central component, technology's\ntrustworthiness dialogues with the socio-technical context in which it is\ninserted, for example, underscoring the relevance of public administration in\nsecuring technological environments. Beyond these insights, the research offers\nbroader reflections on trust and distrust in data-driven technologies,\nadvocating for differentiated strategies for building trust versus managing\ndistrust. Overall, this paper contributes to understanding trust dynamics in\ndigital government technologies, with implications for policymaking and\ntechnology adoption strategies.",

Ion channels that emulate biological synapses are still\nin the early stages of development, especially the tunability of memory states.\nHere, we demonstrate that cations such as K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Al3+ intercalated\nin the interlayer spaces of vermiculite, result in highly confined channels of\nsize 3-5 {\\AA}. They host exotic memristor properties through ion exchange\ndynamics, even at high salt concentrations of 1 M. The bipolar memristor\ncharacteristics observed are tunable with frequency, geometric asymmetry, ion\nconcentration, and intercalants. Notably, we observe polarization-flipping\nmemristor behavior in two cases: one with Al3+ ions and another with devices\nhaving a geometric asymmetry ratio greater than 15. This inversion is\nattributed to the over-screening of counter-ions due to their accumulation at\nthe channel entrance. Our results suggest that ion exchange dynamics, ion-ion\ninteractions, and ion accumulation/depletion mechanisms, particularly with\nmultivalent ions, can be harnessed to develop advanced memristor devices.",

OCEAN is the\nfirst framework to explore code authorship attribution on compiled binaries in\nan open-world and extreme scenario, where two code samples from unknown authors\nare compared to determine if they are developed by the same author. To evaluate\nOCEAN, we introduce new realistic datasets: CONAN, to improve the performance\nof authorship attribution systems in real-world use cases, and SNOOPY, to\nincrease the robustness of the evaluation of such systems. We use CONAN to\ntrain our model and evaluate on SNOOPY, a fully unseen dataset, resulting in an\nAUROC score of 0.86 even when using high compiler optimizations. We further\nshow that CONAN improves performance by 7% compared to the previously used\nGoogle Code Jam dataset. Additionally, OCEAN outperforms previous methods in\ntheir settings, achieving a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art SCS-Gan in\nscenarios analyzing source code. Furthermore, OCEAN can detect code injections\nfrom an unknown author in a software update, underscoring its value for\nsecuring software supply chains.",

The\nforecast of the aforementioned parameters is becoming crucial for the operation\nof the large telescope installations which possess atmospheric-sensitive\nequipment equipped with Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. FAST performs\nautomatically all the steps of an atmosphere forecast process: initialisation\nand forcing data, atmospheric simulation, postprocessing and managing of the\noutputs.The role of such service is useful both in optimizing beforehand AO\ninstruments to the next atmospheric conditions and in planning telescope\nobservations (especially in \"service mode\") in order to maximize the scientific\noutput. FAST was applied first to the ALTA Center project, which provides\nforecasts for the LBT telescope. Then it was extended to the more recent\nproject FATE that is a similar forecast system applied to the VLT. Since its\nfirst version FAST evolved and it has has been modified to fit with the\ndifferent technical specifications of the different projects gaining in\nmodularity. It is now able to provide forecasts on different timescales (from\ndays to hours before) and to provide forecast during night and day time. After\nseveral years of continuous development we can say that FAST reached full\nmaturity and it is now ready for applications to other projects/sites.",

Two superconducting domes are commonly found in unconventional\nsuperconductors and exhibit unique normal states and electronic structures. In\nthis study, we conducted electromagnetic transport measurements to establish a\ncomplete phase diagram, successfully observing the two superconducting domes in\nFeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (0 $\\le x \\le$ 0.25) and FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ (0 $\\le x \\le$ 1)\nsuperconductors. The normal state resistivity on SC1 shows the strange metal\nstate, with a power exponent approximately equal to 1 ($\\rho (T)\\propto T^n$\nwith $n\\sim 1$), whereas the exponent on SC2 is less than 1. A bulk Dirac state\nobserved on SC1, completely synchronized with the strange metal behavior,\nindicating a close relationship between them. While a topological surface Dirac\nstate is witnessed on SC2, and undergoes a sign change near the pure nematic\nquantum critical point. The evolution of the Dirac states indicates that the\nappearance of the two superconducting domes may originate from the Fermi\nsurface reconstruction. Our findings highlight distinct Dirac states and normal\nstate resistivity across the two superconducting domes, providing convincing\nevidence for the existence of the two different pairing mechanisms in\nFeSe-based superconductors.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a widespread and chronic metabolic bone disease that often\nremains undiagnosed and untreated due to limited access to bone mineral density\n(BMD) tests like Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). In response to this\nchallenge, current advancements are pivoting towards detecting osteoporosis by\nexamining alternative indicators from peripheral bone areas, with the goal of\nincreasing screening rates without added expenses or time. In this paper, we\npresent a method to predict osteoporosis using hand and wrist X-ray images,\nwhich are both widely accessible and affordable, though their link to DXA-based\ndata is not thoroughly explored. We employ a sophisticated image segmentation\nmodel that utilizes a mixture of probabilistic U-Net decoders, specifically\ndesigned to capture predictive uncertainty in the segmentation of the ulna,\nradius, and metacarpal bones. This model is formulated as an optimal transport\n(OT) problem, enabling it to handle the inherent uncertainties in image\nsegmentation more effectively. Further, we adopt a self-supervised learning\n(SSL) approach to extract meaningful representations without the need for\nexplicit labels, and move on to classify osteoporosis in a supervised manner.\nOur method is evaluated on a dataset with 192 individuals, cross-referencing\ntheir verified osteoporosis conditions against the standard DXA test. With a\nnotable classification score, this integration of uncertainty-aware\nsegmentation and self-supervised learning represents a pioneering effort in\nleveraging vision-based techniques for the early detection of osteoporosis from\nperipheral skeletal sites.",

Nevertheless, one can tune\nfeatures of a disordered spring network, ranging from bulk elastic constants to\nspecific allosteric responses, through highly precise alterations of the\nstructure. This has been understood through the notion of independent\nbond-level response -- the observation that in many cases, different springs\nhave different effects on different properties. While this idea has motivated\ninverse design in numerous contexts, it has not been formalized and quantified\nin a general context that not just informs but enables and predicts inverse\ndesign. Here, we show how to quantify independent response by linearizing the\nsimultaneous change in multiple emergent features, and introduce the much\nstronger notion of fully independent response. Remarkably, we find that the\nmechanical properties of disordered solids are always fully independent across\na wide array of scenarios, regardless of the target features, tunable\nparameters, and details of particle-particle interactions. Furthermore, our\nformulation quantifies the susceptibility of feature changes to parameter\nchanges, which we find to be correlated with the maximum linear tunability.\nThese results formalize our understanding of a key fundamental difference\nbetween ordered and disordered solids while also creating a practical tool to\nboth understand and perform inverse design.",

On one side, it may\npromote model training as the noisy labels can depict the sample to some\nextent. On the other side, it brings high label ambiguity as the noisy labels\nare quite undistinguishable from the ground-truth label. To leverage the\nnuances of IDPLL effectively, for the first time we create class-wise\nembeddings for each sample, which allow us to explore the relationship of\ninstance-dependent noisy labels, i.e., the class-wise embeddings in the\ncandidate label set should have high similarity, while the class-wise\nembeddings between the candidate label set and the non-candidate label set\nshould have high dissimilarity.

While the classical security of\nKAC and the quantum security of the $1$-round KAC (i.e. Even-Mansour) cipher\nare well understood, the quantum resistance of multi-round KAC remains largely\nunexplored. We focus on the $2$-round KAC construction, defined using public\n$n$-bit permutations $P_1$, $P_2$ and keys $k_0$, $k_1$, and $k_2$ as $E(x) =\nP_2(P_1(x \\oplus k_0) \\oplus k_1) \\oplus k_2$. Our main contributions are as\nfollows:\n  1. Quantum Lower Bounds. We provide the first formal analysis showing that a\n$2$-round KAC is quantum-secure in both the $Q1$ and $Q2$ models. Specifically,\nin the $Q1$ model, a (non-adaptive) adversary must make at least $2^{2n/5}$\nquantum queries to the public permutations and at least $2^{2n/5}$ classical\nqueries to the cipher in order to distinguish it from a random permutation (in\ncontrast to the classical lower bound of $2^{2n/3}$ queries). As a corollary,\nwe show that in the $Q2$ model, a (non-adaptive) adversary requires $2^{n/4}$\nquantum queries. To achieve such a result, we employ the quantum hybrid method\nalong with recently proposed lifting theorems in the ideal cipher and random\npermutation oracle model.\n  2. Quantum Key-Recovery Attack. We give the first nontrivial quantum\nkey-recovery attack on multi-round KAC in the $Q1$ model. Our quantum attack\napplies to any $t$-round KAC and achieves quantum query complexity $O(2^{\\alpha\nn})$, where $\\alpha = \\frac{t(t+1)}{(t+1)^2 + 1}$, improving over the best\nknown classical bound of $O(2^{\\alpha' n})$, where $\\alpha' = \\frac{t}{t+1}$,\nfrom Bogdanov et al.

Having reproducibility in\nmind, with these ambiguities the outcomes of the analysis are difficult to\nreport, e.g., in the methods section of a manuscript or on a platform for\nscientific findings. Here, we illustrate how using an ontology to describe the\nanalysis process can assist in improving clarity, rigour and comprehensibility\nby complementing, simplifying and classifying the details of the\nimplementation. We implemented the Neuroelectrophysiology Analysis Ontology\n(NEAO) to define a unified vocabulary and to standardize the descriptions of\nthe processes involved in analyzing data from neuroelectrophysiology\nexperiments. Real-world examples demonstrate how the NEAO can be employed to\nannotate provenance information describing an analysis process.

Continual segmentation\n(CS) is a potential technique to solve this issue, but a significant obstacle\nis the intractable balance between previous domains (stability) and new domains\n(plasticity) during CS. Furthermore, how to utilize two kinds of features of\nSAM, images and prompts, in an efficient and effective CS manner remains a\nsignificant hurdle. In this work, we propose a novel CS method, termed SAMCL,\nto address these challenges. It is the first study to empower SAM with the CS\nability across dynamic domains. SAMCL decouples stability and plasticity during\nCS by two components: $\\textit{AugModule}$ and $\\textit{Module Selector}$.\nSpecifically, SAMCL leverages individual $\\textit{AugModule}$ to effectively\nand efficiently learn new relationships between images and prompts in each\ndomain. $\\textit{Module Selector}$ selects the appropriate module during\ntesting, based on the inherent ability of SAM to distinguish between different\ndomains. These two components enable SAMCL to realize a task-agnostic method\nwithout any interference across different domains. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SAMCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an\nexceptionally low average forgetting of just $0.5$%, along with at least a\n$2.5$% improvement in transferring to unseen domains.

To simplify the system reconfiguration and eliminate the\npilot overhead required by the effective channel estimation, we considered an\nanalog-only beamforming (AoBF) architecture in this study. The AoBF is designed\nwith the aim of maximizing the sum rate, which is then transformed into a\nproblem, maximizing the power transmitted to the target user equipment (UE) and\nmeanwhile minimizing the power leaked to the other UEs. To solve this problem,\nwe used beam focusing and beam nulling and proposed two AoBF schemes based on\nthe majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm. First, the AoBF scheme based on\nperfect CSI is proposed, with the focus on the beamforming performance and\nregardless of the CSI acquisition. Then, the AoBF scheme based on imperfect CSI\nis proposed, where the low-dimensional imperfect CSI is obtained by beam\nsweeping based on a near-field codebook. Simulation results demonstrate that\nthe two AoBF schemes can approach the sum rate of the HBF schemes but\noutperform HBF schemes in terms of energy efficiency (EE).",

Extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of PromptCD, consistently\nachieving superior performance across various CDCD scenarios.

Here, we\napply this formula by considering only requirements that are already\nscientifically quantifiable. By implementing models for star formation rate,\ninitial mass function, and galactic mass distribution, we calculate the spatial\ndistribution of disk stars as functions of stellar mass and birth age. We apply\nmodels for the GHZ and evaluate the thermal stability of Earth-like atmospheres\nwith various CO$_2$ mixing ratios by implementing the newest stellar evolution\nand upper atmosphere models. In addition, we include the rocky exoplanet\nfrequency, the availability of oceans and subaerial land, and the potential\nlarge moon requirement by evaluating their importance and implementing these\ncriteria from minima to maxima values. We also discuss factors that are not yet\nscientifically quantifiable but may be requirements for EHs to evolve.

The rise of web-based apps and mobile devices has\nprovided valuable user data for mobility-related research. However, real-world\nmobility data is costly and raises privacy concerns. To protect privacy while\nretaining key features of real-world movement, the demand for synthetic data\nhas steadily increased. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown great\npotential for mobility trajectory generation due to their ability to model\nrandomness and uncertainty. However, existing approaches often directly apply\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) noise sampling from image generation\ntechniques, which fail to account for the spatiotemporal correlations and\nsocial interactions that shape urban mobility patterns. In this paper, we\npropose CoDiffMob, a diffusion model for urban mobility generation with\ncollaborative noise priors, we emphasize the critical role of noise in\ndiffusion models for generating mobility data. By leveraging both individual\nmovement characteristics and population-wide dynamics, we construct novel\ncollaborative noise priors that provide richer and more informative guidance\nthroughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method, with generated data accurately capturing both\nindividual preferences and collective patterns, achieving an improvement of\nover 32%. Furthermore, it can effectively replace web-derived mobility data to\nbetter support downstream applications, while safeguarding user privacy and\nfostering a more secure and ethical web.

To study this individual debunking effort - which we call\n'Debunk-It-Yourself (DIY)' - we conducted an exploratory survey n=14 health\nprofessionals who wage a misinformation counter-influence campaign through\nvideos on TikTok. We focused on two topics, nutrition and mental health, which\nare the ones most often subjected to misinformation on the platform.

Contrasting the 'Debunk-It-Yourself' effort with\nthe one TikTok and other platforms (reluctantly) put in moderation, we offer\nrecommendations for a structured response against the misinformation's\ninfluence by the users themselves.",

In this work, we provide a detailed\ndescription of the properties of these \"conservative\" circular orbits and,\nusing the approximation represented by the Landau-Lifshitz equation, examine\nthe role of the radiative back-reaction force that influences the motion of\ncharged particles following both the in and off equatorial circular orbits, as\nwell as the chaotic orbits confined to belts centered around the circular\norbits. To provide clear insight into these dynamics, we compare particle\nmotion with and without the back-reaction force. We demonstrate that, in the\ncase of an attractive Lorentz force, the back-reaction leads to the charged\nparticles falling onto the neutron star's surface in all scenarios considered.\nFor the repulsive Lorentz force, in combination with the back-reaction force,\nwe observe a widening of stable equatorial circular orbits; the off-equatorial\norbits shift toward the equatorial plane and subsequently widen if they are\nsufficiently close to the plane.

For multi-parameter\npersistent homology, which lacks a complete discrete invariant, and where\npersistence modules are no longer always interval decomposable, many\nalternative invariants have been proposed. Many of these invariants are akin to\npersistence barcodes, in that they assign (possibly signed) multisets of\nintervals. Furthermore, to any interval decomposable module, those invariants\nassign the multiset of intervals that correspond to its summands. Naturally,\nidentifying the relationships among invariants of this type, or ordering them\nby their discriminating power, is a fundamental question. To address this, we\nformalize the notion of barcoding invariants and compare their discriminating\npowers. Notably, this formalization enables us to prove that all barcoding\ninvariants with the same basis possess equivalent discriminating power. One\nimplication of our result is that introducing a new barcoding invariant does\nnot add any value in terms of its generic discriminating power, even if the new\ninvariant is distinct from the existing barcoding invariants. This suggests the\nneed for a more flexible and adaptable comparison framework for barcoding\ninvariants.

The basic idea behind the approach is that mixtures with\nsimilar pairs of components will have similar thermodynamic properties. The SBM\nis trained on a matrix that contains some data for a given property for\ndifferent binary mixtures; the missing entries are then predicted by the SBM.\nAs an example, we consider the prediction of isothermal activity coefficients\nat infinite dilution ($\\gamma^\\infty_{ij}$) and show that the SBM outperforms\nthe well-established physical methods modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) and\nCOSMO-SAC-dsp. In this case, the matrix is only sparsely occupied, and it is\nshown that the SBM works also if only a limited number of data for similar\nmixtures is available. The SBM idea can be transferred to any mixture property\nand is a powerful tool for generating essential data for many applications.",

However, a key question\nremains: Do quantum layers offer computational advantages over purely classical\nmodels? This paper explores how classical and hybrid models adapt their\narchitectural complexity to increasing problem complexity. Using a multiclass\nclassification problem, we benchmark classical models to identify optimal\nconfigurations for accuracy and efficiency, establishing a baseline for\ncomparison. HQNNs, simulated on classical hardware (as common in the Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era), are evaluated for their scaling of\nfloating-point operations (FLOPs) and parameter growth. Our findings reveal\nthat as problem complexity increases, HQNNs exhibit more efficient scaling of\narchitectural complexity and computational resources. For example, from 10 to\n110 features, HQNNs show an 53.1% increase in FLOPs compared to 88.1% for\nclassical models, despite simulation overheads. Additionally, the parameter\ngrowth rate is slower in HQNNs (81.4%) than in classical models (88.5%). These\nresults highlight HQNNs' scalability and resource efficiency, positioning them\nas a promising alternative for solving complex computational problems.",

    "abstract": "Road anomalies can be defined as irregularities on the road surface or in the\nsurface itself. Some may be intentional (such as speedbumps), accidental (such\nas materials falling off a truck), or the result of roads' excessive use or low\nor no maintenance, such as potholes. Despite their varying origins, these\nirregularities often harm vehicles substantially. Speed bumps are intentionally\nplaced for safety but are dangerous due to their non-standard shape, size, and\nlack of proper markings. Potholes are unintentional and can also cause severe\ndamage. To address the detection of these anomalies, we need an automated road\nmonitoring system. Today, various systems exist that use visual information to\ntrack these anomalies. Still, due to poor lighting conditions and improper or\nmissing markings, they may go undetected and have severe consequences for\npublic transport, automated vehicles, etc. In this paper, the Enhanced\nTemporal-BiLSTM Network (ETLNet) is introduced as a novel approach that\nintegrates two Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) layers with a Bidirectional\nLong Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer. This combination is tailored to detect\nanomalies effectively irrespective of lighting conditions, as it depends not on\nvisuals but smartphone inertial sensor data. Our methodology employs\naccelerometer and gyroscope sensors, typically in smartphones, to gather data\non road conditions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the ETLNet model\nmaintains an F1-score for detecting speed bumps of 99.3%. The ETLNet model's\nrobustness and efficiency significantly advance automated road surface\nmonitoring technologies.",

    "abstract": "The very existence of partially massless spin 2 supermultiplet tell us that\npartially massless spin 2 has two natural superpartners: massless spin 3/2 and\nmassive spin 3/2 with some special value of mass. As for any pair of fields\nconnected by global supertransformations there are two natural questions:\nexistence of the self-interaction and possibility to make supertransformations\nto be local by switching their interaction with massless spin 3/2 gravitino. At\nfirst, we consider a self-interaction for the partially massless spin 2 and\nmassive spin 3/2 which may be considered as the first approximation to\npartially massless supergravity and provide a direct construction of the\nminimal (i.e. having no more than one derivative) vertex which resembles usual\nsupergravity. Then we consider localization of global supersymmetry which\nconnects partially massless spin 2 with its two possible superpartners --\nmassless spin 3/2 and massive with special mass value. For the first case we\nalso managed to construct a minimal vertex having no more that one derivative.\nAgain this vertex can be considered as a part of what can be called partially\nmassless $N=2$ supergravity. As for the second case, the corresponding vertex\ndoes exist but it has higher derivative terms.",

    "abstract": "Causal systems often exhibit variations of the underlying causal mechanisms\nbetween the variables of the system. Often, these changes are driven by\ndifferent environments or internal states in which the system operates, and we\nrefer to context variables as those variables that indicate this change in\ncausal mechanisms. An example are the causal relations in soil\nmoisture-temperature interactions and their dependence on soil moisture\nregimes: Dry soil triggers a dependence of soil moisture on latent heat, while\nenvironments with wet soil do not feature such a feedback, making it a\ncontext-specific property. Crucially, a regime or context variable such as soil\nmoisture need not be exogenous and can be influenced by the dynamical system\nvariables - precipitation can make a dry soil wet - leading to joint systems\nwith endogenous context variables. In this work we investigate the assumptions\nfor constraint-based causal discovery of context-specific information in\nsystems with endogenous context variables. We show that naive approaches such\nas learning different regime graphs on masked data, or pooling all data, can\nlead to uninformative results. We propose an adaptive constraint-based\ndiscovery algorithm and give a detailed discussion on the connection to\nstructural causal models, including sufficiency assumptions, which allow to\nprove the soundness of our algorithm and to interpret the results causally.\nNumerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed method over\nalternative baselines, but they also unveil current limitations of our method.",

To solve the\nnontrivial task of selecting samples, which on one hand reflect the DRL agent's\ncapabilities of choosing the right action but on the other hand also cover\nenough state space to generalize well, we developed an algorithm to iteratively\ntrain DTs.\n  In this short paper, we apply this algorithm to a real-world implementation\nof a robotic task for the first time. Real-world tasks pose additional\nchallenges compared to simulations, such as noise and delays. The task consists\nof a physical pendulum attached to a cart, which moves on a linear track. By\nmovements to the left and to the right, the pendulum is to be swung in the\nupright position and balanced in the unstable equilibrium. Our results\ndemonstrate the applicability of the algorithm to real-world tasks by\ngenerating a DT whose performance matches the performance of the DRL agent,\nwhile consisting of fewer parameters.

The pulse velocities\nare taken to be time-dependent with a power law dependence on the instantaneous\namplitudes, as suggested by blob velocity scaling theories. In accordance with\nexperimental measurements, the pulse function is assumed to be exponential and\nthe amplitudes are taken to be exponentially distributed. As a consequence of\nlinear damping and time-dependent velocities, it is demonstrated that the\npulses stagnate during their radial motion. This makes the average pulse\nwaiting time increase radially outwards in the scrape-off layer of magnetically\nconfined plasmas. In the case that pulse velocities are proportional to their\namplitudes, the mean value of the process decreases exponentially with radial\ncoordinate, similar to the case when all pulses have the same, time-independent\nvelocity. The profile e-folding length is then given by the product of the\naverage pulse velocity and the parallel transit time. Moreover, both the\naverage pulse amplitude and the average velocity are the same at all radial\npositions due to stagnation of slow and small-amplitude pulses. In general, an\nincreasing average pulse velocity results in a flattened radial profile of the\nmean value of the process as well as a higher relative fluctuation level,\nstrongly enhancing plasma-surface interactions.",

    "abstract": "We consider succinct data structures for representing a set of $n$ horizontal\nline segments in the plane given in rank space to support \\emph{segment\naccess}, \\emph{segment selection}, and \\emph{segment rank} queries. A segment\naccess query finds the segment $(x_1, x_2, y)$ given its $y$-coordinate\n($y$-coordinates of the segments are distinct), a segment selection query finds\nthe $j$th smallest segment (the segment with the $j$th smallest $y$-coordinate)\namong the segments crossing the vertical line for a given $x$-coordinate, and a\nsegment rank query finds the number of segments crossing the vertical line\nthrough $x$-coordinate $i$ with $y$-coordinate at most $y$, for a given $x$ and\n$y$. This problem is a central component in compressed data structures for\npersistent strings supporting random access.\n  Our main result is data structure using $2n\\lg{n} + O(n\\lg{n}/\\lg{\\lg{n}})$\nbits of space and $O(\\lg{n}/\\lg{\\lg{n}})$ query time for all operations. We\nshow that this space bound is optimal up to lower-order terms. We will also\nshow that the query time for segment rank is optimal. The query time for\nsegment selection is also optimal by a previous bound.\n  To obtain our results, we present a novel segment wavelet tree data structure\nof independent interest. This structure is inspired by and extends the classic\nwavelet tree for sequences. This leads to a simple, succinct solution with\n$O(\\log n)$ query times. We then extend this solution to obtain optimal query\ntime. Our space lower bound follows from a simple counting argument, and our\nlower bound for segment rank is obtained by a reduction from 2-dimensional\ncounting.",

The pioneering methods reconstruct\nrealistic head avatars with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), which have been\nlimited by training and rendering speed. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) significantly improve the efficiency of training and\nrendering. However, the surface inconsistency of 3DGS results in subpar\ngeometric accuracy; later, 2DGS uses 2D surfels to enhance geometric accuracy\nat the expense of rendering fidelity.

Our main idea is to utilize\n2D Gaussians to reconstruct the surface of the 3D head, ensuring geometric\naccuracy. We attach the 2D Gaussians to the triangular mesh of the FLAME model\nand connect additional 3D Gaussians to those 2D Gaussians where the rendering\nquality of 2DGS is inadequate, creating a mixed 2D-3D Gaussian representation.\nThese 2D-3D Gaussians can then be animated using FLAME parameters. We further\nintroduce a progressive training strategy that first trains the 2D Gaussians\nand then fine-tunes the mixed 2D-3D Gaussians.

The\nframework is designed to progressively challenge users by simulating real-life\nPM tasks in a controlled VR environment.

During the initial session,\nthe baseline PM abilities of the participants were assessed using the memory\nfor intentions screening test (MIST). The subsequent sessions alternated\nbetween VIT and VRT with increasing task complexity. The MIST scores were\nsignificantly positively correlated with task achievement, confirming the\nefficacy of the system. Imagery abilities were also strongly correlated with\ntask performance, underscoring the importance of visual imagery in PM\ntraining.Usability and user experiences, evaluated on the Jikaku-sho Shirabe\nquestionnaire and the user experience questionnaire, indicated an overall\npositive user experience but higher fatigue levels in elderly participants.\nThis study demonstrates that the VR--PMT system effectively trains and assesses\nPM abilities by integrating VIT and VRT, supporting its potential for broader\napplications in clinical settings.",

The implicit knowledge alignment objective focuses on\nincorporating textual patterns of knowledge into LLMs through triple completion\nlanguage modeling.

In fact, these algorithms have been run on\nreal hardware only for problems in quantum physics, such as Hamiltonians of a\nfew qubits systems. These problems are particularly favorable for quantum\nhardware, since their matrices are the sum of just a few unitary terms and\nsince only shallow quantum circuits are required to estimate the cost function.\nHowever, for many interesting problems in linear algebra, it appears far less\ntrivial to find an efficient decomposition and to trade it off with the depth\nof the cost quantum circuits. A first simple yet interesting instance to\nconsider are tridiagonal systems of equations. These arise, for instance, in\nthe discretization of one-dimensional finite element analyses.\n  This work presents a method to solve a class of tridiagonal systems of\nequations with the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), a recently\nproposed variational hybrid algorithm for solving linear systems. In\nparticular, we present a new decomposition for this class of matrices based on\nboth Pauli strings and multi--qubit gates, resulting in less terms than those\nobtained by just using Pauli gates.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new approach for uncertainty-aware retinal layer\nsegmentation in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) scans using probabilistic\nsigned distance functions (SDF). Traditional pixel-wise and regression-based\nmethods primarily encounter difficulties in precise segmentation and lack of\ngeometrical grounding respectively. To address these shortcomings, our\nmethodology refines the segmentation by predicting a signed distance function\n(SDF) that effectively parameterizes the retinal layer shape via level set. We\nfurther enhance the framework by integrating probabilistic modeling, applying\nGaussian distributions to encapsulate the uncertainty in the shape\nparameterization. This ensures a robust representation of the retinal layer\nmorphology even in the presence of ambiguous input, imaging noise, and\nunreliable segmentations. Both quantitative and qualitative evaluations\ndemonstrate superior performance when compared to other methods. Additionally,\nwe conducted experiments on artificially distorted datasets with various noise\ntypes-shadowing, blinking, speckle, and motion-common in OCT scans to showcase\nthe effectiveness of our uncertainty estimation. Our findings demonstrate the\npossibility to obtain reliable segmentation of retinal layers, as well as an\ninitial step towards the characterization of layer integrity, a key biomarker\nfor disease progression.

For such\nfamilies, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial can be fully encoded in two sets of\nintegers, corresponding to the numerator and denominator exponents, which turn\nout to be related to the Khovanov homology and its Euler characteristics.\nMoreover, a relation between the HOMFLY-PT and Kauffman polynomials, which was\noriginally found for torus knots, is now proven for several such families.\nInterestingly, this relation is equivalent to the vanishing of the two-crosscap\nBPS invariants in topological string theory.

A\ntrickle group is defined by a presentation with relations of the form $xy = zx$\nand $x^\\mu = 1$, that are governed by a simplicial graph, called a trickle\ngraph, endowed with a partial ordering on the vertices, a vertex labeling, and\nan automorphism of the star of each vertex. We show several examples of trickle\ngroups, including extended cactus groups, certain finite-index subgroups of\nvirtual cactus groups, Thompson group F, and ordered quandle groups. A\nterminating and confluent rewriting system is established for trickle groups,\nenabling the definition of normal forms and a solution to the word problem. An\nalternative solution to the word problem is also presented, offering a simpler\nformulation akin to Tits' approach for Coxeter groups and Green's for graph\nproducts of cyclic groups. A natural notion of a parabolic subgraph of a\ntrickle graph is introduced. The subgroup generated by the vertices of such a\nsubgraph is called a standard parabolic subgroup and it is shown to be the\ntrickle group associated with the subgraph itself. The intersection of two\nstandard parabolic subgroups is also proven to be a standard parabolic\nsubgroup. If only relations of the form $xy = zx$ are retained in the\ndefinition of a trickle group, then the resulting group is called a preGarside\ntrickle group.

However, existing works involving both visible\nand infrared images only focus on image fusion, instead of object detection.\nMoreover, they directly fuse the two kinds of image modalities, which ignores\nthe mutual interference between them. To fuse the two modalities to maximize\nthe advantages of cross-modality, we design a dual-enhancement-based\ncross-modality object detection network DEYOLO, in which semantic-spatial cross\nmodality and novel bi-directional decoupled focus modules are designed to\nachieve the detection-centered mutual enhancement of RGB-infrared (RGB-IR).\nSpecifically, a dual semantic enhancing channel weight assignment module (DECA)\nand a dual spatial enhancing pixel weight assignment module (DEPA) are firstly\nproposed to aggregate cross-modality information in the feature space to\nimprove the feature representation ability, such that feature fusion can aim at\nthe object detection task.

This modulation compares favorably with recent reports obtained\nupon electromigration induced by ionic gating.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address the challenge of recipe personalization through\ningredient substitution. We make use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to build\nan ingredient substitution system designed to predict plausible substitute\ningredients within a given recipe context. Given that the use of LLMs for this\ntask has been barely done, we carry out an extensive set of experiments to\ndetermine the best LLM, prompt, and the fine-tuning setups. We further\nexperiment with methods such as multi-task learning, two-stage fine-tuning, and\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO). The experiments are conducted using the\npublicly available Recipe1MSub corpus. The best results are produced by the\nMistral7-Base LLM after fine-tuning and DPO. This result outperforms the strong\nbaseline available for the same corpus with a Hit@1 score of 22.04.

ESA's Gaia space mission is providing\nprecise parallaxes which yield an additional constraint to be included in the\nmodel grid search. Using a handful of main-sequence benchmark stars, we perform\na uniform characterisation of these stars. We assess the accuracy and precision\nof stellar parameters inferred from grid-based searches when a Gaia-based\nluminosity is combined with different stellar constraints. We also examine the\nprecision needed for an interferometric radius (model-independent radius) to\nhave a significant contribution towards the determination of stellar mass in\nthe optimisation process. Our findings show that more precise stellar masses\nare inferred for some stars when seismic and spectroscopic constraints are\ncomplemented with a Gaia-based luminosity, with a scatter varying from 1.9 per\ncent to 0.8 per cent. However, the inferred stellar radii are underestimated\nwhen compared to the interferometric radii and yield a scatter of $\\sim$1.9 per\ncent. In addition, we demonstrate that a precisely measured interferometric\nradius ($\\lesssim$ 1 per cent) when applied in the optimisation process yields\na mass with a precision $\\lesssim$ 1.5 per cent. Finally, we find that when\nonly $l=0$ mode oscillation frequencies are available, robust masses and radii\nare still attainable.

We add new perspectives by investigating weighted Poincare\ninequalities. Our contributions are twofold. In a first part, we provide new\ntheoretical results for weighted Poincare inequalities, guided by GSA needs. We\nrevisit the construction of weights from monotonic functions, providing a new\nproof from a spectral point of view. In this approach, given a monotonic\nfunction g, the weight is built such that g is the first non-trivial\neigenfunction of a convenient diffusion operator. This allows us to reconsider\nthe linear standard, i.e. the weight associated to a linear g. In particular,\nwe construct weights that guarantee the existence of an orthonormal basis of\neigenfunctions, leading to approximation of Sobol indices with Parseval\nformulas. In a second part, we develop specific methods for GSA. We study the\nequality case of the upper bound of a total Sobol index, and link the sharpness\nof the inequality to the proximity of the main effect to the eigenfunction.\nThis leads us to theoretically investigate the construction of data-driven\nweights from estimators of the main effects when they are monotonic, another\nextension of the linear standard. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of using\nweights on a GSA study of two toy models and a real flooding application,\ninvolving the Poincare constant and/or the whole eigenbasis.",

However,\ncurrent research focuses on discrete speech tokens to align with discrete text\ntokens for language modelling, which depends on an audio codec with residual\nconnections or independent group tokens, such a codec usually leverages large\nscale and diverse datasets training to ensure that the discrete speech codes\nhave good representation for varied domain, noise, style data reconstruction as\nwell as a well-designed codec quantizer and encoder-decoder architecture for\ndiscrete token language modelling. This paper introduces Flow-Omni, a\ncontinuous speech token based GPT-4o like model, capable of real-time speech\ninteraction and low streaming latency. Specifically, first, instead of\ncross-entropy loss only, we combine flow matching loss with a pretrained\nautoregressive LLM and a small MLP network to predict the probability\ndistribution of the continuous-valued speech tokens from speech prompt. second,\nwe incorporated the continuous speech tokens to Flow-Omni multi-modality\ntraining, thereby achieving robust speech-to-speech performance with discrete\ntext tokens and continuous speech tokens together.

    "abstract": "The integration of conversational agents into our daily lives has become\nincreasingly common, yet many of these agents cannot engage in deep\ninteractions with humans. Despite this, there is a noticeable shortage of\ndatasets that capture multimodal information from human-robot interaction\ndialogues. To address this gap, we have recorded a novel multimodal dataset\n(MERCI) that encompasses rich embodied interaction data. The process involved\nasking participants to complete a questionnaire and gathering their profiles on\nten topics, such as hobbies and favorite music. Subsequently, we initiated\nconversations between the robot and the participants, leveraging GPT-4 to\ngenerate contextually appropriate responses based on the participant's profile\nand emotional state, as determined by facial expression recognition and\nsentiment analysis. Automatic and user evaluations were conducted to assess the\noverall quality of the collected data. The results of both evaluations\nindicated a high level of naturalness, engagement, fluency, consistency, and\nrelevance in the conversation, as well as the robot's ability to provide\nempathetic responses. It is worth noting that the dataset is derived from\ngenuine interactions with the robot, involving participants who provided\npersonal information and conveyed actual emotions.",

Firstly, we give an elementary proof\nof the following statement: Let $M$ be a (closed, in both the geometrical and\ntopological sense of the word) topological manifold embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\nIf $M$ has positive reach, then M can locally be written as the graph of a\n$C^{1,1}$ from the tangent space to the normal space. Conversely if $M$ can\nlocally written as the graph of a $C^{1,1}$ function from the tangent space to\nthe normal space, then $M$ has positive reach. The result was hinted at by\nFederer when he introduced the reach, and proved by Lytchak. Lytchak's proof\nrelies heavily CAT(k)-theory. The proof presented here uses only basic results\non homology. Secondly, we give optimal Lipschitz-constants for the derivative,\nin other words we give an optimal bound for the angle between tangent spaces in\nterm of the distance between the points. This improves earlier results, that\nwere either suboptimal or assumed that the manifold was $C^2$. Thirdly, we\ngeneralize a result by Aamari et al. which explains the how the reach is\nattained from the smooth setting to general sets of positive reach.",

Our first-principles calculations\nreveal that when the twist angle between the two layers is sufficiently small,\nthese materials foster identical, localized quantum wells within the moir\\'e\nsuperlattices. Each quantum well accommodates a few dispersionless bands and\nlocalized states, akin to the discrete energy levels of an alkali atom.\nExisting experimental techniques allow for individual initialization,\nmanipulation, and readout of the local quantum states.

Most of preference data is generated from the model itself.\nHowever, existing methods require high-quality critical labels, which are\ncostly and rely on human or proprietary models like GPT-4V.

To further enhance model performance, we\nemploy an additional supervised fine-tuning stage after preference tuning.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models rely heavily on large volumes of labeled data to achieve\nhigh performance. However, real-world datasets often contain noisy labels due\nto human error, ambiguity, or resource constraints during the annotation\nprocess. Instance-dependent label noise (IDN), where the probability of a label\nbeing corrupted depends on the input features, poses a significant challenge\nbecause it is more prevalent and harder to address than instance-independent\nnoise. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid framework that combines\nself-supervised learning using SimCLR with iterative pseudo-label refinement to\nmitigate the effects of IDN. The self-supervised pre-training phase enables the\nmodel to learn robust feature representations without relying on potentially\nnoisy labels, establishing a noise-agnostic foundation. Subsequently, we employ\nan iterative training process with pseudo-label refinement, where confidently\npredicted samples are identified through a multistage approach and their labels\nare updated to improve label quality progressively. We evaluate our method on\nthe CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets augmented with synthetic instance-dependent\nnoise at varying noise levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,\nparticularly under high noise conditions, achieving notable improvements in\nclassification accuracy and robustness.

The effect of PxB on the protein-free model system (MS)\ncomposed of four phospholipids (diC16:0PC/16:0-18:1PC/16:0-18:2PC/16:0-18:1PG)\nwas examined in parallel to distinguish the specificity of the composition of\nPSUR. We used several experimental techniques (differential scanning\ncalorimetry, small-and wide-angle X-ray scattering, small angle neutron\nscattering, fluorescence spectroscopy, and electrophoretic light scattering) to\ncharacterize the binding of PxB to both EPS. Electrostatic interactions PxB\n-EPS are dominant. The results obtained support the concept of cationic PxB\nmolecules lying on the surface of the PSUR bilayer, strengthening the\nmultilamellar structure of the PSUR as derived from SAXS and SANS. A\nprotein-free MS mimics natural EPS well but was found to be less resistant to\npenetration of PxB into the lipid bilayer. PxB does not affect the gel-to-fluid\nphase transition temperature Tm of PSUR, while Tm increased by ~ +2 $^\\circ$C\nin MS. The decrease of the thickness of the lipid bilayer (dL) of PSUR upon PxB\nbinding is negligible. The hydrophobic tail of the PxB molecule does not\npenetrate the bilayer as derived from SANS data analysis and changes in lateral\npressure monitored by excimer fluorescence at two depths of the hydrophobic\nregion of the bilayer. Changes in dL of protein-free MS show a biphasic\ndependence on the adsorbed amount of PxB with a minimum close to the point of\nelectroneutrality of the mixture. Our results do not discourage the concept of\na combined treatment with PxBenriched Curosurf. However, the amount of PxB must\nbe carefully assessed (less than 5 wt% relative to the mass of the surfactant)\nto avoid inversion of the surface charge of the membrane.",

    "abstract": "The Generalized Persistence Diagram (GPD) for multi-parameter persistence\nnaturally extends the classical notion of persistence diagram for one-parameter\npersistence. However, unlike its classical counterpart, computing the GPD\nremains a significant challenge. The main hurdle is that, while the GPD is\ndefined as the M\\\"obius inversion of the Generalized Rank Invariant (GRI),\ncomputing the GRI is intractable due to the formidable size of its domain,\ni.e., the set of all connected and convex subsets in a finite grid in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \\geq 2$. This computational intractability suggests\nseeking alternative approaches to computing the GPD.\n  In order to study the complexity associated to computing the GPD, it is\nuseful to consider its classical one-parameter counterpart, where for a\nfiltration of a simplicial complex with $n$ simplices, its persistence diagram\ncontains at most $n$ points. This observation leads to the question: 'Given a\n$d$-parameter simplicial filtration, could the cardinality of its GPD\n(specifically, the support of the GPD) also be bounded by a polynomial in the\nnumber of simplices in the filtration?' This is the case for $d=1$, where we\ncompute the persistence diagram directly at the simplicial filtration level. If\nthis were also the case for $d\\geq2$, it might be possible to compute the GPD\ndirectly and much more efficiently without relying on the GRI.\n  We show that the answer to the question above is negative, demonstrating the\ninherent difficulty of computing the GPD. More specifically, we construct a\nsequence of $d$-parameter simplicial filtrations where the cardinalities of\ntheir GPDs are not bounded by any polynomial in the the number of simplices.\nFurthermore, we show that several commonly used methods for constructing\nmulti-parameter filtrations can give rise to such \"wild\" filtrations.",

Hybrid representations that integrate implicit and\nexplicit features offer a way to mitigate these limitations. However, when\napplied in parallelized block-wise training, two critical issues arise since\nreconstruction accuracy deteriorates due to reduced data diversity when\ntraining each block independently, and parallel training restricts the number\nof divided blocks to the available number of GPUs. To address these issues, we\npropose Momentum-GS, a novel approach that leverages momentum-based\nself-distillation to promote consistency and accuracy across the blocks while\ndecoupling the number of blocks from the physical GPU count. Our method\nmaintains a teacher Gaussian decoder updated with momentum, ensuring a stable\nreference during training. This teacher provides each block with global\nguidance in a self-distillation manner, promoting spatial consistency in\nreconstruction. To further ensure consistency across the blocks, we incorporate\nblock weighting, dynamically adjusting each block's weight according to its\nreconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes show that\nour method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 12.8%\nimprovement in LPIPS over CityGaussian with much fewer divided blocks and\nestablishing a new state of the art.

For the majority of in situ observations of solar wind plasmas\nenabled by heliospheric missions, a three bi-Maxwellian model is commonly\napplied for the ions, assuming that the VDF consists of a proton core, proton\nbeam, and a single He ($\\alpha$) particle population, each with their own\ndensity, bulk velocity, and anisotropic temperature.

Bayesian optimisation, one of\nthe most well-known techniques, typically employs Gaussian processes as\nsurrogate models, leveraging their probabilistic nature to balance exploration\nand exploitation. However, Gaussian processes become computationally\nprohibitive in high-dimensional spaces. Recent alternatives, based on inverse\ndistance weighting (IDW) and radial basis functions (RBFs), offer competitive,\ncomputationally lighter solutions. Despite their efficiency, both traditional\nglobal and Bayesian optimisation strategies suffer from the myopic nature of\ntheir acquisition functions, which focus solely on immediate improvement\nneglecting future implications of the sequential decision making process.\nNonmyopic acquisition functions devised for the Bayesian setting have shown\npromise in improving long-term performance. Yet, their use in deterministic\nstrategies with IDW and RBF remains unexplored.

Specifically, we develop dynamic programming-based paradigms,\nincluding rollout and multi-step scenario-based optimisation schemes, to enable\nlookahead acquisition. These methods optimise a sequence of query points over a\nhorizon (instead of only at the next step) by predicting the evolution of the\nsurrogate model, inherently managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off in\na systematic way via optimisation techniques.

    "abstract": "Influenced by the complexity of volumetric imaging, there is a shortage of\nestablished datasets useful for benchmarking volumetric deep-learning models.\nAs a consequence, new and existing models are not easily comparable, limiting\nthe development of architectures optimized specifically for volumetric data. To\ncounteract this trend, we introduce MozzaVID - a large, clean, and versatile\nvolumetric classification dataset. Our dataset contains X-ray computed\ntomography (CT) images of mozzarella microstructure and enables the\nclassification of 25 cheese types and 149 cheese samples. We provide data in\nthree different resolutions, resulting in three dataset instances containing\nfrom 591 to 37,824 images. While being general-purpose, the dataset also\nfacilitates investigating mozzarella structure properties. The structure of\nfood directly affects its functional properties and thus its consumption\nexperience. Understanding food structure helps tune the production and\nmimicking it enables sustainable alternatives to animal-derived food products.\nThe complex and disordered nature of food structures brings a unique challenge,\nwhere a choice of appropriate imaging method, scale, and sample size is not\ntrivial. With this dataset we aim to address these complexities, contributing\nto more robust structural analysis models.

Interference\nmanagement (IM) plays an integral role in addressing these requirements,\nespecially in ultra-dense SN environments with rapidly varying interference\ninduced by channel characteristics, mobility, and resource limitations. In\ngeneral, IM can be achieved using resource allocation and \\textit{accurate}\nLink adaptation (LA). In this work, we focus on the latter, where we first\nmodel interference at SN devices using the spatially consistent 3GPP channel\nmodel. Following this, we present a discrete-time dynamic state space model\n(DSSM) at a SN access point (AP), where interference power values (IPVs) are\nmodeled as latent variables incorporating underlying modeling errors as well as\ntransmission/protocol delays. Necessary approximations are then presented to\nsimplify the DSSM and to efficiently employ the extended Kalman filter (EKF)\nfor interference prediction. Unlike baseline methods, our proposed approach\npredicts IPVs solely based on the channel quality indicator (CQI) reports\navailable at the SN AP at every transmission time interval (TTI).

Building on our previous Hamiltonian-based methodology, which is\ndesigned to lead networks toward globally optimized states of complete\nconnectivity and minimal energy usage, this research integrates a Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP)-based decision-making model at each node. By leveraging a\ndataset from the Hamiltonian approach, each node independently learns and\nadapts its transmission power in response to local conditions, resulting in\nemergent global behaviors marked by high connectivity and resilience against\nstructural disruptions. This distributed, MLP-driven adaptability allows nodes\nto make context-aware power adjustments autonomously, enabling the network to\nmaintain its optimized state over time.

At 1 K,\nantiskyrmions with a topological charge of -2 emerge as the most stable\nnanodomain state across all examined diameters. In our systematic study, the\nmost robust antiskyrmion was found to have a diameter of 4 nm, maintaining its\noriginal size, shape, and topological charge up to the characteristic\ntemperature T* ~ 85 K. Domains with diameters between 2.8 and approximately 4.5\nnm exhibit fragmentation into six topological defects, termed quarks, each\ncarrying a fractional skyrmion charge of -1/3. For domains larger than 4.5 nm,\neach topological quark splits into two pre-quarks, each with a charge of -1/6.\nThese larger nanodomains demonstrate increased mobility and a growing tendency\nfor shape and skyrmion charge fluctuations. Above the T* temperature, all\nlarger nanodomains gradually shrink to a diameter of about 4 nm before\ncollapsing into a single-domain state.

It is shown that XL-UAAs have larger direction-dependent\nRayleigh distance and uniform power distance than the conventional XL uniform\nlinear arrays (XL-ULAs). Moreover, a closed-form expression for the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is obtained, which depends on collective properties\nof XL-UAAs, such as the distance between the user and the array center,as well\nas the arc radius. In addition, we show that the asymptotic SNR of XL-UAAs with\nthe number of antennas depends on the projection distance of the user to the\nmiddle of the arc array. Finally, numerical results verify that XL-UAAs achieve\na higher SNR than XL-ULAs, especially at larger user incident angles.",

    "abstract": "Precision metrology underpins scientific and technological advancements.\nQuantum metrology offers a pathway to surpass classical sensing limits by\nleveraging quantum states and measurement strategies. However, measuring\nmultiple incompatible observables suffers from quantum backaction, where\nmeasurement of one observable pollutes a subsequent measurement of the other.\nThis is a manifestation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle for two\nnon-commuting observables, such as position and momentum. Here, we demonstrate\nmeasurements of small changes in position and momentum where the uncertainties\nare simultaneously reduced below the standard quantum limit (SQL). We measure\n$\\textit{modular observables}$ using tailored, highly non-classical states that\nideally evade measurement backactions. The states are deterministically\nprepared in the single mode of the mechanical motion of a trapped ion using an\noptimal quantum control protocol. Our experiment uses grid states to measure\nsmall changes in position and momentum and shows a metrological gain of up to\n5.1(5)~dB over the simultaneous SQL. Using an adaptive-phase estimation\nalgorithm with Bayesian inference, we estimate these displacements with a\ncombined variance of 2.6(1.1)~dB below the SQL. Furthermore, we examine\nsimultaneously estimating $\\textit{number}$ and $\\textit{phase}$, which are the\npolar counterparts of position and momentum. This is performed by preparing a\nnovel quantum resource -- number-phase states -- and we demonstrate a\nmetrological gain over their SQL. The combination of quantum control and\nmulti-parameter quantum metrology marks a significant step towards\nunprecedented precision with applications ranging from fundamental physics to\nadvanced quantum technologies.",

Previous studies reveal that\nthe lack of annotated resources hinders the direct detection of unforeseen\nbreaking events not covered in yesterday's news.

However, it is\nchallenging for LLMs to provide comprehensive responses to complex or\ncontroversial issues due to limited diversity. In this work, we propose the\nStance Separated Multi-Agent Debate (S2MAD) to address this issue.\nSpecifically, we firstly introduce Stance Separation, categorizing comments as\neither supporting or opposing the original claim. Subsequently, claims are\nclassified as subjective or objective, enabling agents to generate reasonable\ninitial viewpoints with different prompt strategies for each type of claim.\nDebaters then follow specific instructions through multiple rounds of debate to\nreach a consensus. If a consensus is not reached, a judge agent evaluates the\nopinions and delivers a final verdict on the claim's veracity. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nmodel outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and\neffectively improves the performance of LLMs in breaking event rumor detection.",

    "abstract": "Integrating invariance into data representations is a principled design in\nintelligent systems and web applications. Representations play a fundamental\nrole, where systems and applications are both built on meaningful\nrepresentations of digital inputs (rather than the raw data). In fact, the\nproper design/learning of such representations relies on priors w.r.t. the task\nof interest. Here, the concept of symmetry from the Erlangen Program may be the\nmost fruitful prior -- informally, a symmetry of a system is a transformation\nthat leaves a certain property of the system invariant. Symmetry priors are\nubiquitous, e.g., translation as a symmetry of the object classification, where\nobject category is invariant under translation. The quest for invariance is as\nold as pattern recognition and data mining itself. Invariant design has been\nthe cornerstone of various representations in the era before deep learning,\nsuch as the SIFT. As we enter the early era of deep learning, the invariance\nprinciple is largely ignored and replaced by a data-driven paradigm, such as\nthe CNN. However, this neglect did not last long before they encountered\nbottlenecks regarding robustness, interpretability, efficiency, and so on. The\ninvariance principle has returned in the era of rethinking deep learning,\nforming a new field known as Geometric Deep Learning (GDL). In this tutorial,\nwe will give a historical perspective of the invariance in data\nrepresentations. More importantly, we will identify those research dilemmas,\npromising works, future directions, and web applications.",

As T2I models\nrequire extensive data and computational resources for training, they\nconstitute highly valued intellectual property (IP) for their legitimate\nowners, yet making them incentive targets for unauthorized fine-tuning by\nadversaries seeking to leverage these models for customized, usually profitable\napplications. Existing IP protection methods for diffusion models generally\ninvolve embedding watermark patterns and then verifying ownership through\ngenerated outputs examination, or inspecting the model's feature space.\nHowever, these techniques are inherently ineffective in practical scenarios\nwhen the watermarked model undergoes fine-tuning, and the feature space is\ninaccessible during verification ((i.e., black-box setting). The model is prone\nto forgetting the previously learned watermark knowledge when it adapts to a\nnew task. To address this challenge, we propose SleeperMark, a novel framework\ndesigned to embed resilient watermarks into T2I diffusion models. SleeperMark\nexplicitly guides the model to disentangle the watermark information from the\nsemantic concepts it learns, allowing the model to retain the embedded\nwatermark while continuing to be adapted to new downstream tasks. Our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SleeperMark across various types\nof diffusion models, including latent diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion)\nand pixel diffusion models (e.g., DeepFloyd-IF), showing robustness against\ndownstream fine-tuning and various attacks at both the image and model levels,\nwith minimal impact on the model's generative capability.

In solving for energy conservation, we incorporate\nthe heat source term resulting from irreversible mechanical deformations, which\nembodies viscoelastic and viscoplastic work, and by considering the total\nstress tensor and total inelastic strain rate tensors, including dilatant\nplasticity effects for lithospheric-scale applications, instead of only the\nshear terms as is usually assumed for incompressible materials. This form of\nthe work term thus allows to consider, volumetric deformation and to couple the\nenergy equation to the constitutive description, and hence the stress balance,\nvia the evolving temperature field. Code design enables us to switch individual\nfeatures of this general rheology ``on or off'' and thus to benchmark this\nimplementation with published numerical experiments of crustal-scale shortening\nexperiments. We investigate whether ``brittle-plastic'' compressibility can\npromote or inhibit localization of deformation and thermal evolution during\ncompression for crustal, and upper mantle rheology. For both crustal-scale and\nlithospheric-scale experiments, we establish that the feedback from volumetric\ndissipation, while contributing to temperature increase along with shear\ndissipation, can potentially slow down heat production per unit time, depending\non the choice of boundary conditions.

    "abstract": "Currently, state-of-the-art RL methods excel in single-task settings, but\nthey still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to catastrophic\nforgetting challenges, where previously learned tasks are forgotten as new\ntasks are introduced. This multi-task learning capability is significantly\nimportant for generalist agents, where adaptation features are highly required\n(e.g., autonomous robots). On the other hand, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)\nhave emerged as alternative energy-efficient neural network algorithms due to\ntheir sparse spike-based operations. Toward this, we propose MTSpark, a novel\nmethodology to enable multi-task RL using spiking networks. Specifically,\nMTSpark develops a Deep Spiking Q-Network (DSQN) with active dendrites and\ndueling structure by leveraging task-specific context signals. Specifically,\neach neuron computes task-dependent activations that dynamically modulate\ninputs, forming specialized sub-networks for each task. Moreover, this\nbioplausible network model also benefits from SNNs, enhancing energy efficiency\nand making the model suitable for hardware implementation. Experimental results\nshow that, our MTSpark effectively learns multiple tasks with higher\nperformance compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, MTSpark\nsuccessfully achieves high score in three Atari games (i.e., Pong: -5.4,\nBreakout: 0.6, and Enduro: 371.2), reaching human-level performance (i.e.,\nPong: -3, Breakout: 31, and Enduro: 368), where state-of-the-art struggle to\nachieve. In addition, our MTSpark also shows better accuracy in image\nclassification tasks than the state-of-the-art.

Regardless of how this is achieved, parsimonious representations\nseem to better support the advancement of scientific understanding.

This paper explores contention-based random access\n(CBRA) schemes for asynchronous access in massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) systems. The symmetry across the accessing users with\nthe same pilots is broken by leveraging the delay information inherent to\nasynchronous systems and the angle information from massive MIMO to enhance\nactivity detection (AD) and channel estimation (CE). The problem is formulated\nas a sparse recovery in the delay-angle domain. The challenge is that the\nrecovery signal exhibits both row-sparse and cluster-sparse structure, with\nunknown cluster sizes and locations. We address this by a cluster-extended\nsparse Bayesian learning (CE-SBL) algorithm that introduces a new weighted\nprior to capture the signal structure and extends the expectation maximization\n(EM) algorithm for hyperparameter estimation. Simulation results demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed method in joint AD and CE.",

    "abstract": "HD 60435 is a well-known rapidly oscillating (roAp) Ap star with a series of\nalternating even and odd degree modes, making it a prime asteroseismic target.\nIt is also an oblique pulsator with rotational inclination, $i$, and\nmagnetic/pulsation obliquity, $\\beta$, such that both magnetic/pulsation poles\nare viewed over the rotation period, $P_{\\rm rot} = 7.679696$ d, determined\nfrom rotational light variations. While some roAp stars have stable pulsation\nmode amplitudes over decades, HD 60435 is known to have amplitude variations on\ntime scales as short as 1 d. We show from 5 yr of {\\it TESS} observations that\nthere is strong amplitude modulation on this short time scale with possible\nmode interactions. Most remarkably, HD 60435 stopped pulsating during the time\nspan of the {\\it TESS} observations. This is the first time that any pulsating\nstar has been observed to cease pulsating entirely. That has implications for\nmode interaction, excitation and damping, and is relevant to the problem of why\nonly some stars in many pulsation instability strips pulsate, while others do\nnot. During a 24.45-d time span of the {\\it TESS} data when there was mode\nstability for a dipole mode and a quadrupole mode, the oblique pulsator model\nconstrained $i$ and $\\beta$, which we used to model those modes with a magnetic\npulsation model from which we determined a polar field strength of 4 kG, in\ngood agreement with a known magnetic measurement. We modelled the frequency\nseparations showing that they can constrain the global metallicity, something\nthat is not possible from spectroscopy of the highly peculiar Ap atmosphere.",

While reinforcement learning from human\nfeedback (RLHF) has become the predominant mechanism for alignment in\nnon-embodied domains like large language models, it has not seen the same\nsuccess in aligning visuomotor policies due to the prohibitive amount of human\nfeedback required to learn visual reward functions. To address this limitation,\nwe propose Representation-Aligned Preference-based Learning (RAPL), an\nobservation-only method for learning visual rewards from significantly less\nhuman preference feedback. Unlike traditional RLHF, RAPL focuses human feedback\non fine-tuning pre-trained vision encoders to align with the end-user's visual\nrepresentation and then constructs a dense visual reward via feature matching\nin this aligned representation space. We first validate RAPL through simulation\nexperiments in the X-Magical benchmark and Franka Panda robotic manipulation,\ndemonstrating that it can learn rewards aligned with human preferences, more\nefficiently uses preference data, and generalizes across robot embodiments.\nFinally, our hardware experiments align pre-trained Diffusion Policies for\nthree object manipulation tasks.

Recently,\ndiffusion generative models have emerged as a competitive class of methods for\nthese tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies and model\nhigh-dimensional states. However, diffusion models typically struggle with\nhandling system states with abrupt changes and generalizing to higher\nresolutions.

To address this\nchallenge, we put forth WRF-GS, a novel framework for channel modeling based on\nwireless radiation field (WRF) reconstruction using 3D Gaussian splatting\n(3D-GS). WRF-GS employs 3D Gaussian primitives and neural networks to capture\nthe interactions between the environment and radio signals, enabling efficient\nWRF reconstruction and visualization of the propagation characteristics. The\nreconstructed WRF can then be used to synthesize the spatial spectrum for\ncomprehensive wireless channel characterization. While WRF-GS demonstrates\nremarkable effectiveness, it faces limitations in capturing high-frequency\nsignal variations caused by complex multipath effects. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose WRF-GS+, an enhanced framework that integrates\nelectromagnetic wave physics into the neural network design. WRF-GS+ leverages\ndeformable 3D Gaussians to model both static and dynamic components of the WRF,\nsignificantly improving its ability to characterize signal variations. In\naddition, WRF-GS+ enhances the splatting process by simplifying the 3D-GS\nmodeling process and improving computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Recently, the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) by the Dark\nEnergy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) indicate a potential deviation from the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model. Some studies suggest that the data points from the\nluminous red galaxies (LRG) survey in DESI BAO data may contribute to this\ndiscrepancy. In this work, our main goal is to investigate whether this\ndeviation is caused by the parameterization of the equation of state (EoS) of\ndark energy (DE). Hence, we have examined four popular parameterized dark\nenergy models in our analysis: the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL),\nBarboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), and Feng-Shen-Li-Li\n(FSLL) parameterizations. Considering that LRG1 and LRG2 data points may lead\nto deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model, we use two versions of DESI BAO data,\ndiffering in whether these data points are included. Additionally, to break the\nparameter degeneracies and obtain robust constraint results, we introduce Type\nIa supernovae (SNe Ia) and quasars (QSO) in our analysis. Our findings indicate\nthat in these parameterizations, the deviation from ($w_0$,$w_{1}$)=(-1,0)\nbecomes more pronounced when using the combined data from DESI BAO, SNe Ia, and\nQSO compilations. Here, $w_{0}$ and $w_{1}$ represent the EoS of DE. It\nsuggests that the parameterizations of the EoS of DE have little impact on the\ndeviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Besides, our analysis potentially hints\nthat dark energy may have dynamic properties. In addition, the results obtained\nfrom different BAO datasets demonstrate that the LRG1 and LRG2 data points do\nindeed contribute to a deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Finally,\naccording to the statistical criteria, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)\nand the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the joint constraints provide\nsubstantial observational support to the BA and FSLL models.",

Unlike existing methods\nthat generate the scene sequentially, we frame the problem as single-image\npanorama and depth estimation. Once the coherent panoramic image and its\ncorresponding depth are obtained, the scene can be reconstructed by inpainting\nthe small occluded regions and projecting them into 3D space. Our key\ncontribution is formulating single-image panorama and depth estimation as two\noptimization tasks and introducing alternating minimization strategies to\neffectively solve their objectives.

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive Novel View Synthesis\n(NVS) results in a real-time rendering manner. During training, it relies\nheavily on the average magnitude of view-space positional gradients to grow\nGaussians to reduce rendering loss. However, this average operation smooths the\npositional gradients from different viewpoints and rendering errors from\ndifferent pixels, hindering the growth and optimization of many defective\nGaussians. This leads to strong spurious artifacts in some areas. To address\nthis problem, we propose Hard Gaussian Splatting, dubbed HGS, which considers\nmulti-view significant positional gradients and rendering errors to grow hard\nGaussians that fill the gaps of classical Gaussian Splatting on 3D scenes, thus\nachieving superior NVS results. In detail, we present positional gradient\ndriven HGS, which leverages multi-view significant positional gradients to\nuncover hard Gaussians. Moreover, we propose rendering error guided HGS, which\nidentifies noticeable pixel rendering errors and potentially over-large\nGaussians to jointly mine hard Gaussians. By growing and optimizing these hard\nGaussians, our method helps to resolve blurring and needle-like artifacts.\nExperiments on various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art rendering quality while maintaining real-time efficiency.",

We envision a\nfuture service scenario where wireless sensing service providers distribute\nsensing models to users. During usage, users might request new sensing\ncapabilities. For example, if someone is away from home on a business trip or\nvacation for an extended period, they may want a new sensing capability that\ncan detect falls in elderly parents or grandparents and promptly alert them.

To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in model\nupdates where updating model parameters to implement new capabilities leads to\nthe loss of existing capabilities we design knowledge distillation and weight\nalignment modules. These modules enable the sensing model to acquire new\ncapabilities while retaining the existing ones. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on the large-scale XRF55 dataset across Wi-Fi, millimeter-wave\nradar, and RFID modalities to simulate scenarios where four users sequentially\nintroduced new customized demands.

Existing\nstudies train video quality assessment models that rely on human-annotated\nratings for video evaluation but overlook the reasoning behind evaluations,\nlimiting their ability to capture nuanced human criteria. Moreover, aligning\nT2V model using video-based human feedback remains unexplored. Therefore, this\npaper proposes LiFT, the first method designed to leverage human feedback for\nT2V model alignment. Specifically, we first construct a Human Rating Annotation\ndataset, LiFT-HRA, consisting of approximately 10k human annotations, each\nincluding a score and its corresponding rationale. Based on this, we train a\nreward model LiFT-Critic to learn reward function effectively, which serves as\na proxy for human judgment, measuring the alignment between given videos and\nhuman expectations. Lastly, we leverage the learned reward function to align\nthe T2V model by maximizing the reward-weighted likelihood.

Lithium (Li) is the only\nexperimentally known substitute that can increase the Curie temperature in\nferroelectric niobate-based perovskites, yet the mechanism remains unresolved.\nHere, the unique phenomenon in Li-substituted KNbO3 is investigated using\nfirst-principles density functional theory. Theoretical calculations show that\nLi substitution at the A-site of perovskite introduces compressive chemical\npressure, reducing Nb-O hybridization and associated ferroelectric instability.\nHowever, the large off-center displacement of the Li cation compensates for\nthis reduction and further enhances the soft polar mode, thereby raising the\nCurie temperature. In addition, the stability of the tetragonal phase over the\northorhombic phase is predicted upon Li substitution, which reasonably explains\nthe experimental observation of a decreased orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase\ntransition temperature. Finally, a metastable anti-phase polar state in which\nthe Li cation displaces oppositely to the Nb cation is revealed, which could\nalso contribute to the variation of phase transition temperatures. These\nfindings provide critical insights into the atomic-scale mechanisms governing\nCurie temperature enhancement in ferroelectrics and pave the way for designing\nadvanced ferroelectric materials with improved thermal stability and functional\nperformance.",

Modal analysis can reveal insights into the\nmechanisms governing this process, which are otherwise obscured by nonlocal\ndamping effects. Here, we offer a fresh modal perspective on the transition of\nthe plasmonic response using quantum hydrodynamic theory (QHT)-based\nquasinormal mode (QNM) analysis.

The complex eigenfrequency particularly provides accurate\ninformation on the linewidth and quality factor of the plasmon modes. We\nintroduce an index to characterize charge-transfer efficiency, especially for\nthe charge-transfer plasmon. The significant role of nonlocal damping in the\nmode evolution is elucidated by our mode-resolved QHT-QNM analysis.

    "abstract": "Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse\nenvironments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing\npatterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human\nactions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall\ndetection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where\neven minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This\nsensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when\napplying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To\naddress this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for\ncross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global\ndistributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its\npopularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to\nmisalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is\nachieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum\nMean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless\nsensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the\ntarget domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains\nwithin each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability\nissue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance\nfluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to\ndetermine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of\nlabeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the\nsupport set from the target domain during training and employing it as a\nvalidation set to determine the stopping criterion.The dataset and code are\npublicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .",

    "abstract": "Clustering based on vibration responses, such as transmissibility functions\n(TFs), is promising in structural anomaly detection, but most existing\napproaches struggle with determining the optimal cluster number and handling\nhigh-dimensional streaming data, while their shallow structures also make them\nsensitive to manually-engineered feature quality. To bridge this gap, this work\nproposes the Dirichlet process-deep generative model-integrated incremental\nlearning (DPGIIL) for clustering by combining the advantages of deep generative\nmodels (DGMs) in representation learning and the Dirichlet process mixture\nmodel (DPMM) in identifying distinct patterns in observed data. By introducing\na DPMM prior into the latent space of DGMs, DPGIIL automatically captures\ndissimilarities in extracted latent representations, enabling both generative\nmodeling and clustering. Within the context of variational Bayesian inference,\na lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of DPGIIL, tighter than the\nevidence lower bound given sufficient training data, is derived analytically,\nwhich enables the joint optimization of DGM and DPMM parameters, thereby\nallowing the DPMM to regularize the DGM's feature extraction process.\nAdditionally, a greedy split-merge scheme-based coordinate ascent variational\ninference method is devised to accelerate the optimization. The summary\nstatistics of the DPMM, along with the network parameters, are used to retain\ninformation about previous data for incremental learning. Notably, this study\nuses variational autoencoder (VAE) within DPGIIL as an illustrative example,\nwhile this framework is adaptable to other DGMs. Two case studies show that the\nproposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art approaches in structural\nanomaly detection and clustering, while also dynamically generating new\nclusters to indicate the emergence of new structural conditions for online\nmonitoring.",

    "abstract": "Infrared (IR) imaging is commonly used in various scenarios, including\nautonomous driving, fire safety and defense applications. Thus, semantic\nsegmentation of such images is of great interest. However, this task faces\nseveral challenges, including data scarcity, differing contrast and input\nchannel number compared to natural images, and emergence of classes not\nrepresented in databases in certain scenarios, such as defense applications.\nFew-shot segmentation (FSS) provides a framework to overcome these issues by\nsegmenting query images using a few labeled support samples. However, existing\nFSS models for IR images require paired visible RGB images, which is a major\nlimitation since acquiring such paired data is difficult or impossible in some\napplications. In this work, we develop new strategies for FSS of IR images by\nusing generative modeling and fusion techniques. To this end, we propose to\nsynthesize auxiliary data to provide additional channel information to\ncomplement the limited contrast in the IR images, as well as IR data synthesis\nfor data augmentation. Here, the former helps the FSS model to better capture\nthe relationship between the support and query sets, while the latter addresses\nthe issue of data scarcity. Finally, to further improve the former aspect, we\npropose a novel fusion ensemble module for integrating the two different\nmodalities. Our methods are evaluated on different IR datasets, and improve\nupon the state-of-the-art (SOTA) FSS models.",

A handful of existing works focus on dirty-label attacks with\nwrongly-labeled poisoned training samples, which may fail if a benign model\ntrainer corrects the labels. In this paper, we propose Megatron, an evasive\nclean-label backdoor attack against vision transformers, where the attacker\ninjects the backdoor without manipulating the data-labeling process. To\ngenerate an effective trigger, we customize two loss terms based on the\nattention mechanism used in transformer networks, i.e., latent loss and\nattention diffusion loss. The latent loss aligns the last attention layer\nbetween triggered samples and clean samples of the target label. The attention\ndiffusion loss emphasizes the attention diffusion area that encompasses the\ntrigger. A theoretical analysis is provided to underpin the rationale behind\nthe attention diffusion loss. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB,\nCIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of Megatron.\nMegatron can achieve attack success rates of over 90% even when the position of\nthe trigger is slightly shifted during testing. Furthermore, Megatron achieves\nbetter evasiveness than baselines regarding both human visual inspection and\ndefense strategies (i.e., DBAVT, BAVT, Beatrix, TeCo, and SAGE).",

To tackle this problem, we propose Temporally Correlated\nLatent Exploration (TeCLE), which is a novel intrinsic reward formulation that\nemploys an action-conditioned latent space and temporal correlation. The\naction-conditioned latent space estimates the probability distribution of\nstates, thereby avoiding the assignment of excessive intrinsic rewards to\nunpredictable states and effectively addressing both problems.

    "abstract": "For anomaly detection (AD), early approaches often train separate models for\nindividual classes, yielding high performance but posing challenges in\nscalability and resource management. Recent efforts have shifted toward\ntraining a single model capable of handling multiple classes. However, directly\nextending early AD methods to multi-class settings often results in degraded\nperformance. In this paper, we investigate this performance degradation\nobserved in reconstruction-based methods, identifying the key issue:\ninter-class confusion. This confusion emerges when a model trained in\nmulti-class scenarios incorrectly reconstructs samples from one class as those\nof another, thereby exacerbating reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose\na simple yet effective modification, called class-aware contrastive learning\n(CCL). By explicitly leveraging raw object category information (\\eg carpet or\nwood) as supervised signals, we introduce local CL to refine multiscale dense\nfeatures, and global CL to obtain more compact feature representations of\nnormal patterns, thereby effectively adapting the models to multi-class\nsettings. Experiments across five datasets validate the effectiveness of our\napproach, demonstrating significant improvements and superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, ablation studies indicate that\npseudo-class labels can achieve comparable performance.",

In this study, we introduce a novel two-pulse\nlaser approach to induce spall failure by simultaneously illuminating both free\nsurfaces of micro- and nanoscale-thick Ni foils using femtosecond laser\npulses.By comparing this method with the conventional single-pulse approach, we\ndemonstrate the unique effects of introducing a secondary laser pulse.\nExperimental observations utilizing electron microscopy and focused ion beam\nmilling reveal that the proposed approach effectively induces failure at the\ncenter of the sample, resulting from the interaction of unloading tensile waves\nin the bulk. Notably, the spall threshold for nanoscale Ni foils is\nsignificantly reduced in the two-pulse approach compared to the single-pulse\nmethod. While the single-pulse method requires a threshold fluence of 2,500\n$\\mathrm{J \\cdot m^{-2}}$, the two-pulse approach lowers this to 1,750\n$\\mathrm{J \\cdot m^{-2}}$, highlighting its potential to generate higher\nhydrostatic stress with less laser pulse energy. Both experimental results and\nmolecular dynamics simulations indicate ductile failure mechanisms involving\nnucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids, preceded by the emission of\nstacking faults and Shockley partial dislocations.

However, it also suffers\nfrom high processing complexity at the receiver. In this work, we propose a\nnovel pre-equalization based ISAC-OTFS transmission framework, where the\nterrestrial base station (BS) executes pre-equalization based on its estimated\nchannel state information (CSI). In particular, the mean square error of OTFS\nsymbol demodulation and Cramer-Rao lower bound of sensing parameter estimation\nare derived, and their weighted sum is utilized as the metric for optimizing\nthe pre-equalization matrix. To address the formulated problem while taking the\ntime-varying CSI into consideration, a deep learning enabled channel\nprediction-based pre-equalization framework is proposed, where a\nparameter-level channel prediction module is utilized to decouple OTFS channel\nparameters, and a low-dimensional prediction network is leveraged to correct\noutdated CSI. A CSI processing module is then used to initialize the input of\nthe pre-equalization module. Finally, a residual-structured deep neural network\nis cascaded to execute pre-equalization. Simulation results show that under the\nproposed framework, the demodulation complexity at the receiver as well as the\npilot overhead for channel estimation, are significantly reduced, while the\nsymbol detection performance approaches those of conventional minimum mean\nsquare error equalization and perfect CSI.",

Prophylactic treatment of an intracranial aneurysm also involves\nrisk, hence identifying rupture-prone aneurysms is of substantial clinical\nimportance. This systematic review aims to evaluate the performance of machine\nlearning algorithms for predicting intracranial aneurysm rupture risk.\n  Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched\nuntil December 2023. Studies incorporating any machine learning algorithm to\npredict the risk of rupture of an intracranial aneurysm were included.

Results: Out of 10,307\nrecords screened, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria for this review\nincorporating a total of 20,286 aneurysm cases.

    "abstract": "As deep learning models scale, their training cost has surged significantly.\nDue to both hardware advancements and limitations in current software stacks,\nthe need for data efficiency has risen. Data efficiency refers to the effective\nhiding of data access latency and the avoidance of unnecessary data movements.\nMajor challenges arise from the growing disparity between GPU memory bandwidth\nand computational throughput, imminent GPU memory capacity limitations, and\ninefficiencies in the PyTorch software stack, including a lack of\ndevice-specific PCIe transfer optimizations and high-level domain-specific\nabstractions. To effectively mitigate these data inefficiencies for deep\nlearning training, this dissertation analyzes data inefficiency in\nrepresentative deep training tasks, specifically in graph neural networks\n(GNNs) and large language models (LLMs). It then proposes novel runtime and\ncode generation techniques to mitigate these challenges and implements these\noptimizations seamlessly within the PyTorch stack while maintaining strong\nprogrammability and interoperability. First, PyTorch-Direct is devised to\nincorporate the GPU-centric PCIe data transfer paradigm in PyTorch for GNN\ntraining. Next, Hector intermediate representation (IR) and its code generator\nare proposed to introduce domain-specific high-level abstraction and\nsystematically address memory-intensive performance challenges for relational\nGNNs. Finally, in LLM training, the throughput has been increasingly\nconstrained by GPU memory capacity. To mitigate this, the SSDTrain offloading\nframework is designed and implemented. Together, these contributions show that\ncode generation and runtime techniques can systematically mitigate the data\nmanagement bottlenecks in deep learning training, which stem from the\ndata-intensive nature of workloads and the oversimplification inherent in the\ndeep learning training software stack.",

Addressing\nblockchain's scalability challenges posed by the growing number of nodes and\ntransactions calls for innovative solutions, among which sharding stands out as\na pivotal approach to significantly enhance blockchain throughput. However,\nexisting schemes still face challenges related to a) the impact of vehicle\nmobility on blockchain consensus, especially for cross-shard transaction; and\nb) the strict requirements of low latency consensus in a highly dynamic\nnetwork.

Specifically, we first develop a standard for evaluating the\nnetwork stability of nodes, combined with the nodes' trust values, to propose a\nnovel robust sharding model that is solved through the design of the Genetic\nSharding Algorithm (GSA). Then, we optimize the broadcast latency of the whole\nsharded network by improving the tree-broadcasting to minimize the maximum\nbroadcast latency within each shard. On this basis, we also design a DAG\nconsensus scheme based on an improved hashgraph protocol, which can efficiently\nhandle cross-shard transactions.

To mitigate this, we present a causal modeling\nframework, which aims to reduce the impact of sensitive attributes on\ndiagnostic predictions. Our approach introduces a novel fairness criterion,\n\\textbf{Diagnosis Fairness}, and a unique fairness metric, leveraging\npath-specific fairness to control the influence of demographic attributes,\nensuring that predictions are primarily informed by clinically relevant\nfeatures rather than sensitive attributes. By incorporating adversarial\nperturbation masks, our framework directs the model to focus on critical image\nregions, suppressing bias-inducing information. Experimental results across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces bias\ndirectly associated with sensitive attributes while preserving diagnostic\naccuracy. Our findings suggest that causal modeling can enhance both fairness\nand interpretability in AI-powered clinical decision support systems.",

    "abstract": "Graph Transformer (GT) has recently emerged as a promising neural network\narchitecture for learning graph-structured data. However, its global attention\nmechanism with quadratic complexity concerning the graph scale prevents wider\napplication to large graphs. While current methods attempt to enhance GT\nscalability by altering model architecture or encoding hierarchical graph data,\nour analysis reveals that these models still suffer from the computational\nbottleneck related to graph-scale operations. In this work, we target the GT\nscalability issue and propose DHIL-GT, a scalable Graph Transformer that\nsimplifies network learning by fully decoupling the graph computation to a\nseparate stage in advance. DHIL-GT effectively retrieves hierarchical\ninformation by exploiting the graph labeling technique, as we show that the\ngraph label hierarchy is more informative than plain adjacency by offering\nglobal connections while promoting locality, and is particularly suitable for\nhandling complex graph patterns such as heterophily. We further design subgraph\nsampling and positional encoding schemes for precomputing model input on top of\ngraph labels in an end-to-end manner. The training stage thus favorably removes\ngraph-related computations, leading to ideal mini-batch capability and GPU\nutilization. Notably, the precomputation and training processes of DHIL-GT\nachieve complexities linear to the number of graph edges and nodes,\nrespectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DHIL-GT is efficient in\nterms of computational boost and mini-batch capability over existing scalable\nGraph Transformer designs on large-scale benchmarks, while achieving top-tier\neffectiveness on both homophilous and heterophilous graphs.",

    "abstract": "Antibody therapies have been employed to address some of today's most\nchallenging diseases, but must meet many criteria during drug development\nbefore reaching a patient. Humanization is a sequence optimization strategy\nthat addresses one critical risk called immunogenicity - a patient's immune\nresponse to the drug - by making an antibody more \"human-like\" in the absence\nof a predictive lab-based test for immunogenicity. However, existing\nhumanization strategies generally yield very few humanized candidates, which\nmay have degraded biophysical properties or decreased drug efficacy. Here, we\nre-frame humanization as a conditional generative modeling task, where\nhumanizing mutations are sampled from a language model trained on human\nantibody data. We describe a sampling process that incorporates models of\ntherapeutic attributes, such as antigen binding affinity, to obtain candidate\nsequences that have both reduced immunogenicity risk and maintained or improved\ntherapeutic properties, allowing this algorithm to be readily embedded into an\niterative antibody optimization campaign. We demonstrate in silico and in lab\nvalidation that in real therapeutic programs our generative humanization method\nproduces diverse sets of antibodies that are both (1) highly-human and (2) have\nfavorable therapeutic properties, such as improved binding to target antigens.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) aims to transfer the timbre from the source\nspeaker to an arbitrary unseen speaker while preserving the original linguistic\ncontent. Despite recent advancements in zero-shot VC using language model-based\nor diffusion-based approaches, several challenges remain: 1) current approaches\nprimarily focus on adapting timbre from unseen speakers and are unable to\ntransfer style and timbre to different unseen speakers independently; 2) these\napproaches often suffer from slower inference speeds due to the autoregressive\nmodeling methods or the need for numerous sampling steps; 3) the quality and\nsimilarity of the converted samples are still not fully satisfactory. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a style controllable zero-shot VC approach\nnamed StableVC, which aims to transfer timbre and style from source speech to\ndifferent unseen target speakers. Specifically, we decompose speech into\nlinguistic content, timbre, and style, and then employ a conditional flow\nmatching module to reconstruct the high-quality mel-spectrogram based on these\ndecomposed features. To effectively capture timbre and style in a zero-shot\nmanner, we introduce a novel dual attention mechanism with an adaptive gate,\nrather than using conventional feature concatenation. With this\nnon-autoregressive design, StableVC can efficiently capture the intricate\ntimbre and style from different unseen speakers and generate high-quality\nspeech significantly faster than real-time. Experiments demonstrate that our\nproposed StableVC outperforms state-of-the-art baseline systems in zero-shot VC\nand achieves flexible control over timbre and style from different unseen\nspeakers. Moreover, StableVC offers approximately 25x and 1.65x faster sampling\ncompared to autoregressive and diffusion-based baselines.",

We carry out the simulation\nwith the help of our multi-fluid flux-corrected transport (mFCT) code which\nincorporates a background magnetic field and anisotropic pressure. The\nanisotropic pressure is modeled with a polybaric pressure model (Stasiewicz\n2004). We find that the resultant turbulent state of the interstellar matter\n(ISM), driven purely by time-dependent heating and cooling with polybaric\npressure is similar in nature to the one driven by external forcing such as by\nsupernova feedback. This demonstrates the universal nature of the turbulence in\nISM, which is largely isobaric and incompressible. The findings of our analysis\nis consistent with the contemporary status of knowledge about the multiphase\nnature of the ISM with volume and mass fractions of the various components of\nthe ISM that is warm, cold, and unstable neutral matter (UNM) in the ranges\nreported by various numerical and observational analysis.Though the strength of\nthe background magnetic field only marginally affects the overall evolution,\nthe ratio of the parallel and perpendicular pressures can considerably alter\nthe mass and volume fractions of the three phases, which can affect the overall\nevolution of the TI in the long run.",

We theoretically\nidentify two distinct signatures using single-dish telescopes (FAST, TMRT, QTT,\nGBT) and interferometers (SKA1/2-MID): transient signals from burst-like\ngravitational wave sources and persistent signals from cosmological background\ngravitational wave sources. These signatures are mapped to graviton spectral\nlines derived from quantum field theory by incorporating spin-2 and mass\nconstraints, resulting in smooth, featureless profiles that are critical for\ndistinguishing gravitational wave signals from astrophysical foregrounds. FAST\nattains a characteristic strain bound of $h_c<10^{-23}$, approaching $10^{-24}$\nin the frequency range of $1-3\\mathrm{~GHz}$ with a 6-hour observation period.\nThis performance exceeds the $5 \\sigma$ detection thresholds for GWs\noriginating from primordial black holes (PBHs) and nears the limits set by Big\nBang nucleosynthesis.

    "abstract": "The CHSH inequality is an inequality used to test locality in quantum theory\nand is recognized as one of Bell's inequalities. In contrast, the KCBS\ninequality is employed to test noncontextuality in quantum theory. While\ncertain quantum states are known to violate these inequalities individually, it\nwas previously assumed that no state could violate both inequalities\nsimultaneously. This assumption is encapsulated in the concept of the `monogamy\nrelation.' It describes a trade-off between nonlocality and contextuality: the\nviolation of one inequality typically excludes the possibility of violating the\nother. However, Xue et al. demonstrated that simultaneous violations of both\nthe CHSH and KCBS inequalities are possible with specific choices of\nobservables. This discovery challenges the universal validity of the monogamy\nrelation. It also suggests that the relationship between contextuality and\nnonlocality is more complex than previously understood. They further showed\nthat numerous scenarios exist where both the CHSH inequality and a\ncontextuality inequality involving more than five observables are violated.\nHowever, the number of such scenarios is finite.\n  Building on this, we present two main results. The first is that there are\ninfinitely many scenarios in which both the CHSH inequality and a contextuality\ninequality involving an odd number of observables are violated. This finding\nreveals the existence of infinitely many scenarios where the monogamy relation\nbetween the CHSH inequality and the noncontextuality inequality no longer\nholds. The second is that certain quantum states violate both the KCBS\ninequality and a nonlocality inequality distinct from the CHSH inequality.\nThese insights deepen our understanding of the complex relationship between\nnonlocality and contextuality, and open avenues for exploring state-dependent\ninequalities and their physical implications.",

To reduce this\nuncertainty, experimental measurements of the half-lives of two-neutrino double\nbeta decay (2v2b) in various nuclei are essential as a benchmark for NME\ncalculations.

In the Phase 1 experiment, we aim to improve the current lower limit\non the 2v2b half-life of 160Gd by a prior study using a Ce-doped Gd2SiO5 (GSO)\ncrystal. Ultimately, in Phase 2, the project seeks to achieve a sensitivity\nsurpassing the theoretical prediction of 7.4 x 10^20 years, enabling the\npotential discovery of the 160Gd 2v2b decay.

The modeled\nbackgrounds are contributions from uranium and thorium decay chains, 40K\npresent in GAGG, and 40K gamma-rays from outside of GAGG. Additionally, we\ndeveloped models for both 2v2b and 0v2b decay by implementing the theoretical\nkinematics of two-electron emission in double beta decay in the GEANT4\nsimulation. As a result, our background models successfully reproduced the\nmeasured background spectrum through fitting. By generating pseudo background\nspectra expected in Phase 1 and analyzing them with the combined background and\n2v2b models, we evaluated the 2v2b sensitivity of Phase 1 to be 2.78 x 10^19\nyears (90% C.L.). This paper presents the development of these simulation\nmodels and the expected sensitivities for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 based on the\npseudo data analyses.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free (CF) architecture and full-duplex (FD) communication are leading\ncandidates for next-generation wireless networks. The CF framework removes cell\nboundaries in traditional cell-based systems, thereby mitigating inter-cell\ninterference and improving coverage probability. In contrast, FD communication\nallows simultaneous transmission and reception on the same frequency-time\nresources, effectively doubling the spectral efficiency (SE). The integration\nof these technologies, known as CF FD communication, leverages the advantages\nof both approaches to enhance the spectral and energy efficiency in wireless\nnetworks. CF FD communication is particularly promising due to the low-power\nand cost-effective FD-enabled access points (APs), which are ideal for\nshort-range transmissions between APs and users. Despite its potential, a\ncomprehensive survey or tutorial on CF FD communication has been notably\nabsent. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature. It begins with\nan overview of FD communication fundamentals, self-interference cancellation\ntechniques, and CF technology principles, including their implications for\ncurrent wireless networks. The discussion then moves to the integration and\ncompatibility of CF and FD technologies, focusing on channel estimation,\nperformance analysis, and resource allocation in CF FD massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (mMIMO) networks, supported by an extensive literature review\nand case studies.",

The\nresult shows that when an electron absorbs N photons a photon vortex with a\nzTAM = N is predominantly radiated, but there are still very small\ncontributions of photons with a zTAM = (N-1) and (N +1) due to the spin flip of\nthe initial electron.

    "abstract": "Traceability is a cornerstone of modern software development, ensuring system\nreliability and facilitating software maintenance. While unsupervised\ntechniques leveraging Information Retrieval (IR) and Machine Learning (ML)\nmethods have been widely used for predicting trace links, their effectiveness\nremains underexplored. In particular, these techniques often assume\ntraceability patterns are present within textual data - a premise that may not\nhold universally. Moreover, standard evaluation metrics such as precision,\nrecall, accuracy, or F1 measure can misrepresent the model performance when\nunderlying data distributions are not properly analyzed. Given that automated\ntraceability techniques tend to struggle to establish links, we need further\ninsight into the information limits related to traceability artifacts. In this\npaper, we propose an approach, TraceXplainer, for using information theory\nmetrics to evaluate and better understand the performance (limits) of\nunsupervised traceability techniques. Specifically, we introduce\nself-information, cross-entropy, and mutual information (MI) as metrics to\nmeasure the informativeness and reliability of traceability links. Through a\ncomprehensive replication and analysis of well-studied datasets and techniques,\nwe investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised techniques that predict\ntraceability links using IR/ML. This application of TraceXplainer illustrates\nan imbalance in typical traceability datasets where the source code has on\naverage 1.48 more information bits (i.e., entropy) than the linked\ndocumentation. Additionally, we demonstrate that an average MI of 4.81 bits,\nloss of 1.75, and noise of 0.28 bits signify that there are\ninformation-theoretic limits on the effectiveness of unsupervised traceability\ntechniques. We hope these findings spur additional research on understanding\nthe limits and progress of traceability research.",

In this work, we use the foundational graph connectivity problem\nas a testbed to generate effectively limitless high-coverage data to train\nsmall transformers and test whether they can learn to perform search. We find\nthat, when given the right training distribution, the transformer is able to\nlearn to search.\n  We analyze the algorithm that the transformer has learned through a novel\nmechanistic interpretability technique that enables us to extract the\ncomputation graph from the trained model. We find that transformers perform\nsearch at every vertex in parallel: For each vertex in the input graph,\ntransformers compute the set of vertices reachable from that vertex. Each layer\nthen progressively expands these sets, allowing the model to search over a\nnumber of vertices exponential in $n_{\\text{layers}}$.\n  However, we find that as the input graph size increases, the transformer has\ngreater difficulty in learning the task. This difficulty is not resolved even\nas the number of parameters is increased, suggesting that increasing model\nscale will not lead to robust search abilities. We also find that performing\nsearch in-context (i.e., chain-of-thought) does not resolve this inability to\nlearn to search on larger graphs.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel one-hop sub-query result cache for processing\ngraph read transactions, gR-Txs, in a graph database system. The one-hop\nnavigation is from a vertex using either its in-coming or out-going edges with\nselection predicates that filter edges and vertices. Its cache entry identifies\na unique one-hop sub-query (key) and its result set consisting of immutable\nvertex ids (value). When processing a gR-Tx, the query processor identifies its\nsequence of individual one-hop sub-queries and looks up their results in the\ncache. A cache hit fetches less data from the storage manager and eliminates\nthe requirement to process the one-hop sub-query. A cache miss populates the\ncache asynchronously and in a transactional manner, maintaining the separation\nof read and write paths of our transactional storage manager. A graph read and\nwrite transaction, gRW-Tx, identifies the impacted cache entries and either\ndeletes or updates them. Our implementation of the cache is inside the graph\nquery processing engine and transparent to a user application. We evaluate the\ncache using our eCommerce production workload and with rules that re-write\ngraph queries to maximize the performance enhancements observed with the cache.\nObtained results show the cache enhances 95th and 99th percentile of query\nresponse times by at least 2x and 1.63x, respectively. When combined with query\nre-writing, the enhancements are at least 2.33x and 4.48x, respectively.

    "abstract": "With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there\nhas been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly\nsensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists\nLLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge\nsources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking\nsensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore\nRAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The\nmain challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate\nanswers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an\nalgorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require\nthe sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our\nextensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the\nnon-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\\epsilon\\approx 10$\nacross different models and datasets.",

    "abstract": "Wigner's classification has led to the insight that projective unitary\nrepresentations play a prominent role in quantum mechanics. The physics\nliterature often states that the theory of projective unitary representations\ncan be reduced to the theory of ordinary unitary representations by enlarging\nthe group of physical symmetries. Nevertheless, the enlargement process is not\nalways described explicitly: it is unclear in which cases the enlargement has\nto be done to the universal cover, a central extension, or to a central\nextension of the universal cover. On the other hand, in the mathematical\nliterature, projective unitary representations were extensively studied, and\nfamous theorems such as the theorems of Bargmann and Cassinelli have been\nachieved. The present article bridges the two: we provide a precise,\nstep-by-step guide on describing projective unitary representations as unitary\nrepresentations of the enlarged group. Particular focus is paid to the\ndifference between algebraic and topological obstructions. To build the bridge\nmentioned above, we present a detailed review of the difference between group\ncohomology and Lie group cohomology. This culminates in classifying Lie group\ncentral extensions by smooth cocycles around the identity. Finally, the\ntake-away message is a hands-on algorithm that takes the symmetry group of a\ngiven quantum theory as input and provides the enlarged group as output. This\nalgorithm is applied to several cases of physical interest. We also briefly\noutline a generalization of Bargmann's theory to time-dependent phases using\nHilbert bundles.",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a\nnovel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of\nmolecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy\nbased on coupled Maxwell--Schr\\\"odinger equations is examined for simulating\nlocal molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective\nstrong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum\nimpurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic\nmolecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric\nfunctions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz\nmedium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical\nsimulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate\nof the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the\nimpurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can\nsometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the\nbulk molecules forming strong coupling. Additionally, this approach\ndemonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits\nRabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity\nstructure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this\napproach -- an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark\nmodes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly\nincluded when most molecules are modeled using simple dielectric functions. As\nthe polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay\ndifferently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced\neffect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified\nphotochemistry under electronic strong coupling.",

    "abstract": "The problem of sequential anomaly detection and identification is considered,\nwhere multiple data sources are simultaneously monitored and the goal is to\nidentify in real time those, if any, that exhibit ``anomalous\" statistical\nbehavior. An upper bound is postulated on the number of data sources that can\nbe sampled at each sampling instant, but the decision maker selects which ones\nto sample based on the already collected data. Thus, in this context, a policy\nconsists not only of a stopping rule and a decision rule that determine when\nsampling should be terminated and which sources to identify as anomalous upon\nstopping, but also of a sampling rule that determines which sources to sample\nat each time instant subject to the sampling constraint. Two distinct\nformulations are considered, which require control of different, ``generalized\"\nerror metrics. The first one tolerates a certain user-specified number of\nerrors, of any kind, whereas the second tolerates distinct, user-specified\nnumbers of false positives and false negatives. For each of them, a universal\nasymptotic lower bound on the expected time for stopping is established as the\nerror probabilities go to 0, and it is shown to be attained by a policy that\ncombines the stopping and decision rules proposed in the full-sampling case\nwith a probabilistic sampling rule that achieves a specific long-run sampling\nfrequency for each source. Moreover, the optimal to a first order asymptotic\napproximation expected time for stopping is compared in simulation studies with\nthe corresponding factor in a finite regime, and the impact of the sampling\nconstraint and tolerance to errors is assessed.",

Using this graphical model, we estimate\nsample-dependent quality scores for each LLM, and route each sample to the LLM\nwith the highest corresponding score.

Going beyond the free electron mode and assuming the\nsystem absorbs all the photon energy, the theoretical velocity matches the\nexperimental observation.

Embedding-based entity alignment (EA) has recently\ngained considerable attention, resulting in the emergence of many innovative\napproaches. Initially, these approaches concentrated on learning entity\nembeddings based on the structural features of knowledge graphs (KGs) as\ndefined by relation triples. Subsequent methods have integrated entities' names\nand attributes as supplementary information to improve the embeddings used for\nEA. However, existing methods lack a deep semantic understanding of entity\nattributes and relations.

LLM-Align uses heuristic methods to select\nimportant attributes and relations of entities, and then feeds the selected\ntriples of entities to an LLM to infer the alignment results.

Second, performance symptoms may occur\nat an intermediate or later stage of a big data analytics pipeline. Thus,\nPerfGen uses a phased fuzzing approach. This approach identifies\nsymptom-causing intermediate inputs at an intermediate stage first and then\nconverts them to the inputs at the beginning of the program with a\npseudo-inverse function generated by a large language model. Third, PerfGen\ndefines sets of skew-inspired input mutations, which increases the chance of\ninducing performance problems.\n  We evaluate PerfGen using four case studies.

The\nrock-salt structure of CrN evokes clear magnetic frustration since Cr atoms in\nface-centered cubic lattice form links to twelve nearest neighbors all\nequivalent and AFM. Nonetheless, the magnetostructural transition to an\northorhombically distorted phase below $T_\\text{N} = 287~\\text{K}$ leads to a\ndiversification of Cr-Cr links, which suppresses the frustration and allows for\nstable double-layered AFM order of CrN. Based on $\\textit{ab initio}$\ncalculated exchange parameters, the magnon spectra and temperature evolution of\nordered magnetic moments are derived.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enable the\nunsupervised machine learning (ML) prediction for target data, thus this will\naccelerate real world applications with ML models such as image recognition\ntasks in self-driving. Researchers have reported the UDA techniques are not\nworking well under large co-variate shift problems where e.g. supervised source\ndata consists of handwritten digits data in monotone color and unsupervised\ntarget data colored digits data from the street view. Thus there is a need for\na method to resolve co-variate shift and transfer source labelling rules under\nthis dynamics. We perform two stages domain invariant representation learning\nto bridge the gap between source and target with semantic intermediate data\n(unsupervised). The proposed method can learn domain invariant features\nsimultaneously between source and intermediate also intermediate and target.\nFinally this achieves good domain invariant representation between source and\ntarget plus task discriminability owing to source labels. This induction for\nthe gradient descent search greatly eases learning convergence in terms of\nclassification performance for target data even when large co-variate shift. We\nalso derive a theorem for measuring the gap between trained models and\nunsupervised target labelling rules, which is necessary for the free parameters\noptimization. Finally we demonstrate that proposing method is superiority to\nprevious UDA methods using 4 representative ML classification datasets\nincluding 38 UDA tasks.

    "abstract": "Volatiles like $H_2O$ are present as ice in solids in the outer cold regions\nof protoplanetary disks and as vapor in the warm inner regions within the water\nsnow line. Icy pebbles drifting inwards from the outer disk sublimate after\ncrossing the snow line, enriching the inner disk with solid mass and water\nvapor. Meanwhile, proto-planets forming within the disk open gaps in the disk\ngas, creating traps against the inward drift of pebbles and in turn reducing\nwater enrichment in the inner disk. Recent disk observations from millimeter\ninterferometry and infrared spectroscopy have supported this broad picture by\nfinding a correlation between the outer radial distribution of pebbles and the\nproperties of inner water vapor spectra. In this work, we aim at further\ninforming previous and future observations by building on previous models to\nexplore pebble drift in disks with multiple gaps. We systematically explore\nmultiple gap locations and their depths (equivalent to specific masses of\nplanets forming within), and different particle sizes to study their impact on\ninner disk water enrichment. We find that the presence of close-in deep gaps\ncarved by a Jupiter-mass planet is likely crucial for blocking icy pebble\ndelivery into the inner disk, while planets with lower masses only provide\nleaky traps. We also find that disks with multiple gaps show lower vapor\nenrichment in the inner disk. Altogether, these model results support the idea\nthat inner disk water delivery and planet formation are regulated by the mass\nand location of the most massive planets.",

    "abstract": "Transformers, a groundbreaking architecture proposed for Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP), have also achieved remarkable success in Computer Vision. A\ncornerstone of their success lies in the attention mechanism, which models\nrelationships among tokens. While the tokenization process in NLP inherently\nensures that a single token does not contain multiple semantics, the\ntokenization of Vision Transformer (ViT) utilizes tokens from uniformly\npartitioned square image patches, which may result in an arbitrary mixing of\nvisual concepts in a token. In this work, we propose to substitute the\ngrid-based tokenization in ViT with superpixel tokenization, which employs\nsuperpixels to generate a token that encapsulates a sole visual concept.\nUnfortunately, the diverse shapes, sizes, and locations of superpixels make\nintegrating superpixels into ViT tokenization rather challenging. Our\ntokenization pipeline, comprised of pre-aggregate extraction and\nsuperpixel-aware aggregation, overcomes the challenges that arise in superpixel\ntokenization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach, which\nexhibits strong compatibility with existing frameworks, enhances the accuracy\nand robustness of ViT on various downstream tasks.",

A\nkey insight is that self-attention probability distributions, which capture\nsemantic relations between patches, can be interpreted as a transition matrix\nfor random walks across the image. We leverage this by first using Random Walk\nNormalized Cuts directly on these self-attention activations to partition the\nimage, minimizing transition probabilities between clusters while maximizing\ncoherence within clusters. Applied recursively, this yields a hierarchical\nsegmentation that reflects the rich semantics in the pre-trained attention\nlayers, without any additional training. Next, we explore other ways to build\nthe NCuts adjacency matrix from features, and how we can use the random walk\ninterpretation of self-attention to capture long-range relationships. Finally,\nwe propose an approach to automatically determine the NCut cost criterion,\navoiding the need to tune this manually. We quantitatively analyse the effect\nincorporating different features, a constant versus dynamic NCut threshold, and\nincorporating multi-node paths when constructing the NCuts adjacency matrix.
