    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly\npopular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical\nbottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the\navailability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely\nresource intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic\nwireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML\nalgorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been\nproposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods\nmay not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any\ninsight into the scenario of interest. In this work, we aim to address both\nthese issues by integrating a parametric, physics-based geometric channel\n(PBGC) modeling framework with generative methods. To address limitations with\ngradient flow through the PBGC model, a linearized reformulation is presented,\nwhich ensures smooth gradient flow during generative model training, while also\ncapturing insights about the underlying physical environment. We evaluate our\nmodel against prior baselines by comparing the generated samples in terms of\nthe 2-Wasserstein distance and through the utility of generated data when used\nfor downstream compression tasks.",

    "abstract": "How impulsive solar energetic particle (SEP) events are produced by\nmagnetic-reconnection-driven processes during solar flares remains an\noutstanding question. Here we report a short-duration SEP event associated with\nan X-class eruptive flare on July 03, 2021, using a combination of remote\nsensing observations and in situ measurements. The in situ SEPs were recorded\nby multiple spacecraft including the Parker Solar Probe. The hard X-ray (HXR)\nlight curve exhibits two impulsive periods. The first period is characterized\nby a single peak with a rapid rise and decay, while the second period features\na more gradual HXR light curve with a harder spectrum. Such observation is\nconsistent with in situ measurements: the energetic electrons were first\nreleased during the early impulsive phase when the eruption was initiated. The\nmore energetic in situ electrons were released several minutes later during the\nsecond period of the impulsive phase when the eruption was well underway. This\nsecond period of energetic electron acceleration also coincides with the\nrelease of in situ energetic protons and the onset of an interplanetary type\nIII radio burst. We conclude that these multi-messenger observations favor a\ntwo-phase particle acceleration scenario: the first, less energetic electron\npopulation was produced during the initial reconnection that triggers the flare\neruption, and the second, more energetic electron population was accelerated in\nthe above-the-looptop region below a well-developed, large-scale reconnection\ncurrent sheet induced by the eruption.",

But developing estimators can take significant effort\nfor even a single causal inference setting. For example, algorithms for\nregression-based estimators, propensity score methods, and doubly robust\nmethods were designed across several decades to handle causal estimation with\nobserved confounders. Similarly, several estimators have been developed to\nexploit instrumental variables (IVs), including two-stage least-squares (TSLS),\ncontrol functions, and the method-of-moments. In this work, we instead frame\ncausal inference as a dataset-level prediction problem, offloading algorithm\ndesign to the learning process. The approach we introduce, called black box\ncausal inference (BBCI), builds estimators in a black-box manner by learning to\npredict causal effects from sampled dataset-effect pairs.

The traditional human expert-based evaluation of VLMs\nhas limitations in consistency and scalability, which sparked interest in\nautomatic methods such as employing VLMs to evaluate VLMs. However, the\nreliability of VLMs as judges remains underexplored. Existing methods often\nrely on a single VLM as the evaluator. However, this approach can be unreliable\nor biased because such a model may lack the ability to fully understand the\ncontent and may have inherent biases, ultimately compromising evaluation\nreliability. A remedy is to apply the principle of collective thoughts,\naggregating evaluations from multiple VLMs to enhance reliability. This study\ninvestigates the efficacy of such approaches, particularly when the pool of\njudges includes both reliable and unreliable models. Our findings reveal that\nincorporating collective judgments from such a mixed pool does not necessarily\nimprove the accuracy of the final evaluation. The inclusion of less reliable\njudges can introduce noise, undermining the overall reliability of the\noutcomes. To explore the factors that impact evaluation reliability, we\nfine-tune an underperforming VLM judge, Video-LLaVA, and observe that improved\nunderstanding ability alone is insufficient to make VLM judges more reliable.\nThese findings stress the limitations of collective thought approaches and\nhighlight the need for more advanced methods that can account for the\nreliability of individual models.

Within the NEO framework,\nexcited states are vibronic states representing electronic and nuclear\nvibrational excitations. The NEO multireference configuration interaction\n(MRCI) method presented herein provides accurate ground and excited vibronic\nstates. The electronic and nuclear orbitals are optimized with a NEO\nmulticonfigurational self-consistent field (NEO-MCSCF) procedure, thereby\nincluding both static and dynamic correlation and allowing the description of\ndouble and higher excitations. The accuracy of the NEO-MRCI method is\nillustrated by computing the ground state protonic densities and excitation\nenergies of the vibronic states for four molecular systems with the hydrogen\nnucleus treated quantum mechanically. In addition, revised conventional\nelectronic basis sets adapted for quantized nuclei are developed and shown to\nbe essential for achieving this level of accuracy. The NEO-MRCI approach, as\nwell as the strategy for revising electronic basis sets, will play a critical\nrole in multicomponent quantum chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Due to climate change, the extreme wildfire has become one of the most\ndangerous natural hazards to human civilization. Even though, some wildfires\nmay be initially caused by human activity, but the spread of wildfires is\nmainly determined by environmental factors, for examples, (1) weather\nconditions such as temperature, wind direction and intensity, and moisture\nlevels; (2) the amount and types of dry vegetation in a local area, and (3)\ntopographic or local terrian conditions, which affects how much rain an area\ngets and how fire dynamics will be constrained or faciliated. Thus, to\naccurately forecast wildfire occurrence has become one of most urgent and\ntaunting environmental challenges in global scale. In this work, we developed a\nreal-time Multimodal Transformer Neural Network Machine Learning model that\ncombines several advanced artificial intelligence techniques and statistical\nmethods to practically forecast the occurrence of wildfire at the precise\nlocation in real time, which not only utilizes large scale data information\nsuch as hourly weather forecasting data, but also takes into account small\nscale topographical data such as local terrain condition and local vegetation\nconditions collecting from Google Earth images to determine the probabilities\nof wildfire occurrence location at small scale as well as their timing\nsynchronized with weather forecast information. By using the wildfire data in\nthe United States from 1992 to 2015 to train the multimodal transformer neural\nnetwork, it can predict the probabilities of wildfire occurrence according to\nthe real-time weather forecast and the synchronized Google Earth image data to\nprovide the wildfire occurrence probability in any small location ($100m^2$)\nwithin 24 hours ahead.",

    "abstract": "Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for\noptimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces.\nRecently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses\nthese challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple\nsynthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments,\nso-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ\n(M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple\nnetworked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to\nglobal information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated\nand uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act\nindependently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions.\nIn coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state\nand update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales\nlinearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action\nspace size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and\nprobabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the\nprobability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations\nshow that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training\nwith decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 60%\nlower average policy error (APE), 40% faster convergence, 45% reduced runtime\ncomplexity, and 40% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves\ncomparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods.\nSimulations validate the theoretical analyses.",

    "abstract": "The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm, in which a judge LLM system replaces human\nraters in rating the outputs of other generative AI (GenAI) systems, plays a\ncritical role in scaling and standardizing GenAI evaluations. To validate such\njudge systems, evaluators assess human--judge agreement by first collecting\nmultiple human ratings for each item in a validation corpus, then aggregating\nthe ratings into a single, per-item gold label rating. For many items, however,\nrating criteria may admit multiple valid interpretations, so a human or LLM\nrater may deem multiple ratings \"reasonable\" or \"correct\". We call this\ncondition rating indeterminacy. Problematically, many rating tasks that contain\nrating indeterminacy rely on forced-choice elicitation, whereby raters are\ninstructed to select only one rating for each item. In this paper, we introduce\na framework for validating LLM-as-a-judge systems under rating indeterminacy.\nWe draw theoretical connections between different measures of judge system\nperformance under different human--judge agreement metrics, and different\nrating elicitation and aggregation schemes. We demonstrate that differences in\nhow humans and LLMs resolve rating indeterminacy while responding to\nforced-choice rating instructions heavily bias LLM-as-a-judge validation.\nThrough extensive experiments involving 11 real-world rating tasks and 8\ncommercial LLMs, we show that standard validation approaches that rely upon\nforced-choice ratings select judge systems that are highly suboptimal,\nperforming as much as 30% worse than judge systems selected by our approach\nthat uses multi-label \"response set\" ratings to account for rating\nindeterminacy. We conclude with concrete recommendations for more principled\napproaches to LLM-as-a-judge validation.",

A\ngroupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equation consists of a groupoid\n$\\mathfrak{G}$ together with a map\n$\\pi:\\mathfrak{G}\\to\\operatorname{End}(V\\otimes V)$ for some vector space $V$\nsuch that the Yang-Baxter commutator $[[ \\pi(u),\\pi(w),\\pi(v)]]=0$ if\n$u,v\\in\\mathfrak{G}$ are such that the groupoid composition $w=u\\star v$ is\ndefined. An important role is played by an object map $\\Delta:\\mathfrak{G}\\to\nM$ for some set $M$ such that $\\Delta(u)=\\Delta(v')$, $\\Delta(w)=\\Delta(v)$ and\n$\\Delta(w')=\\Delta(u')$, where $v\\mapsto v'$ is the groupoid inverse map.\n  There are two main regimes of the six-vertex model: the free-fermionic point,\nand everything else. For the free-fermionic point, there exists a parametrized\nYang-Baxter equation with a large parameter group\n$\\operatorname{GL}(2)\\times\\operatorname{GL}(1)$. For non-free-fermionic\nsix-vertex matrices, there are also well-known (group) parametrized Yang-Baxter\nequations, but these do not account for all possible interactions. Instead we\nwill construct a groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter equation that accounts for\nessentially all possible Yang-Baxter equations in the six-vertex model. We will\nalso exhibit a separate groupoid for the five-vertex model. We will show how to\nconstruct solvable lattice models based on groupoid parametrized Yang-Baxter\nequations.",

We selected V1298 Tau for a first targeted\nfollow-up at radio frequencies with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Telescope\n(JVLA), the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), and the Sardinia\nRadio Telescope (SRT), to search for emission in the overall frequency range\n0.55-7.2 GHz. Detecting radio emission from such a very active star is key to\ncharacterise its magnetosphere, allowing in principle to probe the strength of\nthe coronal magnetic field and plasma density. Observations were carried out\nbetween Oct 2023 and Sept 2024: three epochs with uGMRT band-4 (0.55-0.75 GHz),\n12 epochs with the JVLA using L (1-2 GHz) and C (4.5-6.5 GHz) bands, and three\nepochs with SRT using C-high band (6-7.2 GHz). We report the first detection of\nradio emission from V1298 Tau at different epochs using the JVLA. The emission\nhas maximum peak flux densities of 91$\\pm$10 and 177$\\pm$6 $\\mu$Jy/beam in the\nL- and C-band, respectively. From a comparison with contemporary optical\nphotometry, we found that the detected emission with the highest fluxes are\nlocated around a phase of minimum of the photospheric light curve.

The lack of a significant\nfraction of circular polarisation indicates that the observed flux is not due\nto electron cyclotron maser emission from star-planet interaction, and it is\nlikely produced by gyrosynchroton/cyclotron emission from the corona triggered\nby stellar magnetic activity, although we cannot exclude thermal emission due\nto a lack of constraints on the brightness temperature.",

To keep\nup with the ever-increasing network rates, many CPU cycles are spent on the\nnetworking tax. We make a key observation that network processing threads can\nbe simultaneously executed on server CPUs with minimal interference with the\napplication threads. However, utilizing simultaneous multithreading (SMT) to\nscale the number of network threads with the number of application threads\nsuffers from (1) failing to provide strict tail latency requirements for\nlatency-critical applications, and (2) reducing the number of available\nhardware threads for application processes, thus contributing to a high\ndatacenter network tax.

High-level perception functions are\nincreasingly based on deep learning (DL) models due to their improved\nperformance and generalisability compared to traditional algorithms. Despite\nthe vital need to evaluate the performance of DL-based perception functions\nunder real-world conditions using onboard sensor inputs, there is a lack of\nframeworks to implement such systematic evaluations. This paper presents a\nversatile framework to evaluate the impact of perception sensor modalities and\nparameter settings on DL-based perception functions. Using a simulation\nenvironment, the framework facilitates sensor modality selection and parameter\ntuning under different operational design domain conditions. Its effectiveness\nis demonstrated through a case study involving a state-of-the-art surround\ntrajectory prediction model, highlighting performance differences across the\nsensor modalities radar and camera. Different settings for the parameter,\nhorizontal field of view (HFOV) were evaluated to identify the optimal\nconfiguration. The results indicate that a radar sensor with a narrow HFOV is\nthe most suitable configuration for the evaluated perception algorithm.

We argue that a\nmajor, if not the most severe, detrimental factor for training efficiency is\nrelated to the sampling strategy of sequential data. We show that negligence in\nmini-batch sampling leads to more than 50% computation being spent on padding.\nTo that end, we study, profile, and optimize Canary-1B training to show gradual\nimprovement in GPU utilization leading up to 5x increase in average batch sizes\nversus its original training settings. This in turn allows us to train an\nequivalent model using 4x less GPUs in the same wall time, or leverage the\noriginal resources and train it in 2x shorter wall time. Finally, we observe\nthat the major inference bottleneck lies in the autoregressive decoder steps.\nWe find that adjusting the model architecture to transfer model parameters from\nthe decoder to the encoder results in a 3x inference speedup as measured by\ninverse real-time factor (RTFx) while preserving the accuracy and compute\nrequirements for convergence.

    "abstract": "We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two\nlow surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius\nII (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are\nconsistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy\n(UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from\nonly one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K)\nfrom super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its\nmembers are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show\ntypical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one\nexception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584,\n[Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \\pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both\nUFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this\ndoes not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2\ndemonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous)\nsatellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous\nsystems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry),\nN-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal\neffects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST\ncommissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G < 18.8) and the\nsingle and double IFU observing modes.",

A system called GameNet represents the state of the art for\npredicting human behavior in the setting of unrepeated simultaneous-move games,\ncombining a simple \"level-k\" model of strategic reasoning with a complex neural\nnetwork model of non-strategic \"level-0\" behavior. Although this reliance on\nwell-established ideas from cognitive science ought to make GameNet\ninterpretable, the flexibility of its level-0 model raises the possibility that\nit is able to emulate strategic reasoning.

We show that these additional restrictions are empirically harmless,\nleading ElementaryNet to statistically indistinguishable predictive performance\nvs GameNet.

We study the enlarge-and-prune pipeline as an integrated system to\naddress two critical questions: whether it is worth pretraining an enlarged\nmodel even when the model is never deployed, and how to optimize the entire\npipeline for better pruned models. We propose an integrated enlarge-and-prune\npipeline, which combines enlarge model training, pruning, and recovery under a\nsingle cosine annealing learning rate schedule.

The proposed method helps to mitigate the knowledge loss\ncaused by the rising learning rate in naive enlarge-and-prune pipelines and\nenable effective redistribution of model capacity among surviving neurons,\nfacilitating smooth compression and enhanced performance.

To address this, we introduce Segment Anything Small (SAS), a\nsimple yet effective scale- and texture-aware data augmentation technique\ndesigned to enhance the performance of deep learning models for segmenting\nsmall anatomical structures in ultrasound images. SAS employs a dual\ntransformation strategy: (1) simulating diverse organ scales by resizing and\nembedding organ thumbnails into a black background, and (2) injecting noise\ninto regions of interest to simulate varying tissue textures. These\ntransformations generate realistic and diverse training data without\nintroducing hallucinations or artifacts, improving the model's robustness to\nnoise and variability. We fine-tuned a promptable foundation model on a\ncontrolled organ-specific medical imaging dataset and evaluated its performance\non one internal and five external datasets. Experimental results demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in segmentation performance, with Dice score gains of\nup to 0.35 and an average improvement of 0.16 [95% CI 0.132,0.188].\nAdditionally, our iterative point prompts provide precise control and adaptive\nrefinement, achieving performance comparable to bounding box prompts with just\ntwo points. SAS enhances model robustness and generalizability across diverse\nanatomical structures and imaging conditions, particularly for small\nstructures, without compromising the accuracy of larger ones.

We assess validity using reported\nfirst-dose vaccination counts from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).\nNeither classic nor spatial MRP models performed well, highlighting: 1. spatial\nMRP may be most appropriate for richer data contexts, 2. some demographics in\nthe survey data are over-sampled and -aggregated, producing model\nover-smoothing, and 3. a need for survey producers to share user-representative\nmetrics to better benchmark estimates.",

This study aims to\nquantify the frequency of EE in SNe IIb and investigate its physical origin by\nanalyzing optical light curves from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert\nSystem (ATLAS) survey. We selected 74 SNe IIb from 153 spectroscopically\nclassified events in the Transient Name Server (TNS) database, observed by\nATLAS, with peak fluxes exceeding 150 {\\mu}Jy and explosion epoch uncertainties\nlower than six days. Using light curve model fitting and outlier analysis, we\nidentified SNe IIb exhibiting EE and analyzed their photometric properties. We\nfound 21 SNe IIb with EE, corresponding to a frequency of approximately 28-40%,\nwith the higher value obtained under the most stringent data cuts. The EE's\nduration and color evolution are consistent with shock cooling in extended\nhydrogen-rich envelopes. We also found that EE SNe IIb have longer rise times\nand faster post-peak decline rates than non-EE SNe IIb, while both groups share\nsimilar peak absolute magnitudes. Our findings suggest that EE and non-EE SNe\nIIb likely share similar initial progenitor masses but differ in ejecta mass\nproperties, potentially due to varying degrees of binary interaction.

The\ndistribution of $\\mathtt{C}$ is called a projection determinantal point process\n(DPP). The vanilla classical algorithm to sample a DPP works in two steps, an\northogonalization in $\\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ and a sampling step of the same cost.\nThe bottleneck of recent quantum approaches to DPP sampling remains that\npreliminary orthogonalization step. For instance, (Kerenidis and Prakash, 2022)\nproposed an algorithm with the same $\\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization,\nfollowed by a $\\mathcal{O}(nr)$ classical step to find the gates in a quantum\ncircuit. The classical $\\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ orthogonalization thus still\ndominates the cost. Our first contribution is to reduce preprocessing to\nnormalizing the columns of $X$, obtaining $\\mathsf{X}$ in $\\mathcal{O}(nr)$\nclassical operations. We show that a simple circuit inspired by the formalism\nof Kerenidis et al., 2022 samples a DPP of a type we had never encountered in\napplications, which is different from our target DPP. Plugging this circuit\ninto a rejection sampling routine, we recover our target DPP after an expected\n$1/\\det \\mathsf{X}^\\top\\mathsf{X} = 1/a$ preparations of the quantum circuit.\nUsing amplitude amplification, our second contribution is to boost the\nacceptance probability from $a$ to $1-a$ at the price of a circuit depth of\n$\\mathcal{O}(r\\log n/\\sqrt{a})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ extra qubits.\nPrepending a fast, sketching-based classical approximation of $a$, we obtain a\npipeline to sample a projection DPP on a quantum computer, where the former\n$\\mathcal{O}(nr^2)$ preprocessing bottleneck has been replaced by the\n$\\mathcal{O}(nr)$ cost of normalizing the columns and the cost of our\napproximation of $a$.",

    "abstract": "An equidistant set in the Euclidean space consists of points having equal\ndistances to both members of a given pair of sets, called focal sets. Having no\neffective formulas to compute the distance of a point and a set, it is hard to\ndetermine the points of an equidistant set in general. Special classes of\nequidistant sets allow us to approximate the equidistant points in more\ncomplicated cases. In the paper we have a hyperplane corresponding to the first\norder (linear) approximation for one of the focal sets and the second one is\nconsidered as the epigraph of a positive-valued continuous function. In the\nfirst part of the paper we prove that the equidistant points having equal\ndistances to the epigraph of a positive-valued continuous function and its\ndomain form the graph of a multivariate function. Therefore such an equidistant\nset is called a multivariate equidistant function. We also prove that the\nequidistant function one of whose focal sets is constituted by the pointwise\nminima of finitely many positive-valued continuous functions is given by the\npointwise minima of the corresponding equidistant functions. In the second part\nof the paper we consider equidistant functions belonging to the epigraph of a\nconvex function under some smoothness conditions. Independently of the\ndimension of the space we present a special parameterization for the\nequidistant points based on the closest point property of the epigraph as a\nconvex set and we give the characterization of the equidistant functions as\nwell. An example is also presented with a hyperboloid of revolution as one of\nthe focal sets.",

Simulation-based learning and sim-to-real\ntransfer have led to recent success in solving assembly tasks in the presence\nof object pose variation, perception noise, and control error; however, the\ndevelopment of a generalist (i.e., multi-task) agent for a broad range of\nassembly tasks has been limited by the need to manually curate assembly assets,\nwhich greatly constrains the number and diversity of assembly problems that can\nbe used for policy learning. Inspired by recent success of using generative AI\nto scale up robot learning, we propose MatchMaker, a pipeline to automatically\ngenerate diverse, simulation-compatible assembly asset pairs to facilitate\nlearning assembly skills. Specifically, MatchMaker can 1) take a\nsimulation-incompatible, interpenetrating asset pair as input, and\nautomatically convert it into a simulation-compatible, interpenetration-free\npair, 2) take an arbitrary single asset as input, and generate a\ngeometrically-mating asset to create an asset pair, 3) automatically erode\ncontact surfaces from (1) or (2) according to a user-specified clearance\nparameter to generate realistic parts. We demonstrate that data generated by\nMatchMaker outperforms previous work in terms of diversity and effectiveness\nfor downstream assembly skill learning.

In the\npresent work, we unify, extend, and interpret several such approaches through a\nclassical large deviations perspective. To this end, we consider time-symmetric\nensembles that are pre- and post-selected before and after a Markovian\nexperiment is performed. The Schrodinger bridge problem is that of finding the\nmost likely joint distribution of initial and final outcomes that is consistent\nwith obtained endpoint results. The derived distribution provides quantum\nMarkovian dynamics that bridge the observed endpoint states in the form of\ndensity matrices. The solution retains its classical structure in that density\nmatrices can be expressed as the product of forward-evolving and\nbackward-evolving matrices. In addition, the quantum Schrodinger bridge allows\ninference of the most likely distribution of outcomes of an intervening\nmeasurement with unknown results. This distribution may be written as a product\nof forward- and backward-evolving expressions, in close analogy to the\nclassical setting, and in a time-symmetric way. The derived results are\nillustrated through a two-level amplitude damping example.",

For instance, for\nmultipartite states, it is the divide between separable and entangled, for\nchannels, the divide between entanglement-breaking and not, for sets of\nmeasurements, the divide between compatible and incompatible, and for\nassemblages, the divide between steerable and unsteerable. However, no unified\njustification of these placements of the classical-nonclassical divide has been\nproposed. That is, although each might be motivated by some notion of what it\nmeans to be classically explainable, it is not the same notion for all of them.\nOne well-motivated notion of classical explainability is the one based on\ngeneralized noncontextuality: a set of circuits is classically explainable if\nthe statistics they generate can be realized by a generalized-noncontextual\nontological model. In this work, we show that this notion can be leveraged to\ndefine a classical-nonclassical divide for individual quantum processes of\narbitrary type. A set of measurements is judged to be classical if and only if\na particular set of circuits -- the one obtained by contracting these\nmeasurements with every possible quantum state -- is classically explainable in\nthe sense just articulated. We begin the task of characterizing where the\nclassical-nonclassical divide lies according to this proposal for a variety of\ndifferent types of processes. In particular, we show that all of the following\nare judged to be nonclassical: every entangled state, every set of incompatible\nmeasurements, every non-entanglement-breaking channel, every steerable\nassemblage. However, it also judges certain subsets of the complementary\nclasses to be nonclassical, i.e., certain separable states, compatible sets of\nmeasurements, entanglement-breaking channels, and unsteerable assemblages.",

To address this tension, we study the validity of the\nassumptions made in calculating the Milky Way's rotation curve. To do so, we\napply Jeans' equation, the current standard approach of measuring rotation\ncurves, to three cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies\nfrom the FIRE-2 Latte suite. Using synthetic Gaia surveys, we replicate the\nsample selection process and calculation employed in measuring the Milky Way\nrotation curve. We examine four failure modes of this calculation and find that\nthe measured curves deviate from the true curve by $5$-$20\\%$ rather than below\n$5\\%$, as estimated by previous works. Interestingly, there is a large\ngalaxy-to-galaxy variance, and different systematics dominate different\ngalaxies. We rederive the Milky Way's dark matter density profile with the\nrotation curve while incorporating systematics from the simulations. The\nposterior distribution of the density profiles is consistent with a fiducial\nNFW profile when assuming a gNFW profile for dark matter. We find that the\nvirial mass, $7.32^{+1.98}_{-1.53}\\times10^{11}~M_{\\odot}$, consistent with\nother probes of the Milky Way's mass.

We\npresent the first uniform analysis of the vertical extent of millimeter dust\nfor a representative sample of 33disks. We used radiative transfer modeling of\narchival high-angular-resolution (<=0.1\") ALMA dust observations of inclined\nand ringed disks to estimate their vertical dust scale height, which was\ncompared to estimated gas scale heights to characterize the level of vertical\nsedimentation. In all 23systems for which constraints could be obtained, we\nfind that the outer parts of the disks are vertically settled. 5disks allow for\nthe characterization of the dust scale height both within and outside\napproximately half the dust disk radius, showing a lower limit on their dust\nheights at smaller radii. This implies that the ratio between vertical\nturbulence and the Stokes number, $\\alpha_z/\\St$, decreases radially in these\nsources. For 21rings in 15disks, we also constrained the level of radial\nconcentration of the dust, finding that about half of the rings are compatible\nwith strong radial trapping. In most of these rings, vertical turbulence is\nfound to be comparable to or weaker than radial turbulence, which is\nincompatible with the turbulence generated by the vertical shear instability at\nthese locations. We further used our dust settling constraints to estimate the\nturbulence level under the assumption that the dust size is limited by\nfragmentation, finding typical upper limits around\n$\\alpha_\\text{frag}\\leq10^{-3}$. In a few sources, we find that turbulence\ncannot be the main source of accretion.

We motivate our proposal from the viewpoint of extremal black hole\ndecay and show that the bound on the particle spectrum is given by the critical\ncharge-to-mass ratio beyond which the Schwinger effect can take place. This\nquantum effect shares the same condition as requiring a particle to satisfy a\nrepulsive force condition at the black hole horizon, so that the extremal black\nhole can decay without reabsorbing the particle. We discuss the relation of our\nproposed weak gravity bound with the near-horizon Breitenlohner-Freedman bound.\nWe also comment on the generalization in the case of multiple U(1) gauge\ntheories, providing evidence for a convex hull condition in AdS background.",

Moreover, any realistic\nsimulation must account for noise, and any viable quantum computing scheme\nbased on linear optics requires feedforward. In this paper, we propose an\nalgorithm that models the output amplitudes as partial derivatives of a\nmultivariate polynomial. The algorithm explores the lattice of all intermediate\npartial derivatives, where each derivative is used to compute more efficiently\nones with higher degree. In terms of memory, storing one path from the root to\nthe leaves is sufficient to iterate over all amplitudes and requires only $2^n$\nelements, as opposed to $\\binom{n+m-1}{n}$ for the fastest state of the art\nmethod. This approach effectively balances the time-memory trade-off while\nextending to both noisy and feedforward scenarios with negligible cost.

    "abstract": "Random many-body states are both a useful tool to model certain physical\nsystems and an important asset for quantum computation. Realising them,\nhowever, generally requires an exponential (in system size) amount of\nresources. Recent research has presented a way out by showing that one can\ngenerate random states, or more precisely a controlled approximation of them,\nby applying a quantum circuit built in terms of few-body unitary gates. Most of\nthis research, however, has been focussed on the case of quantum circuits\ncomposed by completely random unitary gates. Here we consider what happens for\ncircuits that, instead, involve a minimal degree of randomness. Specifically,\nwe concentrate on two different settings: (a) brickwork quantum circuits with a\nsingle one-qudit random matrix at a boundary; (b) brickwork quantum circuits\nwith fixed interactions but random one-qudit gates everywhere. We show that,\nfor any given initial state, (a) and (b) produce a distribution of states\napproaching the Haar distribution in the limit of large circuit depth. More\nprecisely, we show that the moments of the distribution produced by our\ncircuits can approximate the ones of the Haar distribution in a depth\nproportional to the system size. Interestingly we find that in both Cases (a)\nand (b) the relaxation to the Haar distribution occurs in two steps - this is\nin contrast with what happens in fully random circuits. Moreover, we show that\nchoosing appropriately the fixed interactions, for example taking the local\ngate to be a dual-unitary gate with high enough entangling power, minimally\nrandom circuits produce a Haar random distribution more rapidly than fully\nrandom circuits. In particular, dual-unitary circuits with maximal entangling\npower - i.e. perfect tensors - appear to provide the optimal quantum state\ndesign preparation for any design number.",

Meanwhile, low-fidelity simulators--such as reduced-order\nmodels, heuristic reward functions, or generative world models--can cheaply\nprovide useful data for RL training, even if they are too coarse for direct\nsim-to-real transfer. We propose multi-fidelity policy gradients (MFPGs), an RL\nframework that mixes a small amount of data from the target environment with a\nlarge volume of low-fidelity simulation data to form unbiased, reduced-variance\nestimators (control variates) for on-policy policy gradients. We instantiate\nthe framework by developing multi-fidelity variants of two policy gradient\nalgorithms: REINFORCE and proximal policy optimization. Experimental results\nacross a suite of simulated robotics benchmark problems demonstrate that when\ntarget-environment samples are limited, MFPG achieves up to 3.9x higher reward\nand improves training stability when compared to baselines that only use\nhigh-fidelity data. Moreover, even when the baselines are given more\nhigh-fidelity samples--up to 10x as many interactions with the target\nenvironment--MFPG continues to match or outperform them. Finally, we observe\nthat MFPG is capable of training effective policies even when the low-fidelity\nenvironment is drastically different from the target environment. MFPG thus not\nonly offers a novel paradigm for efficient sim-to-real transfer but also\nprovides a principled approach to managing the trade-off between policy\nperformance and data collection costs.",

We\nexplore the existence and efficient computation of allocations that satisfy\neither fairness or equity constraints. The fairness notions we consider ensure\nthat each agent values her bundle at least as much as others', allowing for\n(any or some) item removal, while the equity guarantees roughly equal\nvaluations among agents, with similar adjustments. For objective valuations\nwhere items are classified as either goods or chores, we present a\npseudo-polynomial local-search algorithm computing an\n``equitable-up-to-any-good-or-any-chore'' (EQX*) allocation, a weaker version\nof an ``equitable-up-to-any-item\" (EQX) allocation.

As a key technical contribution of this work, by\nleveraging fixed-point theorems (such as Sperner's Lemma and its variants), we\nestablish the existence of ``equitable-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore'' (EQ1*)\nand ``envy-free-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore'' (EF1*) allocations for\nnon-negative (and possibly non-objective and non-monotone) valuations. This\nholds even when items are arranged in a path and bundles must form connected\nsub-paths. Additionally, we present a polynomial-time dynamic-programming\nalgorithm that computes an EQ1* allocation. Finally, we extend the EF1* and\nEQ1* results to non-positive valuations using a novel multi-coloring variant of\nSperner's lemma, a combinatorial result of independent interest. For monotone\nnon-increasing valuations and path-connected bundles, this implies the\nexistence of EF1 and EQ1 allocations, with EQ1 allocations being efficiently\ncomputable.",

    "abstract": "We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating\nhigh-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is\nrarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused\non modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from\ntrajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high\ntrajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene\ninformation. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method\nthat effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality,\nmultimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent\nin diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by\nintroducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that\nselects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on\nscene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative\nmethod, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a\nrefined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates.\nOur experimental results, validated on the Navsim\\cite{Dauner2024_navsim},\ndemonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering\nrobust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS\nof 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other\ndiffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising\nstep to obtain excellent performance.

We show that the irreducible strata of\n$\\overline{\\mathcal{H}}$ are in bijection with combinatorial objects called\ndecorated trees (up to a suitable equivalence), and that containment of\nirreducible strata is given by edge contraction of decorated trees.

In this paper,\nwe evaluate three such methods - sensitive unlearning, adversarial training,\nand orthogonality loss - against a fairness-unaware baseline, using experiments\non the CelebA and UTK-Face datasets with an ImageNet pre-trained ViT-Base\nmodel. We find that orthogonality loss consistently reduces bias while\nmaintaining or improving utility, whereas adversarial training improves False\nPositive Rate Parity and Demographic Parity in some cases, and sensitive\nunlearning provides no clear benefit. In tasks where significant biases are\npresent, distributed fairness-aware fine-tuning methods can effectively\neliminate bias without compromising consumer privacy and, in most cases,\nimprove model utility.",

Each contrast highlights specific tumor characteristics,\nenabling a comprehensive understanding of tumor morphology, edema, and\npathological heterogeneity. However, existing methods still face the challenges\nof multi-level specificity perception across different contrasts, especially\nwith limited annotations. These challenges include data heterogeneity,\ngranularity differences, and interference from redundant information. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a Task-oriented Uncertainty Collaborative\nLearning (TUCL) framework for multi-contrast MRI segmentation. TUCL introduces\na task-oriented prompt attention (TPA) module with intra-prompt and\ncross-prompt attention mechanisms to dynamically model feature interactions\nacross contrasts and tasks. Additionally, a cyclic process is designed to map\nthe predictions back to the prompt to ensure that the prompts are effectively\nutilized. In the decoding stage, the TUCL framework proposes a dual-path\nuncertainty refinement (DUR) strategy which ensures robust segmentation by\nrefining predictions iteratively. Extensive experimental results on limited\nlabeled data demonstrate that TUCL significantly improves segmentation accuracy\n(88.2\\% in Dice and 10.853 mm in HD95). It shows that TUCL has the potential to\nextract multi-contrast information and reduce the reliance on extensive\nannotations.

We\nadvocate a return to a formal approach, in the logical tradition of Carnap,\nthat treats determinism as a property of scientific theories, rather than an\nelusive metaphysical doctrine.\n  We highlight two key distinctions: (1) the difference between qualitative and\n\"full\" determinism, as emphasized in recent discussions of physics and\nmetaphysics, and (2) the distinction between weak and strong formal conditions\non the uniqueness of world extensions. We argue that defining determinism in\nterms of metaphysical notions such as haecceities is unhelpful, whereas\nrigorous formal criteria -- such as Belot's D1 and D3 -- offer a tractable and\nscientifically relevant account.

This work leverages this emergent phase for electric\nfield detection at room temperature. Sensitive frequency-resolved electric\nfield measurements at very low-frequencies (VLF) are of central importance in a\nwide range of applications where deep-penetration is required in\ncommunications, navigation and imaging or surveying. The long wavelengths on\norder of 10-100 km (3-30 kHz) limit the efficiency, sensitivity, and bandwidth\nof compact classical detectors that are constrained by the Chu limit.\nRydberg-atom electrometers are an attractive approach for microwave\nelectric-field sensors but have reduced sensitivity at lower-frequencies. Very\nrecent efforts to advance the standard Rydberg-atoms approach is based on DC\nelectric-field (E-field) Stark shifting and have resulted in sensitivities\nbetween 67.9-2.2 uVcm-1Hz-1/2 (0.1-10 kHz) by fine optimization of the DC\nE-field. A major challenge in these approaches is the need for embedded\nelectrodes or plates due to DC E-field Stark screening effect, which can\nperturb coupling of VLF signals when injected from external sources. In this\narticle, it is demonstrated that state-of-art sensitivity (~1.6-2.3\nuVcm-1Hz-1/2) can instead be achieved using limit-cycle oscillations in\ndriven-dissipative Rydberg atoms by using a magnetic field (B-field) to develop\nmode-competition between nearby Rydberg states. The mode-competition between\nnearby Rydberg-states develop an effective transition centered at the\noscillation frequency capable of supporting external VLF E-field coupling in\nthe ~10-15kHz regime without the requirement for fine optimization of the\nB-field magnitude.",

    "abstract": "Multidimensional poverty measurement is crucial for capturing deprivation\nbeyond income-based metrics. This study compares the Alkire-Foster (AF) method\nand a Markov Random Field (MRF) approach for classifying multidimensional\npoverty using a simulation-based analysis. The AF method applies a\ndeterministic threshold-based classification, while the MRF approach leverages\nprobabilistic graphical modelling to account for correlations between\ndeprivation indicators. Using a synthetic dataset of 50,000 individuals with\nten binary deprivation indicators, we assess classification accuracy, false\npositive/negative trade-offs, and agreement between the methods. Results show\nthat AF achieves higher classification accuracy (89.5%) compared to MRF\n(75.4%), with AF minimizing false negatives and MRF reducing false positives.\nThe overall agreement between the two methods is 65%, with discrepancies\nprimarily occurring when AF classifies individuals as poor while MRF does not.\nWhile AF is transparent and easy to implement, it does not capture\ninterdependencies among indicators, potentially leading to misclassification.\nMRF, though computationally intensive, offers a more nuanced understanding of\ndeprivation clusters. These findings highlight the trade-offs in\nmultidimensional poverty measurement and provide insights for policymakers on\nmethod selection based on data availability and policy objectives.

Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of multiple solutions\nto the GS equation when solved in idealistic geometries with simplified plasma\ncurrent density profiles and boundary conditions. Until now, the question of\nwhether multiple equilibria might exist in real-world tokamak geometries with\nmore complex current density profiles and integral free-boundary conditions\n(commonly used in production-level equilibrium codes) has remained unanswered.\nIn this work, we discover multiple solutions to the static forward\nfree-boundary GS problem in the MAST-U tokamak geometry using the validated\nevolutive equilibrium solver FreeGSNKE and the deflated continuation algorithm.\nBy varying the plasma current, current density profile coefficients, or coil\ncurrents in the GS equation, we identify and characterise distinct equilibrium\nsolutions, including both deeply and more shallowly confined plasma states. We\nsuggest that the existence of even more equilibria is likely prohibited by the\nrestrictive nature of the integral free-boundary condition, which globally\ncouples poloidal fluxes on the computational boundary with those on the\ninterior. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for\nwider equilibrium modelling and emphasise the need to explore whether multiple\nsolutions are present in other equilibrium codes and tokamaks, as well as their\npotential impact on downstream simulations that rely on GS equilibria.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in generative models have sparked research on improving model\nfairness with AI-generated data. However, existing methods often face\nlimitations in the diversity and quality of synthetic data, leading to\ncompromised fairness and overall model accuracy. Moreover, many approaches rely\non the availability of demographic group labels, which are often costly to\nannotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair, aiming to overcome these limitations\nand harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting\nalgorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a\nbiased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic\nannotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data\ngenerated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two\nkey challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm, 1) the low quality\nof synthetic data, which can still happen even with advanced generative models,\nand 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the\nlimitation of synthetic data quality, we propose Contextual Synthetic Data\nGeneration (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I)\nwith prompts generated by a context-aware LLM, ensuring both data diversity and\ncontrol of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts, we\nintroduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters\nmore sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated.\nExperiments on CelebA and UTKFace datasets show that our AIM-Fair improves\nmodel fairness while maintaining utility, outperforming both fully and\npartially fine-tuned approaches to model fairness.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms behind the fragmentation of high-mass dense clumps into\ncompact star-forming cores are fundamental topics in current astrophysical\nresearch. The ALMAGAL survey provides the opportunity to study this process at\nan unprecedented level of detail and statistical significance, featuring\nhigh-angular resolution $1.38$ mm ALMA observations of $1013$ massive dense\nclumps at various Galactic locations. These clumps cover a wide range of\ndistances, masses, surface densities, and evolutionary stages. Here, we present\nthe catalog of compact sources obtained with the CuTEx algorithm from continuum\nimages of the full ALMAGAL clump sample combining ACA-$7$m and $12$m ALMA\narrays, reaching a uniform high median spatial resolution of $\\sim1400$ au. We\ndiscuss the fragmentation properties and the estimated physical parameters of\nthe core population. The ALMAGAL compact source catalog includes $6348$ cores\ndetected in $844$ clumps ($83\\%$ of the total), with a number of cores per\nclump between $1$ and $49$ (median of $5$). The estimated core diameters are\nmostly within $\\sim800-3000$ au (median of $1700$ au). We obtained core masses\nfrom $0.002$ to $345\\,\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$. We evaluated the variation in the\ncore mass function (CMF) with evolution as traced by the clump $L/M$, finding a\nclear, robust shift and change in slope among CMFs within subsamples at\ndifferent stages. This finding suggests that the CMF shape is not constant\nthroughout the star formation process, but rather it builds (and flattens) with\nevolution, with higher core masses reached at later stages. We found that all\ncores within a clump grow in mass on average with evolution, and the number of\ncores increases with the core masses. Our results favor a clump-fed scenario\nfor high-mass star formation, in which cores form as low-mass seeds, and then\ngain mass while further fragmentation occurs in the clump.",

    "abstract": "Unconscious bias has been shown to influence how we assess our peers, with\nconsequences for hiring, promotions and admissions. In this work, we focus on\naffinity bias, the component of unconscious bias which leads us to prefer\npeople who are similar to us, despite no deliberate intention of favoritism. In\na world where the people hired today become part of the hiring committee of\ntomorrow, we are particularly interested in understanding (and mitigating) how\naffinity bias affects this feedback loop. This problem has two distinctive\nfeatures: 1) we only observe the biased value of a candidate, but we want to\noptimize with respect to their real value 2) the bias towards a candidate with\na specific set of traits depends on the fraction of people in the hiring\ncommittee with the same set of traits. We introduce a new bandits variant that\nexhibits those two features, which we call affinity bandits. Unsurprisingly,\nclassical algorithms such as UCB often fail to identify the best arm in this\nsetting. We prove a new instance-dependent regret lower bound, which is larger\nthan that in the standard bandit setting by a multiplicative function of $K$.\nSince we treat rewards that are time-varying and dependent on the policy's past\nactions, deriving this lower bound requires developing proof techniques beyond\nthe standard bandit techniques. Finally, we design an elimination-style\nalgorithm which nearly matches this regret, despite never observing the real\nrewards.",

High connectivity and long\nrange interactions induce strong constraints on the system dynamics. Here, we\nstudy the transport properties of a quantum network described by the\nparadigmatic XXZ Hamiltonian, with non-trivial graph connectivity and topology,\nand long-range interaction. We show how long range interactions induce a memory\npreserving effects and strongly affect the spreading of the excitations due to\ncooperative shielding. We describe the memory-preserving effect in all-to-all\nconnected regular networks with distance-independent couplings. Indeed the\nmemory of the number of initially injected excitations is preserved over long\ntimes, being encoded in the number of frequencies present in the dynamics.\nInterestingly, we find that memory-preserving effects occur also in less\nregular graphs, such as quantum networks with either power-law node\nconnectivity or complex, small-world type, architectures. We discuss the\nimplications of these properties in biology-related problems, such as an\napplication to Weber's law in neuroscience, and their implementation in\nspecific quantum technologies via biomimicry. We also show how the presence of\nlong range interaction strongly affect the dynamics of the excitations in\nsmall-world networks and power law all-to-all coupled networks. Indeed due to\ncooperative shielding as the connectivity or the range of interaction increase\nthe initial excitation spreads more slowly among the network and becomes\nstrongly dependent on the initial conditions.",

    "abstract": "Real-world household tasks present significant challenges for mobile\nmanipulation robots. An analysis of existing robotics benchmarks reveals that\nsuccessful task performance hinges on three key whole-body control\ncapabilities: bimanual coordination, stable and precise navigation, and\nextensive end-effector reachability. Achieving these capabilities requires\ncareful hardware design, but the resulting system complexity further\ncomplicates visuomotor policy learning. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce the BEHAVIOR Robot Suite (BRS), a comprehensive framework for\nwhole-body manipulation in diverse household tasks. Built on a bimanual,\nwheeled robot with a 4-DoF torso, BRS integrates a cost-effective whole-body\nteleoperation interface for data collection and a novel algorithm for learning\nwhole-body visuomotor policies. We evaluate BRS on five challenging household\ntasks that not only emphasize the three core capabilities but also introduce\nadditional complexities, such as long-range navigation, interaction with\narticulated and deformable objects, and manipulation in confined spaces. We\nbelieve that BRS's integrated robotic embodiment, data collection interface,\nand learning framework mark a significant step toward enabling real-world\nwhole-body manipulation for everyday household tasks.

Imposing that some such\nsolutions$\\unicode{x2013}$e.g. Schwarzschild or de Sitter solutions motivated\nin the context of black hole physics or cosmology$\\unicode{x2013}$should exist,\nthe space of scalar-tensor theories is strongly restricted. Here we investigate\nprecisely what these restrictions are within general quadratic/cubic\nhigher-order scalar-tensor theories for stealth solutions, whose metric is\ngiven by that in GR, supporting time-dependent scalar hair with a constant\nkinetic term. We derive, in a fully covariant approach, the conditions under\nwhich the Euler-Lagrange equations admit all (or a specific set of) exact GR\nsolutions, as the first step toward our understanding of a wider class of\ntheories that admit approximately stealth solutions. Focusing on static and\nspherically symmetric black hole spacetimes, we study the dynamics of linear\nodd-parity perturbations and discuss possible deviations from GR. Importantly,\nwe find that requiring the existence of all stealth solutions prevents any\ndeviations from GR in the odd-parity sector. In less restrictive scenarios, in\nparticular for theories only requiring the existence of Schwarzschild(-de\nSitter) black holes, we identify allowed deviations from GR, derive the\nstability conditions for the odd modes, and investigate the generic deviation\nof a non-trivial speed of gravitational waves.

    "abstract": "This work presents a physics-based machine learning framework to predict and\nanalyze oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from compression-ignition\nengine-powered vehicles using on-board diagnostics (OBD) data as input.\nAccurate NOx prediction from OBD datasets is difficult because NOx formation\ninside an engine combustion chamber is governed by complex processes occurring\non timescales much shorter than the data collection rate. Thus, emissions\ngenerally cannot be predicted accurately using simple empirically derived\nphysics models. Black box models like genetic algorithms or neural networks can\nbe more accurate, but have poor interpretability. The transparent model\npresented in this paper has both high accuracy and can explain potential\nsources of high emissions. The proposed framework consists of two major steps:\na physics-based NOx prediction model combined with a novel Divergent Window\nCo-occurrence (DWC) Pattern detection algorithm to analyze operating conditions\nthat are not adequately addressed by the physics-based model. The proposed\nframework is validated for generalizability with a second vehicle OBD dataset,\na sensitivity analysis is performed, and model predictions are compared with\nthat from a deep neural network. The results show that NOx emissions\npredictions using the proposed model has around 55% better root mean square\nerror, and around 60% higher mean absolute error compared to the baseline NOx\nprediction model from previously published work. The DWC Pattern Detection\nAlgorithm identified low engine power conditions to have high statistical\nsignificance, indicating an operating regime where the model can be improved.\nThis work shows that the physics-based machine learning framework is a viable\nmethod for predicting NOx emissions from engines that do not incorporate NOx\nsensing.",

Our user study confirms the\nproposed system's efficiency and usability, where we use widely-used primitive\ntasks for training teleoperation with da Vinci surgical robots. Data throughput\nimproves across all tasks compared to real robot settings by 41% on average.\nThe total experiment time is reduced by an average of 10%.

    "abstract": "Infant-directed speech (IDS) is highly rhythmic, and in European languages\nIDS is dominated by patterns of amplitude modulation (AM) at ~2Hz (reflecting\nprosody) and ~5Hz (reflecting individual syllables). The rhythm structure of\nspoken Japanese is thought to differ from European stress-timed and\nsyllable-timed languages, depending on moraic units. Morae comprise any onset\nphoneme and vowel phonemes within a syllable, PA-N-DA. Arguably, initial speech\nencoding via cortical tracking by infants is likely to utilize\nlanguage-universal physical acoustic structures in speech rather than\nlanguage-specific structures like morae, since the infant brain must be\nprepared to acquire any human language. Here a language-blind computational\nmodel of linguistic rhythm based on features of the amplitude envelope is used\nto compute these physical acoustic stimulus characteristics for Japanese. Using\n~18,000 samples of natural IDS and child-directed speech (CDS) recorded\nlongitudinally from 6 parents while speaking to their children over the ages\n0-5 years, we find that the temporal modulation patterns that characterise the\namplitude envelope of Japanese are highly similar to those found for\nstress-timed and syllable-timed European languages. However, the AM band\ncorresponding to the syllabic level in CDS/IDS in European languages (~2-12Hz,\ntheta-rate cortical tracking) was elongated in Japanese (2.5-17Hz). Further,\nthe phase synchronization ratios between the two slowest AM bands were as\nlikely to be 1:3 as 1:2, which differs from European languages where 1:2 ratios\nare dominant. Accordingly, the language-universal amplitude-driven physical\nacoustic structures important for cortical speech tracking flexibly accommodate\nlanguage-specific differences in core rhythmic units.",

However, selecting task-level experts\nis often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different\nexpertise per instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained\nLLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free\nMixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to\nselection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in\nbiomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that\ndynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning\ntasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own\nreasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized\ninto a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability\nto integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's\ninstance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but --\nwhen implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to\nthe need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we\nimplement a batch strategy that groups instances based on their assigned\nexperts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert\nmodels on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent\nbaselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks\n(MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we show that Symbolic-MoE beats strong\nLLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute avg.\ngain of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE\ngeneralizes well to unseen tasks and removes the need for expensive multi-round\ndiscussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.",

Here,\nwe develop a physical model for the formation of chondritic mixtures as an\noutcome of vaporizing collisions between planetesimals that were dynamically\nexcited by the growth and migration of planets. We present calculations of\nnebular shock waves generated by impact vapor plumes and focus on aspects of\nthe plume interaction with the nebular gas and dust that have been neglected in\nprevious studies of impact ejecta. We find that, when water dominates the\nvapor, the plumes are relatively cool. However, the plume expansion is\nsupersonic and can drive strong shock waves in the dusty nebular gas. Portions\nof these nebular shock fronts initially melt nebular dust, forming chondrules\nthat are coupled to the moving front. As the shock front expands and cools, the\nchondrules solidify while the shock front entrains additional dust. Eventually,\nthe plume expansion stalls and then hydrodynamically collapses, turbulently\nmixing variably processed dust and size-sorted chondrules. For probable impact\nparameters and nebular conditions during giant planet growth and migration, the\nimpact-generated mixtures have characteristics that span the range observed in\nchondritic meteorites, providing an environment for rapid formation of\nchondritic assemblages after chondrule formation. Our impact vapor and nebular\nshocks (IVANS) model links chondrule formation to the overall context of planet\nformation and provides a framework for interpreting the detailed chronological\nand geochemical record contained in chondritic meteorites.",

Firstly, we find that, after the\ndisappearance of ICL, the asymptotic strategy is a remarkable hybrid between\nin-weights and in-context learning, which we term \"context-constrained\nin-weights learning\" (CIWL). CIWL is in competition with ICL, and eventually\nreplaces it as the dominant strategy of the model (thus leading to ICL\ntransience). However, we also find that the two competing strategies actually\nshare sub-circuits, which gives rise to cooperative dynamics as well. For\nexample, in our setup, ICL is unable to emerge quickly on its own, and can only\nbe enabled through the simultaneous slow development of asymptotic CIWL. CIWL\nthus both cooperates and competes with ICL, a phenomenon we term \"strategy\ncoopetition.\" We propose a minimal mathematical model that reproduces these key\ndynamics and interactions. Informed by this model, we were able to identify a\nsetup where ICL is truly emergent and persistent.",

A\nrecent performance metric called fraction of best possible reach (BPR) measures\nthe impact of using a model's recommended size K subset of sites compared to\nthe best possible top-K in hindsight. We tackle two open problems related to\nBPR. First, we explore how to rank all sites numerically given a probabilistic\nmodel that predicts event counts jointly across sites. Ranking via the per-site\nmean is suboptimal for BPR. Instead, we offer a better ranking for BPR backed\nby decision theory. Second, we explore how to train a probabilistic model's\nparameters to maximize BPR. Discrete selection of K sites implies all-zero\nparameter gradients which prevent standard gradient training. We overcome this\nbarrier via advances in perturbed optimizers. We further suggest a training\nobjective that combines likelihood with a decision-aware BPR constraint to\ndeliver high-quality top-K rankings as well as good forecasts for all sites.

However, analyzing live dialogues in real-time necessitates\nlow-latency processing systems, making it impractical to deploy models with\nbillions of parameters due to latency constraints. As a result, practitioners\noften prefer smaller models with millions of parameters, trained on\nhigh-quality, human-annotated datasets. Yet, curating such datasets is both\ntime-consuming and costly. Consequently, there is a growing need to combine the\nscalability of LLM-generated labels with the precision of human annotations,\nenabling fine-tuned smaller models to achieve both higher speed and accuracy\ncomparable to larger models. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective\nframework to address this challenge. Our approach is specifically designed for\nper-utterance classification problems, which encompass tasks such as intent\ndetection, dialogue state tracking, and more. To mitigate the impact of\nlabeling errors from LLMs -- the primary source of inaccuracies in student\nmodels -- we propose a noise-reduced preference learning loss.

The gas density, the low\ncurrent and the comfortable avalanche-streamer separation guarantee high\ndetection efficiency, rate capability and slow detector ageing. The mixture has\na high Global Warming Potential (GWP ~1430), primarily due to the presence of\nC2H2F4. The C2H2F4 and SF6 are not recommended for industrial uses anymore,\nthus their availability will be increasingly difficult over time and the search\nfor an alternative gas mixture is then of absolute priority. CERN is also\ndriving efforts to reduce these gases, as they contribute significantly to the\nLHC greenhouse gas emissions.

We show here,\nusing Kelvin's model of unbounded constant shear augmented by spanwise-periodic\nstreaks, that this is because the push-over mechanism can act in concert with a\nOrr mechanism based upon the streaks to produce much-enhanced transient growth.\nThe model clarifies the transient growth mechanism originally found by Schoppa\n& Hussain, (J.

The instability and even transient growth acting on its own are found to\nhave the correct nonlinear feedback to generate streamwise rolls which can then\nre-energise the assumed streaks through lift-up indicating a sustaining cycle.\nOur results therefore support the view that while lift-up is believed central\nfor the roll-to-streak regenerative process, it is Orr and push-over mechanisms\nthat are both key for the streak-to-roll regenerative process in near-wall\nturbulence.",

We show that our approach can inform rater selection\nand feedback interpretation by capturing nuanced viewpoints across different\ndemographic groups, hence improving the quality of pluralistic data collection\nand in turn contributing to more robust AI development.",

The second component uses\nTransfer Learning (TL) to fine-tune the knowledge from the first component and\ncreate a model for grading and assessing cardiac images. The framework\ndemonstrates high performance in both classification and grading, achieving up\nto 99.43% accuracy and as low as 0.3067 error, respectively.

The second approach involved reordering the\nfeature importance list following the relative proportion of active cases,\nproviding insights into the expected effect of certain functional\ngroups/fragments on TDP1 inhibition. The third approach was to identify the\nmost and least desirable functional groups/fragments with respect to TDP1\ninhibition. The dataset used for these three approaches was obtained by\nsplitting the IUPAC name`s samples from the bioassay into basic functional\ngroups/fragments. These tokens were then used to name the features (columns) of\nthe dataset that will be used for the mentioned computational approaches. The\nvalues in these columns corresponded to the presence (marked with 1) or absence\n(marked with 0) of this functional group fragment in the relevant sample. Thus,\nthe dataset used in the study has 5,015 columns (features). The labels of this\ndataset derived from the initial dataset focused on TDP1 inhibition. In\naddition to the basic study, the CID_SID ML model was developed, which, using\nonly the compound and substance identifier (CID and SID) data from PubChem,\ncould predict with an accuracy of 85.2%, a precision of 94.2%, a precision of\n75%, an F1 of 83.5%, and an ROC of 85.2%.",

Existing research focuses on robustness to explicit\nnoise (e.g., document semantics) but overlooks spurious features (a.k.a.\nimplicit noise). While previous works have explored spurious features in LLMs,\nthey are limited to specific features (e.g., formats) and narrow scenarios\n(e.g., ICL). In this work, we statistically confirm the presence of spurious\nfeatures in the RAG paradigm, a robustness problem caused by the sensitivity of\nLLMs to semantic-agnostic features. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive\ntaxonomy of spurious features and empirically quantify their impact through\ncontrolled experiments. Further analysis reveals that not all spurious features\nare harmful and they can even be beneficial sometimes.

To explore more possibilities of quantized OSDSR, we propose an efficient\nmethod, Quantization via reverse-module and timestep-retraining for OSDSR,\nnamed QArtSR. Firstly, we investigate the influence of timestep value on the\nperformance of quantized models. Then, we propose Timestep Retraining\nQuantization (TRQ) and Reversed Per-module Quantization (RPQ) strategies to\ncalibrate the quantized model. Meanwhile, we adopt the module and image losses\nto update all quantized modules. We only update the parameters in quantization\nfinetuning components, excluding the original weights. To ensure that all\nmodules are fully finetuned, we add extended end-to-end training after\nper-module stage. Our 4-bit and 2-bit quantization experimental results\nindicate that QArtSR obtains superior effects against the recent leading\ncomparison methods. The performance of 4-bit QArtSR is close to the\nfull-precision one. Our code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/libozhu03/QArtSR.",

Here we use the modulation-doping\ntechnique to break inversion symmetry at novel Ge1-xSnx/Ge interfaces and\nexplore spin-orbit phenomena in the emergent Rashba-coupled hole gases.\nMagneto-optical investigations demonstrate the unusual establishment of a\nstaggered band alignment with carrier lifetime in the ns range. Optical spin\norientation is then leveraged to directly inject spin-polarized currents in the\nRashba-split 2D gas.

This provides\nunprecedented access to low-order contributions of the spin-orbit Hamiltonian.\nMoreover, it leads to the startling demonstration that the spin Hall angle can\nbe optically controlled by modifying the Rashba coupling through the\nphotoexcitation density.

Unfortunately, current\ndeep learning-based methods often neglect the simultaneous construction of\nlocal features and global dependencies at different time scales, lacking\nsufficient feature extraction capabilities to achieve satisfactory\nclassification accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nMultiscale Periodic Time Series Network (MPTSNet), which integrates multiscale\nlocal patterns and global correlations to fully exploit the inherent\ninformation in time series. Recognizing the multi-periodicity and complex\nvariable correlations in time series, we use the Fourier transform to extract\nprimary periods, enabling us to decompose data into multiscale periodic\nsegments.

However, there are several\nexceptions to this rule, including the ultra-hot-Neptune LTT 9779b, which have\nbeen found to have high geometric albedos. We observed four eclipses of LTT\n9779b with the G280 grism of the Hubble Space Telescope's WFC3 UVIS mode;\ntargeting the scattering signatures of the cloud condensate species causing the\nplanet's elevated reflectivity. However, we do not definitively detect the\nplanet's eclipse in our observations, with injection-recovery tests yielding a\n3-$\\sigma$ upper limit of 113 ppm on the eclipse depth of LTT 9779b in the\n0.2-0.8$\\mu$m waveband.

    "abstract": "Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) experiments are a cornerstone for materials\nstructure characterization. Despite their widespread application, analyzing\npXRD diffractograms still presents a significant challenge to automation and a\nbottleneck in high-throughput discovery in self-driving labs. Machine learning\npromises to resolve this bottleneck by enabling automated powder diffraction\nanalysis. A notable difficulty in applying machine learning to this domain is\nthe lack of sufficiently sized experimental datasets, which has constrained\nresearchers to train primarily on simulated data. However, models trained on\nsimulated pXRD patterns showed limited generalization to experimental patterns,\nparticularly for low-quality experimental patterns with high noise levels and\nelevated backgrounds. With the Open Experimental Powder X-Ray Diffraction\nDatabase (opXRD), we provide an openly available and easily accessible dataset\nof labeled and unlabeled experimental powder diffractograms. Labeled opXRD data\ncan be used to evaluate the performance of models on experimental data and\nunlabeled opXRD data can help improve the performance of models on experimental\ndata, e.g. through transfer learning methods. We collected 92552\ndiffractograms, 2179 of them labeled, from a wide spectrum of materials\nclasses. We hope this ongoing effort can guide machine learning research toward\nfully automated analysis of pXRD data and thus enable future self-driving\nmaterials labs.",

The\nanalysis incorporates significant enhancements in calibration methods, sky\nmodel subtraction, radio-frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, and an\nimproved signal separation technique using machine learning to develop a\nphysically motivated covariance model for the 21-cm signal. These advancements\nhave markedly reduced previously observed excess power due to residual\nsystematics, bringing the measurements closer to the theoretical thermal noise\nlimit across the entire $k$-space. Using comparable observational data, we\nachieve a 2 to 4-fold improvement over our previous LOFAR limits, with best\nupper limits of $\\Delta_{21}^2 < (68.7\\,\\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k =\n0.076\\,h\\,\\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, $\\Delta_{21}^2 < (54.3\\,\\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k =\n0.076\\,h\\,\\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$ and $\\Delta_{21}^2 < (65.5\\,\\mathrm{mK})^2$ at $k\n= 0.083\\,h\\,\\mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$ at redshifts $z \\approx 10.1, 9.1$, and $8.3$,\nrespectively. These new multi-redshift upper limits provide new constraints\nthat can be used to refine our understanding of the astrophysical processes\nduring the EoR. Comprehensive validation tests, including signal injection,\nwere performed to ensure the robustness of our methods. The remaining excess\npower is attributed to residual foreground emissions from distant sources, beam\nmodel inaccuracies, and low-level RFI. We discuss ongoing and future\nimprovements to the data processing pipeline aimed at further reducing these\nresiduals, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of LOFAR observations in the quest\nto detect the 21-cm signal from the EoR.",

These\nequations and their solutions are intractable to solve and represent exactly,\nrequiring novel approximation techniques. This work takes strides towards this\nend, establishing conditions on the method of parameterizing return\ndistributions under which the DHJB equation can be approximately solved.\nParticularly, we show that under a certain topological property of the mapping\nbetween statistics learned by a distributional RL algorithm and corresponding\ndistributions, approximation of these statistics leads to close approximations\nof the solution of the DHJB equation. Concretely, we demonstrate that the\nquantile representation common in distributional RL satisfies this topological\nproperty, certifying an efficient approximation algorithm for continuous-time\ndistributional RL.",

The\npacking number $\\rho(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum size of a vertex set whose\nclosed neighborhoods are pairwise disjoint. In this paper we study graph\nclasses ${\\cal G}$ such that $\\gamma(G)/\\rho(G)$ is bounded by a constant\n$c_{\\cal G}$ for each $G\\in {\\cal G}$. We propose an inductive proof technique\nto prove that if $\\cal G$ is the class of $2$-degenerate graphs, then there is\nsuch a constant bound $c_{\\cal G}$. We note that this is the first monotone,\ndense graph class that is shown to have constant ratio. We also show that the\nclasses of AT-free and unit-disk graphs have bounded ratio.\n  In addition, our technique gives improved bounds on $c_{\\cal G}$ for planar\ngraphs, graphs of bounded treewidth or bounded twin-width. Finally, we provide\nsome new examples of graph classes where the ratio is unbounded.",

To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph\nAutoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric\ndeep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global\nstructure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical\npooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve\nessential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process.\nEven though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a\nsystem's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI\nconsistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous\nlatent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from\nstochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple\napplications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of\nprotein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective\nmotion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain\nconnectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior\nperformance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent\nphenomena across diverse scientific domains.",

In this work, we present the acquisition and\nprocessing of the ALMAGAL data. The main goal is to set up a robust pipeline\nthat generates science-ready products, with a good and uniform quality across\nthe whole sample. ALMAGAL observations were performed with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Each field was observed in three\ndifferent telescope arrays, being sensitive to spatial scales ranging from 1000\nau up to 0.1 pc. The spectral setup allows sensitive imaging of the continuum\nemission at 219 GHz, and it covers multiple molecular spectral lines observed\nin four different spectral windows that span about 4 GHz in frequency coverage.\nWe have designed a Python-based processing workflow to calibrate and image\nthese observational data. This ALMAGAL pipeline includes an improved continuum\ndetermination, suited for line-rich sources; an automatic self-calibration\nprocess that improves the dynamical range of the final images; and the\ncombination of data from different telescope arrays to produce science-ready,\nfully combined images. The fully combined products have spatial resolutions in\nthe range 800-2000 au, and mass sensitivities in the range 0.02-0.07 Mo. We\nalso present a first analysis of the spectral line information included in the\nALMAGAL setup, and its potential for future scientific studies. As an example,\nspecific spectral lines at 1000 au scales resolve the presence of multiple\noutflows in clusters and will help us to search for disk candidates around\nmassive protostars. Moreover, the broad frequency bands provide information on\nthe chemical richness of the different cluster members, which can be used to\nstudy the chemical evolution during the formation process of star clusters.",

The method is based on a\nphase-field formulation of two-phase, compressible, inviscid flow with a\ntrivial mixture model. Implicit shock tracking is a high-order,\noptimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that automatically aligns mesh\nfaces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with\ninter-element jumps. It is used to accurately approximate shocks and\nrarefactions without stabilization and converge the phase-field solution to a\nsharp interface one by aligning mesh faces with the material interface.\nTime-dependent problems are formulated as steady problems in a space-time\ndomain where complex wave interactions (e.g., intersections and reflections)\nmanifest as space-time triplet points. The space-time formulation avoids\ncomplex re-meshing and solution transfer that would be required to track moving\nwaves with mesh faces using the method of lines. The approach is applied to\nseveral two-phase flow Riemann problems involving gases with ideal, stiffened\ngas, and Becker-Kistiakowsky-Wilson (BKW) equations of state, including a\nspherically symmetric underwater explosion problem. In all cases, the method\naligns element faces with all shocks (including secondary shocks that form at\ntime t > 0), rarefactions, and material interfaces, and accurately resolves the\nflow field on coarse space-time grids.",

Using a baseline LLM\nin two setups-Unguided, where the model has no prior exposure to test samples,\nand Guided, where the model has prior knowledge of the desired answer-EMDM\ndistinguishes instances of varying difficulty. The CoT and answer correctness\nfrom these setups inform an optimization objective for weight assignment,\nresulting in a more nuanced evaluation of model performance.

The generalized matching problem is an ILP where each\ncolumn of the constraint matrix has $1$-norm of at most $2$. It captures\nseveral well-known polynomial time solvable problems such as matching and flow\nproblems. We parameterize by the size of variable and constraint backdoors,\nwhich measure the least number of columns or rows that must be deleted to\nobtain a generalized matching ILP.\n  We present the following results: (i) a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT)\nalgorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $p$ of a minimum variable backdoor\nto generalized matching; (ii) a randomized slice-wise polynomial (XP) time\nalgorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $h$ of a minimum constraint\nbackdoor to generalized matching as long as $c$ and $A$ are encoded in unary;\n(iii) we complement (ii) by proving that solving an ILP is W[1]-hard when\nparameterized by $h$ even when $c,A,l,u$ have coefficients of constant size. To\nobtain (i), we prove a variant of lattice-convexity of the degree sequences of\nweighted $b$-matchings, which we study in the light of SBO jump M-convex\nfunctions. This allows us to model the matching part as a polyhedral constraint\non the integer backdoor variables. The resulting ILP is solved in FPT time\nusing an integer programming algorithm. For (ii), the randomized XP time\nalgorithm is obtained by pseudo-polynomially reducing the problem to the exact\nmatching problem.

Here, we analyze the occurrence rate of LRDs, which emerge around\nredshifts $z \\sim 6-8$ and sharply decline at $z < 4$.

We propose a hypothesis that the first one or\ntwo AGN events associated with newly-formed seed BHs are observed as LRDs and\ntheir unique features fade in the subsequent episodes. This naturally explains\nthe cosmic evolution of AGN abundance over $0 < z < 5$, which follows $\\propto\n(1+z)^{-5/2}$ due to the cumulative effect of recurring AGN activity. The\nunique characteristics of LRDs are likely linked to the dense gas environments\naround the seed BHs, which create strong absorption features in the broad-line\nemission and enable super-Eddington accretion bursts, ultimately yielding the\nobserved overmassive nature of BHs compared to the local relationship.

    "abstract": "Scaling up a superconducting quantum computer will likely require quantum\ncommunication between remote chips, which can be implemented using an itinerant\nmicrowave photon in a transmission line. To realize high-fidelity\ncommunication, it is essential to control the frequency and temporal shape of\nthe microwave photon. In this work, we demonstrate the generation of\nfrequency-tunable shaped microwave photons without resorting to any\nfrequency-tunable circuit element. We develop a framework which treats a\nmicrowave resonator as a band-pass filter mediating the interaction between a\nsuperconducting qubit and the modes in the transmission line. This\ninterpretation allows us to stimulate the photon emission by an off-resonant\ndrive signal. We characterize how the frequency and temporal shape of the\ngenerated photon depends on the frequency and amplitude of the drive signal. By\nmodulating the drive amplitude and frequency, we achieve a frequency tunability\nof 40 MHz while maintaining the photon mode shape time-symmetric. Through\nmeasurements of the quadrature amplitudes of the emitted photons, we\ndemonstrate consistently high state and process fidelities around 95\\% across\nthe tunable frequency range. Our hardware-efficient approach eliminates the\nneed for additional biasing lines typically required for frequency tuning,\noffering a simplified architecture for scalable quantum communication.",

To address this, we\nintroduce S4M (Segment Anything with 4 Extreme Points), which augments SAM by\nleveraging extreme points -- the top-, bottom-, left-, and right-most points of\nan instance -- prompts. These points are intuitive to identify and provide a\nfaster, structured alternative to box prompts. However, a na\\\"ive use of\nextreme points degrades performance, due to SAM's inability to interpret their\nsemantic roles. To resolve this, we introduce dedicated learnable embeddings,\nenabling the model to distinguish extreme points from generic free-form points\nand better reason about their spatial relationships. We further propose an\nauxiliary training task through the Canvas module, which operates solely on\nprompts -- without vision input -- to predict a coarse instance mask. This\nencourages the model to internalize the relationship between extreme points and\nmask distributions, leading to more robust segmentation.

This paper explores the\nradial-mode stability of stars across parameter space occupied by BLAPs. Models\nare constructed for homogeneous stellar envelopes and are agnostic of\nevolution. Linear non-adiabatic models demonstrate the major requirement for\npulsations to be enrichment of iron and nickel in the driving zone to a few\ntimes the solar abundance. There is no constraint on mass. Non-linear models\ndemonstrate that BLAP pulsations will be of large amplitude and will show\nstrong shocks at minimum radius. A variety of light-curve shapes are found\nacross the BLAP instability strip, accounting for the variety observed.\nLinearised period relations are derived from the non-linear models. The phase\nof maximum luminosity relative to minimum radius is correlated with effective\ntemperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$), preceding for cool stars and following for hot\nstars, and split if close to minimum radius. In both linear and non-linear\ncases, most models pulsate in the fundamental mode (F). First-overtone (1H)\npulsations are excited on the low luminosity blue side of the instability\nregion and become more prevalent at higher mass. The period ratio $P_{\\rm\n1H}/P_{\\rm F}=0.81$ contrasts with the classical Cepheid value (0.70 - 0.75).\nThe transition from F to 1H mode pulsations follows a period-mass relation; the\nF-mode pulsators adjacent to the transition show a reverse shock. At high\n$T_{\\rm eff}$ some non-linear models show unstable overtone modes up to 5H and\nmulti-mode behaviour.

In practice training data lack those anomalous\nsamples; hence state-of-the-art methods are trained to discriminate between\nnormal and synthetically-generated pseudo-anomalous data. Most methods use data\naugmentation techniques on normal images to simulate anomalies. However the\nbest-performing ones implicitly leverage a geometric bias present in the\nbenchmarking datasets. This limits their usability in more general conditions.\nOthers are relying on basic noising schemes that may be suboptimal in capturing\nthe underlying structure of normal data. In addition most still favour the\nimage domain to generate pseudo-anomalies training models end-to-end from only\nthe normal class and overlooking richer representations of the information. To\novercome these limitations we consider frozen yet rich feature spaces given by\npretrained models and create pseudo-anomalous features with a novel adaptive\nlinear feature perturbation technique. It adapts the noise distribution to each\nsample applies decaying linear perturbations to feature vectors and further\nguides the classification process using a contrastive learning objective.\nExperimental evaluation conducted on both standard and geometric bias-free\ndatasets demonstrates the superiority of our approach with respect to\ncomparable baselines.

We consider a practical multi-user multi-input\nsingle-output (MU-MISO) system, where a base station (BS) equipped with fixed\nposition antennas (FPAs) employs RSMA to communicate with multiple single-FA\nusers, while an eavesdropping target may potentially wiretap the signals. The\nsystem adopts a novel rate splitting (RS) scheme, where the common layer stream\nserves a dual purpose: it conveys valid data to legitimate users (LUs) while\nsimultaneously generating jamming signals to confuse potential eavesdroppers.\nWe establish the problem and propose the optimization algorithm under two\nconditions: perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions.\nSpecifically, under perfect the CSI condition, we address the non-convex\noptimization problem by proposing an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm,\nwhich decomposes the problem into two subproblems: beamforming matrix\noptimization and the adjustment of FA positions. For beamforming optimization,\nwe utilize semidefinite programming (SDP) and successive convex approximation\n(SCA) to convert the problem into a more tractable convex form. Given a fixed\nbeamforming matrix, SCA is applied to handle the surrogate upper bound of the\nconstraints. In the case of imperfect CSI, the continuous nature of CSI errors\nleads to an infinite number of constraints. To overcome this challenge, we\npropose an AO-based algorithm that incorporates the S-Procedure and SCA to\nobtain a high-quality beamforming matrix and effective FA positions.

Achieving high quality typically requires dense\nsampling of input views, which can lead to frustrating manual labor. Manually\npositioning cameras to maintain an optimal desired distribution can be\ndifficult for humans, and if a good distribution is found, it is not easy to\nreplicate. Additionally, the captured data can suffer from motion blur and\ndefocus due to human error. In this paper, we use a lightweight object capture\npipeline to reduce the manual workload and standardize the acquisition setup,\nwith a consumer turntable to carry the object and a tripod to hold the camera.\nOf course, turntables and gantry systems have been frequently used to\nautomatically capture dense samples under various views and lighting\nconditions; the key difference is that we use a turntable under natural\nenvironment lighting. This way, we can easily capture hundreds of valid images\nin several minutes without hands-on effort. However, in the object reference\nframe, the light conditions vary (rotate); this does not match the assumptions\nof standard NVS methods like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). We design a neural\nradiance representation conditioned on light rotations, which addresses this\nissue and allows rendering with novel light rotations as an additional benefit.\nWe further study the behavior of rotations and find optimal capturing\nstrategies. We demonstrate our pipeline using 3DGS as the underlying framework,\nachieving higher quality and showcasing the method's potential for novel\nlighting and harmonization tasks.",

However, LLMs can generate hallucinations\nand nonfactual information, undermining their trustworthiness in high-stakes\nmedical tasks. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a statistically rigorous\nframework for marginal (average) coverage guarantees but has limited\nexploration in medical QA. This paper proposes an enhanced CP framework for\nmedical multiple-choice question-answering (MCQA) tasks. By associating the\nnon-conformance score with the frequency score of correct options and\nleveraging self-consistency, the framework addresses internal model opacity and\nincorporates a risk control strategy with a monotonic loss function. Evaluated\non MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU datasets using four off-the-shelf LLMs, the\nproposed method meets specified error rate guarantees while reducing average\nprediction set size with increased risk level, offering a promising uncertainty\nevaluation metric for LLMs.",

Design/methodology/approach - Tourism is\none of the most digitalized sectors of the economy, and social networks are an\nimportant source of data for information gathering. However, the high levels of\nredundant information on the Web and the appearance of contradictory opinions\nand facts produce undesirable effects that must be cross-checked against real\ndata. This paper sets out the causal relationships associated with tourist\nflows to enable the formulation of appropriate strategies. Findings - The\nresults can be applied to numerous cases, for example, in the analysis of\ntourist flows, these findings can be used to determine whether the behaviour of\ncertain groups affects that of other groups, as well as analysing tourist\nbehaviour in terms of the most relevant variables.

Using a remeshing-based\ncontinuum finite element (FE) framework, we reveal that two-scale metallic\nhierarchical solids exhibit a distinct, localized deformation mode that\ninvolves necking and fracture of microscale tension members even at small\nglobal compressive strains (3-5%). The tensile failure is always preceded by\nplastic buckling of a complementary compression member. This combined\nnecking-buckling (NB) mode critically underlies the collapse of\nhexagon-triangle (HTH) hierarchical lattices over a wide range of relative\ndensities and length-scale ratios and is also seen in diamond-triangle (DTH)\nlattices. In lattices with very slender microscale members, necking is\nprevented by a competing failure mode that involves coordinated buckling (CB)\nof multiple members. Our custom remeshing FE framework is critical to resolve\nthe localized large plastic strains, ductile failure, and complex local modes\nof deformation (including cusp formation) that are characteristic of the NB\nmode. A theoretical buckling analysis supports the inevitability of the NB and\nCB modes in HTH lattices. The occurrence of the NB mode has consequences for\nenergy absorption by two-scale hierarchical solids, and hence influences their\ndesign.",

This limitation poses challenges for using such\nalgorithms on various neural processing units (NPUs) and edge AI devices, which\nhave diverse model formats and frameworks. In this paper, we show SplitQuantV2,\nan innovative algorithm designed to enhance low-bit linear quantization of\nLLMs, can achieve results comparable to those of advanced algorithms.\nSplitQuantV2 preprocesses models by splitting linear and convolution layers\ninto functionally equivalent, quantization-friendly structures. The algorithm's\nplatform-agnostic, concise, and efficient nature allows for implementation\nwithout the need for GPUs. Our evaluation on the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct model\nusing the AI2's Reasoning Challenge (ARC) dataset demonstrates that\nSplitQuantV2 improves the accuracy of the INT4 quantization model by 11.76%p,\nmatching the performance of the original floating-point model. Remarkably,\nSplitQuantV2 took only 2 minutes 6 seconds to preprocess the 1B model and\nperform linear INT4 quantization using only an Apple M4 CPU. SplitQuantV2\nprovides a practical solution for low-bit quantization on LLMs, especially when\ncomplex, computation-intensive algorithms are inaccessible due to hardware\nlimitations or framework incompatibilities.",

When applied to the\npost-Minkowskian (PM) description of the two-body problem in Einsteinian\ngravity, this Lagrange-EOB (LEOB) approach allows for a new formulation of the\nconservative dynamics that avoids the drawbacks of the recursive definition of\nEOB-PM Hamiltonians. Using state-of-the-art values of the waveform and\nradiation reaction, based on factorized and resummed post-Newtonian (PN)\nexpressions, we apply our new formalism to the construction of an aligned-spin,\nquasi-circular, inspiralling EOB waveform model, called LEOB-PM, that\nincorporates analytical information up to the 4PM level, completed by 4PN\ncontributions up to the sixth order in eccentricity, in the orbital sector, and\nby 4.5PN contributions, in the spin-orbit sector. In the nonspinning case, we\nfind, for the first time, that an uncalibrated LEOB-PM model delivers EOB/NR\nunfaithfulness (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range\n$10-200M_\\odot$) of at most $1\\%$ over all the nonspinning dataset of the\nSimulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Numerical Relativity (NR) catalog up to mass\nratio $q=15$, also yielding excellent phasing agreement with the $q=32$\nconfiguration of the RIT catalog.

    "abstract": "Sparse arrays have been widely exploited in radar systems because of their\nadvantages in achieving large array aperture at low hardware cost, while\nsignificantly reducing mutual coupling. However, sparse arrays suffer from high\nsidelobes which may lead to false detections. Missing elements in sparse arrays\ncan be interpolated using the sparse array measurements. In snapshot-limited\nscenarios, such as automotive radar, it is challenging to utilize difference\ncoarrays which require a large number of snapshots to construct a covariance\nmatrix for interpolation. For single snapshot sparse array interpolation,\ntraditional model-based methods, while effective, require expert knowledge for\nhyperparameter tuning, lack task-specific adaptability, and incur high\ncomputational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based\nsingle snapshot sparse array interpolation network that addresses these\nchallenges by leveraging a frequency-domain attention mechanism. The proposed\napproach transforms the sparse signal into the frequency domain, where the\nattention mechanism focuses on key spectral regions, enabling improved\ninterpolation of missing elements even in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nconditions.

Since this is a matrix\ninequality involving the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix\n(QFIM), the formalism breaks down when the QFIM is singular. In this paper, we\nexamine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result\nfrom an over-parametrization on the metrological level.

Although\nthe number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM\neigenvalues, the Cram\\'er-Rao formalism typically does not provide information\nabout the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a\nseries of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights.\nIn particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior\ndistribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of\nunknown parameters.

Most existing PFL methods focus on personalizing the aggregated\nglobal model for each client, neglecting the fundamental aspect of federated\nlearning: the regulation of how client models are aggregated. Additionally,\nalmost all of them overlook the graph structure formed by clients in federated\nlearning. In this paper, we propose a novel method, Personalized Federated\nLearning with Graph Attention Network (pFedGAT), which captures the latent\ngraph structure between clients and dynamically determines the importance of\nother clients for each client, enabling fine-grained control over the\naggregation process.

However, the\nmajority of current studies mainly concentrate on detecting whether SRBs are\npresent or absent, often focusing on only one particular type of burst.\nMoreover, the neural network models used for SRB detection are typically\ncomplex, involving a large number of parameters, which results in slower\nprocessing speeds. This study establishes a dataset encompassing Type II, Type\nIII, Type IIIs, Type IV, and Type V SRBs collected from e-CALLISTO, including\n8,752 SRB spectrum images and achieving annotations for 10,822 SRBs. We propose\na multi-category SRB detection model based on task-aligned one-stage object\ndetection (TOOD). TOOD can solve the problem of inconsistent predictions in\nclassification and localization tasks, and it improves the detection recall\nrate. This model aligns classification and localization tasks and optimizes the\nneck network by incorporating a channel attention mechanism. This model\nachieves higher recall and accuracy with fewer parameters. This model can\naccurately detect five types of SBRs. The experimental results show that the\nmodel achieved an accuracy of 79.9\\% (AP50) and a recall rate of 95.1\\% on the\nSBRs dataset. A higher recall rate than other models means fewer SRBs are\nmissed in automatic detection.

The pulsar has a spin period of 4.99 ms, an orbital period of\n18.8 days, and is in a very eccentric ($e = 0.89$) orbit around a massive\ncompanion. In this work, we present the updated timing analysis of this system,\nobtained with an additional 1 yr of monthly observations using the Giant\nMetrewave Radio Telescope and 2.5 yrs of observations using the MeerKAT\ntelescope. This has allowed for a precise measurement of the proper motion of\nthe system, implying a transverse velocity of\n$30\\,\\pm\\,7\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ relative to the cluster. This is\nsmaller than the cluster's escape velocity and consistent with the pulsar's\nassociation to NGC 1851. We have confirmed a large second spin frequency\nderivative and large associated jerk, which has increased the spin frequency\nderivative by a factor of 27 since the mid-2000s. The third spin frequency\nderivative showed that the strength of this jerk has increased by $\\sim 65\\%$\nin the same time period. We take the effect of the changing acceleration into\naccount and this allows for much improved estimates of the orbital period\nderivative. The large and fast-increasing jerk implies the presence of a third\nbody in the vicinity of the pulsar (no counterpart is detectable within\ndistance limit in HST images). Based on our measured parameters, we constrain\nthe mass, distance and orbital parameters for this third body. The induced\ntidal contributions to the post-Keplerian parameters are small, and the precise\nmeasurement of these parameters allowed us to obtain precise mass measurements\nfor the system: $M_\\mathrm{tot} = 2.4734(3)$ M$_{\\odot}$, $M_\\mathrm{p} =\n1.39(3)$ M$_{\\odot}$, $M_\\mathrm{c} = 1.08(3)$ M$_{\\odot}$.

To approximately capture\nthis property, we specially design a parameterized quantum layer to realize\npermutation invariance in the kernel model. We show that our novel encoding\nmethod and parameterized layers used in the quantum kernel model can\neffectively capture the symmetric characteristics of the pairwise DNA sequence\ncomparison task.

    "abstract": "Understanding galactic magnetic fields is essential for interpreting feedback\nprocesses in galaxies. Despite their importance, the exact structure of these\nfields, particularly in galactic halos, remains unclear. Accurate descriptions\nare crucial for understanding the interaction between star formation and halo\nmagnetisation. By systematically analysing the polarisation patterns in halos\nof nearby galaxies, we aim to deepen the understanding of the interplay between\ngalactic magnetic fields and star formation processes. We provide an analytical\ndescription of the observed X-shaped halos. Based on radio polarimetry data, we\nclassify the polarisation patterns of a sample of edge-on galaxies, by using a\nnewly introduced three-class system: disc dominated, small-scale, and X-shaped.\nWe then fit X-shaped patterns to the polarisation data for galaxies classified\nas X-shaped and explore links between the polarisation patterns and other\nphysical properties of these galaxies. The classification process shows that 11\nout of 18 analysed galaxies display an X-shaped polarisation pattern. Galaxies\nclassified as disc dominated seem less efficient at forming stars than expected\nfor their stellar mass and rotate faster than galaxies with similarly sized\nHI-discs. X-shape modelling reveals that the polarisation patterns are best\nfitted by a constant-angle model, and we observe a correlation between the\nX-shape opening angle and star formation rate surface density indicating the\ninterplay between the star formation in the disc and the magnetisation of the\ngalactic halo. The analysis of polarisation patterns in nearby galaxies reveals\nthat most exhibit an X-shaped configuration, indicating a common magnetic field\nstructure in galactic halos. The introduced models capture the X-shaped\nmorphology and reveal the link between the X-shape's opening angle and star\nformation rate surface density.",

We demonstrate a method to combine imaging and spectral\ndata to infer the polarisation of a coronal loop's standing kink wave, without\nthe need for multiple instruments or multiple lines of sight. We use the unique\ncapabilities of the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP) to observe the\nstanding kink mode of an off-limb coronal loop perturbed by an eruption. The\nfull off-disk corona is observed using the 1074 nm Fe XIII spectral line,\nproviding Doppler velocity, intensity and line width. By tracking the\noscillatory motion of a loop apex in a time-distance map, we extract the\nline-of-sight (Doppler) velocity of the inhomogeneity as it sways and compare\nit with the derivative of its plane-of-sky displacement. This analysis provides\nthe loop's velocity in two perpendicular planes as it oscillates with a period\nof $8.9^{+0.5}_{-0.5}$ minutes. Through detailed analysis of the phase relation\nbetween the transverse velocities we infer the kink oscillation to be\nhorizontally polarised, oscillating in a plane tilted $-13.6^{+2.9}_{-3.0}$\ndegrees away from the plane of sky. The line widths show a periodic enhancement\nduring the kink oscillation, exhibiting both the kink period and its double.\nThis study is the first to combine direct imaging and spectral data to infer\nthe polarisation of a coronal loop oscillation from a single viewpoint.",

    "abstract": "Directed wiring diagrams can be used as a composition pattern for composing\ninput/output systems such as Moore machines. In a Moore machine, the input\nparametrizes an internal state and the internal state defines the output.\nBecause the value of the output is shielded from the input by the internal\nstate, Moore machines can compose by connecting the output of any machine to\nthe input of any other machine. These connections are defined by the trace\nwires in a directed wiring diagram. Unlike Moore machines, Mealy machines allow\nthe output to be directly and instantaneously affected by the input. In order\nto compose such machines via directed wiring diagrams, it is necessary to avoid\ncycles between trace wires in the wiring digram and dependencies of outputs on\ninputs. To capture these patterns of composition, we introduce an operad of\ndependent directed wiring diagrams. We then define an algebra of Mealy machines\non this operad and an algebra of stock and flow diagrams in which the values of\nauxiliary variables are parameterized by inputs. Finally, we give a semantics\nfor this algebra of stock and flow diagrams by giving a morphism of algebras\nfrom stock and flow diagrams into Mealy machines.",

    "abstract": "Creating highly spin-squeezed states for quantum metrology surpassing the\nstandard quantum limit is a topic of great interest. Spin squeezing has been\nachieved by either entangling different atoms in an ensemble, or by controlling\nthe multi-level internal spin state of an atom. Here, we experimentally\ndemonstrate combined internal and collective spin squeezing in a hot atomic\nensemble with $\\sim 10^{11}$ rubidium atoms. By synergistically combining these\ntwo types of squeezing and carefully aligning their squeezing quadratures, we\nhave achieved a metrologically relevant spin squeezing of $-6.21\\pm0.84$ dB,\nsignificantly outperforming the results obtained by utilizing either type of\nsqueezing alone. Our approach provides a new perspective on fully harnessing\nthe degrees of freedom inherent in quantum states of an atomic ensemble.",

However, security\nconcerns remain largely unexplored, particularly the threat of backdoor\nattacks, which can introduce malicious behaviors into models through\nfine-tuning with poisoned datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate\nthe vulnerabilities of LLM-based Text-to-SQL models and present ToxicSQL, a\nnovel backdoor attack framework. Our approach leverages stealthy {semantic and\ncharacter-level triggers} to make backdoors difficult to detect and remove,\nensuring that malicious behaviors remain covert while maintaining high model\naccuracy on benign inputs. Furthermore, we propose leveraging SQL injection\npayloads as backdoor targets, enabling the generation of malicious yet\nexecutable SQL queries, which pose severe security and privacy risks in\nlanguage model-based SQL development. We demonstrate that injecting only 0.44%\nof poisoned data can result in an attack success rate of 79.41%, posing a\nsignificant risk to database security. Additionally, we propose detection and\nmitigation strategies to enhance model reliability. Our findings highlight the\nurgent need for security-aware Text-to-SQL development, emphasizing the\nimportance of robust defenses against backdoor threats.",

The X-ray emission exhibited significant\ndependence on both energy and torque state. This work highlights the comparison\nof timing features of 4U 1626$-$67 with a previous $AstroSat$ observation from\n2018, when the neutron star was in the spin-up state. The power density\nspectrum (PDS) of the 2023 observation comprised a sharp peak corresponding to\n$\\nu_{\\rm NS}\\sim$130 mHz X-ray pulsations along with a prominent\nquasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature at $\\nu_{\\rm QPO}\\sim$46 mHz with\n$\\sim$20\\% rms amplitude, which was positively correlated with energy. We also\nreport the detection of sidebands to QPO occurring at a beat frequency\n($\\nu_{\\rm NS}-\\nu_{\\rm QPO}$) of $\\sim$83 mHz with $\\sim$8\\% rms amplitude,\nhaving $>3\\sigma$ detection significance. Additionally, we utilized $Nuclear\n~Spectroscopic ~Telescope ~ARray$ ($NuSTAR$) observations from the same torque\nstate (2023 May-July) to analogize the presence and energy dependence of\nsidebands. The source retains timing properties in this spin-down torque state,\nsimilar to those seen in the previous spin-down phase. In sharp contrast, PDS\nfrom the 2018 observation was dominated by red noise, an absence of QPOs and a\nbroadening in the wings of the pulse frequency peak, indicating a coupling\nbetween periodic and low-frequency aperiodic variability. Furthermore, we\ndetected the known cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) at 37 keV in\nthe Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) spectrum. We explore various\nmechanisms that could possibly explain the presence of QPOs exclusively during\nthe spin-down state.",

Using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the time\nderivative of the vector field, we find a set of coupled nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equation for the time dependent effective skyrmion radius and its\nhelicity. In particular, we use a triangular-shaped skyrmion profile of its\npolar angle. Contrary to the commonly expected simple exponential decrease in\nsize, we reveal a more complicated time dependence, in which the time-dependent\nradius crosses over from an exponential decay towards a square root decrease,\n$\\sim (t - t_c)^{1/2}$, near a critical time $t_c$ at which it collapses. This\ncritical time is found to depend logarithmically on the lattice constant. In\naddition, we examine the interplay between the shrinking dynamics and an\naccompanying transformation through different skyrmion configurations,\ndepending on the various system parameters.

There are opportunities for better cooperation\nif the spectral occupation and technology of the interference can be detected.\nNamely, this information can help the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple\nAccess (OFDMA) scheduler in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) to efficiently allocate\nresources to multiple users inthe frequency domain. This work shows that a\nsingle Channel State Information (CSI) snapshot, which is used for packet\ndemodulation in the receiver, is enough to detect and classify the type of CTI\non low-cost Wi-Fi 6 hardware. We show the classification accuracy of a small\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\nand Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) with simulated data, as well as using a\nwired and over-the-air test with a professional wireless connectivity tester,\nwhile running the inference on the low-cost device. Furthermore, we use\nopenwifi, a full-stack Wi-Fi transceiver running on software-defined radio\n(SDR) available in the w-iLab.t testbed, as Access Point (AP) to implement a\nCTI-aware multi-user OFDMA scheduler when the clients send CTI detection\nfeedback to the AP.

    "abstract": "Despite various efforts, decarbonizing the heating sector remains a\nsignificant challenge. To tackle it by smart planning, the availability of\nhighly resolved heating demand data is key. Several existing models provide\nheating demand only for specific applications. Typically, they either offer\ntime series for a larger area or annual demand data on a building level, but\nnot both simultaneously. Additionally, the diversity in heating demand across\ndifferent buildings is often not considered. To address these limitations, this\npaper presents a novel method for generating temporally resolved heat demand\ntime series at the building level using publicly available data. The approach\nintegrates a thermal building model with stochastic occupancy simulations that\naccount for variability in user behavior. As a result, the tool serves as a\ncost-effective resource for cross-sectoral energy system planning and policy\ndevelopment, particularly with a focus on the heating sector. The obtained data\ncan be used to assess the impact of renovation and retrofitting strategies, or\nto analyze district heating expansion. To illustrate the potential applications\nof this approach, we conducted a case study in Puertollano (Spain), where we\nprepared a dataset of heating demand with hourly resolution for each of 9,298\nresidential buildings. This data was then used to compare two different\npathways for the thermal renovation of these buildings. By relying on publicly\navailable data, this method can be adapted and applied to various European\nregions, offering broad usability in energy system optimization and analysis of\ndecarbonization strategies.",

While existing EFCIL methods\nleverage knowledge distillation to alleviate forgetting, they still face two\ncritical challenges: semantic shift and decision bias. Specifically, the\nembeddings of old tasks shift in the embedding space after learning new tasks,\nand the classifier becomes biased towards new tasks due to training solely with\nnew data, hindering the balance between old and new knowledge. To address these\nissues, we propose the Dual-Projection Shift Estimation and Classifier\nReconstruction (DPCR) approach for EFCIL. DPCR effectively estimates semantic\nshift through a dual-projection, which combines a learnable transformation with\na row-space projection to capture both task-wise and category-wise shifts.\nFurthermore, to mitigate decision bias, DPCR employs ridge regression to\nreformulate a classifier reconstruction process. This reconstruction exploits\nprevious in covariance and prototype of each class after calibration with\nestimated shift, thereby reducing decision bias. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that, on various datasets, DPCR effectively balances old and new\ntasks, outperforming state-of-the-art EFCIL methods.

Modelling such configurations relies\nstrongly on calibration to numerical-relativity (NR) simulations. Binaries on\nquasi-circular orbits have been widely explored in NR, however, coverage of the\nbroader 9-dimensional parameter space, including orbital eccentricity, remains\nsparse. This article develops a new procedure to control orbital eccentricity\nof binary black hole simulations that enables choosing initial data parameters\nwith precise control over eccentricity and mean anomaly of the subsequent\nevolution, as well as the coalescence time. We then calculate several sequences\nof NR simulations that nearly uniformly cover the 2-dimensional\neccentricity--mean anomaly space for equal mass, non-spinning binary black\nholes. We demonstrate that, for fixed eccentricity, many quantities related to\nthe merger dynamics of binary black holes show an oscillatory dependence on\nmean anomaly. The amplitude of these oscillations scales nearly linearly with\nthe eccentricity of the system. We find that for the eccentricities explored in\nthis work, the magnitude of deviations in various quantities such as the merger\namplitude and peak luminosity can approach $\\sim5\\%$ of their quasi-circular\nvalue. We use our findings to explain eccentric phenomena reported in other\nstudies. We also show that methods for estimating the remnant mass employed in\nthe effective-one-body approach exhibit similar deviations, roughly matching\nthe amplitude of the oscillations we find in NR simulations. This work is an\nimportant step towards a complete description of eccentric binary black hole\nmergers, and demonstrates the importance of considering the entire\n2-dimensional parameter subspace related to eccentricity.",

Addressing this\ncomplexity requires advanced modeling approaches capable of capturing the\nintricate relationship between loading sequences and fatigue lifetime.\nTraditional fatigue simulations are computationally prohibitive, necessitating\nmore efficient methods. This study highlights the potential of physics-based\nmachine learning ($\\phi$ML) to predict the fatigue lifetime of materials.\nSpecifically, a FFNN is designed to embed physical constraints from\nexperimental evidence directly into its architecture to enhance prediction\naccuracy. It is trained using numerical simulations generated by a physically\nbased anisotropic continuum damage fatigue model. The model is calibrated and\nvalidated against experimental fatigue data of concrete cylinder specimens\ntested in uniaxial compression. The proposed approach demonstrates superior\naccuracy compared to purely data-driven neural networks, particularly in\nsituations with limited training data, achieving realistic predictions of\ndamage accumulation. Thus, a general algorithm is developed and successfully\napplied to predict fatigue lifetimes under complex loading scenarios with\nmultiple loading ranges.

    "abstract": "The Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC), as the next-generation\nelectron-positron collider, is tasked with advancing not only Higgs physics but\nalso the discovery of new physics. Achieving these goals requires\nhigh-precision measurements of particles. Taichu seires, Monolithic Active\nPixel Sensor (MAPS), a key component of the vertex detector for CEPC was\ndesigned to meet the CEPC's requirements. For the geometry of vertex detector\nis long barrel with no endcap, and current silicon lacks a complete\ndigitization model, precise estimation of cluster size particularly causing by\nparticle with large incident angle is needed. Testbeam results were conducted\nat the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) to evaluate cluster size\ndependence on different incident angles and threshold settings. Experimental\nresults confirmed that cluster size increases with incident angle. Simulations\nusing the Allpix$^2$ framework replicated experimental trends at small angles\nbut exhibited discrepancies at large angles, suggesting limitations in linear\nelectric field assumptions and sensor thickness approximations. The results\nfrom both testbeam and simulations have provided insights into the performance\nof the TaichuPix chip at large incident angles, offering a crucial foundation\nfor the establishment of a digital model and addressing the estimation of\ncluster size in the forward region of the long barrel. Furthermore, it offers\nvaluable references for future iterations of TaichuPix, the development of\ndigital models, and the simulation and estimation of the vertex detector's\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Automotive radar is a key component of sensing suites in autonomous driving\n(AD) and advanced driver-assist systems (ADAS). However, limited line-of-sight\n(LOS) significantly reduces radar efficiency in dense urban environments.\nTherefore, automotive radars need to extend their capabilities beyond LOS by\nlocalizing occluding and reflective surfaces and non-line-of-sight (NLOS)\ntargets. This work addresses the NLOS target localization challenge by\nrevisiting the NLOS radar signal propagation model and introducing a hybrid\nlocalization approach. The proposed approach first detects and localizes\nreflective surfaces, then identifies the LOS/NLOS propagation conditions, and\nfinally localizes the target without prior scene knowledge, without using\nDoppler information, and without any auxiliary sensors. The proposed hybrid\napproach addresses the computational complexity challenge by integrating a\nphysical radar electromagnetic wave propagation model with a deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) to estimate occluding surface parameters. The efficiency of the\nproposed approach to localize the NLOS targets and to identify the NLOS/LOS\npropagation conditions is evaluated via simulations in a broad range of\nrealistic automotive scenarios. Extending automotive radar sensing beyond LOS\nis expected to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous and\nADAS-equipped vehicles.",

We conducted\ntwo-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests to investigate two distinct aspects:\nsimilarities in paired G1, G2 distributions across different taxa and\nwavelength dependency within the same taxa. When comparing different taxa, we\ncouldn't reject the null hypothesis for 11% of the orange sample and 31% of the\ncyan sample, indicating more disparities in the orange filter. For wavelength\ndependency, paired distributions of G1, G2 (o) vs. G1, G2 (c) showed\nstatistically significant differences across all complexes, except for the A\nclass. Our analysis suggests that while phase coloring behaviors are observed\nwithout a clear preference for reddening or bluening at phase angles below 5\ndegrees, reddening predominates in the 10 - 30 degrees range. We also observed\nsmaller uncertainties in G2 than in G1. Simulations showed that G2 is less\nsensitive to lack of data at small phase angles.

First, Swift\nJ1727.8--1613 was in the transition process from the hard intermediate state\n(HIMS) to the very high state (VHS) during the first flaring period (MJD\n60197--60204), and afterwards it exhibited typical VHS parameter\ncharacteristics, such as high temperature of the disk inner radius and a steep\npower-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.6. Second, the flares in the VHS\nare characterized by a rapid increase in the flux of accretion disk,\naccompanied by a simultaneous rapid expansion of the inner radius, which could\nbe apparent if the accretion disk hardening factor varies significantly. The\nstrong power-law component during the VHS is likely produced by synchrotron\nself-Compton process in the relativistic jets, in agreement with the observed\nweak reflection component and lack of correlation with the disk component.",

Our results are classified in 1D massless\nand massive cases, 3D general and $n$ dimensional in generality. In the 1D\nmassless case we prove that any globally defined solution converges to zero as\ntime tends to infinity, within a spatial region expanding at a rate\nproportional to $ t \\log^{-2} t$. This result holds without assumptions on the\nsmallness of initial data or specific power of nonlinearity, ruling out the\nexistence of standing breather-like or solitary wave structures in this regime.\nIn the 1D massive case, solitary waves are known to exist. Introducing new\nvirial identities adapted to the Dirac's distinctive algebra, we prove that\nthere are ``holomorphic'' odd nonlinearities under which globally defined small\nodd solutions decay to zero on spatial compact sets as time tends to infinity.\nThis result is extended to the 3D case under boundedness of the $H^1$ norm but\nwithout requiring the parity condition on the data, giving decay proofs for an\nimportant class of nonlinear Dirac models, and opening the door to the future\nuse of virial identities to prove asymptotic stability of well-chosen Dirac\nsolitary waves.\n  Finally, in higher dimensions $ n \\geq 1$, we prove the $L^2$ decay for\nglobal solutions of nonlinear Dirac equations in the ``exterior light-cone''\nregion. This confirms the non-existence of breathers and other solutions\npropagating faster than the speed of light. Our proofs rely on carefully\nconstructed weighted virial identities.",

Photovoltaic cells can convert light energy into electrical energy to\npower sensing devices, but their power may not be sufficient to ensure\nenergy-free sensing due to the varying power needs of sensors and high\ncomputational demands. In this paper, we propose the use of photovoltaic cells\nas a standalone sensor for the recognition of different contexts, including\nuser identification, step counting, and location tracking. The system utilizes\nthe photocurrent readings generated by the photovoltaic cells to capture the\nunique mobility patterns of different users. By analyzing these patterns, the\nsystem can accurately identify the user, count the number of steps taken, and\ntrack the user's location. We propose a computationally efficient DTW to match\nthe variable length sequences of photocurrent readings to a database of known\npatterns and identify the closest subject and location matches. The system was\nrigorously evaluated in a realistic environment, and the results indicate that\nit can accurately estimate step count, identify subjects, and localize them\nwith an accuracy of 88%, 90%, and 43cm, respectively.

One of the key\nchallenges for NV-based quantum applications is building an accurate model to\npredict its decoherence properties and their quantum nature. In this study, we\ncombine theory and experiment to investigate NV decoherence dynamics in the\npresence of nitrogen donor (P1 center) baths, which is one of the dominant\ndecoherence sources in diamond. We employ a cluster-correlation expansion (CCE)\nmethod to compute the NV decoherence under the Hahn-echo (HE) and\nCarr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequences at various P1 concentrations\nfrom 1ppm to 300 ppm. We show that the coherence time (T2) increases with the\nnumber of pi pulses applied, indicating that the NV spin is decoupled from the\nP1 bath. Notably, we find that T2 scales quadratically as a function of the\npulse number, on a logarithmic scale, as opposed to the linear scaling\npredicted by widely accepted semi-classical theories in the literature. In our\nexperiment, we measure the CPMG signal for two diamond samples with high P1\nconcentrations of 0.8ppm and 13ppm. We demonstrate that the T2 scaling is\nindeed quadratic, thus confirming our theoretical predictions. Our results show\nthat the quantum bath model combined with the CCE method can accurately capture\nthe quantum nature of the P1-driven NV decoherence.

Recent research has highlighted the potential of\ndata-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots.\nHowever, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality\nor excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture\nis also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and\nremains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level\nmethod is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D)\nGaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster\nthe 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are\ncontrolled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural\nnetwork. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data\npairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without\ndepth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles,\nwe can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology,\nkinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images\nfrom different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting.

    "abstract": "Fluid antenna system (FAS) is an emerging technology that uses the new form\nof shape- and position-reconfigurable antennas to empower the physical layer\nfor wireless communications. Prior studies on FAS were however limited to\nnarrowband channels. Motivated by this, this paper addresses the integration of\nFAS in the fifth generation (5G) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM) framework to address the challenges posed by wideband communications. We\npropose the framework of the wideband FAS OFDM system that includes a novel\nport selection matrix. Then we derive the achievable rate expression and design\nthe adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme based on the rate. Extensive\nlink-level simulation results demonstrate striking improvements of FAS in the\nwideband channels, underscoring the potential of FAS in future wireless\ncommunications.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Attentive VLM Agent (AVA), a multimodal StarCraft II agent that\naligns artificial agent perception with the human gameplay experience.\nTraditional frameworks such as SMAC rely on abstract state representations that\ndiverge significantly from human perception, limiting the ecological validity\nof agent behavior. Our agent addresses this limitation by incorporating RGB\nvisual inputs and natural language observations that more closely simulate\nhuman cognitive processes during gameplay. The AVA architecture consists of\nthree integrated components: (1) a vision-language model enhanced with\nspecialized self-attention mechanisms for strategic unit targeting and\nbattlefield assessment, (2) a retrieval-augmented generation system that\nleverages domain-specific StarCraft II knowledge to inform tactical decisions,\nand (3) a dynamic role-based task distribution system that enables coordinated\nmulti-agent behavior. The experimental evaluation in our proposed AVACraft\nenvironment, which contains 21 multimodal StarCraft II scenarios, demonstrates\nthat AVA powered by foundation models (specifically Qwen-VL and GPT-4o) can\nexecute complex tactical maneuvers without explicit training, achieving\ncomparable performance to traditional MARL methods that require substantial\ntraining iterations. This work establishes a foundation for developing\nhuman-aligned StarCraft II agents and advances the broader research agenda of\nmultimodal game AI. Our implementation is available at\nhttps://github.com/camel-ai/VLM-Play-StarCraft2.",

We evaluate three approaches: (1) doubling transmission links\n(bridges) between different communities, (2) adding bypasses around weakly\nsynchronized nodes, and (3) reinforcing edges that trigger the largest cascade\nfailures. We use two different models of the Hungarian high-voltage network.\nThese models are built from the official data provided by the transmission\nsystem operator, thus eliminating the assumptions typically used in other\nstudies. The coupling strength distribution of the Hungarian models shows good\nagreement with our previous works using the European and North American grids.\n  Additionally, we examine the occurrence of Braess' paradox, where added\ntransmission capacity unexpectedly reduces overall stability. Our results show\nthat reinforcement through community-based bridge duplication yields the most\nsignificant improvements across all parameters. A visual comparison highlights\ndifferences between this method and traditional reinforcement approaches. To\nthe authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantitatively compare\nresults of oscillator-based studies with those relying on power system analysis\nsoftware.\n  Characteristic results of line-cut simulations reveal cascade size\ndistributions with fat-tailed decays for medium coupling strengths, while\nexponential behavior emerges for small and large couplings. The observed\nexponents are reminiscent of the continuously changing exponents due to\nGriffiths effects near a hybrid type of phase transition.",

To formally provide provable guarantees, we introduce a novel concept of\ndistance-based indistinguishability, which can facilitate users to comfortably\nrelax their security requirements. We then design Femur, an efficient framework\nto securely query public key-value stores with flexible security and\nperformance trade-offs. It uses a space-efficient learned index to convert\nquery keys into storage locations, obfuscates these locations with extra noise\nprovably derived by the distance-based indistinguishability theory, and sends\nthe expanded range to the server. The server then adaptively utilizes the best\nscheme to retrieve data. We also propose a novel variable-range PIR scheme\noptimized for bandwidth-constrained environments. Experiments show that Femur\noutperforms the state-of-the-art designs even when ensuring the same full\nsecurity level. When users are willing to relax their privacy requirements,\nFemur can further improve the performance gains to up to 163.9X, demonstrating\nan effective trade-off between security and performance.",

Perovskite\nrare-earth nickelates are largely studied for their temperature-driven MIT\nwhich is accompanied by a breathing mode distortion, and associated to a\nbond-disproportionation of the expanded (3d8L0) and compressed (3d8L2) NiO6\noctahedra. Steric effects control the onset temperature of the MIT, the latter\nbeing concomitant or not with a complex antiferromagnetic spin arrangement\ndepending upon the choice of the rare earth ion (TMIT>TNeel). Interface\nengineering of oxygen octahedra tilting, as imposed by the symmetry and\norientation of the substrate, has resulted in an efficient pathway to modify\nboth TMIT and TNeel, hence, suggesting a key role of the electron-phonon\ncoupling for both transport and magnetic properties in nickelate thin films.\nHere, via a combination of resonant elastic X-ray scattering and transport\nexperiments, we show a control over both TMIT and TNeel in heteroepitaxial\nPZT(d)/NNO(7 nm)//STO heterostructures, which are characterized by different\nstrains and polarization states of the PZT layer grown at different thicknesses\nd. We found the expected NNO bulk behaviour, for a fully relaxed PZT layer\nshowing a monodomain polarization state. On the other side, an almost 30 K\ndifference, is found for a fully strained PZT characterized by a multidomain\ntexture of the polarization state. We discuss our results in terms of an\naltered breathing distortion pattern of the underlying nickelate layer as\nsupported by X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements. We infer that locally\ndifferent polar distortions controlled by a combination of polarization\ndirection and strength of the strain state play the main role in the observed\nTMIT and TNeel variations.",

These models are not rare but encompass Toric Codes across arbitrary\ndimensions and subsume the X-cube fracton code as special cases. Featuring a\nhierarchical structure of generalized entanglement renormalization group, many\nTetra-Digit models host spatially extended excitations (e.g., loops, membranes,\nand exotic non-manifold objects) with constrained mobility and deformability,\nand exhibit system-size-dependent ground state degeneracies that scale\nexponentially with a polynomial in linear sizes. In this work, we first\ngraphically and algebraically demonstrate quantum circuits for computational\nbasis states, before generalizing to broader cases. Central to this framework\nis a key ingredient termed the \\emph{seed-entangler} acting on a small number\nof qubits termed \\textit{seeds}, enabling a systematic scheme to achieve\narbitrary code states. Remarkably, the number of available seeds equals the\nnumber of logical qubits for the constructed examples, which leaves plenty of\nroom for future investigation in theoretical physics, mathematics and quantum\ninformation science. With experimental feasibility via synthetic dimensions in\nmodern quantum simulators, this framework transcends spatial dimensions,\nbridges liquid and non-liquid states, unifies gapped phases governed by\ndistinct entanglement renormalization group schemes, and offers a pathway\ntoward engineering topological phases and manipulating logical qubits.",

They carry unique information on the materials and the physical\nprocesses which led to the presence of planets and moons. Many important\nquestions about cometary physics, such as origin, constituents and mechanism of\ncometary activity, remain unanswered. The next perihelion of comet 1P/Halley,\nin 2061, is an excellent opportunity to revisit this object of outstanding\nscientific and cultural relevance. In 1986, during its latest approach to the\nSun, several flyby targeted Halley's comet to observe its nucleus and shed\nlight on its properties, origin, and evolution. However, due to its retrograde\norbit and high ecliptic inclination, the quality of data was limited by the\nlarge relative velocity and short time spent by the spacecraft inside the coma\nof the comet. A rendezvous mission like ESA/Rosetta would overcome such\nlimitations, but the trajectory design is extremely challenging due to the\nshortcomings of current propulsion technology. Given the considerable lead\ntimes of spacecraft development and the long duration of the interplanetary\ntransfer required to reach the comet, it is imperative to start mission\nplanning several decades in advance. This study presents a low-thrust\nrendezvous strategy to reach the comet before the phase of intense activity\nduring the close approach to the Sun. The trajectory design combines a\ngravity-assist maneuver with electric propulsion arcs to maximize scientific\npayload mass while constraining transfer duration. A propulsive plane change\nmaneuver would be prohibitive. To keep the propellant budget within reasonable\nlimits, most of the plane change maneuver is achieved via either a Jupiter or a\nSaturn flyby. The interplanetary low-thrust gravity-assisted trajectory design\nstrategy is described, followed by the presentation of multiple\nproof-of-concept solutions.",

    "abstract": "Thin-film inspection on large-area substrates in coating manufacture remains\na critical parameter to ensure product quality; however, extending the\ninspection process precisely over a large area presents major challenges, due\nto the limitations of the available inspection equipment. An additional\nmanipulation problem arises when automating the inspection process, as the\nsilicon wafer requires movement constraints to ensure accurate measurements and\nto prevent damage. Furthermore, there are other increasingly important\nlarge-area industrial applications, such as Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing\nwhere coating thickness inspection introduces additional challenges. This paper\npresents an autonomous inspection system using a robotic manipulator with a\nnovel learned constraint manifold to control a wafer to its calibration point,\nand a novel multi-sensor array with high potential for scalability into large\nsubstrate areas. We demonstrate that the manipulator can perform required\nmotions whilst adhering to movement constraints. We further demonstrate that\nthe sensor array can perform thickness measurements statically with an error of\n$<2\\%$ compared to a commercial reflectometer, and through the use of a\nmanipulator can dynamically detect angle variations $>0.5^\\circ$ from the\ncalibration point whilst monitoring the RMSE and $R^2$ over 1406 data points.\nThese features are potentially useful for detecting displacement variations in\nR2R manufacturing processes.",

Although individual universality classes have been extensively\nstudied, the theoretical framework for scaling crossovers between distinct\ndynamical regimes remains underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a\nphenomenological approach to describe dynamic scaling crossovers in\nreaction-diffusion systems, utilizing a Bernoulli differential equation with\ntime-dependent reaction coefficients. Under a new scaling hypothesis for\nspatial fluctuations, we analytically derive five universal power-law crossover\nfunctions. These solutions accurately describe experimental observations of\nabsorbing phase transitions in turbulent liquid crystals and reaction-diffusion\ncrossovers in exciton-exciton recombination, revealing possible mechanisms\nassociated with many-body correlations and two-component dynamics.

A molecular\nmotor is characterized by a set of low energy states that differ in their\nconfiguration, i.e. position or rotation. In biology and Feringa-type motors,\nunidirectional motion is driven by excitation of the molecule into a\nhigh-energy transitional state followed by a directional relaxation back to a\nlow-energy state. Directionality is created by a steric hindrance for movement\nalong one of the directions on the path from the excited state back to a low\nenergy state. Here, we showcase a principle mechanism for the generation of\nunidirectional rotation of a molecule without the need of steric hindrance and\ntransitional excited states. The chemical design of the molecule consisting of\na platform, upright axle and chiral rotor moiety enables a rotation mechanism\nthat relies on the transfer of orbital angular momentum from the driving\ncurrent to the rotor. The transfer is mediated via orbital currents that are\ncarried by helical orbitals in the axle.",

Here, we study the impact of coherent errors and their mitigation\nunder standard error-reduction techniques, both theoretically and\nexperimentally on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a representative case\nstudy, we implement a range of Grover's algorithm circuits containing up to 10\nqubits and 26 two-qubit gates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of randomized\ncompiling (RC) and algorithm error detection (ED), where the latter is realized\nvia post-selection on ancillary qubits that ideally return to the ground state\nat the end of each circuit. Our results highlight a synergetic effect:\ncombining RC and ED yields the largest reductions in errors, indicating that\nthese methods can work together to extend the capabilities of near-term quantum\ndevices for moderately deep circuits.",

The BS is\nperforming the task of detecting an AGV while managing downlink transmission of\nultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) data in a time-sharing manner.\nScheduling fixed time slots for both sensing and communication is inefficient\nfor the InF environment, as the instantaneous environmental changes necessitate\na higher frequency of sensing operations to accurately detect the AGV. To\naddress this issue, we propose an environment-aware scheduling scheme, in which\nwe first formulate an optimization problem to maximize the probability of\ndetection of AGV while considering the survival time constraint of URLLC data.\nSubsequently, utilizing the Nash bargaining theory, we propose an adaptive\ntime-sharing scheme that assigns sensing duration in accordance with the\nenvironmental clutter density and distributes time to URLLC depending on the\nincoming traffic rate. Using our own Python-based discrete-event link-level\nsimulator, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme over the\nbaseline scheme in terms of probability of detection and downlink latency.",

In this work, a new method for estimating the tortuosity of\nporous electrodes is proposed based on radical tessellation, and the results\nagree well with those calculated by empirical formulas and finite element\nsimulations. Compared with empirical formulas, the proposed method can estimate\ntortuosity for more complicated microstructures, regardless of particle\ndistribution and size dispersity; compared with finite element simulations, the\nproposed method offers a significant advantage in computational efficiency.\nBased on the method, the influence of different microstructure characters on\nthe tortuosity is discussed. It is found that in addition to the porosity, the\nparticle size and particle aggregation morphology are all critical in\ninfluencing the tortuosity of the porous electrode. Finally, the tortuosity\nobtained by this method is integrated into the Pseudo-2-dimensional (P2D) model\nfor the calculation of effective properties, and the results show that this\nmethod offers an efficient way in improving the prediction accuracy of P2D\nmodels.",

This is a problem when studying solar flares with\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as they generally use input images of a\nfixed size. Different processes can be performed to retrieve a database with\nhomogeneous-sized data, such as resizing. Unfortunately, key features can be\nlost or distorted during these processes. This can lead to a deterioration of\nthe ability of CNNs to classify flares of different soft X-ray classes,\nespecially those from ARs with complex structures. Our work aims to implement\nand test a CNN architecture that retains the full features of the original\nresolution of the input images. We compare the performance of two CNN\narchitectures for solar flare prediction: the first is a traditional CNN with\nresized input whereas the other implements a spatial pyramid pooling (SPP)\nlayer without any input resizing. Both are trained on the Spaceweather HMI\nActive Region Patch line-of-sight magnetogram database. We also study two cases\nof binary classification. In the first case, our model distinguishes ARs\nproducing flares in less than 24h of class greater or equal to C1.0 from ARs\nproducing flares in more than 24h or never; in the second case, it\ndistinguishes ARs producing flares in less than 24h of class greater or equal\nto M1.0 from the other ARs. Our models implementing an SPP layer outperform the\ntraditional CNN models when predicting flares greater or equal to C1.0 within\n24h. However, their performances degrade sharply along the other models studied\nin this paper, when trained to classify images greater or equal to M1.0 flares.\nThe degradation in SPP models when classifying only images greater or equal to\nM1.0 flares as positive may be attributed to its success in identifying\nfeatures that appear in ARs a few hours before the flare, independently of\ntheir soft X-ray class.",

Thus, we propose an approach based\non causal inference to quantify the research impact of a specific technical\ntopic.

First, we identify papers of a specific\ntechnical topic using keywords or category tags from Microsoft Academic Graph,\nwhich is one of the largest academic publication dataset. Next, we build a\npaper citation network between each technical field. Then, we aggregate the\ncross-field citation count for each research field.

Evaluation results show that deep learning\nsignificantly affects computer vision and natural language processing.

    "abstract": "This paper explores the use of partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) for\nencrypted vector similarity search, with a focus on facial recognition and\nbroader applications like reverse image search, recommendation engines, and\nlarge language models (LLMs). While fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) exists,\nwe demonstrate that encrypted cosine similarity can be computed using PHE,\noffering a more practical alternative. Since PHE does not directly support\ncosine similarity, we propose a method that normalizes vectors in advance,\nenabling dot product calculations as a proxy. We also apply min-max\nnormalization to handle negative dimension values.\n  Experiments on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset use DeepFace's\nFaceNet128d, FaceNet512d, and VGG-Face (4096d) models in a two-tower setup.\nPre-encrypted embeddings are stored in one tower, while an edge device captures\nimages, computes embeddings, and performs encrypted-plaintext dot products via\nadditively homomorphic encryption. We implement this with LightPHE, evaluating\nPaillier, Damgard-Jurik, and Okamoto-Uchiyama schemes, excluding others due to\nperformance or decryption complexity. Tests at 80-bit and 112-bit security\n(NIST-secure until 2030) compare PHE against FHE (via TenSEAL), analyzing\nencryption, decryption, operation time, cosine similarity loss, key/ciphertext\nsizes.\n  Results show PHE is less computationally intensive, faster, and produces\nsmaller ciphertexts/keys, making it well-suited for memory-constrained\nenvironments and real-world privacy-preserving encrypted similarity search.",

However, the role\nof 3D encoders with respect to other modalities remains unexplored.\nFurthermore, existing 3D foundation models that leverage large datasets are\ntypically trained with explicit alignment objectives with respect to frozen\nencoders from other representations. In this work, we investigate the\npossibility of a posteriori alignment of representations obtained from\nuni-modal 3D encoders compared to text-based feature spaces. We show that naive\npost-training feature alignment of uni-modal text and 3D encoders results in\nlimited performance. We then focus on extracting subspaces of the corresponding\nfeature spaces and discover that by projecting learned representations onto\nwell-chosen lower-dimensional subspaces the quality of alignment becomes\nsignificantly higher, leading to improved accuracy on matching and retrieval\ntasks. Our analysis further sheds light on the nature of these shared\nsubspaces, which roughly separate between semantic and geometric data\nrepresentations. Overall, ours is the first work that helps to establish a\nbaseline for post-training alignment of 3D uni-modal and text feature spaces,\nand helps to highlight both the shared and unique properties of 3D data\ncompared to other representations.

This results in a stiff system of ordinary differential equations,\nwhere the stiffness is mainly caused by a small region of the spatial mesh.\nWhen using explicit time-integration schemes, the time step size is severely\nrestricted by a few spatial elements, leading to a loss of efficiency. As a\nremedy, we propose and analyze a general leapfrog-based scheme which is\nmotivated by [5]. The new, fully explicit, local time-integration method\nfilters the stiff part of the system in such a way that its CFL condition is\nsignificantly weaker than that of the leapfrog scheme while its computational\ncost is only slightly larger. For this scheme, the filter function is a\nsuitably scaled and shifted Chebyshev polynomial. While our main interest is in\nexplicit local-time stepping schemes, the filter functions can be much more\ngeneral, for instance, a certain rational function leads to the locally\nimplicit method, proposed and analyzed in [24].

It can be stored in large quantities, decoupling\nrenewable energy generation from its use, and is therefore considered essential\nfor achieving a climate-neutral economy. The intermittency of renewable energy\ngeneration and the stochastic nature of demand are, however, challenging\nfactors for the dynamic planning of hydrogen storage and transportation. This\nholds particularly in the early-adoption phase when hydrogen distribution\noccurs through vehicle-based networks. We therefore address the Dynamic\nInventory Routing Problem (DIRP) under stochastic supply and demand with direct\ndeliveries for the vehicle-based distribution of hydrogen. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework that\nintegrates constraints into the learning process and incorporates parameterized\npost-decision state value predictions. Additionally, we introduce\nLookahead-based CRL (LCRL), which improves decision-making over a multi-period\nhorizon to enhance short-term planning while maintaining the value predictions.\nOur computational experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CRL and LCRL across\ndiverse instances. Our learning methods provide near-optimal solutions on small\nscale instances that are solved via value iteration. Furthermore, both methods\noutperform typical deep learning approaches such as Proximal Policy\nOptimization, as well as classical inventory heuristics, such as\n(s,S)-policy-based and Power-of-Two-based heuristics. Furthermore, LCRL\nachieves a 10% improvement over CRL on average, albeit with higher\ncomputational requirements. Analyses of optimal replenishment policies reveal\nthat accounting for stochastic supply and demand influences these policies,\nshowing the importance of our addition to the DIRP.",

    "abstract": "Building on a beyond-GW many-body framework that incorporates higher-order\nvertex effects in the self-energy -- giving rise to T-matrix and second-order\nexchange contributions -- this approach is extended to now include the vertex\nderived in that work to the kernel in the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) for the\nreducible polarization function. This results in a frequency-dependent\ninteraction kernel that naturally captures random phase approximation (RPA)\neffects, dynamical excitonic interactions, and the correlated propagation of\nmultiple correlated electron-hole pairs that model multi- (including bi- and\ntri-) excitonic effects, relevant for nonlinear optics and high harmonic\ngeneration. These processes emerge from including the functional derivatives of\nthe screening and vertex with respect to the Green's function in the vertex,\nenabling a fully abinitio, time-dependent treatment of correlation effects. By\nfocusing on the reducible rather than irreducible polarization function, this\napproach provides a computationally viable framework for capturing complex\nmany-body interactions for calculating the self-energy, optical spectra and\nEELS. The resulting interaction kernel is relatively straightforward, clearly\ndelineates the physical processes that are included and omitted, and has the\nsame dimensionality as the conventional BSE kernel used in standard many-body\ntheory implementations, but is now itself frequency dependent. The method is\nexpected to facilitate the integration of advanced many-body effects into\nstate-of-the-art software packages, offering a universal and highly accurate\nframework for the description of sub-atomic correlations. Such advancements are\ncrucial for the development of semiconductor, optoelectronic, superconducting\nand antimatter technologies, and ensuring that theoretical modeling evolves\nalongside exascale and accelerated computing.",

Most of the cluster members detected in HI show significant\nsigns of interaction with the intra-cluster medium or other galaxies. The\ngalaxy ESO 358-60 however stands out as its large HI disk appears regular and\nundisturbed. A possible explanation for this undisturbed disk is that the\ngalaxy is not in Fornax.\n  We analyze the HI distribution within and around ESO 358-60 based on the MFS\nobservations. We visually inspect the low resolution data in order to study the\nHI disk from the center to its outskirts and look for low column density gas\nthat could reveal recent interactions. We then construct a detailed\nparameterization of the HI disk by fitting a tilted ring model to the high\nresolution data cube. We use the fitted rotational velocity to place the galaxy\non the baryonic Tully-Fisher relationship. By equating the galaxy's HI and 3.6\n$\\mu$m fluxes to the thus retrieved baryonic mass, we obtain a redshift\nindependent distance.\n  Our modeling confirms the regularity of the HI disk in ESO 358-60 but also\nshows that the galaxy contains a significant line of sight warp and contains\nradial motions, of the order of 10 km s$^{-1}$, that cover the extent of the\noptical disk. From the modeling we obtain a velocity V$_{\\rm flat} = $48.1\n$\\pm$ 1.4 km s$^{-1}$ for the best fit rotation curve. This leads to a distance\nfrom the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation of 9.4 $\\pm$ 2.5 Mpc,$\\sim$ 10 Mpc less\nthan the distance to the Fornax cluster. This distance not only fits better\nwith V$_{\\rm flat}$ but also with the overall HI distribution of low mass\ngalaxies and the fact that the galaxy appears undisturbed and reasonably\nsymmetric. At 9.4 Mpc ESO 358-60 cannot be a member of the Fornax cluster but\nis a foreground field galaxy.",

    "abstract": "While previous multimodal slow-thinking methods have demonstrated remarkable\nsuccess in single-image understanding scenarios, their effectiveness becomes\nfundamentally constrained when extended to more complex multi-image\ncomprehension tasks. This limitation stems from their predominant reliance on\ntext-based intermediate reasoning processes. While for human, when engaging in\nsophisticated multi-image analysis, they typically perform two complementary\ncognitive operations: (1) continuous cross-image visual comparison through\nregion-of-interest matching, and (2) dynamic memorization of critical visual\nconcepts throughout the reasoning chain. Motivated by these observations, we\npropose the Complex Multi-Modal Chain-of-Thought (CMMCoT) framework, a\nmulti-step reasoning framework that mimics human-like \"slow thinking\" for\nmulti-image understanding. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: 1.\nThe construction of interleaved multimodal multi-step reasoning chains, which\nutilize critical visual region tokens, extracted from intermediate reasoning\nsteps, as supervisory signals. This mechanism not only facilitates\ncomprehensive cross-modal understanding but also enhances model\ninterpretability. 2. The introduction of a test-time memory augmentation module\nthat expands the model reasoning capacity during inference while preserving\nparameter efficiency. Furthermore, to facilitate research in this direction, we\nhave curated a novel multi-image slow-thinking dataset. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our model.",

In quantum memories and\ncommunication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors\noften dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example,\nexhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components.

Anticipating instances\noutside their training scope, learning-enabled systems are often equipped with\nout-of-distribution (OOD) detectors that alert when a trained system encounters\na state it does not recognize or in which it exhibits uncertainty. There exists\nlimited work conducted on the problem of OOD detection within RL, with prior\nstudies being unable to achieve a consensus on the definition of OOD execution\nwithin the context of RL. By framing our problem using a Markov Decision\nProcess, we assume there is a transition distribution mapping each state-action\npair to another state with some probability. Based on this, we consider the\nfollowing definition of OOD execution within RL: A transition is OOD if its\nprobability during real-life deployment differs from the transition\ndistribution encountered during training. As such, we utilize conditional\nvariational autoencoders (CVAE) to approximate the transition dynamics of the\ntraining environment and implement a conformity-based detector using\nreconstruction loss that is able to guarantee OOD detection with a\npre-determined confidence level. We evaluate our detector by adapting existing\nbenchmarks and compare it with existing OOD detection models for RL.",

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful tool for\ndecision-making in robotics, enabling efficient exploration of large search\nspaces. However, traditional MCTS methods struggle in environments\ncharacterized by high uncertainty and noisy data due to their reliance on\nfinal-step reward evaluation. The lack of intermediate feedback during search\noften results in suboptimal decision-making and computational inefficiencies.\n  This paper introduces Reward-Centered ReST-MCTS, a novel framework that\nenhances MCTS by incorporating intermediate reward shaping. The core of our\napproach is the Rewarding Center, which refines search trajectories by\ndynamically assigning partial rewards using rule-based validation, heuristic\nguidance, and neural estimation. By integrating these mechanisms, our method\nenables real-time optimization of search paths, mitigating the effects of error\npropagation.\n  We evaluate Reward-Centered ReST-MCTS in robotic manipulation tasks under\nhigh uncertainty, demonstrating consistent improvements in decision accuracy.\nCompared to baseline methods, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and\nVanilla ReST-MCTS, our framework achieves a 2-4% accuracy improvement while\nmaintaining computational feasibility. Ablation studies confirm the\neffectiveness of intermediate feedback in search refinement, particularly in\npruning incorrect decision paths early. Furthermore, robustness tests show that\nour method retains high performance across varying levels of uncertainty.",

A more natural\napproach may be a regression model on RMST using pseudo-observations, which\nallows for a direct estimation without modeling the survival function. Only a\nfew Bayesian methods exist, and each requires a model of the survival function.\nWe developed a new Bayesian method that combines the use of pseudo-observations\nwith the generalized method of moments.

A simulation study was conducted\nwith different time-dependent treatment effects (early, delayed, and crossing\nsurvival) and covariate effects, showing that our approach provides valid\nresults, aligns with existing methods, and shows improved precision after\ncovariate adjustment. For illustration, we applied our approach to a phase III\ntrial in prostate cancer, providing estimates of the treatment effect on RMST,\ncomparable to existing methods.

Model\nediting has emerged as a prominent approach for updating LLMs' knowledge with\nminimal computational costs and parameter changes. This approach typically\nidentifies and adjusts specific model parameters associated with newly acquired\nknowledge. However, existing methods often underestimate the adverse effects\nthat parameter modifications can have on broadly distributed knowledge. More\ncritically, post-edit LLMs frequently struggle with multi-hop reasoning and\ncontinuous knowledge updates. Although various studies have discussed these\nshortcomings, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we\nprovide an evaluation of ten model editing methods along four dimensions:\nreliability, generalization, locality, and portability. Results confirm that\nall ten popular model editing methods show significant shortcomings across\nmultiple dimensions, suggesting model editing is less promising. We then\npropose a straightforward method called Selective Contextual Reasoning (SCR),\nfor knowledge updating. SCR does not modify model parameters but harnesses\nLLM's inherent contextual reasoning capabilities utilizing the updated\nknowledge pieces. Under SCR, an LLM first assesses whether an incoming query\nfalls within the scope of an external knowledge base. If it does, the relevant\nexternal knowledge texts are contextualized to enhance reasoning; otherwise,\nthe query is answered directly.

    "abstract": "Verbal communication transmits information across diverse linguistic levels,\nwith neural synchronization (NS) between speakers and listeners emerging as a\nputative mechanism underlying successful exchange. However, the specific speech\nfeatures driving this synchronization and how language-specific versus\nuniversal characteristics facilitate information transfer remain poorly\nunderstood. We developed a novel content-based interbrain encoding model to\ndisentangle the contributions of acoustic and linguistic features to\nspeaker-listener NS during Mandarin storytelling and listening, as measured via\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG). Results revealed robust NS throughout\nfrontotemporal-parietal networks with systematic time lags between speech\nproduction and perception. Crucially, suprasegmental lexical tone features\n(tone categories, pitch height, and pitch contour), essential for lexical\nmeaning in Mandarin, contributed more significantly to NS than either acoustic\nelements or universal segmental units (consonants and vowels). These tonal\nfeatures generated distinctive spatiotemporal NS patterns, creating\nlanguage-specific neural \"communication channels\" that facilitated efficient\nrepresentation sharing between interlocutors. Furthermore, the strength and\npatterns of NS driven by these language-specific features predicted\ncommunication success. These findings demonstrate the neural mechanisms\nunderlying shared representations during verbal exchange and highlight how\nlanguage-specific features can shape neural coupling to optimize information\ntransfer during human communication.",

Therefore, a main challenge is\ndetermining how to integrate graph data, which contains structural and spatial\ninformation about molecules, with text data. In addition, simply using both 1D\nSMILES text and 2D graph as inputs without addressing how they align and\nrepresent the molecule structure in different modalities makes it challenging\nto fully utilize structural knowledge about molecules. To this end, we propose\nGraphT5, a multi-modal framework that integrates 1D SMILES text and 2D graph\nrepresentations of molecules for molecular language modeling. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel cross-token attention module in GraphT5 to bridge the gap\narising from the fundamental differences between the two modalities of molecule\nrepresentations. Cross-token attention exploits implicit information between\nSMILES and graphs of molecules, resulting from their interactions at a\nfine-grained token level that benefits molecular language modeling.

However, offline\nreinforcement learning suffers challenges due to the distributional shift\nbetween the learned and behavior policies, leading to errors when computing\nQ-values for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To mitigate this issue, policy\nconstraint methods aim to constrain the learned policy's distribution with the\ndistribution of the behavior policy or confine action selection within the\nsupport of the behavior policy. However, current policy constraint methods tend\nto exhibit excessive conservatism, hindering the policy from further surpassing\nthe behavior policy's performance. In this work, we present Only Support\nConstraint (OSC) which is derived from maximizing the total probability of\nlearned policy in the support of behavior policy, to address the conservatism\nof policy constraint. OSC presents a regularization term that only restricts\npolicies to the support without imposing extra constraints on actions within\nthe support. Additionally, to fully harness the performance of the new policy\nconstraints, OSC utilizes a diffusion model to effectively characterize the\nsupport of behavior policies. Experimental evaluations across a variety of\noffline RL benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly enhances performance,\nalleviating the challenges associated with distributional shifts and mitigating\nconservatism of policy constraints.

The magnetic\nfield morphology is highly ordered in all three dense regions. The plane-of-sky\nmagnetic field strengths are {\\sim}1 mG for the 20MC and the 50MC, and {\\sim}2\nmG for the CND.

Advanced\nmulti-connectivity (MC) millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks are now available to\ntransmit hologram videos by providing the necessary bandwidth. However, the\nexisting link selection schemes in MC-based mmWave networks neglect the source\ncontent characteristics of hologram videos and the coordination among the\nparameters of different protocol layers in each link, leading to sub-optimal\nstreaming performance. To address this issue, we propose a\ncross-layer-optimized link selection scheme for hologram video streaming over\nmmWave networks.

In 2D perovskites, excitons are the dominant\nphotogenerated species and their energetic structure plays a pivotal role,\ngoverning photon absorption and emission processes. In these materials, dark\nexciton states can undergo photoluminescence due to the relaxation of selection\nrules and this process can be modulated by an external magnetic field, enabling\nunambiguous identification of the exciton fine structure. Previous reports of\nmagneto-optical spectroscopy on 2D perovskites have been restricted to the\nmacroscopic response, where key information is lost regarding the microscopic\nheterogeneity of the photoluminescence.

In 2D perovskite thin films, we distinguish\nbetween regions of localised bright and dark exciton populations, correlated to\nthe film morphology.

In this paper, we investigate the use of partially labeled\ndata for label-efficient unpaired multi-modal learning, which can reduce the\nannotation cost by up to one half. We term the new learning paradigm as\nPartially Supervised Unpaired Multi-Modal Learning (PSUMML) and propose a novel\nDecomposed partial class adaptation with snapshot Ensembled Self-Training\n(DEST) framework for it. Specifically, our framework consists of a compact\nsegmentation network with modality specific normalization layers for learning\nwith partially labeled unpaired multi-modal data. The key challenge in PSUMML\nlies in the complex partial class distribution discrepancy due to partial class\nannotation, which hinders effective knowledge transfer across modalities. We\ntheoretically analyze this phenomenon with a decomposition theorem and propose\na decomposed partial class adaptation technique to precisely align the\npartially labeled classes across modalities to reduce the distribution\ndiscrepancy. We further propose a snapshot ensembled self-training technique to\nleverage the valuable snapshot models during training to assign pseudo-labels\nto partially labeled pixels for self-training to boost model performance.

Built from heterologous data of NASDAQ 100 companies,\nFinTMMBench offers three significant advantages. 1) Multi-modal Corpus: It\nencompasses a hybrid of financial tables, news articles, daily stock prices,\nand visual technical charts as the corpus. 2) Temporal-aware Questions: Each\nquestion requires the retrieval and interpretation of its relevant data over a\nspecific time period, including daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual\nperiods. 3) Diverse Financial Analysis Tasks: The questions involve 10\ndifferent financial analysis tasks designed by domain experts, including\ninformation extraction, trend analysis, sentiment analysis and event detection,\netc. We further propose a novel TMMHybridRAG method, which first leverages LLMs\nto convert data from other modalities (e.g., tabular, visual and time-series\ndata) into textual format and then incorporates temporal information in each\nnode when constructing graphs and dense indexes.

    "abstract": "It is known that noble metals such as gold, silver and copper are not\nsupercon- 1 ductors, so as magnesium. This is due to the weakness of the\nelectron-phonon interaction 2 which makes them excellent conductors but not\nsuperconductors. As it has recently been 3 shown for gold, silver and copper,\neven for magnesium it is possible that in very particular 4 situations\nsuperconductivity may occur. Quantum confinement in thin films has been 5\nconsistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting\ncritical 6 temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important\nfundamental question 7 whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce\nobservable superconductivity in non- 8 superconducting metals such as\nmagnesium. We study this problem using a generalization, 9 in the Eliashberg\nframework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under 10\nthin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type\nequations, we 11 find the dependence of the superconducting critical\ntemperature on the film thickness, L. 12 This parameter-free theory predicts\nsuperconductivity in very thin magnesium films. We 13 demonstrate that this is\na fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very 14 precise value,\nclose to half a nanometer.",

Despite recent progress, these tasks\nare often addressed independently, with GS-based rendering methods struggling\nunder diverse light conditions and failing to produce accurate surfaces, while\nGS-based reconstruction methods frequently compromise rendering quality. This\nraises a central question: must rendering and reconstruction always involve a\ntrade-off? To address this, we propose MGSR, a 2D/3D Mutual-boosted Gaussian\nsplatting for Surface Reconstruction that enhances both rendering quality and\n3D reconstruction accuracy. MGSR introduces two branches--one based on 2D-GS\nand the other on 3D-GS. The 2D-GS branch excels in surface reconstruction,\nproviding precise geometry information to the 3D-GS branch. Leveraging this\ngeometry, the 3D-GS branch employs a geometry-guided illumination decomposition\nmodule that captures reflected and transmitted components, enabling realistic\nrendering under varied light conditions. Using the transmitted component as\nsupervision, the 2D-GS branch also achieves high-fidelity surface\nreconstruction. Throughout the optimization process, the 2D-GS and 3D-GS\nbranches undergo alternating optimization, providing mutual supervision. Prior\nto this, each branch completes an independent warm-up phase, with an early\nstopping strategy implemented to reduce computational costs. We evaluate MGSR\non a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, at both object and scene\nlevels, demonstrating strong performance in rendering and surface\nreconstruction.

To address it, this paper proposes an innovative and\nefficient strategy, termed IntSim, that explicitly decouples the driving\nintentions of surrounding actors from their motion planning for realistic and\nefficient safety-critical simulation.

The column\ndensity map shows that NGC4111 and seven other different types of galaxies\nshare a huge HI gas complex. The data also suggest that NGC 4111 is interacting\nwith seven galaxies. Moreover, we identified a rotating gas disk associated\nwith NGC 4111 from the HI complex. Still, the HI disk rotation direction has\ndeviated from its stellar disk about 34.2$^{\\circ}$, indicating that the NGC\n4111 galaxy is undergoing a transition from a spiral galaxy to an S0 galaxy by\nthe tidal interactions. The obtained dark matter-to-stellar mass ratio of\nNGC4111 is 3.1$\\pm$0.7, which is lower than the average value of the Local\nUniverse, implying that the interactions may strip its dark matter. Our results\nsuggest that in a galaxy group environment, tidal interactions have a\nsignificant effect on galaxy features.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has shown strong potential in cancer classification from\nwhole-slide images (WSIs), but the need for extensive expert annotations often\nlimits its success. Annotation-free approaches, such as multiple instance\nlearning (MIL) and self-supervised learning (SSL), have emerged as promising\nalternatives to traditional annotation-based methods. However, conventional SSL\nmethods typically rely on synthetic data augmentations, which may fail to\ncapture the spatial structure critical to histopathology. In this work, we\npropose a spatial context-driven positive pair sampling strategy that enhances\nSSL by leveraging the morphological coherence of spatially adjacent patches\nwithin WSIs. Our method is modular and compatible with established joint\nembedding SSL frameworks, including Barlow Twins, BYOL, VICReg, and DINOv2. We\nevaluate its effectiveness on both slide-level classification using MIL and\npatch-level linear probing. Experiments across four datasets demonstrate\nconsistent performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 5\\% to 10\\%\ncompared to standard augmentation-based sampling. These findings highlight the\nvalue of spatial context in improving representation learning for computational\npathology and provide a biologically meaningful enhancement for pretraining\nmodels in annotation-limited settings.

For such out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs,\nthe model can no longer make valid predictions, and its error is potentially\nunbounded.\n  Testing OOD detection methods on real-world datasets is complicated by the\nambiguity around which inputs are in-distribution (ID) or OOD. We design a\nbenchmark for OOD detection, which includes three novel and easily-visualisable\ntoy examples. These simple examples provide direct and intuitive insight into\nwhether the detector is able to detect (1) linear and (2) non-linear concepts\nand (3) identify thin ID subspaces (needles) within high-dimensional spaces\n(haystacks). We use our benchmark to evaluate the performance of various\nmethods from the literature.\n  Since tactile examples of OOD inputs may benefit OOD detection, we also\nreview several simple methods to synthesise OOD inputs for supervised training.\nWe introduce two improvements, $t$-poking and OOD sample weighting, to make\nsupervised detectors more precise at the ID-OOD boundary.

Prior\nefforts fall short of modeling a long-term sequence with drastic motions,\nfrequent topology changes or interactions with props, and resort to segmenting\nthe whole sequence into groups of frames that are processed independently,\nwhich undermines temporal stability and thereby leads to an unpleasant viewing\nexperience and inefficient storage footprint.

Owing to the\nflexibility of the incrementally evolving representation, our method\noutperforms existing approaches in terms of both per-frame and temporal quality\nmetrics while maintaining fast rendering through its purely explicit\nrepresentation.

We propose viewing\nCAD reconstruction as a specific instance of sparse-view 3D reconstruction to\novercome these limitations. While this reformulation offers a promising\nperspective, existing 3D reconstruction methods typically require natural\nimages and corresponding camera poses as inputs, which introduces two major\nsignificant challenges: (1) modality discrepancy between CAD sketches and\nnatural images, and (2) difficulty of accurate camera pose estimation for CAD\nsketches. To solve these issues, we first transform the CAD sketches into\nrepresentations resembling natural images and extract corresponding masks.\nNext, we manually calculate the camera poses for the orthographic views to\nensure accurate alignment within the 3D coordinate system. Finally, we employ a\ncustomized sparse-view 3D reconstruction method to achieve high-quality\nreconstructions from aligned orthographic views. By leveraging raster CAD\nsketches for self-supervision, our approach eliminates the reliance on vector\nCAD sketches and 3D ground truth.

    "abstract": "Feature caching has emerged as an effective strategy to accelerate diffusion\ntransformer (DiT) sampling through temporal feature reuse. It is a challenging\nproblem since (1) Progressive error accumulation from cached blocks\nsignificantly degrades generation quality, particularly when over 50\\% of\nblocks are cached; (2) Current error compensation approaches neglect dynamic\nperturbation patterns during the caching process, leading to suboptimal error\ncorrection. To solve these problems, we propose the Gradient-Optimized Cache\n(GOC) with two key innovations: (1) Cached Gradient Propagation: A gradient\nqueue dynamically computes the gradient differences between cached and\nrecomputed features. These gradients are weighted and propagated to subsequent\nsteps, directly compensating for the approximation errors introduced by\ncaching. (2) Inflection-Aware Optimization: Through statistical analysis of\nfeature variation patterns, we identify critical inflection points where the\ndenoising trajectory changes direction. By aligning gradient updates with these\ndetected phases, we prevent conflicting gradient directions during error\ncorrection. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet demonstrate GOC's superior\ntrade-off between efficiency and quality. With 50\\% cached blocks, GOC achieves\nIS 216.28 (26.3\\% higher) and FID 3.907 (43\\% lower) compared to baseline DiT,\nwhile maintaining identical computational costs. These improvements persist\nacross various cache ratios, demonstrating robust adaptability to different\nacceleration requirements.

Although SINDy is recognized as a\nremarkable approach for identifying nonlinear systems, several challenges\nremain. Its application to industrial systems remains limited, and multi-step\npredictions are not guaranteed due to overfitting and noisy data. This\nphenomenon is often caused by the increase in basis functions resulting from\nthe extension of coordinates, such as time-delay embedding. To address these\nproblems, we propose an emphasized SINDy by incorporating ensemble learning,\nelite gathering, and classification techniques while keeping convex\ncalculation. The proposed method employs library bagging and extracts elites\nwith an R-squared greater than 90%. Then, clustering is performed on the\nsurviving elites because physically motivated basis functions are not always\navailable, and the elites obtained do not always show the same trends. After\nthe classification, discrete model candidates are obtained by taking the mean\nof each classified elite. Finally, the best model is selected.

Existing methods focus on exploring the per-token\ndynamic calibration to ensure both inference acceleration and model accuracy\nunder 4-bit quantization. However, in autoregressive generation inference of\nlong sequences, the overhead of repeated dynamic quantization and\ndequantization steps becomes considerably expensive.

MergeQuant integrates the per-channel quantization steps with the\ncorresponding scalings and linear mappings through a Quantization Step\nMigration (QSM) method, thereby eliminating the quantization overheads before\nand after matrix multiplication. Furthermore, in view of the significant\ndifferences between the different channel ranges, we propose dimensional\nreconstruction and adaptive clipping to address the non-uniformity of\nquantization scale factors and redistribute the channel variations to the\nsubsequent modules to balance the parameter distribution under QSM. Within the\nstatic quantization setting of W4A4, MergeQuant reduces the accuracy gap on\nzero-shot tasks compared to FP16 baseline to 1.3 points on Llama-2-70B model.\nOn Llama-2-7B model, MergeQuant achieves up to 1.77x speedup in decoding, and\nup to 2.06x speedup in end-to-end compared to FP16 baseline.",

    "abstract": "Traditional control methods often show limitations in dealing with complex\nnonlinear systems, especially when it is difficult to accurately obtain the\nexact system model, and the control accuracy and stability are difficult to\nguarantee. To solve this problem, the Koopman operator theory provides an\neffective method to linearise nonlinear systems, which simplifies the analysis\nand control of the system by mapping the nonlinear dynamics into a\nhigh-dimensional space. However, the existing extended dynamical mode\ndecomposition (EDMD) methods suffer from randomness in the selection of basis\nfunctions, which leads to bias in the finite-dimensional approximation to the\nKoopman operator, thus affecting the accuracy of model prediction. To solve\nthis problem, this paper proposes a BLS-EDMD method based on the Broad learning\nsystem (BLS) network. The method achieves a high-precision approximation to the\nKoopman operator by learning more accurate basis functions, which significantly\nimproves the prediction ability of the model. Building on this, we further\ndevelop a model predictive controller (MPC) called BE-MPC. This controller\ndirectly utilises the high-dimensional and high-precision predictors generated\nby BLS-EDMD to predict the system state more accurately, thus achieving precise\ncontrol of the underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV), and its effectiveness is\nverified by simulation.",

Distributed training\nutilizing federated learning offers an alternative by harnessing real-world\nuser data, providing scalability and reducing costs.

    "abstract": "Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in diverse and challenging scenarios\nis essential to align them with human preferences. To mitigate the prohibitive\ncosts associated with human evaluations, utilizing a powerful LLM as a judge\nhas emerged as a favored approach. Nevertheless, this methodology encounters\nseveral challenges, including substantial expenses, concerns regarding privacy\nand security, and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose a straightforward,\nreplicable, and accurate automated evaluation method by leveraging a\nlightweight LLM as the judge, named RocketEval. Initially, we identify that the\nperformance disparity between lightweight and powerful LLMs in evaluation tasks\nprimarily stems from their ability to conduct comprehensive analyses, which is\nnot easily enhanced through techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning. By\nreframing the evaluation task as a multi-faceted Q&A using an instance-specific\nchecklist, we demonstrate that the limited judgment accuracy of lightweight\nLLMs is largely attributes to high uncertainty and positional bias. To address\nthese challenges, we introduce an automated evaluation process grounded in\nchecklist grading, which is designed to accommodate a variety of scenarios and\nquestions. This process encompasses the creation of checklists, the grading of\nthese checklists by lightweight LLMs, and the reweighting of checklist items to\nalign with the supervised annotations. Our experiments carried out on the\nautomated evaluation benchmarks, MT-Bench and WildBench datasets, reveal that\nRocketEval, when using Gemma-2-2B as the judge, achieves a high correlation\n(0.965) with human preferences, which is comparable to GPT-4o. Moreover,\nRocketEval provides a cost reduction exceeding 50-fold for large-scale\nevaluation and comparison scenarios. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Joinn99/RocketEval-ICLR .",

    "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter\ncharacterising the thermal state of sea surface. Due to the intricate thermal\ninteractions between land, sea, and atmosphere, the spatial gradients of SST in\ncoastal waters often appear at finer spatial scales than those in open ocean\nwaters. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its\n100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale\ncoastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution\nthermal sensors. In this study, we first analysed the spatiotemporal patterns\nof SST in South Australia's temperate coastal waters from 2014 to 2023 by\ndeveloping an operational approach for SST retrieval from the Landsat-8 TIRS\nsensor. A buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to\nvalidate the quality of SST retrievals. Then the daily baseline climatology of\nSST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and\nanalysis of anomalous SST events. Our results suggest the following: (1) the\nsatellite-derived SST data aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values;\n(2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St\nVincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures\nduring winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher\nseasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and\nSt Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to\nhave a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study\narea; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm\nmonths than the cool months. We hope these findings would be helpful in\nsupporting the fishing and aquaculture industries in the coastal waters of\nSouth Australia.",

In low-complexity knots, chain segments can move\nquasi-independently. However, as the crossing number increases, the ring's\ndegrees of freedom become collectively coupled: distinct arc segments must move\nin coordinated, out-of-phase patterns to preserve the knot. We formulate this\nusing an arc-based model in which each crossing imposes constraints that\ngenerate a coupling matrix among subchain displacements. We show how strong\ncouplings emerge at higher knot complexity, eventually leading to topologically\ndriven dynamical arrest. We demonstrate that torus and twist knots belong to\ndistinct universality classes of topologically driven dynamical arrest: torus\nknots exhibit a gradual, stretched-exponential slowdown, while twist knots\nundergo a sharp, jamming-like transition.

In this paper, we present an alternative application of\nGaAs-based LED with SI-GaAs substrate for X-ray detection and imaging. The\nmechanism relies on the semiconductor frequency down-conversion process, where\nthe SI-GaAs substrate acts as a photodetector (PD). Upon X-ray irradiation, the\ngenerated photocurrent by the SI-GaAs substrate drives the LED to emit NIR\nphotons which can be detect by a low-cost CCD. We demonstrate direct X-ray\ndetection and present preliminary imaging results, providing another example of\nthe applicability of the PD-LED design for optical frequency conversion. The\nproposed LED X-ray detector leverages mature materials and fabrication\nprocesses. The application of the frequency down-conversion concept makes it\npossible for pixel-less imaging using a large single imaging unit, eliminating\nthe need for readout circuits. This PD-LED architecture offers an alternative\napproach to direct X-ray detection and imaging, characterized by higher\nabsorption, improved image resolution, and enhanced material stability.",

In this report, we present the first\nsuccessful replication of these emergent characteristics for multimodal\nreasoning on only a non-SFT 2B model. Starting with Qwen2-VL-2B and applying\nreinforcement learning directly on the SAT dataset, our model achieves 59.47%\naccuracy on CVBench, outperforming the base model by approximately ~30% and\nexceeding both SFT setting by ~2%.

However, it is prone to produce GPU fragments (e.g.,\n15\\%-94\\%) in serverless DL systems due to the dynamicity of workloads and\ncoarse-grained static GPU allocation mechanisms, gradually eroding the profits\noffered by serverless elasticity.\n  Different from classical serverless systems that only scale horizontally, we\npresent introspective elasticity (IE), a fine-grained and adaptive\ntwo-dimensional co-scaling mechanism to support GPU resourcing-on-demand for\nserverless DL tasks. Based on this insight, we build Dilu, a cross-layer and\nGPU-based serverless DL system with IE support. First, Dilu provides\nmulti-factor profiling for DL tasks with efficient pruning search methods.\nSecond, Dilu adheres to the resourcing-complementary principles in scheduling\nto improve GPU utilization with QoS guarantees. Third, Dilu adopts an adaptive\n2D co-scaling method to enhance the elasticity of GPU provisioning in real\ntime. Evaluations show that it can dynamically adjust the resourcing of various\nDL functions with low GPU fragmentation (10\\%-46\\% GPU defragmentation), high\nthroughput (up to 1.8$\\times$ inference and 1.1$\\times$ training throughput\nincrement) and QoS guarantees (11\\%-71\\% violation rate reduction), compared to\nthe SOTA baselines.",

Features of six planes are extracted by the 2D encoder and\nsent to the HexPlane Association Module (HAM) to adaptively fuse the most\ninformative information for each point. The fused point features are further\nfed to the task head to yield the ultimate predictions. Compared to the popular\npoint and voxel representation, the HexPlane representation is efficient and\ncan utilize highly optimized 2D operations to process sparse and unordered 3D\npoint clouds. It can also leverage off-the-shelf 2D models, network weights,\nand training recipes to achieve accurate scene understanding in 3D space. On\nScanNet and SemanticKITTI benchmarks, our algorithm, dubbed HexNet3D, achieves\ncompetitive performance with previous algorithms. In particular, on the ScanNet\n3D segmentation task, our method obtains 77.0 mIoU on the validation set,\nsurpassing Point Transformer V2 by 1.6 mIoU.

Analysis of the RBS data confirmed that the V layer fully\nreacted with the SiO$_2$ substrate to form V$_3$Si at the interface, in\naddition to a vanadium oxide (VO$_x$) layer forming atop the V$_3$Si film. The\nthickness of the V$_3$Si layer ranges from 63 to 130 nm, with annealing\ntemperatures between 750$^\\circ$C and 800$^\\circ$C.

For\nintra-process messages, Intel-TBB Flow Graph is used with C++ pointer passing,\nwhich ensures zero memory copying and instant delivery. Meanwhile,\ninter-process and cross-device communication seamlessly switch to ZeroMQ. When\na node receives a message from any source, it is immediately activated and\nscheduled for parallel execution by Intel-TBB. The computational hypergraph\nconsists of nodes represented by TBB flow graph nodes and edges formed by TBB\npointer-based connections for intra-process communication, as well as ZeroMQ\nlinks for inter-process and cross-device communication. This structure enables\nseamless distributed parallelism. Additionally, HyperGraph ROS provides\nROS-like utilities such as a parameter server, a coordinate transformation\ntree, and visualization tools.

    "abstract": "Graph processing requires irregular, fine-grained random access patterns\nincompatible with contemporary off-chip memory architecture, leading to\ninefficient data access. This inefficiency makes graph processing an extremely\nmemory-bound application. Because of this, existing graph processing\naccelerators typically employ a graph tiling-based or processing-in-memory\n(PIM) approach to relieve the memory bottleneck. In the tiling-based approach,\na graph is split into chunks that fit within the on-chip cache to maximize data\nreuse. In the PIM approach, arithmetic units are placed within memory to\nperform operations such as reduction or atomic addition. However, both\napproaches have several limitations, especially when implemented on current\nmemory standards (i.e., DDR). Because the access granularity provided by DDR is\nmuch larger than that of the graph vertex property data, much of the bandwidth\nand cache capacity are wasted. PIM is meant to alleviate such issues, but it is\ndifficult to use in conjunction with the tiling-based approach, resulting in a\nsignificant disadvantage. Furthermore, placing arithmetic units inside a memory\nchip is expensive, thereby supporting multiple types of operation is thought to\nbe impractical. To address the above limitations, we present Piccolo, an\nend-to-end efficient graph processing accelerator with fine-grained in-memory\nrandom scatter-gather. Instead of placing expensive arithmetic units in\noff-chip memory, Piccolo focuses on reducing the off-chip traffic with\nnon-arithmetic function-in-memory of random scatter-gather. To fully benefit\nfrom in-memory scatter-gather, Piccolo redesigns the cache and MHA of the\naccelerator such that it can enjoy both the advantage of tiling and in-memory\noperations. Piccolo achieves a maximum speedup of 3.28$\\times$ and a geometric\nmean speedup of 1.62$\\times$ across various and extensive benchmarks.",

Unlike traditional\nsynchronous estimators that rely on constant-frequency (zero-order) triggers,\nevent-based visual odometry can actively accumulate information to generate\ntemporally high-order estimation triggers. However, existing methods primarily\nfocus on adaptive event representation after estimation triggers, neglecting\nthe decision-making process for efficient temporal triggering itself. This\noversight leads to the computational redundancy and noise accumulation. In this\npaper, we introduce a temporally high-order event-based visual odometry with\nspiking event accumulation networks (THE-SEAN). To the best of our knowledge,\nit is the first event-based visual odometry capable of dynamically adjusting\nits estimation trigger decision in response to motion and environmental\nchanges. Inspired by biological systems that regulate hormone secretion to\nmodulate heart rate, a self-supervised spiking neural network is designed to\ngenerate estimation triggers. This spiking network extracts temporal features\nto produce triggers, with rewards based on block matching points and Fisher\ninformation matrix (FIM) trace acquired from the estimator itself. Finally,\nTHE-SEAN is evaluated across several open datasets, thereby demonstrating\naverage improvements of 13\\% in estimation accuracy, 9\\% in smoothness, and\n38\\% in triggering efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",

However, whilst centrifugation is effective, no a priori models are\navailable to predict the outcome of centrifugation, making time consuming\niterative experiments necessary. Here we present a simple model for the\nbehaviour of 2D nanosheets during centrifugation and benchmark its predictions\nagainst experiments. This model uses simple expressions, specific to 2D\nparticles, for the hydrodynamic radius, effective density and viscous\nresistance to generate the equation of motion of individual nanosheet during\ncentrifugation. Critically, the equation of motion is then used to predict\nnanosheet size distributions within centrifugation products.

Comparison\nwith experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this model for a range of\n2D materials and solvent systems, and its ability to describe quite subtle\neffects.

A larger mass further accelerates the accretion\nradiation output for PBHs with initial masses greater than one solar mass,\npotentially leading to a stringent energy-dumping constraint derived from\nobservations of the cosmic microwave background. The energy injected via PBH\naccretion is capable of ionizing and heating the intergalactic medium (IGM),\nultimately affecting the optical depth of cosmic reionization and the 21-cm\nsignal. This work investigates primordial black hole mass growth using the\nBondi-Hoyle accretion model and accounts for additional ionization and heating\ninduced by PBHs. We derive stringent PBH abundance limits using an upper limit\non optical depth set by Planck 2018 CMB measurements. We find that accretion\ngrowth significantly strengthens late-time observational constraints for\nprimordial black holes with initial masses ranging from several solar masses up\nto $10^4$ solar masses. The PBH fraction of the Universe's unobserved mass\ncontent can be constrained to $f_{\\mathrm{PBH, ini}}\\sim 10^{-2}$ to $10^{-7}$\nin this mass range, and when accounting for mass evolution our constraints can\nbe strengthened by up to one order of magnitude.

However, the existing methods continue to be restricted by the\nrequirements for manual labor and the limited scope of capability assessment.\nTo address these limitations, we introduce AutoTestForge, an automated and\nmultidimensional testing framework for NLP models in this paper. Within\nAutoTestForge, through the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nautomatically generate test templates and instantiate them, manual involvement\nis significantly reduced. Additionally, a mechanism for the validation of test\ncase labels based on differential testing is implemented which makes use of a\nmulti-model voting system to guarantee the quality of test cases. The framework\nalso extends the test suite across three dimensions, taxonomy, fairness, and\nrobustness, offering a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of NLP\nmodels. This expansion enables a more in-depth and thorough assessment of the\nmodels, providing valuable insights into their strengths and weaknesses. A\ncomprehensive evaluation across sentiment analysis (SA) and semantic textual\nsimilarity (STS) tasks demonstrates that AutoTestForge consistently outperforms\nexisting datasets and testing tools, achieving higher error detection rates (an\naverage of $30.89\\%$ for SA and $34.58\\%$ for STS).

Unfortunately, this requirement is rarely satisfied in\npractice. As we demonstrate, using a poorly calibrated bound can lead to\nsignificant regret accumulation.

We identify three key categories of modifications\nto the abstract simulator that enable policy transfer to physical robots:\nsimulation fidelity enhancements, training optimizations and simulation\nstochasticity. We then run an empirical study with extensive ablations to\ndetermine the value of each modification category for enabling policy transfer\nin cooperative robot soccer tasks. We also compare the performance of policies\nproduced by our method with a well-tuned non-learning-based behavior\narchitecture from the annual RoboCup competition and find that our approach\nleads to a similar level of performance.

While prior work tends to simplify\nthe system model by omitting critical system factors such as clock offsets,\nfiltering effects, antenna array orientation offsets, and channel estimation\nerrors, we address the challenges of a practical mmWave multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) communication system between a single base station (BS)\nand a vehicle while tracking the vehicle's position and orientation (PO)\nconsidering realistic driving behaviors. We first develop a channel tracking\nalgorithm based on multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (MOMP) with\nfactoring (F-MOMP) to reduce computational complexity and enable\nhigh-resolution channel estimates during the tracking stage, suitable for PO\nestimation. Then, we develop a network called VO-ChAT (Vehicle\nOrientation-Channel Attention for orientation Tracking), which processes the\nchannel estimate sequence for orientation prediction. Afterward, a weighted\nleast squares (WLS) problem that exploits the channel geometry is formulated to\ncreate an initial estimate of the vehicle's 2D position. A second network named\nVP-ChAT (Vehicle Position-Channel Attention for position Tracking) refines the\ngeometric position estimate. VP-ChAT is a Transformer inspired network\nprocessing the historical channel and position estimates to provide the\ncorrection for the initial geometric position estimate. The proposed solution\nis evaluated using raytracing generated channels in an urban canyon\nenvironment.

In this paper, we prove\na transference version of this theorem. More precisely, for fixed $q$ and $r$,\nwe show that with high probability, a monochromatic matching of approximately\nthe same size exists in any $q$-colouring of a random hypergraph, already when\nthe average degree is a sufficiently large constant. In fact, our main new\nresult is a defect version of the Alon--Frankl--Lov\\'asz theorem for almost\ncomplete hypergraphs.

The accuracy of the integrated location and orientation depends on\nthe precision of the uncertainty modeling. Traditional methods of uncertainty\nmodeling typically assume a Gaussian distribution and involve manual heuristic\nparameter tuning. However, these methods struggle to scale effectively and\naddress long-tail scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a\nlearning-based method that encodes sensor information using higher-order neural\nnetwork features, thereby eliminating the need for uncertainty estimation. This\nmethod significantly eliminates the need for parameter fine-tuning by\ndeveloping an end-to-end neural network that is specifically designed for\nmulti-sensor fusion. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour approach in real-world autonomous driving scenarios. Results show that the\nproposed method outperforms existing multi-sensor fusion methods in terms of\nboth accuracy and robustness.

    "abstract": "Monocular Indoor Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to reconstruct a 3D\nsemantic occupancy map from a single RGB image of an indoor scene, inferring\nspatial layout and object categories from 2D image cues. The challenge of this\ntask arises from the depth, scale, and shape ambiguities that emerge when\ntransforming a 2D image into 3D space, particularly within the complex and\noften heavily occluded environments of indoor scenes. Current SSC methods often\nstruggle with these ambiguities, resulting in distorted or missing object\nrepresentations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative\napproach that leverages novel view synthesis and multiview fusion.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate how virtual cameras can be placed around the scene\nto emulate multiview inputs that enhance contextual scene information. We also\nintroduce a Multiview Fusion Adaptor (MVFA) to effectively combine the\nmultiview 3D scene predictions into a unified 3D semantic occupancy map.\nFinally, we identify and study the inherent limitation of generative techniques\nwhen applied to SSC, specifically the Novelty-Consistency tradeoff. Our system,\nGenFuSE, demonstrates IoU score improvements of up to 2.8% for Scene Completion\nand 4.9% for Semantic Scene Completion when integrated with existing SSC\nnetworks on the NYUv2 dataset.

This work investigates the thermal boundary\nconductance (TBC) of standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures\nusing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) driven by accurate machine\nlearning interatomic potentials trained from density-functional theory\ncalculations. For the standalone interface, the TBC is found to be ~600 MW m-2\nK-1 at room temperature after quantum correction, with possible ~60% elastic\nand ~40% inelastic contributions. The result revises previous NEMD predictions\n(400 - 2000 MW m-2 K-1) using empirical interatomic potentials. When a second\nGaN/AlN interface is brought close to the original interface, the TBC of the\noriginal interface can increase to 1000 MW m-2 K-1, and this value gradually\ndecreases with increasing distance between the two interfaces. When multiple\ninterfaces are introduced in proximity, the first interface's TBC can be\nfurther enhanced to above 1150 MW m-2 K-1. After comparing double interfaces,\nsuperlattices, and random multilayers, it is concluded that such enhancement of\nTBC is not caused by the emergence of coherent superlattice modes but rather by\nthe ballistic transport of the original bulk phonon modes of each material.\nAdditionally, a \"critical separation distance\" (l_cs) is defined as the\nthreshold beyond which the two interfaces no longer influence each other and\nbehave independently. l_cs is determined by the mean free path of the phonons\nfiltered by the interfaces that transport in the middle layer between two\ninterfaces.

To tackle these issues, we propose to\nuse a reconstruction by generation pipeline that leverages learned priors from\nvideo diffusion models to provide plausible interpretations for regions outside\nthe field of view or occluded. However, the generated sequences exhibit\ninconsistencies that do not fully benefit subsequent 3DGS modeling.

This guidance is training-free and does\nnot require any fine-tuning of the diffusion model. To facilitate holistic\nscene modeling, we also propose a trajectory initialization method. It\neffectively identifies regions that are outside the field of view and occluded.\nWe further design a scheme tailored for 3DGS optimization with generated\nsequences.

Challenges include decreased point cloud\naccuracy with longer frame intervals under the constant velocity assumption,\ncoupling of erroneous IMU information when IMU saturation occurs, and decreased\nlocalization accuracy due to the use of fixed-resolution maps during\nindoor-outdoor scene transitions. To address these issues, we propose a loosely\ncoupled adaptive LiDAR-Inertial-Odometry named \\textbf{Adaptive-LIO}, which\nincorporates adaptive segmentation to enhance mapping accuracy, adapts motion\nmodality through IMU saturation and fault detection, and adjusts map resolution\nadaptively using multi-resolution voxel maps based on the distance from the\nLiDAR center. Our proposed method has been tested in various challenging\nscenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of the improvements we introduce.\nThe code is open-source on GitHub:\n\\href{https://github.com/chengwei0427/adaptive_lio}{Adaptive-LIO}.",

Motivated by this finding, here we report a comprehensive\ntheoretical study of this system. Our density functional theory calculations\nreveal that the undistorted P4/mmm phase without pressure is unstable due to\nthree distortion modes. Increasing pressure suppresses these modes and causes\n``charge transfer'' between the single-layer and bilayer sublattices, leading\nto hole-doping in the single-layer blocks. Our random-phase approximation\ncalculations indicate a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that arises\nfrom spin-fluctuation scattering between Fermi surface states mainly\noriginating from the single-layer blocks and additional weaker contributions\nfrom the bilayer blocks. These spin-fluctuations could be detected by inelastic\nneutron scattering as a strong peak at ${\\bf q}=(\\pi, \\pi)$.

    "abstract": "Cooperation underlies many aspects of the evolution of human and animal\nsocieties, where cooperators produce social goods to benefit others. Explaining\nthe emergence of cooperation among selfish individuals has become a major\nresearch interest in evolutionary dynamics. Previous studies typically use\ncomplex networks to capture the interactions between individuals, and assume\nthat cooperators distribute benefits equally to their neighbors. In practice,\nthe distribution of social goods is often non-uniform, and individuals may\nselectively provide benefits to those they interact with based on their\npersonal preferences. Here, we develop an efficient algorithm to optimize the\nplacement of donation structure in any given network to minimize the threshold\nfor the emergence of cooperation. We find when cooperators allocate the\nbenefits preferentially compared to the traditional settings of donating to all\nneighbors, cooperation tends to be maximally promoted. Furthermore, the optimal\ndonation structure is strongly disassortative -- the low-degree nodes tend to\ndonate to high-degree ones preferentially and vice versa. Based on this\nfinding, we offer a local heuristic strategy based on degree thresholds for\npersonalizing the allocation of social goods and choosing each cooperator's\nrecipient, which we use to prove its effectiveness in empirical datasets. Our\nfindings advance the understanding of mechanisms for promoting cooperation with\nstrategic allocations of social goods.",

Metals have long been dismissed due\nto their strong reflectivity at infrared wavelengths. Here, we demonstrate HHG\nfrom silver - a noble metal - using few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses at\nnear-normal incidence. Our results show that sub-cycle electron dynamics within\nthe material's penetration depth can drive high-order harmonics, challenging\nthe prevailing notion that metals are unsuited for infrared-driven strong-field\nprocesses. Despite silver's high reflectivity and large free-electron density,\nwe observe nonperturbative harmonics extending into the extreme ultraviolet (up\nto 20 eV). Moreover, silver's multi-shot damage threshold proves surprisingly\nhigh (30 TW/cm^2) - comparable to large-bandgap dielectrics like magnesium\noxide - thereby enabling intense strong-field processes in a metallic\nenvironment. Measuring the orientation dependence of the emitted harmonics\nreveals that the process arises from coherent electron dynamics in the crystal\nlattice, rather than from a plasma-driven mechanism. Time-dependent\ndensity-matrix simulations based on maximally localized Wannier functions show\nthat low-order harmonics predominantly originate from conduction electrons near\nthe Fermi surface (s- and p-type orbitals), whereas higher harmonics rely on\nbound d-electron excitations. These findings establish metals - long thought\nunfavorable for HHG - as a promising platform for ultrafast strong-field\nphysics, extending high-harmonic spectroscopy to regimes in which lattice order\nand plasma formation directly intersect. This work expands the frontier of\nsolid-state HHG to all-metallic attosecond pulse generation and underscores the\npotential of metals as robust XUV sources for advanced attosecond metrology.",

However,\nprompts differ from traditional code in many ways and require new approaches to\nensure that they are robust.

Also, while\nnatural language prompts are easy to modify, the impact of updates is harder to\npredict. New approaches to testing, debugging, and modifying prompts with\nrespect to the model running them are required.\n  To address some of these issues, we developed PromptPex, an LLM-based tool to\nautomatically generate and evaluate unit tests for a given prompt. PromptPex\nextracts input and output specifications from a prompt and uses them to\ngenerate diverse, targeted, and valid unit tests. These tests are instrumental\nin identifying regressions when a prompt is changed and also serve as a tool to\nunderstand how prompts are interpreted by different models. We use PromptPex to\ngenerate tests for eight benchmark prompts and evaluate the quality of the\ngenerated tests by seeing if they can cause each of four diverse models to\nproduce invalid output. PromptPex consistently creates tests that result in\nmore invalid model outputs than a carefully constructed baseline LLM-based test\ngenerator.

    "abstract": "Despite of tremendous research on decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) and algebraic\ngeometry (AG) codes under the random and adversary substitution error models,\nfew studies have explored these codes under the burst substitution error model.\nBurst errors are prevalent in many communication channels, such as wireless\nnetworks, magnetic recording systems, and flash memory. Compared to random and\nadversarial errors, burst errors often allow for the design of more efficient\ndecoding algorithms. However, achieving both an optimal decoding radius and\nquasi-linear time complexity for burst error correction remains a significant\nchallenge. The goal of this paper is to design (both list and probabilistic\nunique) decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes that achieve the Singleton\nbound for decoding radius while maintaining quasi-linear time complexity.\n  Our idea is to build a one-to-one correspondence between AG codes (including\nRS codes) and interleaved RS codes with shorter code lengths (or even constant\nlengths). By decoding the interleaved RS codes with burst errors, we derive\nefficient decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes. For decoding interleaved RS\ncodes with shorter code lengths, we can employ either the naive methods or\nexisting algorithms. This one-to-one correspondence is constructed using the\ngeneralized fast Fourier transform (G-FFT) proposed by Li and Xing (SODA 2024).\nThe G-FFT generalizes the divide-and-conquer technique from polynomials to\nalgebraic function fields. More precisely speaking, assume that our AG code is\ndefined over a function field $E$ which has a sequence of subfields\n$\\mathbb{F}_q(x)=E_r\\subseteq E_{r-1}\\subseteq \\cdots\\subset E_1\\subseteq\nE_0=E$ such that $E_{i-1}/E_i$ are Galois extensions for $1\\le i\\le r$. Then\nthe AG code based on $E$ can be transformed into an interleaved RS code over\nthe rational function field $\\mathbb{F}_q(x)$.",

However, LLM Judges have been shown to exhibit biases that can\ndistort their judgments. We evaluate how well LLM Judges can grade whether a\ngiven response to a conversational question is correct, an ability crucial to\nsoundly estimating the overall response quality. To do so, we create and\npublicly release a human-annotated dataset with labels of correctness for 1,200\nLLM responses. We source questions from a combination of existing datasets and\na novel, challenging benchmark (BFF-Bench) created for this analysis. We\ndemonstrate a strong connection between an LLM's ability to correctly answer a\nquestion and grade responses to that question. Although aggregate level\nstatistics might imply a judge has high agreement with human annotators, it\nwill struggle on the subset of questions it could not answer. To address this\nissue, we recommend a simple solution: provide the judge with a correct,\nhuman-written reference answer. We perform an in-depth analysis on how\nreference quality can affect the performance of an LLM Judge.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective study using\nthe CT-RATE-JPN dataset containing 22,778 training reports and 150 test\nreports. Both models were fine-tuned for multi-label classification of 18\ncommon chest CT conditions. The training data was split in 18,222:4,556 for\ntraining and validation. Performance was evaluated using F1 scores for each\ncondition and exact match accuracy across all 18 labels. Results: ModernBERT\ndemonstrated superior tokenization efficiency, requiring 24.0% fewer tokens per\ndocument (258.1 vs. 339.6) compared to BERT Base. This translated to\nsignificant performance improvements, with ModernBERT completing training in\n1877.67 seconds versus BERT's 3090.54 seconds (39% reduction). ModernBERT\nprocessed 38.82 samples per second during training (1.65x faster) and 139.90\nsamples per second during inference (1.66x faster). Despite these efficiency\ngains, classification performance remained comparable, with ModernBERT\nachieving superior F1 scores in 8 conditions, while BERT performed better in 4\nconditions. Overall exact match accuracy was slightly higher for ModernBERT\n(74.67% vs. 72.67%), though this difference was not statistically significant\n(p=0.6291). Conclusion: ModernBERT offers substantial improvements in\ntokenization efficiency and training speed without sacrificing classification\nperformance.
