    "abstract": "Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering\ndisciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by\nOrszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of\nnumerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that\nturbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very\nsensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In\nphysics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out\nby Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent\nKolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with\nthat given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal\ntrajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly\npolluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has\nhuge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and\nthe energy cascade but also even in statistics.",

Using a 3D magnetohydrodynamic model,\nwe identify a current helicity reversal pattern associated with the eruption: a\npre-eruption decrease and a post-eruption increase. This helicity reversal is\nattributed to the redistribution of electric currents: before the eruption,\ncurrents concentrate toward the polarity inversion line (PIL); after the\neruption they move away from the PIL, consistent with the flare ribbon\nseparation, which is caused by the upward progression reconnection site. To\nvalidate this pattern, we conducted an observational analysis of 50 $\\geq$M5.0\neruptive flares. The results reveal that 58\\% of cases exhibited a pre-eruption\ndecrease and 92\\% showed the post-eruption increase in current helicity.\nDetailed analysis of two cases with this reversal suggests that they share the\nsame current redistribution pattern, consistent with the mechanism identified\nin the simulations. Moreover, the pre-eruption decrease could be observed\nclearly even in the long-term evolution of the two cases. Current helicity can\nserve as an indicator of when electric currents are built up for the subsequent\neruption, and it has the potential to predict CMEs to some extent.",

The\ninability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their\nover-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards\ngeneral-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models\n(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the\nreal-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research\nprogress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely\nlimited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.\nIn addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work\nshould demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and\ntrustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline.

Insight into the optimal\npolicy value can guide the development of reward-maximizing, individualized\ntreatment regimes. However, because the functional that defines the optimal\nvalue is non-differentiable, standard semi-parametric approaches for performing\ninference fail to be directly applicable. Existing approaches for handling this\nnon-differentiability fall roughly into two camps. In one camp are estimators\nbased on constructing smooth approximations of the optimal value. These\napproaches are computationally lightweight, but typically place unrealistic\nparametric assumptions on outcome regressions. In another camp are approaches\nthat directly de-bias the non-smooth objective. These approaches don't place\nparametric assumptions on nuisance functions, but they either require the\ncomputation of intractably-many nuisance estimates, assume unrealistic\n$L^\\infty$ nuisance convergence rates, or make strong margin assumptions that\nprohibit non-response to a treatment. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\nconstructing smooth approximations of non-differentiable functionals.

    "abstract": "The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays\nbeing a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This\nresearch addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway\nnetwork by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological\nfeatures. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and\nneglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple\neffects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology,\noriginally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air\nnetwork, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node\nCentrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest,\nDecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is\nto predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited\nperformance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the\nnecessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research\ncontributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and\nproposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for\ndelays.",

The enhancement in the\nGamow-Teller (GT) transition strength in $^{70}$Br compared to the\n$\\beta$-decay of the lighter $^{62}$Ge was suggested as an indication for\nincreased neutron-proton ($np$) pairing correlation. To explore the $np$\ncorrelations in nuclei, we systematically examined the $\\beta$-decay properties\nof the even-even nuclei $A=58,62,66,$ and $70$ into $N=Z$ odd-odd nuclei. By\nemploying an interaction involving solely $J=1, T=0$ and $J=0, T=1$ pairing\nmatrix elements, we observe that the pairing does not necessarily lead to an\nenhancement in the GT strength for the same coupling strength. But with the\ninclusion of the $g_{9/2}$ orbital, the GT strength can be increased with\nincreasing $np$ pairing in connection with the enhanced contribution from the\n$g_{9/2}$ orbital. We further compare those results with realistic calculations\nin the $fp$ and $f_{5/2}pg_{9/2}$ model space to gauge the contribution from\n$f_{7/2}$ and $g_{9/2}$ orbitals in the GT strengths. With the JUN45\ninteraction, there is an increment for the yrast $1^+$ state for the decay of\n$^{70}$Kr as compared to the decay of $^{62}$Ge due to increased $g_{9/2}$\ncontribution. Additionally, we probe the effect of $np$ pairing on $B_{\\rm GT}$\nby modifying the single-particle energies and the $T = 0$ matrix elements of\nthe interaction responsible for the decay transition strength.

The proposed approach adapts\nan existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in\nthe calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent\nprediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with\nrespect to the desired $(1 - \\alpha)$-level when using finite-sample\ncalibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS\ngenerally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming\nproperties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage\nguarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine\nthe effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the\nperformance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we\nempirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including\nCIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method\nis robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current\nDP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.\nSpecifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal\nprediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy\nguarantees in all these experimental settings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and\ngeneralize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with\nhuman-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial\nintelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable\nsuccess in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs\nor parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often\nmeans retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures,\nwhich increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific\napproaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver\n(UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we\nprove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of\nestimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we\nillustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional\ngenerative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a\nsingle round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning\nability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of\nzero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from\nunseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.",

We introduce\nMulti-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures\nthat facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational\ncost.

    "abstract": "A pervasive approach in scientific computing is to express the solution to a\ngiven problem as the limit of a sequence of vectors or other mathematical\nobjects. In many situations these sequences are generated by slowly converging\niterative procedures and this led practitioners to seek faster alternatives to\nreach the limit. ``Acceleration techniques'' comprise a broad array of methods\nspecifically designed with this goal in mind. They started as a means of\nimproving the convergence of general scalar sequences by various forms of\n``extrapolation to the limit'', i.e., by extrapolating the most recent iterates\nto the limit via linear combinations. Extrapolation methods of this type, the\nbest known example of which is Aitken's Delta-squared process, require only the\nsequence of vectors as input. However, limiting methods to only use the\niterates is too restrictive. Accelerating sequences generated by fixed-point\niterations by utilizing both the iterates and the fixed-point mapping itself\nhas proven highly successful across various areas of physics. A notable example\nof these Fixed-Point accelerators (FP-Accelerators) is a method developed by D.\nAnderson in 1965 and now widely known as Anderson Acceleration (AA).\nFurthermore, Quasi-Newton and Inexact Newton methods can also be placed in this\ncategory as well. This paper presents an overview of these methods -- with an\nemphasis on those, such as AA, that are geared toward accelerating fixed point\niterations.",

The cooperative behavior\ncan be influenced by the environmental noise in partially observable settings\nand by the decision-making strategies of agents, which may incorporate not only\nreputation but also traits such as generosity and forgiveness. Traditional\nsimulations often assume fully random interactions, where cooperation is tested\nbetween randomly selected agent pairs. In this paper, we investigate\ncooperation dynamics using the concept of Stephen Wolfram's one-dimensional\nbinary cellular automata. This approach allows us to explore how cooperation\nevolves when interactions are limited to neighboring agents. We define binary\ncellular automata rules that conform to the donation game mechanics.\nAdditionally, we introduce models of perceptual and action noise, along with a\nmutation matrix governing the probabilistic evolution of agent strategies. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that cooperation is significantly affected by\nagents' mobility and their spatial locality on the game board.

This study presents the\nfirst dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa\nNew Zealand, quantifying potential GDP losses across seven disruption and\nmitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary\nfocus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs)\non the electrical power transmission network. The goal is to support\ndecision-making around space weather mitigation investments by providing a\nfirst-order approximation of their potential economic benefits. We find that in\nthe absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to\nNZ\\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading\nsupply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding\nNZ\\$3 billion. Importantly, research-led operational strategies, such as\noptimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\\$370 million in losses\nfor as little as NZ\\$500,000 in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of\n740 to 1. Moreover, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices further\nreduce disruption to as low as NZ\\$1.12 billion, with avoided GDP losses up to\nNZ\\$2.3 billion, and benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1. When also\nacknowledging unmodelled impacts, including multi-billion losses in capital\nequipment and long-term revenue, the economic rationale for pre-emptive\nmitigation becomes even more pertinent.

While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local\nforecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in\nhandling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.\nThese methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally\nexpensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In\ncontrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance\nprediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through\nglobalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load\nforecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of\ndifferent modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore\nfeature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how\nglobalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In\naddition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its\npotential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the\nbalance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series\nclustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming\nmodels and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.\nThrough extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity\nload, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently\noutperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global\nfeatures and clustering techniques.

However, ABPM data are often reduced to summary statistics,\nsuch as means or medians, which obscure temporal features like nocturnal\ndipping and individual chronotypes. Functional data analysis methods better\ncapture these temporal dynamics but typically treat each ABPM measurement\nseparately, limiting their ability to leverage correlations among matched\nmeasurements. In this work, we observe that aligning ABPM data along\nmeasurement type, time, and patient ID lends itself to a tensor\nrepresentation--a multidimensional array. Although tensor learning has shown\ngreat potential in other fields, it has not been applied to ABPM data. Existing\ntensor learning approaches often lack temporal smoothing constraints, assume no\nmissing data, and can be computationally demanding. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel smooth tensor decomposition method that\nincorporates a temporal smoothing penalty and accommodates missing data. We\nalso develop an automatic procedure for selecting the optimal smoothing\nparameter and tensor ranks. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method\nreliably reconstructs smooth temporal trends from noisy, incomplete data.\nApplication to ABPM data from patients with concurrent obstructive sleep apnea\nand type 2 diabetes uncovers clinically relevant associations between patient\ncharacteristics and ABPM measurements, which are missed by summary-based\napproaches.",

Let\n$u(M)=u^F(M)$ be the Lie algebra of the subgroup of the Tannakian fundamental\ngroup of $M$ that acts trivially on the associated graded $Gr^FM$. The\nfiltration $F_\\bullet M$ induces a filtration on the internal Hom\n$\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$, which in turn induces a filtration $F_\\bullet u(M)$ on\n$u(M)$. This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this\npaper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of\nthe extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In\nparticular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we\nneither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is\nsemisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by\nthe desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its\nrealizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations\nof pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting\nfunctorial weight filtration.\n  We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition\nin the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial\nupper bound $F_{-1}\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier\ncriteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special\ncontexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the\nresults to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight\nfiltration $W_\\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with\nour general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the\nset of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a\ngiven graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$.",

While\nthis approach itself is still in its infancy, and many obstacles must still be\novercome before its physical implementation, challenges from the software and\nalgorithmic side must also be identified and addressed. For instance, this\nparadigm shift requires a new form of compiler that considers the network\nconstraints in general as well as phenomena arising due to the nature of\nquantum communication. In distributed quantum computing, large circuits are\ndivided into smaller subcircuits such that they can be executed individually\nand simultaneously on multiple QPUs that are connected through quantum\nchannels. As quantum communication, for example, in the form of teleportation,\nis expensive, it must be used sparingly. We address the problem of assigning\nqubits to QPUs to minimize communication costs in two different ways. First by\napplying time-aware algorithms that take into account the changing connectivity\nof a given circuit as well as the underlying network topology. We define the\noptimization problem, use simulated annealing and an evolutionary algorithm and\ncompare the results to graph partitioning and sequential qubit assignment\nbaselines. In another approach, we propose an evolutionary-based quantum\ncircuit optimization algorithm that adjusts the circuit itself rather than the\nschedule to reduce the overall communication cost. We evaluate the techniques\nagainst random circuits and different network topologies. Both evolutionary\nalgorithms outperform the baseline in terms of communication cost reduction.

This paper introduces PoliAnalyzer, a neuro-symbolic system that\nassists users with personalized privacy policy analysis. PoliAnalyzer uses\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) to extract formal representations of data\nusage practices from policy texts. In favor of deterministic, logical inference\nis applied to compare user preferences with the formal privacy policy\nrepresentation and produce a compliance report. To achieve this, we extend an\nexisting formal Data Terms of Use policy language to model privacy policies as\napp policies and user preferences as data policies. In our evaluation using our\nenriched PolicyIE dataset curated by legal experts, PoliAnalyzer demonstrated\nhigh accuracy in identifying relevant data usage practices, achieving F1-score\nof 90-100% across most tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how PoliAnalyzer can\nmodel diverse user data-sharing preferences, derived from prior research as 23\nuser profiles, and perform compliance analysis against the top 100 most-visited\nwebsites. This analysis revealed that, on average, 95.2% of a privacy policy's\nsegments do not conflict with the analyzed user preferences, enabling users to\nconcentrate on understanding the 4.8% (636 / 13205) that violates preferences,\nsignificantly reducing cognitive burden. Further, we identified common\npractices in privacy policies that violate user expectations - such as the\nsharing of location data with 3rd parties. This paper demonstrates that\nPoliAnalyzer can support automated personalized privacy policy analysis at\nscale using off-the-shelf NLP tools. This sheds light on a pathway to help\nindividuals regain control over their data and encourage societal discussions\non platform data practices to promote a fairer power dynamic.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new framework of episodic tabular Markov decision processes\n(MDPs) with adversarial preferences, which we refer to as preference-based MDPs\n(PbMDPs). Unlike standard episodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where the\nnumerical value of the loss is directly observed, in PbMDPs the learner instead\nobserves preferences between two candidate arms, which represent the choices\nbeing compared. In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the\nreward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a\nregret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we\npresent a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{HSAT})$ for\nepisodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per\nepisode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is\nthe number of episodes. Leveraging this construction, we then derive a regret\nlower bound of $\\Omega( (H^2 S K)^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$ for PbMDPs with Borda\nscores, where $K$ is the number of arms. Next, we develop algorithms that\nachieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$. We first propose a global\noptimization approach based on online linear optimization over the set of all\noccupancy measures, achieving a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}((H^2 S^2 K)^{1/3}\nT^{2/3} )$ under known transitions. However, this approach suffers from\nsuboptimal dependence on the potentially large number of states $S$ and\ncomputational inefficiency. To address this, we propose a policy optimization\nalgorithm whose regret is roughly bounded by $\\tilde{O}( (H^6 S K^5)^{1/3}\nT^{2/3} )$ under known transitions, and further extend the result to the\nunknown-transition setting.",

This tradeoff becomes even\nmore pronounced in pediatric applications due to the stringent size constraints\nimposed by the smaller patient population. This study presents an automated\nCFD-driven shape optimization of a new intermediate diffuser stage for the\nPediaFlow pediatric VAD, positioned immediately downstream of the impeller to\nimprove pressure recovery.\n  Methods: We adopted a multi-objective optimization approach to maximize\npressure recovery while minimizing hemolysis. The proposed diffuser stage was\nisolated from the rest of the flow domain, enabling efficient evaluation of\nover 450 design variants using Sobol sequence, which yielded a Pareto front of\nnon-dominated solutions. The selected best candidate was further refined using\nlocal T-search algorithm. We then incorporated the optimized front diffuser\ninto the full pump for CFD verification and in vitro validation.\n  Results: We identified critical dependencies where longer blades increased\npressure recovery but also hemolysis, while the wrap angle showed a strong\nparabolic relationship with pressure recovery but a monotonic relationship with\nhemolysis. Counterintuitively, configurations with fewer blades (2-3)\nconsistently outperformed those with more blades (4-5) in both metrics. The\noptimized two-blade design enabled operation at lower pump speeds (14,000 vs\n16,000 RPM), improving hydraulic efficiency from 26.3% to 32.5% and reducing\nhemolysis by 31%.\n  Conclusion: This approach demonstrates that multi-objective CFD optimization\ncan systematically explore complex design spaces while balancing competing\npriorities of performance and hemocompatibility for pediatric VADs.",

Various\ndescriptions exist in the literature for modelling the surface manifestation of\nconvection, the choice of which affects our interpretations. We aim to evaluate\nthe performance of and preference for various granulation background models for\na suite of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of convection across the HR diagram,\nthereby expanding the number of simulations and coverage of parameter space for\nwhich such studies have been made. We take a statistical approach by\nconsidering the granulation in power density spectra of 3D simulations, where\nno biases or systematics of observational origin are present. To properly\ncontrast the performance of the models, we develop a Bayesian nested sampling\nframework for model inference and comparison. This framework was extended to\nreal stellar data using KIC 8006161 (Doris) and the Sun. We find that\nmulti-component models are consistently preferred over a single-component\nmodel, with each tested multi-component model demonstrating merit in specific\ncases. This occurs for simulations with no magnetic activity, thus ruling out\nstellar faculae as the sole source of the second granulation component. Like a\nprevious study, we find that a hybrid model with a single overall amplitude and\ntwo characteristic frequencies performs well for numerous simulations.\nAdditionally, a tentative third granulation component beyond the value of\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$ is seen for some simulations, but its potential presence in\nobservations requires further efforts. Studying the granulation signatures in\nthese simulations paves the way to studying stars with accurate granulation\nmodels.

While current observations\nfocus on stellar accretion and inner dust emission, the fate of the\nvolatile-rich material expelled during disruption remains poorly understood. We\ninvestigate whether the hydrogen- and helium-rich gas expelled from the\ndisrupted planet's envelope and atmosphere can escape the inner system and be\ngravitationally captured by a low-mass outer planet, potentially forming a\ntransient atmosphere and producing detectable volatile contamination. We model\nthe outward diffusion of gas from a tidally stripped giant using 2D\nhydrodynamical simulations, complemented by analytical estimates of volatile\nobservability and atmospheric escape. We assess the efficiency of gas capture\nby outer planets and the survival timescales of the resulting secondary\natmospheres under high-energy stellar irradiation. Our results show that\nvolatile-rich gas can form a \"volatile-enriched planet\" (VEP). The resulting\nenvelopes can contain up to 10^-6 Earth masses -- comparable to Earth's\natmosphere -- for Earth-like planets, yielding transit depths of tens to\nhundreds of parts per million. Such signatures may persist for 1 to 100 million\nyears, depending on planetary mass, orbit, and stellar activity.

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the\nimplications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected\ncoresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an\nextensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations\nbenchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,\nand five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.\nThereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between\nsample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant\nmodel robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using\nembedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk\nof inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based\non learning dynamics.

When the mass of NSC inside the\norbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The\nsubsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal\npotential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential\nis mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the\nsecular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular\nmomentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits\ncan experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational\nwaves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study\nanalytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the\nimportant effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest\npossible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of\nfast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly\neccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital\nperiod. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale\nof the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular\nvalues of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from\nthe ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the\neccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger.

It has been\nproposed that multichannel topological Kondo (MCTK) model involving topological\nCooper pair boxes with $M$ Majorana modes [SO($M$) \"spin\"] and $N$ spinless\nelectron channels exhibits an exotic intermediate coupling fixed point. This\nintermediate fixed point has been analyzed through large-$N$ perturbative\ncalculations, which gives a zero-temperature conductance decaying as $1/N^2$ in\nthe large-$N$ limit.

Using representation theory, we verify\nthe existence of this intermediate-coupling fixed point and find the\nstrong-coupling effective Hamiltonian for the case $M=4$. Using conformal field\ntheory techniques for SO($M$), we generalize the notion of overscreening and\nconclude that the MCTK model is an overscreened Kondo model. We find the\nfixed-point finite-size energy spectrum and the leading irrelevant operator\n(LIO). We express the fixed-point conductance in terms of the modular S-matrix\nof SO($M$) for general $N$, confirming the previous large-$N$ result. We\ndescribe the finite-temperature corrections to the conductance by the LIO and\nfind that they are qualitatively different for the cases $N=1$ and $N\\geq2$ due\nto the different fusion outcomes with the current operator. We also compare the\nmultichannel topological Kondo model to the topological symplectic Kondo model.",

    "abstract": "Pinwheel Scheduling is a fundamental scheduling problem, in which each task\n$i$ is associated with a positive integer $d_i$, and the objective is to\nschedule one task per time slot, ensuring each task perpetually appears at\nleast once in every $d_i$ time slots. Although conjectured to be\nPSPACE-complete, it remains open whether Pinwheel Scheduling is NP-hard (unless\na compact input encoding is used) or even contained in NP.\n  We introduce k-Visits, a finite version of Pinwheel Scheduling, where given n\ndeadlines, the goal is to schedule each task exactly k times. While we observe\nthat the 1-Visit problem is trivial, we prove that 2-Visits is strongly\nNP-complete through a surprising reduction from Numerical 3-Dimensional\nMatching (N3DM). As intermediate steps in the reduction, we define NP-complete\nvariants of N3DM which may be of independent interest. We further extend our\nstrong NP-hardness result to a generalization of k-Visits $k\\geq 2$ in which\nthe deadline of each task may vary throughout the schedule, as well as to a\nsimilar generalization of Pinwheel Scheduling, thus making progress towards\nsettling the complexity of Pinwheel Scheduling.\n  Additionally, we prove that 2-Visits can be solved in linear time if all\ndeadlines are distinct, rendering it one of the rare natural problems which\nexhibit the interesting dichotomy of being in P if their input is a set and\nNP-complete if the input is a multiset. We achieve this through a Turing\nreduction from 2-Visits to a variation of N3DM, which we call Position\nMatching. Based on this reduction, we also show an FPT algorithm for 2-Visits\nparameterized by a value related to how close the input deadlines are to each\nother, as well as a linear-time algorithm for instances with up to two distinct\ndeadlines.",

    "abstract": "Twelve years have passed since World IPv6 Launch Day, but what is the current\nstate of IPv6 deployment? Prior work has examined IPv6 status as a binary: can\nyou use IPv6, or not? As deployment increases we must consider a more nuanced,\nnon-binary perspective on IPv6: how much and often can a user or a service use\nIPv6? We consider this question as a client, server, and cloud provider.\nConsidering the client's perspective, we observe user traffic. We see that the\nfraction of IPv6 traffic a user sends varies greatly, both across users and\nday-by-day, with a standard deviation of over 15%. We show this variation\noccurs for two main reasons. First, IPv6 traffic is primarily human-generated,\nthus showing diurnal patterns. Second, some services are IPv6-forward and\nothers IPv6-laggards, so as users do different things their fraction of IPv6\nvaries. We look at server-side IPv6 adoption in two ways. First, we expand\nanalysis of web services to examine how many are only partially IPv6 enabled\ndue to their reliance on IPv4-only resources. Our findings reveal that only\n12.5% of top 100k websites qualify as fully IPv6-ready. Finally, we examine\ncloud support for IPv6. Although all clouds and CDNs support IPv6, we find that\ntenant deployment rates vary significantly across providers. We find that ease\nof enabling IPv6 in the cloud is correlated with tenant IPv6 adoption rates,\nand recommend best practices for cloud providers to improve IPv6 adoption. Our\nresults suggest IPv6 deployment is growing, but many services lag, presenting a\npotential for improvement.",

Secondly, we show that important quantum\nalgorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search\nalgorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal\nProcessing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give\nclean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics.\nFinally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of\nour language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to\nthese semantics.

    "abstract": "We investigate quantum electrodynamics in the infrared regime (QED-IR) using\nthe adiabatic approximation and the framework of the functional Berry phase. In\nthis approach, the physical state space is exact, nonperturbatively dressed,\nand endowed with a topological structure. Electrons do not exist as bare\nparticles, but as topologically protected electron-photon clouds, defining a\nnew kind of infrared quantum. These clouds are weakly bound in energy -- with a\nbinding scale estimated at $\\Lambda_{\\text{IR}} \\sim 0.2$ eV -- and remain\nstable provided photon energies remain below this threshold. Crucially, the\ntheory becomes exactly solvable in this regime due to the quantization of the\nfunctional Berry flux, which governs the infrared dynamics of the dressed\nstates. When hard (high-energy) processes are involved, this topological\nprotection is lifted, and the theory smoothly recovers conventional\nperturbative QED. In contrast, in the deep infrared, the electromagnetic\ninteraction never fully vanishes, leading to observable effects. We argue that\nthe energy required to dissolve the infrared electron-photon cloud in QED is\napproximately 0.2 eV, well above the thermal energy of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). However, the observed temperature anisotropies correspond to\nfluctuations near $10^{-9}$ eV, which may lie at the threshold for perturbing,\nbut not destroying, the topological structure of the dressed state. This\nsuggests that CMB deviations could reflect residual topological imprints of the\nfunctional infrared dynamics. Finally, we propose that analogous cloud-like\nstructures may manifest in other quantum systems governed by low-energy photon\ndynamics, such as atomic and molecular environments.",

    "abstract": "We have previously studied several elements in 58 selected bulge spheroid\nstars, based on spectral lines in the H-band. We now derive the abundances of\nthe less-studied elements phosphorus (P; Z=15), sulphur (S; Z=16), and\npotassium (K; Z=19). The abundances of P, S, and K in 58 bulge spheroid stars\nare compared both with the results of a previous analysis of the data from the\nApache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE), and with a few\navailable studies of these elements. We derive the individual abundances\nthrough spectral synthesis, using the stellar physical parameters available for\nour sample from the DR17 release of the APOGEE project. We provide\nrecommendations for the best lines to be used for the studied elements among\nthose in the H-band. We also compare the present results, together with\nliterature data, with chemical-evolution models. Finally, the neutrino-process\nwas taken into account for the suitable fit to the odd-Z elements P and K. We\nconfirm that the H-band has useful lines for the derivation of the elements P,\nS, and K in moderately metal-poor stars. The abundances, plotted together with\nliterature results from high-resolution spectroscopy, indicate that: moderately\nenhanced phosphorus stars are found, reminiscent results obtained for thick\ndisk and halo stars of metallicity [Fe/H]~-1.0. Therefore, for the first time,\nwe identify this effect to occur in the old stars from the bulge spheroid.\nSulphur is an alpha-element and behaves as such. Potassium and sulphur both\nexhibit some star-to-star scatter, but fit within the expectations from\nchemical evolution models.",

Central to this work is the\nderivation and use of a model for the leading edge vortex on the caudal fin.\nThis vortex dominates the thrust production from the fin and the LEV model\nforms the basis for the derivation of scaling laws grounded in flow physics.\nScaling laws are derived for thrust, power, efficiency, cost-of-transport, and\nswimming speed, and are parameterized using data from high fidelity\nsimulations. These laws are validated against published simulation and\nexperimental data, revealing several new kinematic and morphometric parameters\nthat critically influence hydrodynamic performance.

However, while observations\nubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\\sim L^*$\nstar-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk,\nespecially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O\nVI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk\nrotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\\approx0.2$\nstar-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) within 45$^\\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while\nindividual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the\nbulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match\nO VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of\ntheir velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion\nmatches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more\nlikely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI\nvelocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the\nextended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches\nrepresent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is\ntheoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular\nmomentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent\nto mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.",

However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.",

We explore how N/O relates to\ndensity structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age,\ncompactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those\nof galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV\nnitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic\ntime. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns\nwith the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that\ngalaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant\nredshift evolution in N/O.

The CLASSY galaxies with\nhigh SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong\ncorrelation with stellar mass is found.

This\nstudy numerically investigates the settling behavior of multisize solid\nparticles in a non-newtonian slurry inside a semicircular open channel (flume).\nThe non-newtonian slurry is modelled using a three-dimensional (3D) unsteady\nEulerian-Eulerian (E-E) model coupled with the Hershel-Bulkley (HB) rheological\nmodel. A detailed sensitivity analysis of drag models is performed to establish\nthe solid-fluid interaction in the slurry flow. The numerical model is\nvalidated with the experimental data from the literature and shows a fair\nagreement. The validated model is used to simulate the settling behavior of the\nslurry in the flume. The mean particle diameter of the solid particles in the\nslurry is in the range of 75-296 $\\mu$m with a median diameter of 188 $\\mu$m.\nThe effect of particle size distributions (PSDs), flume inclination, bubble\nsize and bubble volume fraction on the particle settling inside the flume is\ninvestigated in the parametric study. The analysis of our results revealed that\nthe settling of solids is significantly affected by PSDs in the open channel\nsystem. In particular, the increase in flume inclination progresses the\nsettling and dissipation of fine and coarse particles, respectively. Additional\nsimulations showed that the inception of bubbles influences the settling\nvelocity of solids, which changes the settling behavior of multisize solids\ninside the flume.

Recently, counting answer sets has\nemerged as an important computational problem with applications in\nprobabilistic reasoning, network reliability analysis, and other domains. This\nhas motivated significant research into designing efficient ASP counters. While\nsubstantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development\nof practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.\n  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of\ndisjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected\npropositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative\ncharacterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring\nthat intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows\nSharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology.\nThrough extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate\nthat SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with\nlarge answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid\ncounting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to\nachieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive\nprograms.",

To address these challenges,\nwe propose VISTA (View-Invariant Segmentation-Based Tracking for Frame\nAlignment), a novel open-set, monocular global localization framework that\ncombines: 1) a front-end, object-based, segmentation and tracking pipeline,\nfollowed by 2) a submap correspondence search, which exploits geometric\nconsistencies between environment maps to align vehicle reference frames. VISTA\nenables consistent localization across diverse camera viewpoints and seasonal\nchanges, without requiring any domain-specific training or finetuning. We\nevaluate VISTA on seasonal and oblique-angle aerial datasets, achieving up to a\n69% improvement in recall over baseline methods. Furthermore, we maintain a\ncompact object-based map that is only 0.6% the size of the most\nmemory-conservative baseline, making our approach capable of real-time\nimplementation on resource-constrained platforms.",

    "abstract": "Wind-forced near-inertial waves (NIWs) propagate through a sea of mesoscale\neddies, which can fundamentally alter their evolution. The nature of this\nNIW--mesoscale interaction depends on how dispersive the waves are. For weakly\ndispersive waves, ray tracing suggests that the NIW frequency should be shifted\nby $\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta$, where $\\zeta$ is the mesoscale vorticity, and that the\nwaves are refracted into anticyclones. Strongly dispersive waves, in contrast,\nretain the large-scale structure of the wind forcing and exhibit a small\nnegative frequency shift. Previous in situ observational studies have indeed\nrevealed varying degrees of NIW--mesoscale interaction. Here, observations of\nNIWs from drifters are used to map the geography of NIW--mesoscale interactions\nglobally, and idealized simulations and a simple model are used to identify the\nunderlying physical processes. Almost everywhere in the ocean, with the notable\nexception of the North Pacific, the NIW frequency is strongly modulated by the\nmesoscale vorticity, with the slope of the frequency shift vs. vorticity taking\nvalues of approximately $0.4$. Concentration of NIW energy into anticyclones is\na common feature throughout the ocean. Other aspects of the observations,\nhowever, show signatures of strongly dispersive waves: a negative frequency\nshift and weaker concentration into anticyclones in regions with strong eddies\nas well as weak modulation of the NIW frequency by mesoscale eddies in the\nNorth Pacific. The signatures of both weakly and strongly dispersive NIW\nbehavior can be rationalized by the geography of the wave dispersiveness and\nthe fact that wind forcing excites multiple vertical modes with different wave\ndispersiveness. These results have implications for NIW-induced mixing in the\nupper-ocean.",

    "abstract": "Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node\nmetastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node\n(LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In\nthis work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature\nencoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the\ngenerative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual\nfeatures and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled\nand structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models\nare deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo\nneo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the\nground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP'\nachieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated\nmetrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85\n+/- 0.05.

    "abstract": "In a sense of deformation quantization, noncommutative (NC) geometry\nintroduces a quantum structure of spacetime. Using the twist-deformation\nformalism, we show that the dynamical effects of spacetime noncommutativity can\namount to a transition to a rotating frame of reference. In particular, we\nstudy the dynamics of charged matter (scalars and spinors) on the background of\nMelvin's electric universe in the framework of NC gauge field theory. Melvin's\nelectric/magnetic universe is a static, axially symmetric solution of the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations, representing a parallel bundle of self-gravitating\nelectric/magnetic flux. Due to its axial symmetry, it allows for a very special\nkind of Killing twist that does not deform the metric itself but only the gauge\nfield and the matter fields. Focusing on the perturbative NC equations of\nmotion for charged scalars and Dirac spinors coupled to Melvin's electric\nbackground, we show that they have the same form as the corresponding classical\n(commutative) equations of motion coupled to the same geometric background but\nin a uniformly rotating frame whose angular velocity is determined by the NC\nscale and the electric charge of the matter field. In principle, this NC\nrotation effect can be experimentally tested by setting up the Sagnac\ninterferometry apparatus to measure the Sagnac phase shift for charged versus\nelectrically neutral particles, thus placing a bound on the scale of spacetime\nnoncommutativity.",

    "abstract": "Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a\nhigh-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score\n(MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging\nfor many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent\nvariance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions\nhave been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual\nfactors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead\nto unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework\nthat pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning\non just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS\nprediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are\nthen used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity\ninformation and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean\nLibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at\ndifferent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with\naudio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results\nsuggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly\nimproves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared\nagainst the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These\nfindings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly\ncontributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.",

The identification of the\nelectromagnetic counterparts of GW sources is crucial for multi-messenger\nastronomy, one way of which is to use galaxy catalogues to guide optical\nfollow-up observations. In this paper, we test the utility of galaxy-targeted\napproach with mass prioritised galaxy ranking for the ongoing LIGO O4 run. We\nhave used the simulated results for the expected LIGO O4 events and the NED-LVS\ngalaxy catalogue and based our study for small field of view telescopes,\nspecifically the GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). With the increase in sensitivity\nof LIGO/Virgo in the ongoing observing run O4, the expected number of total\ndetections have gone up but most of these are also now poorly localised. We\nshow that a larger volume covered in the same field-of-view (FoV) on the sky\nresults in a large increase in the total number of galaxies in each FoV. A\nsignificant top-heaviness is observed in the mass-ranked list of galaxies,\nwhich still number to a few thousand in most cases. At larger distances, such\nhigh numbers of deep follow-up observations are infeasible in most cases\nrendering galaxy catalogues useful in limited cases, but these are still useful\nat lower distances where LVK detectors are currently sensitive and where galaxy\ncompleteness is higher. We also explore the effect of mass-filling to account\nfor galaxy catalogue incompleteness at large distances. If mass-filled\nprobabilities are considered as the metric for ranking and coverage, we find\nthat the conventional 2D probability search performs better than a 3D galaxy\ncatalogue (without mass-filling) based search at distances larger than 300 Mpc\n(upto which NED-LVS is ~70% complete), and using 3D mass times probability in\neach tile performs better for nearby events.",

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary discs around Very Low Mass Stars (VLMS) show hydrocarbon-rich\nMIR spectra indicative of C/O>1 in their inner discs, in contrast to discs\naround higher-mass hosts which mostly show O-bearing species. One scenario\nproposed to elevate C/O in VLMS inner discs is the advection of O-depleted gas\nfrom the outer disc. However, if CO gas remains abundant, C/O can be at most\n~1. We test if chemical transformation of CO into other species allows this\ntransport scenario to produce C/O significantly above 1. We track the evolving\ninner disc C/H and O/H with a 1D disc evolution code. We model the transport of\nmolecules in gas and ice and add conversions of species to represent key\nreaction pathways at the midplane. We explore the role of disc mass, size,\nionization rate, and substructures. The inner disc C/O increases over time due\nto sequential delivery where O-rich species (e.g. H2O) give way to C-rich\nspecies (e.g. CH4). To reach C/O>1, separating C and O is key, hence the\nliberation of C from gaseous CO by He+ is critical. Ionization drives this\nchemistry and needs rates >~10^-17 s^-1 for VLMSs for sufficient chemical\nevolution within a disc lifetime. However, <~10^-17 s^-1 is needed to ensure\nthat C/O stays <1 for the first few Myr in T Tauri discs. While C/O is usually\nhigher for VLMS than T Tauri stars due to faster sequential delivery, C/O\nsignificantly above 1 is only produced by combining gas-phase CO destruction\nwith gas advection and radial drift. Sufficient O depletion and hydrocarbon\nproduction around VLMSs can then be achieved but may imply higher ionization\nrates than T Tauris. Observations of older discs may distinguish whether higher\nionization rates are indeed needed or faster physical evolution timescales\nalone are sufficient. CH3OH ice photodissociation at a dust trap between the\nCH3OH and CH4 snowlines may also liberate C as CH4 gas that can enrich the\ninner disc.",

Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22\nTHz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted\nbehavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs\nmechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz\nexhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode\nintensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking\nsuggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the\nsplitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via\nparametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two\nphotons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason\ncompetes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency.

More recently, attention has shifted to visual\nquestion answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily\nfocused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic\ncategories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce\nMapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three\nmap types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning\ntopics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple\nMLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against\none another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact\nof map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs,\nand removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and\nsensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and\npotential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.",

A computationally simpler alternative\nis to use the gravitational dual to derive the effective action of the boundary\ntheory in a derivative expansion, and then solve the resulting\nlower-dimensional equations of motion. Once the effective action, typically\ntruncated at two derivatives, is obtained, the holographic theory can be set\naside, and bubble solutions can be found from ordinary differential equations.\nIn this paper, we test this approach in a simple holographic setup: a probe\nscalar field in a black brane background with nonlinear multi-trace boundary\nconditions. We compute critical bubble solutions both from the effective action\nand by solving the full gravitational equations, and find good agreement\nbetween the two methods.",

Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and\nautomated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs\nare not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative\non-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on\ntwo-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal\ncar-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral\nlane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human\nfactors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a\nHCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based\non the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model\nbased on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the\nelitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and\nefficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation.

Using VLT/UVES\nand HST/COS quasar spectra, we analyse MgI, MgII, HI, CII, CIII, and OVI\nabsorption relative to galaxy rotation curves from Keck/LRIS and Magellan/MagE\nspectra. We find that at lower $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir}\\leq 0.2$), over 80% of\nabsorption in all ions lies on the side of systemic velocity matching disk\nrotation, and the optical-depth-weighted median velocity ($v_{abs}$) is\nconsistent with the peak rotation speed. At higher $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir} >\n0.2$), the kinematics diverge by ionisation state: For low ionisation gas, the\namount of co-rotating absorption remains >80%, yet $v_{abs}$ drops to 60% of\nthe galaxy rotation speed. For high ionisation gas (OVI), only 60% of the\nabsorption is consistent with co-rotation and $v_{abs}$ drops to 20% of the\nrotation speed. Furthermore, the velocity widths, corresponding to 50% of the\ntotal optical depth ($\\Delta v_{50}$) for low ionisation gas is 1.8 times\nlarger in the inner halo than at larger radii, while for CIII and OVI $\\Delta\nv_{50}$ remains unchanged with distance. These results suggest a radially\ndependent CGM kinematic structure: the inner halo hosts cool, dynamically broad\ngas tightly coupled to disk rotation, whereas beyond 0.2$R_{vir}$, particularly\ntraced by OVI and HI, the CGM shows weaker rotational alignment and lower\nvelocity dispersion. Therefore, low-ionisation gas likely traces extended\nco-rotating gas, inflows and/or recycled accretion, while high-ionisation gas\nreflects a mixture of co-rotating, lagging, discrete collisionally ionised\nstructures, indicating a kinematic stratification of the multi-phase CGM.\n[Abridged]",

    "abstract": "The detection of planets in protoplanetary disks has proven to be extremely\nchallenging. In contrast, rings and gaps, usually attributed to planet-disk\ninteractions, have been found in virtually every large protoplanetary (Class\nII) disk observed at 0.9-1.3 mm with sufficient spatial resolution (5 au). The\nnearby disk around MP Mus (PDS 66) stands as an exception to this rule, and its\nadvanced age (7-10 Myr) is particularly difficult to reconcile with its\napparent lack of substructures. Despite the disk's smooth appearance, Gaia data\nof MP Mus show a significant proper motion anomaly, signalling the presence of\na companion. Here we present ALMA 3 mm observations of the system with\ncomparable high spatial resolution to previous 1.3 mm data. The new\nobservations pierce deeper into the disk midplane and reveal an inner cavity\n(<3 au) and a ring at 10 au. The disk structure inferred from ALMA observations\nnarrows down the properties of the companion to a gas giant orbiting at 1-3 au,\nand hydrodynamic simulations further confirm that such a planet can produce the\nobserved cavity. These independent pieces of evidence constitute an indirect\nbut compelling detection of an exoplanet within a protoplanetary disk using\nGaia astrometry. MP Mus is the first system in which undetected substructures\nare revealed thanks to the lower optical depths at longer wavelengths,\nsuggesting that rings and gaps are even more abundant than what is currently\nbelieved.",

Although over 30\nsuch quasars are now known at $z > 5.5$, the signal remains elusive in\npractice, owing to instrumental noise, the intrinsic weakness of the absorption\nfeatures, and the limited brightness of available background sources. Recent\nstudies have focused on the one-dimensional transmission power spectrum as a\nstatistical observable, but this approach also demands high signal-to-noise\nratios. Here, we present a systematic comparison of five inference pipelines\nfor recovering IGM parameters from mock 21-cm forest spectra at $z = 6$,\nincorporating realistic instrumental noise and telescope characteristics. We\nshow that likelihood-free inference based on machine learning substantially\noutperforms traditional Bayesian methods. In particular, our most effective\nmethod dispenses with the power spectrum entirely: we use a convolutional U-Net\nto extract a latent-space encoding of the input spectrum and perform parameter\nregression using XGBoost. This approach yields accurate constraints on the IGM\nneutral fraction and X-ray heating efficiency even with a single 50-hour uGMRT\nsightline, which is an orders-of-magnitude improvement in integration time\nrelative to existing techniques. We publicly release our code, training data,\nand models. Beyond the 21-cm forest, these results underscore the promise of\nhybrid deep learning and gradient-boosted inference techniques for extracting\nphysical information from low-SNR data across astrophysics.",

We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss\nproperties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO,\n$^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an\nextremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex\nmorphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the\ncircumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known\nextreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection\nmechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be\npartially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s)\ndetached equatorial component with $M{\\sim}0.05$ $M_{\\odot}$ and a slow (10\nkm/s) spherical envelope with $\\dot{M}\\sim3\\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$.

In this\nstudy, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy\nformation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine\nAGN at high redshift (z > 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the\nMillenniumTNG simulation.

Ionizing photons are primarily\nproduced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive\nreionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original\nIllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1,\nresulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty\ngrowth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching.

The emergence of scaling laws and foundation models\nin other domains has inspired the development of \"depth foundation models\":\ndeep neural networks trained on large datasets with strong zero-shot\ngeneralization capabilities. This paper surveys the evolution of deep learning\narchitectures and paradigms for depth estimation across the monocular, stereo,\nmulti-view, and monocular video settings. We explore the potential of these\nmodels to address existing challenges and provide a comprehensive overview of\nlarge-scale datasets that can facilitate their development. By identifying key\narchitectures and training strategies, we aim to highlight the path towards\nrobust depth foundation models, offering insights into their future research\nand applications.",

In the years that followed, the dark matter\nhypothesis as an explanation for dark matter phenomenology attracted far more\nattention compared to the hypothesis of modified gravity, and the latter is\nlargely regarded today as a non-viable alternative. The present article takes\nan integrated history and philosophy of science approach in order to identify\nthe reasons why the scientific community mainly pursued the dark matter\nhypothesis in the years that followed, as opposed to modified gravity. A\nplausible answer is given in terms of three epistemic criteria for the\npursuitworthiness of a hypothesis: (a) its problem-solving potential, (b) its\ncompatibility with established theories and the feasibility of incorporation,\nand (c) its independent testability. A further comparison between the problem\nof dark matter and the problem of dark energy is also presented, explaining why\nin the latter case the situation is different, and modified gravity is still\nconsidered a viable possibility.",

First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,\nwhich limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character\nundergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing\ndetails become evident.

We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame\ncolour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate\n-- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with\nzero, across low ($0.05<z<0.5$) and high ($0.8<z<1.55$) redshifts. In order to\nconstruct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain\nmaximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment\nwith colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the\namplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated\nwith stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between $0<z<1.5$,\ntrends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments\nwe measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion\npaper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA\nsignals with significant detections, including model comparison.

Our work unveils a sharp threshold in the discretization across\nwhich qualitatively continuum dynamics from the dam breaks are observed.\nFurthermore, we observe a rich multitude of wave patterns in the small coupling\nlimit including unsteady (and stationary) Whitham shocks, traveling DSWs,\ndiscrete NLS kinks and dark solitary waves, among others. Besides, we uncover\nthe phenomena of DSW breakdown and the subsequent formation of multi-phase\nwavetrains, due to generalized modulational instability of \\textit{two-phase}\nwavetrains. We envision this work as a starting point towards a deeper dive\ninto the apparently rich DSW phenomenology in a wide class of DNLS models\nacross different dimensions and for different nonlinearities.",

    "abstract": "The development of scientific data analyses is a resource-intensive process\nthat often yields results with untapped potential for reuse and\nreinterpretation. In many cases, a developed analysis can be used to measure\nmore than it was designed for, by changing its input data or parametrization.\nExisting reinterpretation frameworks, such as RECAST, enable analysis\nreinterpretation by preserving the analysis implementation to allow for changes\nof particular parts of the input data. We introduce FlexCAST, which generalizes\nthis concept by preserving the analysis design itself, supporting changes to\nthe entire input data and analysis parametrization. FlexCAST is based on three\ncore principles: modularity, validity, and robustness. Modularity enables a\nchange of the input data and parametrization, while validity ensures that the\nobtained results remain meaningful, and robustness ensures that as many\nconfigurations as possible yield meaningful results. While not being limited to\ndata-driven machine learning techniques, FlexCAST is particularly valuable for\nthe reinterpretation of analyses in this context, where changes in the input\ndata can significantly impact the parametrization of the analysis. Using a\nstate-of-the-art anomaly detection analysis on LHC-like data, we showcase\nFlexCAST's core principles and demonstrate how it can expand the reach of\nscientific data analysis through flexible reuse and reinterpretation.",

Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm\nfor unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common\ntheoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which\ncovers them both.

Motivated by this\nquestion, we study the associated Threshold problem: deciding whether there\nexists a correlated equilibrium whose value exceeds a given threshold. We prove\nthat this problem is PSPACE-hard for NFCE in multiplayer extensive-form games\nwith perfect recall, even for fixed thresholds. To contextualize this result,\nwe also establish the complexity of the Threshold problem for Nash equilibria\nin this setting, showing it is ER-complete. These results uncover a surprising\ncomplexity reversal: while optimal correlated equilibria are computationally\nsimpler than optimal Nash in normal-form games, the opposite holds in\nextensive-form games, where computing optimal correlated equilibria is provably\nharder. Building on this line of inquiry, we also address a related question by\n[VSF08], who introduced the notions of extensive-form correlated equilibrium\n(EFCE) and agent-form correlated equilibrium (AFCE). They asked how difficult\nthe Threshold problem is for AFCE; we answer this question by proving that it\nis NP-hard, even in two-player games without chance nodes. Complementing our\nhardness results, we establish tight complexity classifications for the\nThreshold problem across several correlated equilibrium concepts - including\nEFCE, AFCE, normal-form coarse, extensive-form coarse, and agent-form coarse\ncorrelated equilibria. For each of these solution concepts in multiplayer\nstochastic extensive-form games with perfect recall, we prove NP-completeness\nby providing matching NP upper bounds to the previously known hardness results.\nTogether, our results provide the most complete landscape to date for the\ncomplexity of optimal equilibrium computation in extensive-form games.",

The star-forming clumps exhibit\nlow values of velocity shear (~12 km/s) and high velocity dispersion (~70\nkm/s). The dynamical masses of the clumps are typically higher than gas masses\ninferred from the measured star-formation rates of each clump.

The\nclosing of the cavity generates a thrust-producing jet. Our previous\nexperimental study (Mahulkar and Arakeri, PRF, 2024) compared the flow fields\nof the clapping body in two cases: free-moving (dynamic) and\nforward-constrained (stationary). The experiments revealed significant\ndifferences in body motion and flow structures. This numerical study further\ninvestigates these differences using plate motion data from the experiments.\nOur computations show that, in dynamic cases, interplate cavity pressure is\nlower than in stationary cases. A basic unsteady Bernoulli analysis explains\nthat forward acceleration reduces interplate pressure. Furthermore, stationary\ncases exhibit distinct vortex dynamics, with starting vortex tubes forming at\nthe plate edges and reconnecting with stopping vortex tubes to form triangular\nvortex loops in the rear wake, along with two sideways-oriented ringlets. In\ndynamic cases, the starting vortex tubes slide backward and reconnect with\nbound-vorticity threads shed from the outer surface of the plates, forming\nelliptical loops that reconnect circumferentially. Referring to Sullivan et al.\n(JFM, 2008), we quantify the energy deficit in isolated axisymmetric vortex\nrings using separate simulations and propose a model for the potential energy\nin the vortex core at the formation time. Using this model, we show that the\ntotal wake energy (kinetic + potential) equals the initial slug energy for the\nvortex ring, and in clapping, it equals the work done on the fluid by the\npressure torque on the plates.",

While these planning stages are\ntraditionally addressed sequentially, their interdependencies often lead to\nsuboptimal vehicle usage. We propose the VCR-PESP, an integrated formulation\nthat minimizes fleet size while ensuring feasible and infrastructure-compliant\nperiodic timetables. We present the first Satisfiability Modulo Theories\n(SMT)-based method for the VCR-PESP to solve the resulting large-scale\ninstances. Unlike the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which requires time\ndiscretisation, SMT supports continuous time via difference constraints,\neliminating the trade-off between temporal precision and encoding size. Our\napproach avoids rounding artifacts and scales effectively, outperforming both\nSAT and Mixed Integer Program (MIP) models across non-trivial instances. Using\nreal-world data from the Swiss narrow-gauge operator RhB, we conduct extensive\nexperiments to assess the impact of time discretisation, vehicle circulation\nstrategies, route flexibility, and planning integration. We show that discrete\nmodels inflate vehicle requirements and that fully integrated solutions\nsubstantially reduce fleet needs compared to sequential approaches. Our\nframework consistently delivers high-resolution solutions with tractable\nruntimes, even in large and complex networks. By combining modeling accuracy\nwith scalable solver technology, this work establishes SMT as a powerful tool\nfor integrated railway planning.

Addressing key methodological\ngaps in existing literature, the analysis leverages Retrofitted Word Embeddings\nto encode discrete emotional cues tailored to ESG-relevant narratives. Unlike\nprior studies that rely on lexicon-based or transformer-based models, this\napproach explicitly incorporates domain-specific emotional semantics while\naccounting for firm-level heterogeneity and temporal sentiment fluctuations.\nUsing a dataset of 16 multinational firms and sentiment data extracted from\nSeeking Alpha headlines, the study tests three hypotheses: (1) emotion-specific\nsentiment independently predicts stock returns; (2) the moderating effect of\nsentiment varies across ESG dimensions; and (3) positive (negative) sentiment\namplifies (dampens) ESG performance effects. The analysis implements a dual\nsentiment aggregation strategy and introduces a triple-significance filtering\ncriterion to identify robust interactions. Results support Hypotheses 1 and 2,\nwith emotions such as anticipation and trust showing consistent associations\nwith return variation across firms and ESG categories. However, findings for\nHypothesis 3 are mixed: while some sentiment-ESG combinations align with\ntheoretical expectations, many contradictory interactions exhibit stronger\neffects. In this study, retrofitted embeddings outperform the NRC Emotion\nLexicon in explaining stock return variation within ESG-sentiment interaction\nmodels, underscoring the value of emotional nuance in ESG-finance modeling.\nThese results underscore the importance of emotion-sensitive sentiment modeling\nin understanding investor behavior and ESG-related stock price movements.",

Recent studies estimate the stellar (and system)\nlifetime as 3 Gyr, which is significantly longer than the tidal migration\ntimescale. We show that exomoons are unlikely to survive around K2-18b due to\nrapid tidal-driven migration, casting doubt on moon-based habitability\nscenarios for short-period M-dwarf planets in general.",

Despite extensive research, current jamming detection methods often\nrely on simulated data or proprietary over-the-air datasets with limited\ncross-layer features, failing to accurately represent the real state of a\nnetwork and thus limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce JamShield, a dynamic jamming detection\nsystem trained on our own collected over-the-air and publicly available\ndataset.

Our experimental\nresults demonstrate significant improvements in detection rate, precision, and\nrecall, along with reduced false alarms and misdetections compared to\nstate-of-the-art detection algorithms, making JamShield a robust and reliable\nsolution for detecting jamming attacks in real-world wireless networks.",

    "abstract": "Three core tenets of reinforcement learning (RL)--concerning the definition\nof agency, the objective of learning, and the scope of the reward\nhypothesis--have been highlighted as key targets for conceptual revision, with\nmajor implications for theory and application. We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from\norigins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication\noffer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained\nreinforcement learning in biological systems.",

Conventional\ndecoders designed for worst-case error scenarios incur significant overhead,\nprompting the development of local decoders, that leverage the sparse and often\ntrivial nature of many quantum errors, to support the conventional decoders.\nThe previously proposed Clique decoder addresses this by handling isolated,\nlength-1 space and time errors within the cryogenic environment with minimal\nhardware costs, thereby mitigating I/O bandwidth constraints between cryogenic\nquantum systems and room-temperature processors. Building on this foundation,\nwe propose Clique_L2 that extends the Clique-based approach by relaxing some\noriginal constraints and incorporating additional low-cost logic to also\ncorrect length-2 error chains in space, which become non-trivial occurrences at\nhigher physical error rates and code distances. This enhanced capability not\nonly further reduces out-of-the-fridge data transmission but also adapts more\neffectively to clustered errors observed under a variety of noise models.\nSpecifically, under data-qubit-only errors and uniformly random noise,\nClique_L2 achieves up to 8.95x decoding bandwidth reduction over the original\nClique (or Clique_L1) decoder, especially beneficial at higher code distances.\nWhen clustered errors and longer error chains are more likely to occur,\nClique_L2 achieves up to 18.3x decoding bandwidth reduction over Clique_L1,\nachieving substantial benefits across a wide range of physical qubit error\nrates.",

If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in\nLSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method\nthat combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift\nspace distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on\ndark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations.\nLT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns\nquasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then\nthe NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales.\nThe method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant\nperformance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN\nalone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger\ncorrelations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately.\nThe hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and\nhalo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to\nNN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and\nquasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation\nfunctions.

While some\nartificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black\nboxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these\nmodels typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level\ncontext. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven\nRelational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic\ntask from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and\nranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a\npatient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological\nfeatures. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these\nreports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based\non the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a\nretrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of\ndeep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies\nconfirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational\nranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant\nperformance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our\nwork demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning\nthrough a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and\neffective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.",

We identify several key\ntimescales relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics and quantify them using the SE\nand SPI approaches. The shortest timescale corresponds to equilibration in a\nwell at time $t \\ll \\tau_{\\rm B}$, where $\\tau_{\\rm B}$ is the Brownian\ndiffusion time. The second important timescale is when an inflexion point\nappears in the effective potential constructed from the density at $t\n\\lessapprox \\tau_{\\rm B}$. Shortly after, the existence of a second potential\nwell can be inferred from sufficient sampling of the dynamics. Interestingly,\nthis timescale decreases with increasing barrier height. We find significant\ndeviations from the equilibrium limit unless $t \\gg \\tau_{\\rm B}$. We further\ncalculate \\red{the} density current at the barrier for bistable and asymmetric\npotentials and find that it crosses over to that from equilibrium rate theory\nat a time that does not appear to depend on the barrier height.

In many\napplications of medical synchrotrons, such as microdosimetry and ion imaging,\nprecise knowledge of the spill structure and instantaneous particle rate is\ncrucial. Conventional ionization chambers, while omnipresent in clinical\nsettings, suffer from limitations in charge resolution and integration time,\nmaking single-particle detection at high dose rates unfeasible. To address\nthese limitations, we present a beam detection setup based on a silicon carbide\n(SiC) sensor and a monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC), capable of\ndetecting single particles with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) pulse\nduration of 500 ps. At the MedAustron ion therapy center, we characterized the\nspill structure of proton and carbon-ion beams delivered to the irradiation\nroom beyond the timescale of the maximum ion revolution frequency in the\nsynchrotron. The resulting data offer valuable insights into the beam intensity\nat small time scales and demonstrate the capabilities of SiC-based systems for\nhigh-flux beam monitoring.",

There has been\nremarkable progress in the past several decades, through various different\nattempts. However, the decay character theory for partially dissipative\nhyperbolic systems remains largely open, as the Fourier transform of Green's\nfunction is generally not explicit in multi-dimensions. In this paper, we\npropose a general $L^p$ energy method and provide the positive answer to the\nunsolved question left in [5]. Under the convex entropy and Shizuta-Kawashima\nconditions, we pinpoint the critical regularity for the global solutions to the\npartially dissipative systems in the hybrid Besov spaces with different\nexponents on conservative and dissipative components in low and high\nfrequencies, from the viewpoint of spectral analysis and the $L^1$ time\nintegrability of Lipschitz bound. Furthermore, a new effective quantity\n$\\Psi(t,x)$ capturing the interaction of conservative and dissipative\ncomponents is introduced, which enables us to establish the sharp\ncharacterization of large-time asymptotic behavior. Finally, we also show that,\nwith faster orders of convergence, the conservative and dissipative components\nof solutions can be asymptotically approximated by new profiles generated from\nparabolic systems subjected to $\\Psi_0$ (the initial effective quantity), in\nthe spirit of Chapman-Enskog expansion.",

Given a graph and\ntwo dominating sets of equal size $k$, the {\\em Dominating Set Reconfiguration\nwith Token sliding} (DSR-TS) problem asks whether one can, by iteratively\nreplacing a vertex by an adjacent one, transform the first set into the second\none, while ensuring that every set during the reconfiguration process is a\ndominating set.\n  The token jumping variant, where a vertex can be replaced by a non-adjacent\none, is known to be efficiently solvable on many graph classes such as planar,\nbounded treewidth, and the very broad notion of nowhere-dense classes of\ngraphs. Alternatively, some algorithms also exist for the reconfiguration of\nindependent sets in the token sliding paradigm for graph classes with bounded\ndegree or large girth.\n  We show that DSR-TS is W[2]-hard when parameterized $k$, the pathwidth of the\ninstance, and the iteration of the reconfiguration sequence (a recently\nintroduced parameter).

    "abstract": "Gamma-ray binaries present emission that is variable and can reach UHE. The\nprocesses behind the acceleration of the particles that produce this very\nenergetic radiation are yet to be understood. We probe the properties of the\nparticle accelerator and the UHE photon emitter in the gamma-ray binary LS\n5039. From the properties of the binary system and the UHE radiation detected\nby HAWC, we used analytical tools to investigate how these properties constrain\nthe emission and acceleration regions, namely the role of synchrotron losses,\nparticle confinement, and the accelerated particle spectrum, and propose an\nacceleration scenario that can relax the derived constraints. The modest target\ndensities for hadronic processes and the overall gamma-ray orbital variability\nfavor IC scattering of ultraviolet photons from the massive companion star by\nhighly relativistic e-. The acceleration of the highest energy e- implies a\nconstraint on synchrotron cooling in the accelerator, which can set an upper\nlimit on its magnetic field. Moreover, the detected variability requires very\nstrong particle confinement in both the acceleration and emitter, which sets a\nlower limit on their magnetic fields that is barely consistent with the\nsynchrotron cooling constraint from acceleration. Synchrotron losses may be\nhigher in the emitter if it is separated from the accelerator, but this\nrequires a very hard particle injection spectrum. An accelerator based on an\nultrarelativistic outflow can alleviate these requirements. A scenario for LS\n5039 as that proposed by Derishev et al., in which an ultrarelativistic\nmagnetized outflow accelerates leptons injected within the outflow by\ngammagamma absorption, provides a viable mechanism to accelerate very energetic\ne-. This mechanism relaxes the acceleration and confinement requirements by\nreducing the impact of synchrotron cooling, and can generate the required e-\nspectrum.",

Integrating\nout the massive states leads to a scalar-tensor EFT describing the massless\ngraviton and scalar degrees of freedom. Using the on-shell amplitude methods\nand the spinor-helicity formalism, we match the two frameworks at one loop, so\nas to express the EFT Wilson coefficients in terms of the UV masses and\ncoupling. We explore the space of the operators generated in the EFT, including\nthe ones related to the scalar Gauss-Bonnet (SGB) and dynamical Chern-Simons\n(DCS) gravity theories. We demonstrate that, within our setup, the SGB\ninteractions are always generated with shift-symmetry breaking operators. This\nis in contrast to the DCS case, where there is a unique choice that preserves\nthe shift symmetry in the IR, corresponding to a theory of spin 1/2 fermions\nand a complex scalar with a Peccei-Quinn global symmetry.",

    "abstract": "Solving chance-constrained optimal control problems for systems subject to\nnon-stationary uncertainties is a significant challenge.Conventional robust\nmodel predictive control (MPC) often yields excessive conservatism by relying\non static worst-case assumptions, while standard stochastic MPC methods\nstruggle when underlying uncertainty distributions are unknown a priori.This\narticle presents a Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC (RAAR-MPC) framework,a\nhierarchical architecture that systematically orchestrates a novel synthesis of\nproactive, learning-based risk assessment and reactive risk regulation. The\nframework employs a medium-frequency risk assessment engine, which leverages\nGaussian process regression and active learning, to construct a tight,\ndata-driven characterization of the prediction error set from operational\ndata.Concurrently, a low-timescale outer loop implements a self-correcting\nupdate law for an adaptive safety margin to precisely regulate the empirical\nrisk and compensate for unmodeled dynamics.This dual-timescale adaptation\nenables the system to rigorously satisfy chance constraints with a user-defined\nprobability, while minimizing the conservatism inherent in traditional\napproaches.We formally establish that the interplay between these adaptive\ncomponents guarantees recursive feasibility and ensures the closed-loop system\nsatisfies the chance constraints up to a user-defined risk level with high\nprobability.Numerical experiments on a benchmark DC-DC converter under\nnon-stationary parametric uncertainties demonstrate that our framework\nprecisely achieves the target risk level, resulting in a significantly lower\naverage cost compared to state-of-the-art robust and stochastic MPC strategies.",

In addition, boosting algorithms\nhave demonstrated exceptional performance across diverse learning problems,\nprimarily due to their ability to focus on hard-to-learn instances and\niteratively reduce residual errors. This makes them a promising approach for\nlearning multi-task problems. However, real-world MTL scenarios often involve\ntasks that are not well-aligned (known as outlier or adversarial tasks), which\ndo not share beneficial similarities with others and can, in fact, deteriorate\nthe performance of the overall model. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nRobust-Multi-Task Gradient Boosting (R-MTGB), a novel boosting framework that\nexplicitly models and adapts to task heterogeneity during training. R-MTGB\nstructures the learning process into three sequential blocks: (1) learning\nshared patterns, (2) partitioning tasks into outliers and non-outliers with\nregularized parameters, and (3) fine-tuning task-specific predictors. This\narchitecture enables R-MTGB to automatically detect and penalize outlier tasks\nwhile promoting effective knowledge transfer among related tasks. Our method\nintegrates these mechanisms seamlessly within gradient boosting, allowing\nrobust handling of noisy or adversarial tasks without sacrificing accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our approach successfully isolates outliers, transfers\nknowledge, and consistently reduces prediction errors for each task\nindividually, and achieves overall performance gains across all tasks. These\nresults highlight robustness, adaptability, and reliable convergence of R-MTGB\nin challenging MTL environments.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted\nextensive attentions in the sensing field due to their theoretically ultra-high\nresonance quality factors (Q-factors). Among them, Friedrich-Wintgen (F-W)\nBICs, which arise from the interference between different coupled modes, are\nparticularly promising for acoustic sensing applications owing to the easy\nrealization. Most existing F-W BICs are realized in open systems through the\ninterference between waveguides and resonant cavities. However, with increasing\ndemands for higher resolution and sensitivity in modern chemical and biological\nsensing, the practically measured Q-factors of conventional open-system F-W\nBICs often fall short of expectations.In this work, we introduce F-P resonance\nvia acoustic-solid coupling to explore the formation mechanism and realization\nmethod of high-Q F-W BICs in quasi-closed systems, and further investigate\ntheir application in gas sensing. A coupled resonator model combining elastic\nand acoustic waves in a quasi-closed cavity is first established. Coupled mode\ntheory is employed to calculate the eigenmodes of both localized and radiative\nmodes. Based on this, the Hamiltonian matrix of the coupled system is\nconstructed, from which the acoustic transmission spectrum is derived. The\nresults show that the Q-factor of the F-W BIC induced by acoustic-solid\ncoupling is significantly higher than that of open systems, which is further\nvalidated by experiments.Based on this, a gas concentration sensing technique\nbased on acoustic-solid coupled F-W BIC behavior is developed. A sensing device\nis fabricated accordingly, and gas concentration measurements are carried out.\nExperimental results demonstrate a pronounced response to gases with different\nconcentrations, confirming the feasibility and reliability of this novel gas\nsensing approach.",

Specifically,\nutilizing sparse/incomplete measured data, a time-dependent optimization\nproblem is formulated for determining the expansion coefficients of an\nassociated low-dimensional representation of the stochastic wind field.\nCompared to an alternative, standard, compressive sampling treatment of the\nproblem, the developed methodology exhibits the following advantages. First,\nthe Bayesian formulation enables also the quantification of the uncertainty in\nthe estimates. Second, the requirement in standard CS-based applications for an\na priori selection of the expansion basis is circumvented. Instead, this is\ndone herein in an adaptive manner based on the acquired data. Overall, the\nmethodology exhibits enhanced extrapolation accuracy, even in cases of\nhigh-dimensional data of arbitrary form, and of relatively large extrapolation\ndistances. Thus, it can be used, potentially, in a wide range of wind\nengineering applications where various constraints dictate the use of a limited\nnumber of sensors.

We propose a\nnovel practical decoder, referred to as maximum likelihood matching pursuit\n(MLMP), which greedily finds the support of the codewords of users with partial\nmaximum likelihood metrics. As opposed to the conventional\nsuccessive-cancellation based greedy algorithms, MLMP works as a\nsuccessive-combining energy detector. We also propose MLMP modifications to\nimprove the performance at high code rates. Our studies in short block lengths\nshow that, even without any channel state information, SPARC with MLMP decoder\nachieves multi-user diversity in some scenarios, giving better error\nperformance with multiple users than that of the corresponding single-user\ncase.

The stiffness\nof the NS core matter has shown a minor effect on the tidal deformability of\nsuch NS ($M<\\text{M}_{\\odot}$). An opposite behavior is obtained as an increase\nin the tidal Love number but a decrease in the more effective compactness of NS\n($M>\\text{M}_{\\odot}$), upon increasing (decreasing) the stiffness of the\nemployed EOS (its mass). This appears as enhanced tidal deformability indicated\nat a larger radius for NS of stiffer NM and for the lighter NS above\n$\\text{M}_{\\odot}$.

In this work, we study the interplay of collider, direct and\nindirect detection constraints on an extension of the dark Abelian Higgs model\nthat includes a Dirac fermionic DM candidate, $\\chi$. We take into account in a\nconsistent fashion the dilution of the indirect and direct detection signals\nwhen the relic abundance of $\\chi$ is smaller than the total observed DM\ndensity (assuming that it is a subdominant component in those cases). As a\nconsequence, we show that indirect detection constraints cannot probe regions\nwith large kinetic mixing, and direct detection experiments provide the leading\nconstraints in most of the parameter space. Collider searches for the\n(invisibly decaying) vector mediator provide complementary bounds in areas with\nlarge kinetic mixing. We find that the only way to avoid both indirect and\ndirect detection limits is in narrow windows of parameter space close to\n$m_\\chi\\lesssim m_{Z_D}/2$, when $\\chi$ is produced resonantly in the early\nuniverse, and it can constitute all of the DM. For this to happen, a small dark\nsector coupling is required: $\\alpha_D~\\lesssim10^{-3}$ for DM masses below $6$\nGeV, or $\\alpha_D~\\lesssim10^{-5}$ for DM masses larger than $10$ GeV.

    "abstract": "Training neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) typically relies on\nbackpropagation (BP), necessitating storage of activations from the forward\npass for subsequent backward updates. Furthermore, backpropagating error\nsignals through multiple layers often leads to vanishing or exploding\ngradients, which can degrade learning performance and stability. We propose a\nnovel approach that trains each layer of the neural network using local signals\nduring the forward pass in RL settings. Our approach introduces local,\nlayer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from\nmulti-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance. This\nmethod allows each hidden layer to be trained using local signals computed\nduring forward propagation, thus eliminating the need for backward passes and\nstoring intermediate activations. Our experiments, conducted with policy\ngradient methods across common RL benchmarks, demonstrate that this\nbackpropagation-free method achieves competitive performance compared to their\nclassical BP-based counterpart. Additionally, the proposed method enhances\nstability and consistency within and across runs, and improves performance\nespecially in challenging environments.",

Unstructured\ndata, which lacks a predefined format, encompasses various forms such as\nemails, reports, and scans. It is estimated to constitute approximately 80% of\nenterprise data. Despite the valuable insights it can offer, extracting\nmeaningful information from unstructured data is more complex compared to\nstructured data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has gained popularity for\nautomating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, and reducing errors.\nHowever, RPA is traditionally reliant on structured data, limiting its\napplication to processes involving unstructured documents. This study addresses\nthis limitation by developing the UNstructured Document REtrieval SyStem\n(UNDRESS), a system that uses fuzzy regular expressions, techniques for natural\nlanguage processing, and large language models to enable RPA platforms to\neffectively retrieve information from unstructured documents. The research\ninvolved the design and development of a prototype system, and its subsequent\nevaluation based on text extraction and information retrieval performance. The\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of UNDRESS in enhancing RPA capabilities\nfor unstructured data, providing a significant advancement in the field. The\nfindings suggest that this system could facilitate broader RPA adoption across\nprocesses traditionally hindered by unstructured data, thereby improving\noverall business process efficiency.",

The model endogenously identifies the worst\nregional Dunkelflaute events, prolonged periods of low wind and solar\navailability, and incorporates multiple extreme weather realizations within a\nsingle optimization run. Results show that system costs rise nonlinearly with\nthe geographic extent of these events: a single worst-case regional disruption\nincreases costs by 9%, but broader disruptions across multiple regions lead to\nmuch sharper increases, up to 51%. As Dunkelflaute conditions extend across\nmost of Europe, additional cost impacts level off, with a maximum increase of\n71%. The optimal technology mix evolves with the severity of weather stress:\nwhile renewables, batteries, and interregional transmission are sufficient to\nmanage localized events, large-scale disruptions require long-term hydrogen\nstorage and load shedding to maintain system resilience. Central European\nregions, especially Germany and France, emerge as systemic bottlenecks, while\nperipheral regions bear the cost of compensatory overbuilding. These findings\nunderscore the need for a coordinated European policy strategy that goes beyond\nnational planning to support cross-border infrastructure investment, scale up\nflexible technologies such as long-duration storage, and promote a\ngeographically balanced deployment of renewables to mitigate systemic risks\nassociated with Dunkelflaute events.",

The goal of the GP\nmagnetometry investigation is to identify magnetic anomalies that cannot be\nreadily explained in terms of a natural or human-made origin, and analyze these\njointly with the data collected from the other modalities. These include an\nensemble of visible and infrared cameras, a broadband acoustic system and a\nweather-monitoring system.

    "abstract": "We investigate the impact of magnetic flux and the odd-even parity of lattice\npoints $N$ on electron transport in an annular Kitaev chain, with an\nexplanation provided from the energy band perspective. Three transport\nmechanisms including direct transmission (DT), local Andreev reflection (LAR)\nand crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) are considered. In particular, the\nconnection configuration of electrodes to different lattice sites is studied,\nwhere the case that the two electrodes connected to the sites are aligned along\na diameter is called as symmetric connection and otherwise as asymmetric\nconnections. For even $N$ and asymmetric connection, the vanished LAR and CAR\nin symmetric connection will emerge as peaks. A more prominent observation is\nthat the symmetry of the two resonant peaks due to DT processes located at\n$\\phi = \\pi/3$ and $\\phi = 2\\pi/3$ for symmetric connection will be broken, and\nthe peak at $\\phi = \\pi/3$ will be largely reduced, where $\\phi$ is the\nmagnetic flux per site. Moreover, the peaks around $\\phi = \\pi/3$ due to LAR\nand CAR processes grows drastically even larger than that from DT. For LAR and\nCAR processes, there is no peak around $\\phi = 2\\pi/3$ and transmission due to\nthese two processes are completely suppressed for $\\phi>\\pi/2$. Moreover, it is\nfound that the energy bands vary with $\\phi$ in a period of $\\pi$ and $2\\pi$\nfor even or odd $N$. These behaviors reflect a complicated competition from DT,\nLAR and CAR processes and the parity of the lattice number in the Kitaev ring,\nwhich will be interested for the quantum device based on Kitaev chain.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new mean-field game framework to analyze the impact of carbon\npricing in a multi-sector economy with defaultable firms. Each sector produces\na homogeneous good, with its price endogenously determined through market\nclearing. Firms act as price takers and maximize profits by choosing an optimal\nallocation of inputs-including labor, emissions, and intermediate goods from\nother sectors-while interacting through the endogenous sectoral price. Firms\nalso choose their default timing to maximize shareholder value.\n  Formally, we model the economy as an optimal stopping mean-field game within\neach sector. The resulting system of coupled mean-field games admits a linear\nprogramming formulation that characterizes Nash equilibria in terms of\npopulation measure flows. We prove the existence of a linear programming Nash\nequilibrium and establish uniqueness of the associated price system.\n  Numerical illustrations are presented for firms with constant elasticity of\nsubstitution (CES) production functions. In a stylized single-sector economy,\ncarbon price shocks induce substitution between emissions and labor. In a\nthree-sector economy, the manufacturing sector faces consumer demand and\nrequires inputs from a brown sector, which can be increasingly replaced by\ngreen-sector goods as carbon prices rise. These experiments reveal that carbon\nprice shocks can generate substantial spillover effects along the value chain,\nunderscoring the importance of sectoral interdependencies in shaping effective\ndecarbonization pathways.",

The aim of this paper is to analyse the carbon abundance\ndetermination for the large empirical X-shooter Spectral Library (XSL),\ncommonly used as a benchmark for the development of stellar population models.\nThe analysis was performed over strong molecular CH bands in the G-band region.\nWe used the GAUGUIN automated spectrum synthesis code, and adopted two\ndifferent grids of reference synthetic spectra separately, each with the same\n[C/Fe] abundance coverage. We carried out a detailed comparison between both\ngrids to evaluate the accuracy and the model dependence of the measured [C/Fe]\nabundances. We obtained a large and precise unbiased [C/Fe] abundance catalogue\nfrom both theoretical grids, well distributed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR)\ndiagram and with no trend with the stellar parameters. We also measured\ncompatible values from each independent CH band, with a high-quality [C/Fe]\nabundance estimate for both dwarfs and giants indistinctly. We observed a\ndispersed flat trend around [C/Fe] = 0.0 dex all along the metallicity regime,\nin agreement with some literature studies. However, we reported variations up\nto 0.8 dex in the [C/Fe] composition of the star depending on the adopted grid.\nWe did not find such differences in the $\\alpha$-element measurements. This\nbehaviour implies a strong model dependence in the [C/Fe] abundance estimate.\nPotential sources of error could be associated with the use of spectral\nsynthesis methods to derive stellar carbon abundances in the CH4300A band.\nIntrinsic small differences in the synthetic models over this crowded and\nblended region may induce a large disparity in the precise abundance estimate\nfor any stellar type, leading to inaccurate carbon measurements without being\nnoticed",

This approach allows for improved temporal resolution compared\nto conventional nanosecond diagnostics, enabling measurements of\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ as small as 50 ps, the corresponding $N_H$ reaching down\nto $10^{14} cm^{-3}$. Atomic densities are calibrated by performing identical\nps--TALIF measurements in krypton gas contained in a custom-built low-pressure\ncuvette. Physical mechanisms that may be involved in the TALIF scheme such as\nphotoionisation and/or stimulated emission are also assessed, ensuring reliable\nstudies. The determined $\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and $N_H$ increase with the\nhelium flow rate ($Q_{He}$) in the range $Q_{He}=0.3-1$ slm. Both quantities\nare maximized near the exit nozzle of the $\\mu$APPJ, obtaining values below 400\nps and $6x10^{14} cm^{-3}$, respectively. As the axial distance increases,\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ declines with a rate of $\\approx$65 ps/mm for $Q_{He}=1$\nslm which is about 3 times smaller than for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm. These findings\nreveal a strong correlation between the experimentally-measured\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and the local air entrainment into the jet as indicated\nby their comparison with calculated effective lifetimes based on published\nquenching rates. Furthermore, operating the $\\mu$APPJ in the burst mode allows\nfor the estimation of the residence time ($t_{res}$) of ground state H--atoms\nin the helium gas channel, which is larger for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm ($t_{res}\n\\approx 1.2 ms$) compared to $Q_{He}=1$ slm ($t_{res} \\approx 0.5 ms$). H-atoms\nconsumption in the gas channel can be affected by diffusion and mechanisms\ninvolving neutral ground-state and metastable species among others.\nFurthermore, based on an error propagation analysis, density uncertainty as\nhigh as 64% (depending on the operating condition) is revealed. This mainly\noriginates in the ratio of the two-photon absorption cross sections of Kr and H\natoms ( $\\sigma^{(2)}Kr$ / $\\sigma^{(2)}H$) which has not yet been measured in\nthe picosecond regime. Nevertheless, the combined utilisation of ps--TALIF and\nstreak camera diagnostics demonstrates high sensitivity and temporal resolution\nfor directly probing key reactive species in atmospheric pressure microplasmas.",

In particular, a\nreduction of the radiation length has been measured when ultrarelativistic\nelectron and photon beams were incident on a high-Z scintillator crystal along\none of its main axes. Here, we propose the possibility to exploit this physical\neffect for the design of a new type of compact e.m. calorimeter, based on\noriented ultrafast lead tungstate (PWO-UF) crystals, with a significant\nreduction in the depth needed to contain electromagnetic showers produced by\nhigh-energy particles with respect to the state-of-the-art. We report results\nfrom tests of the crystallographic quality of PWO-UF samples via\nhigh-resolution X-ray diffraction and photoelastic analysis. We then describe a\nproof-of-concept calorimeter geometry defined with a Geant4 model including the\nshower development in oriented crystals. Finally, we discuss the experimental\ntechniques needed for the realization of a matrix of scintillator crystals\noriented along a specific crystallographic direction. Since the angular\nacceptance for e.m. shower acceleration depends little on the particle energy,\nwhile the decrease of the shower length remains pronounced at very high energy,\nan oriented crystal calorimeter will open the way for applications at the\nmaximum energies achievable in current and future experiments.

However, current\nsystolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing\nFlashAttention. Systolic arrays achieve high utilization primarily for\nconsecutive and large matrix multiplications, whereas FlashAttention requires\nfrequent interleaving of matrix multiplications and softmax operations.\n  The frequent data swaps between matrix multiplications on the systolic array\nand softmax operations on external units result in low array utilization.\nMoreover, when these computations run concurrently, the softmax stage contends\nwith matrix multiplication for register file and SRAM ports, further degrading\nperformance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array\narchitecture that enables the FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely within a\nsingle systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units. At the\ncore of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps\nFlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise\noverlap.

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches for molecular imaging of Parkinson's disease (PD) in\nvivo require radioactive isotopes, lengthy scan times, or deliver only low\nspatial resolution. Recent advances in saturation transfer-based PD magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) have provided biochemical insights, although the image\ncontrast is semi-quantitative and nonspecific. Here, we combined a rapid\nmolecular MRI acquisition paradigm with deep learning based reconstruction for\nmulti-metabolite quantification of glutamate, mobile proteins, semisolid, and\nmobile macromolecules in an acute MPTP\n(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model. The quantitative\nparameter maps are in general agreement with the histology and MR spectroscopy,\nand demonstrate that semisolid magnetization transfer (MT), amide, and\naliphatic relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE) proton volume fractions may\nserve as PD biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "In many situations, simply finding a target during a search is not enough. It\nis equally important to be able to return to that target repeatedly or to\nenable a larger community to locate and utilize it. While first passage time is\ncommonly used to measure search success, relatively little is known about\nincreasing the average rate of target encounters over time. Here, using an\nactive Brownian particle model with chemotaxis, we demonstrate that when a\nsearcher has no memory and there is no communication among multiple searchers,\nencoding information about the target's location in the environment outperforms\npurely memoryless strategies by boosting the overall hit rate. We further show\nthat this approach reduces the impact of target size on a successful search and\nincreases the total utilization time of the target.",

While it is well established, a\nkey challenge remains the measurements of microcrystals or thin films\nespecially in the sub-Kelvin, high magnetic field regime. Here we present a\nsetup combining the high sensitivity of SiN$_x$ membrane based calorimetry with\nthe absolute accuracy of Coulomb blockade thermometry to realise a\nnanocalorimeter for such tasks. The magnetic field independent technique of\nCoulomb blockade thermometry provides an on-platform thermometer combining a\nprimary thermometry mode for in-situ calibration with a fast secondary mode\nsuitable for specific heat measurements. The setup is validated using\nmeasurements of a 20 $\\mu$g sample of Sr$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ achieving a resolution\non the order of 0.1 nJ/K at 500 mK and an absolute accuracy limited by the\ndetermination of the sample's mass.

    "abstract": "The paper describes the objectives, design and findings of the pre-launch\nground characterisation campaigns of the Euclid infrared detectors. The pixel\nproperties, including baseline, bad pixels, quantum efficiency, inter pixel\ncapacitance, quantum efficiency, dark current, readout noise, conversion gain,\nresponse nonlinearity, and image persistence were measured and characterised\nfor each pixel. We describe in detail the test flow definition that allows us\nto derive the pixel properties and we present the data acquisition and data\nquality check software implemented for this purpose. We also outline the\nmeasurement protocols of all the pixel properties presented and we provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the performance of the Euclid infrared detectors as\nderived after tuning the operating parameters of the detectors. The main\nconclusion of this work is that the performance of the infrared detectors\nEuclid meets the requirements. Pixels classified as non-functioning accounted\nfor less than 0.2% of all science pixels. IPC coupling is minimal and crosstalk\nbetween adjacent pixels is less than 1% between adjacent pixels. 95% of the\npixels show a QE greater than 80% across the entire spectral range of the\nEuclid mission. The conversion gain is approximately 0.52 ADU/e-, with a\nvariation less than 1% between channels of the same detector. The reset noise\nis approximately equal to 23 ADU after reference pixels correction. The readout\nnoise of a single frame is approximately 13 $e^-$ while the signal estimator\nnoise is measured at 7 $e^-$ in photometric mode and 9 $e^-$ in spectroscopic\nacquisition mode. The deviation from linear response at signal levels up to 80\nk$e^-$ is less than 5% for 95% of the pixels. Median persistence amplitudes are\nless than 0.3% of the signal, though persistence exhibits significant spatial\nvariation and differences between detectors.",

To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions\nAdaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity\nNetwork (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically\ncombines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a\nwavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a\nbiologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature\nenhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained\nand continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate\nuncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and\nlightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without\nsacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate\nthat HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an\naverage symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap\nerror (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the\n3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of\n1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different\ndatasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in\nproviding anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor\nsegmentation.",

It\nis however difficult to interpret the privacy budget ($\\varepsilon$) expressed\nby DP. To make the actual risk associated with the privacy budget more\ntransparent, multiple privacy metrics (PMs) have been proposed to assess the\nprivacy risk of the data.

While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support\ncontestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks\n(EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs\ncan be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability\nproblem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences)\nto achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a\ntopic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation\nattribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic\nargument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing\ninterpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building\non G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the\nedge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach\nexperimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural\ncharacteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer\nperceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.",

In this paper, we highlight that\nthis can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.\nThus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian\nSplatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its\nsurface reconstruction process.

Pulse-height spectra were recorded using a liquid-scintillation\ncounting system before and after dispersing the nanoparticles into the\nscintillator, and the differences between them were analyzed to infer the\ninteraction outcomes. Gd$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles emitted numerous electrons;\nhowever, under identical experimental conditions, no detectable electron\nemission was observed from Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). Here, \"detectable electron\nemission\" refers to electrons with energies high enough to be registered by the\nliquid-scintillation detector used (approx 100 eV and, more typically, >= 1-2\nkeV); however, it excludes electrons that may be emitted at lower energies.\nThus, a species-dependent radiation-nanoparticle interaction was observed.\nRigorous controls and falsification tests excluded various artefacts-including\ndetector insensitivity, surface contamination, aggregation, quenching, and\nself-absorption-as causes for the absence of detectable electron emission from\nAuNPs. This observation potentially prompts a re-evaluation of the common\nassumption that nanoparticles behave like their bulk counterparts and emit\nelectrons upon gamma-irradiation.

These methods often lack the robustness\nneeded to handle incomplete, heterogeneous, or noisy intelligence, and they\nprovide limited transparency in decision-making-factors that reduce their\neffectiveness in real-world threat environments. To address these limitations,\nwe propose LRCTI, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework designed for\nmulti-step CTI credibility verification. The framework first employs a text\nsummarization module to distill complex intelligence reports into concise and\nactionable threat claims. It then uses an adaptive multi-step evidence\nretrieval mechanism that iteratively identifies and refines supporting\ninformation from a CTI-specific corpus, guided by LLM feedback. Finally, a\nprompt-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) module is applied to evaluate the\ncredibility of each claim while generating interpretable justifications for the\nclassification outcome. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets,\nCTI-200 and PolitiFact show that LRCTI improves F1-Macro and F1-Micro scores by\nover 5%, reaching 90.9% and 93.6%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

    "abstract": "Seventeen-carbon-atom-wide armchair graphene nanoribbons (17-AGNRs) are\npromising candidates for high-performance electronic devices due to their\nnarrow electronic bandgap. Atomic precision in edge structure and width control\nis achieved through a bottom-up on-surface synthesis (OSS) approach from\ntailored molecular precursors in ultra-high vacuum (UHV). This synthetic\nprotocol must be optimized to meet the structural requirements for device\nintegration, with ribbon length being the most critical parameter. Here, we\nreport optimized OSS conditions that produce 17-AGNRs with an average length of\napproximately 17 nm. This length enhancement is achieved through a gradual\ntemperature ramping during an extended annealing period, combined with a\ntemplate-like effect driven by monomer assembly at high surface coverage. The\nresulting 17-AGNRs are comprehensively characterized in UHV using scanning\nprobe techniques and Raman spectroscopy. Raman measurements following substrate\ntransfer enabled the characterization of the length distribution of GNRs on the\ndevice substrate and confirmed their stability under ambient conditions and\nharsh chemical environments, including acid vapors and etchants. The increased\nlength and ambient stability of the 17-AGNRs lead to their reliable integration\ninto device architectures. As a proof of concept, we integrate 17-AGNRs into\nfield-effect transistors (FET) with graphene electrodes and confirm that\nelectronic transport occurs through the GNRs. This work demonstrates the\nfeasibility of integrating narrow-bandgap GNRs into functional devices and\ncontributes to advancing the development of carbon-based nanoelectronics.",

Due to the low distance to the source and its\nintrinsically high luminosity MAXI J1820$+$070 was observed extensively over\nthis time period, resulting in high-cadence and quasi-simultaneous observations\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum. These data sets provide the opportunity to\nprobe the connection between accretion and the launch of jets in greater detail\nthan for the majority of black hole X-ray binaries. In this work we present\nradio (Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array, MeerKAT), X-ray (Swift), and\noptical (Las Cumbres Observatory) observations of MAXI J1820$+$070 throughout\nits entire outburst, including its initial hard state, subsequent soft state,\nand further hard-state-only re-brightenings (covering March 2018 to August\n2022). Due to the regularity and temporal density of our observational data we\nare able to create a Radio - X-ray - Optical activity plane where we find a\nhigh degree of correlation between the three wave bands during the hard states,\nand observe hysteresis as MAXI J1820$+$070 enters and exits the soft state.\nBased on the morphology of the optical light curves we see evidence for optical\njet contributions during the soft-to-hard state transition, as well as fading\noptical emission well before the hard to soft transition. We establish that the\nremarkably similar profiles of the re-brightening events are broadly consistent\nwith modified disk instability models where irradiation from the inner\naccretion disk is included.",

Real-world flight tests\ndemonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network\nis capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight\ncontrol loop.

Consequently, studying and developing imputation methods has\nbeen an active field of research over the last decade. Faced with an imputation\ntask and a large number of methods, how does one find the most suitable\nimputation? Although model selection in different contexts, such as prediction,\nhas been well studied, this question appears not to have received much\nattention. In this paper, we follow the concept of Imputation Scores (I-Scores)\nand develop a new, reliable, and easy-to-implement score to rank missing value\nimputations for a given data set without access to the complete data. In\npractice, this is usually done by artificially masking observations to compare\nimputed to observed values using measures such as the Root Mean Squared Error\n(RMSE). We discuss how this approach of additionally masking observations can\nbe misleading if not done carefully and that it is generally not valid under\nMAR. We then identify a new missingness assumption and develop a score that\ncombines a sensible masking of observations with proper scoring rules. As such\nthe ranking is geared towards the imputation that best replicates the\ndistribution of the data, allowing to find imputations that are suitable for a\nrange of downstream tasks. We show the propriety of the score and discuss an\nestimation algorithm involving energy scores. Finally, we show the efficacy of\nthe new score in simulated data examples, as well as a downstream task.",

    "abstract": "In semiconductor packaging, accurately recovering 3D information is crucial\nfor non-destructive testing (NDT) to localize circuit defects. This paper\npresents a novel approach called the 3D Magnetic Inverse Routine (3D MIR),\nwhich leverages Magnetic Field Images (MFI) to retrieve the parameters for the\n3D current flow of a single-segment. The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning\n(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based\nconstraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:\ni) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\\ell/z_o$), where $\\ell$\nis the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic\nsensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging\nspatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for\nthe position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\\ell$), current ($I$), and current\nflow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer\nthen adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\\ell$, $I$) to\nminimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI. The\nresults demonstrate that the 3D MIR method accurately recovers 3D information\nwith high precision, setting a new benchmark for magnetic image reconstruction\nin semiconductor packaging. This method highlights the potential of combining\nDL and physics-driven optimization in practical applications.",

Given two permutations $\\tau$ and $\\pi$,\nthe pattern matching problem (PPM) asks whether $\\tau$ contains $\\pi$. This\nproblem arises in various contexts in computer science and statistics and has\nbeen studied extensively in exact-, parameterized-, approximate-,\nproperty-testing- and other formulations.\n  In this paper, we study pattern matching in a streaming setting, when the\ninput $\\tau$ is revealed sequentially, one element at a time. There is\nextensive work on the space complexity of various statistics in streams of\nintegers. The novelty of our setting is that the input stream is a permutation,\nwhich allows inferring some information about future inputs. Our algorithms\ncrucially take advantage of this fact, while existing lower bound techniques\nbecome difficult to apply.\n  We show that the complexity of the problem changes dramatically depending on\nthe pattern $\\pi$.

This paper\ninvestigates the optimization of the sensing accuracy of a UAV swarm deployed\nto perform multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)\nsensing. In conventional single-baseline InSAR systems, only one synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) antenna pair acquires two SAR images from two distinct\nangles to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of the target area. However,\nmulti-baseline InSAR extends this concept by aggregating multiple acquisitions\nfrom different angles, thus, significantly enhancing the vertical accuracy of\nthe DEM.

This work focuses on improving the sensing precision by\nminimizing the height error of the averaged DEM while simultaneously ensuring\nsensing and communication quality-of-service (QoS).

However, the recent abundance and precision of\nobservational data shows that this problem is far from solved. A modern\napproach should be developed by using multidimensional models.\n  Aims. We established a new theoretical framework for comparison between\none-dimensional and multidimensional convection models by mapping the\ntwo-dimensional structure of the convective zone and optimizing the modeling\nparameters of the SPHERLS code.\n  Methods. We constructed a series of static envelope models for the same RR\nLyrae stars, but with different horizontal sizes and resolutions. We then used\na series of statistical methods to quantify the sizes of convective eddies, map\nthe energy cascade, and describe the different structural parts of the\nconvective zone. These include integral length scales, Fourier series, and the\ndetermination of the convective flux through horizontal averaging.\n  Results. The structure of the convective zone depends significantly on the\nmodel size, below an angular size of $9^\\circ$. The horizontal resolution of\nearlier studies is adequate to describe the granulation pattern in the large\neddy simulation approach. In quasi-static RR Lyrae stars, the convective zone\nconsists of two distinct dynamically unstable regions that are loosely\nconnected. Approximately half of the convective flux is supplied by the\ntransport of ionization energy in the partial hydrogen ionization zone.\n  Conclusions. The 2D models presented in this work with the described size and\nresolution parameters can be used for comparison against 1D models. The\nstructure of the convective zone urges reconsideration of some recent\napproaches to describe the convective flux currently used in radial stellar\npulsation codes, which will be addressed in a separate paper.",

Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad\ndynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the\nbath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters.

    "abstract": "Upon the impact of a flat disk on a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid that is in\nthermal equilibrium with its own vapor, a thin vapor layer is entrapped under\nthe disk. Due to the tendency of vapor to undergo phase change under pressure\nvariation upon impact, the dynamics of this entrapped vapor pocket are\ndifferent from those of a non-condensable air pocket. In this work, we\nexperimentally investigate the dynamics of the entrapped vapor pocket, more\nspecifically its time evolution and its subsequent influence on the\nhydrodynamic loads at different equilibrium ambient temperatures and impact\nvelocities. We find that the retraction of the vapor pocket at high ambient\ntemperature and small impact velocity is slow, occurring from the disk edge,\nand driven by the dynamic pressure $\\rho_{\\text{L}}U_0^2$. In contrast, at\nlower ambient temperatures and large impact velocities, after a short initial\nstage, the vapor pocket will collapse rapidly due to condensation. This\nscenario is confirmed by conducting experiments where, by heating the disk, the\nvapor pocket collapse is observed to slow down. We attribute this to the\nvaporization of liquid near the three-phase contact line region that frustrates\nthe condensation process and reduces the impact pressure on the disk. The\nviolent collapse of the vapor pocket may impart additional instantaneous\nmomentum, but the overall pressure and force impulses are still found to be\nclosely associated with the liquid added mass. Finally, we found that at a high\ntilt angle of the disk, the three-phase contact line movement over the disk\nsurface may hinder the proper entrapment and compression of the vapor pocket,\nwhich results in a lower central impact pressure as rapid condensation at the\ncentral disk region does not occur.",

First, the\nSimple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor\nqueries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a\nstructured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional\nrelationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the\nMulti-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates\ntextual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal\nConsistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a\nTextual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a\nunified and robust 3D visual grounding.

As this problem does not appear to be amenable to reductions to\nexisting hard problems such as set disjointness or indexing due to correlations\nbetween the inputs of the three players, we leverage results from\ncross-intersecting set families to prove the hardness of UniqueOverlap for\ndeterministic algorithms.

We also proposed a new loss function, the\nmask random difference loss, which enhances the consistency of the generated\neffects around the mask by randomly expanding and eroding the mask\nedges.Finally, to generate a smoke image dataset using random masks for\nsubsequent detection tasks, we incorporated smoke characteristics and use a\nmultimodal large language model as a filtering tool to select diverse and\nreasonable smoke images, thereby improving the quality of the synthetic\ndataset.

    "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) provides information theoretic security based\non quantum mechanics, however, its practical deployment is challenged by\nimperfections of source devices. Among various source loopholes, correlations\nbetween transmitted pulses pose a significant yet underexplored security risk,\npotentially compromising QKD's theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose\na security analysis framework for QKD under correlations, enabling finite-key\nanalysis for the first time by extending and rearranging QKD rounds and\nleveraging the generalized chain rule. Based on this framework, and inspired by\nthe idea of side-channel-secure QKD, we develop a secure QKD against correlated\nleakage source only need the characterization of correlation range and the\nlower bound on the vacuum component of the prepared states. Additionally, our\nframework can be extended to other QKD protocols, offering a general approach\nto consider correlation induced security vulnerabilities. The simulation\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol and its significantly\nsuperior tolerance to imperfect parameters compared to existing protocols. This\nwork provides a crucial step toward closing security loopholes in QKD,\nenhancing its practicality, and ensuring long-distance,high-performance secure\ncommunication under real-world constraints.",

In contrast, this work extends the\nanalysis to both overdetermined and underdetermined cases, allowing the mean of\nthe random measurement matrix to be rank-deficient. A remarkable contribution\nis the proof that the equivalent MLE problem is convex and satisfies strong\nduality, strengthening previous quasiconvexity results.

However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,\ndividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination\nexperienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we\npropose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly\nmultidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed\nlevels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a\nnovel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby\nisolating the most critical subgroups.\n  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and\ndemonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing\nhow discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.\nFurthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the\ncase of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging\nthe skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that\nthe proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than\npreviously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for\na given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,\naiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing.

However, due\nto the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video\ngeneration models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on\nbenchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our\nknowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively\nevaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.\nInspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative\nunit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative\nAtom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.\nGuided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we\nconstruct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing\nevaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs.

We start with the following standard\nassumptions:\n  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.\n  (2) The second moment $\\mathbf{E}_{X\\sim \\mu}[\\|X\\|^2]\\leq M$.\n  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling\nfrom such distributions is at least\n$\\left(\\frac{LM}{d\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\Omega(d)}$ where $\\epsilon$ is the desired\naccuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\\'e constant can be\narbitrarily large.\n  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers\n(see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23))\nstrengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:\n  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\\mu$ is $L$-smooth.\n  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of\nsampling from $\\mu$ can be $\\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\\cdot\n\\left(\\frac{Ld+M}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)^{\\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial\nin $d$ and $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ when $L=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and\n$M=\\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query\ncomplexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the\nseemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead\nto an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.\n  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger\nmoment assumption that $\\|X\\|$ is $\\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\\sim\\mu$, the\nPoincar\\'e constant of $\\mu$ is at most $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$. As an\napplication of our technique, we obtain improved estimate of the Poincar\\'e\nconstant for mixture of Gaussians with the same covariance.",

Decidability of\nthe problem is open in general, with the most notable positive result being a\ndecision procedure for LRS of order at most 4.\n  In this paper we consider a bounded version of the Skolem Problem, in which\nthe input consists of an LRS $\\langle u_n \\rangle_{n=0}^\\infty$ and a bound $N\n\\in \\mathbb N$ (with all integers written in binary), and the task is to\ndetermine whether there exists $n\\in\\{0,\\ldots,N\\}$ such that $u_n=0$. We give\na randomised algorithm for this problem that, for all $d\\in \\mathbb N$, runs in\npolynomial time on the class of LRS of order at most $d$. As a corollary we\nshow that the (unrestricted) Skolem Problem for LRS of order at most 4 lies in\n$\\mathsf{coRP}$, improving the best previous upper bound of\n$\\mathsf{NP}^{\\mathsf{RP}}$.\n  The running time of our algorithm is exponential in the order of the LRS -- a\ndependence that appears necessary in view of the $\\mathsf{NP}$-hardness of the\nBounded Skolem Problem. However, even for LRS of a fixed order, the problem\ninvolves detecting zeros within an exponentially large range. For this, our\nalgorithm relies on results from $p$-adic analysis to isolate polynomially many\ncandidate zeros and then test in randomised polynomial time whether each\ncandidate is an actual zero by reduction to arithmetic-circuit identity\ntesting.",

We perform a\ndetailed spectroscopic analysis of the long X-ray burst, lasting for $\\sim 600$\ns, seen in the NuSTAR observation carried out on 2022 September. The persistent\nemission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model\n(nthcomp), and the source exhibits a soft spectral state during this\nobservation. The observed burst exhibits a rise time of $\\sim 25$ s and a decay\ntime of $\\sim 282$ s. The time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst shows a\nsignificant departure from a pure thermal spectrum and is described with a\nmodel consisting of a varying-temperature blackbody plus an evolving persistent\nemission component. We observe a significant enhancement in the persistent\nemission during the burst. The enhancement of the pre-burst persistent flux is\npossibly due to Poynting-Robertson drag or coronal reprocessing. At the peak of\nthe burst, the blackbody temperature and the blackbody emitting radius reached\na maximum of $2.10\\pm 0.07$ keV and $5.5\\pm 2.1$ km, respectively.

Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their\npolysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from\ncross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete\nand abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features\nare language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains\nunderexplored.

We find that many such features predominantly appear in\nthe middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features\ninfluence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be\nused for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along\nwith more interpretability.

Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and\nlocal information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods\noften suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between\ncorrect and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the\ncandidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which\nalleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments\non various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a\n1.8$\\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.",

These\nregions are kinematically cold (|v| < 40 km/s), prompting the alternative\nhypothesis that the correlation reflects an age bias: planetary systems in\noverdensities are systematically younger and therefore less likely to have\nundergone tidal inspiral and destruction. We test whether the apparent excess\nof HJs in phase space overdensities arises from differences in intrinsic host\nproperties -- mass, metallicity, age -- which may correlate with phase space\ndensity or whether there is evidence for an additional environmental effect. We\nderive homogeneous estimates for the mass, metallicity, and age of\nplanet-hosting stars using 2MASS and Gaia DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and\nself-consistent spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observables. In a sample\nof 2265 confirmed exoplanet hosts, we find a significant relative excess of HJs\norbiting stars in overdense regions. However, we also find that overdensities\npreferentially host younger, more massive, and more metal-rich stars compared\nto underdensities. After correcting for these differences, either by detrending\nthe phase space density against age or by matching host properties across\nsubsamples, we find no significant differences in the HJ populations between\nover- and underdense regions. Our results suggest that the previously reported\ncorrelation between HJ occurrence and phase space density is driven by\nunderlying differences in host star demographics rather than an intrinsic\nenvironmental effect.",

    "abstract": "Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that\nconventional metrics often overlook. In particular, unconscious parental\nexpectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional\nexpression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,\noften stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is\ndifficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these\nlatent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support\nfor psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese\nparent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on\nideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a\nRole-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes\ndialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,\ndescribe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual\nattributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these\noutputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert\nagents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable\nfeedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show\nthat the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate\naccuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.\nMoreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited\nsigns of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the\nframework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family\ninteractions.",

While existing methods attempt to address various\nincomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality\ncombination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical\nlimitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict\nwith each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank\nadaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a\nnovel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal\nlearning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination\naware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The\nMCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct\ncharacteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts\nthe training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each\nmodality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across\ndifferent modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms\nprevious incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.",

These transformations and their resulting mechanical\nproperties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials'\nmicrostructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is\nchallenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning\noffers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present\na large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical\nresponses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The\nmicrostructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17\nwallpaper symmetry groups and employs B\\'ezier curves for a rich parametric\nspace. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based\ncomputational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries,\neach subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our\ndataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models,\nfacilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables\ninvestigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations,\npotentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.",

Our analysis identifies key advantages of MoE, including\nsuperior model capacity compared to equivalent Bayesian approaches, improved\ntask-specific performance, and the ability to scale model capacity efficiently.\nWe also underscore the importance of ensuring expert diversity, accurate\ncalibration, and reliable inference aggregation, as these are essential for\nmaximizing the effectiveness of MoE architectures.

Hence, PQoS is extremely useful for automotive\napplications such as teleoperated driving, which poses strict constraints in\nterms of latency and reliability. A promising tool for PQoS is given by\nReinforcement Learning (RL), a methodology that enables the design of\ndecision-making strategies for stochastic optimization. In this manuscript, we\npresent PRATA, a new simulation framework to enable PRedictive QoS based on AI\nfor Teleoperated driving Applications. PRATA consists of a modular pipeline\nthat includes (i) an end-to-end protocol stack to simulate the 5G Radio Access\nNetwork (RAN), (ii) a tool for generating automotive data, and (iii) an\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) unit to optimize PQoS decisions. To prove its\nutility, we use PRATA to design an RL unit, named RAN-AI, to optimize the\nsegmentation level of teleoperated driving data in the event of resource\nsaturation or channel degradation. Hence, we show that the RAN-AI entity\nefficiently balances the trade-off between QoS and Quality of Experience (QoE)\nthat characterize teleoperated driving applications, almost doubling the system\nperformance compared to baseline approaches. In addition, by varying the\nlearning settings of the RAN-AI entity, we investigate the impact of the state\nspace and the relative cost of acquiring network data that are necessary for\nthe implementation of RL.",

Quantum state\nverification (QSV) has recently gained much attention as an efficient and\nexperiment-friendly approach for verifying entangled states. In this work, we\nexperimentally demonstrate a QSV protocol for verifying three-qubit\nnonstabilizer $W$ state via a modified homogeneous strategy.

    "abstract": "With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural\nnetwork-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these\nmodels have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most\nexisting approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the\nconstruction of a separate model for each time series, which results in\nsubstantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing\npenalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal\nrelationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural\nGranger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model\nand applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and\noutput to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific\ntime series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures\nsuch as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical\nsimulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC\noutperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational\noverhead.

Using a minimal\nbilayer Hubbard model incorporating only the essential Ni-$d_{3z^2-r^2}$\norbitals, we demonstrate that a phase transition naturally arises from tuning\nthe ratio of intralayer to interlayer hopping amplitudes. The transition point\nseparates regimes with a rich interplay between superconducting and\ndensity-wave orders.

Predictions can be used proactively to\nadjust communication parameters at runtime and optimize network operations for\nindustrial applications. Methods including convolutional neural networks and\nlong short-term memory were analyzed on datasets acquired from a real Wi-Fi\nsetup across multiple channels. The models were compared in terms of prediction\naccuracy and computational complexity.

In this\nstudy, we present a procedure to derive theoretical upper bounds on the kinetic\nmixing parameter $\\varepsilon^2(M_U)$ by analyzing dilepton spectra from\nheavy-ion collisions across a broad energy range, from SIS to LHC energies. Our\nanalysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD)\ntransport approach, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra\nin $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions across the same energy range. Besides the\ndilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model\nparticles (such as mesons and baryons), the PHSD has been extended to include\nthe decay of hypothetical dark photons into dileptons, $U \\to e^+ e^-$. The\nproduction of these dark photons occurs via Dalitz decays of $\\pi^0$, $\\eta$,\n$\\omega$, $\\eta^{\\prime}$, and $\\Delta$ resonances; direct decays of $\\rho$,\n$\\omega$, and $\\phi$; the kaon mode $K^+ \\to \\pi^+ U$; and thermal $q\\bar q$\nannihilation in the quark-gluon plasma.

    "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion\nthat we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in\nour experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large\ngraph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.",

The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate\nturbulence-driving mechanisms in the outer disk region. Since the VSI requires\nrapid gas cooling, dust grains in disks can influence and potentially control\nVSI-driven turbulence. However, VSI-driven turbulence has strong vertical\nmotion, causing vertical dust diffusion. As a result, it remains unclear how\nturbulent structures and dust distributions form. We aim to clarify whether the\nVSI can achieve a quasi-steady dust profile under cooling rate evolution\nassociated with turbulently diffusing dust. We also elucidate the dependence of\nthe dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio on the realization and persistence of\nthe equilibrium state. We perform global two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of an axisymmetric disk to investigate how the VSI drives\nturbulence and maintains a balance between dust settling and diffusion. These\nsimulations account for the dynamic interplay between dust distribution,\ncooling rates, and turbulence. We find that VSI mixing, dust settling, and\nlocal cooling reach an equilibrium, forming a thick dust layer with a\ndimensionless vertical mixing coefficient of approximately 10^{-3}. The ability\nof the VSI to sustain this state also depends on the dust size and dust-to-gas\nmass ratio. Larger grains or lower mass ratios weaken turbulence, leading to\ndust settling. The condition of equilibrium state existence is consistent with\nthe prediction of the semi-analytic model presented by Fukuhara & Okuzumi\n(2024). Our results indicate that efficient turbulent dust mixing and efficient\ncooling can occur simultaneously. They also imply that turbulence in\nVSI-dominated disks has different intensity levels depending on the grain size.\nThis suggests that the efficiency of dust growth can depend on the VSI in\nprotoplanetary disks.",

To address this, we first compile the UnsafeConcepts dataset,\nfeaturing 75 unsafe concepts, i.e., ``Swastika,'' ``Sexual Harassment,'' and\n``Assaults,'' along with associated 1.5K images. We then conduct a systematic\nevaluation of VLMs' perception (concept recognition) and alignment (ethical\nreasoning) capabilities.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a simplified reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based approach using proximal policy optimization (PPO) to strengthen the\nability to identify unsafe concepts from images.

    "abstract": "Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical\nsettings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D\nspatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant\ntime consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based\non sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from\nresearchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent\nyears, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have\ndemonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction.\nNonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent\nrepresentation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT\nmodalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment\nwithin the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent\nLatent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature\ncontrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray\nimages and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental\nresults indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art\ngenerative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the\nLIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing\nthe effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but\ncan also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as\ntext-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research\nand applications in other domains.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the structure of high-dimensional data is fundamental to\nneuroscience and other data-intensive scientific fields. While persistent\nhomology effectively identifies basic topological features such as \"holes,\" it\nlacks the ability to reliably detect more complex topologies, particularly\ntoroidal structures, despite previous heuristic attempts. To address this\nlimitation, recent work introduced persistent cup-length, a novel topological\ninvariant derived from persistent cohomology. In this paper, we present the\nfirst implementation of this method and demonstrate its practical effectiveness\nin detecting toroidal structures, uncovering topological features beyond the\nreach of persistent homology alone. Our implementation overcomes computational\nbottlenecks through strategic optimization, efficient integration with the\nRipser library, and the application of landmark subsampling techniques. By\napplying our method to grid cell population activity data, we demonstrate that\npersistent cup-length effectively identifies toroidal structures in neural\nmanifolds. Our approach offers a powerful new tool for analyzing\nhigh-dimensional data, advancing existing topological methods.",

    "abstract": "In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum\ndelay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is\ncrucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an\nArithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to\nperform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,\nsynchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum\nclock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static\nTiming Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can\nbe determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead\nto suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In\nthis work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum\ndelay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally\nhard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring\nextremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem\ninto ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address\ncomplex problems in hardware design.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the\nextreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of\nhuman activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural\nresources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the\nextremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or\nhighland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model\nwhich explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide\nevents. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain\nfree resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote\nsensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for\ntwo tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our\nproposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,\nand Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,\n93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU\nscores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,\nNepal datasets. These experimental results prove potential to integrate our\nproposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.",

Our approach is efficient in terms of the number of queries to the\nblock encoding of a Hamiltonian. Also, our approach can avoid Suzuki-Trotter\ndecomposition. We constructed quantum circuits for GQSP-based quantum power\nmethods, estimated the number of queries, and numerically verified that this\nframework works. We additionally benchmark various quantum power methods with\nmolecular Hamiltonians and demonstrate that Quantum Power Lanczos converges\nfaster and more reliably than standard Quantum Power Iteration, while Quantum\nInverse Iteration outperforms existing inverse iteration variants based on\ntime-evolution operators. We also show that the Quantum Folded Spectrum Method\ncan obtain excited states without variational optimization. Overall, our\nresults indicate that GQSP-based implementations of power methods combine\nscalability, flexibility, and robust convergence, paving the way for practical\ninitial state preparations on fault-tolerant quantum devices.",

    ],
    "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of\nFeynman integrals with high powers of numerators or propagators, a demanding\ncomputational step in evaluating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. The\nalgorithm starts with solving syzygy equations in individual sectors to produce\nIBP operators that turn seed integrals into IBP equations without artificially\nraised propagator powers. The IBP operators are expressed in terms of\nindex-shift operators and number operators. We perform row reduction to\nsystematically reshuffle the IBP operators and expose reduction rules with\nsymbolic dependence on the powers of propagators and numerators. When this is\ninsufficient, we produce more symbolic reduction rules by directly solving the\nlinear system of IBP equations in which some propagator/numerator powers are\nkept symbolic. This linear system is kept small, as the equations are generated\nfrom a small set of seed integrals in the neighborhood of the target integral.\nWe stress-test our algorithm against two highly non-trivial examples, namely\nrank-20 integrals for the double box with an external mass and the massless\npentabox. As an application, we revisit the IBP reduction in a calculation of\nscattering amplitudes for spinning black hole binary systems, which involves\ntwo-loop Feynman integrals with complexity greater than 20, and achieve much\nfaster IBP reduction than that of the original calculation.",

The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely\nresembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation\nlevels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the\ntroposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere\nremains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore\nmicrobial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to\nastrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in\naccess and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE\n(Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne\npayload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them\nin conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and\ndesigned in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main\npayload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that\ndetermines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed\nduring flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control)\nto monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS\ntrackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once\nsampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload.\nUpon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be\nsent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the\npresence and nature of collected material.",

SN 2024abfo is the seventh SN IIb with a\ndirect progenitor detection. We find that the position of the supernova in our\nERIS adaptive optics imaging agrees with the progenitor position in archival\nHST imaging to within 19 mas. The progenitor SED is consistent with an A5\ngiant. Single star models predict an initial mass in the range 11 to 15 solar\nmasses, while the most probable binary model is a 12+1.2 solar mass system with\nan initial period of 1.73 years. We also find significant evidence for\nvariability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN\n2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At\nlate times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe,\nwhich may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN\n2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic\nlight curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen\nin the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at\nearly times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha\nabsorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to\nexplain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out\nsingle-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary\ncompanion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features\nwould support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which\nunderwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion,\nresulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope.",

However, modality conflicts,\narising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two\ncritical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple\nmodalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional\nmodalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality\nindicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality.\nAdditionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate\nmulti-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality\ndifferences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by\ndisentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific\ncomponents, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently\nenhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to\nadditional modalities.

To\nachieve effective proactive defense, this paper models honeypot deployment as a\ngamma-fixed signaling game in which node liveness serves as the only signal and\nnormal-node signal gamma is exogenously fixed. We define the gamma-perfect\nBayesian-Nash equilibrium (gamma-PBNE). Analytical expressions are obtained for\nall gamma-PBNEs, revealing three distinct equilibrium regimes that depend on\nthe priori honeypot ratio. Furthermore, the optimal honeypot ratio and\nsignaling strategy that jointly maximize the network average utility are\nobtained. To capture strategic interaction over time, we develop a\ndiscrete-time fictitious-play algorithm that couples Bayesian belief updates\nwith empirical best responses. We prove that, as long as the honeypot ratio is\nperturbed within a non-degenerate neighbourhood of the optimum, every\nfictitious-play path converges to the defender-optimal gamma-PBNE.

However, most existing works\nassume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited\nunderstanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within\nthe model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in\nLLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a\nsingle model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed\nseveral triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding\nsimilarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation\neven when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings\nexpose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate\nthis threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains\nspecific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis.

We found that neglecting the\n$R/I$ evolutionary effects can lead to systematic overestimation or\nunderestimation of magnetar parameters such as $B_p$, $P_0$, and $\\epsilon$\nfrom 20\\% to 50\\%. We also found that some tight correlations, which can be\napproximately expressed as $\\epsilon\\propto P_0^{1.57\\pm0.22}$,\n$\\epsilon\\propto B_p^{0.97\\pm0.13}$, $B_p\\propto P_0^{1.30\\pm0.16}$, $E_{\\rm\nwind}\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{0.83\\pm0.07}(E_{\\rm jet}^{0.76\\pm0.06})$,\n$P_0\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{-0.29\\pm0.03}(E_{\\rm jet}^{-0.26\\pm0.02})$,\n$B_p\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{-0.58\\pm0.06}(E_{\\rm jet}^{-0.55\\pm0.05})$, and\n$\\epsilon\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{-0.55\\pm0.07}(E_{\\rm jet}^{-0.52\\pm0.06})$\nfor our selected EoSs.

Finally,\nwe found that the GW signals from the remnants of those GW-dominated GRBs with\nredshift measurements cannot reach aLIGO sensitivity threshold, and only two\ncases (GRBs 150323A and 170607A) can reach ET sensitivity threshold.

Among various candidates,\nself-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to\ntheir ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their\ncompatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical\nproperties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure.\nThe annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength\nby promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence\nmeasurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the\nsingle-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of\nthe emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing\ntemperature of $760^\\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality\nof the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with\nnear transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a\nfactor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that\nrapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that\npreserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce\nundesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum\nphotonic applications.",

Keypoints, as\nstructure-aware, pixel-level, and compact representations of objects,\nparticularly articulated ones, play a crucial role in applications such as\nfine-grained image analysis, object retrieval, and behavior recognition.

For this purpose we restrict\nthe four-dimensional $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills instantons to those with spatial\nspherical symmetry $SO(3)$, which automatically causes the dimensional\nreduction of the four-dimensional $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory to the\ntwo-dimensional $U(1)$ gauge-scalar theory as implemented explicitly by the\nWitten transformation. In this setting, we show that the restoration of the\nresidual gauge symmetry occurs due to condensations of instantons and\nanti-instantons, although the residual gauge symmetry was spontaneously broken\nin the perturbative vacuum. This result demonstrates that the true confinement\nphase is a disordered phase in which all symmetries remain unbroken.",

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures.

However, existing detection methods for data poisoning attacks on\nDL-based code search models remain insufficiently effective. To address this\ncritical security issue, we propose MT4DP, a Data Poisoning Attack Detection\nFramework for DL-based Code Search Models via Metamorphic Testing. MT4DP\nintroduces a novel Semantically Equivalent Metamorphic Relation (SE-MR)\ndesigned to detect data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models.\nSpecifically, MT4DP first identifies the high-frequency words from search\nqueries as potential poisoning targets and takes their corresponding queries as\nthe source queries. For each source query, MT4DP generates two semantically\nequivalent follow-up queries and retrieves its source ranking list. Then, each\nsource ranking list is re-ranked based on the semantic similarities between its\ncode snippets and the follow-up queries. Finally, variances between the source\nand re-ranked lists are calculated to reveal violations of the SE-MR and warn\nthe data poisoning attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MT4DP\nsignificantly enhances the detection of data poisoning attacks on DL-based code\nsearch models, outperforming the best baseline by 191% on average F1 score and\n265% on average precision.

In an applied example using UK Biobank data,\nwe assess the effect of vitamin D levels on coronary artery disease risk across\n20 recruitment centres. Despite some regional variation in vitamin D\ndistributions, there is no evidence for a causal effect or heterogeneity in\nestimates. Compared to stratification methods requiring model-based\nassumptions, the context-stratified approach is simple to implement and robust\nto collider bias, provided the context variable is exogenous. However, the\nmethod's power and interpretability depend critically on meaningful exogenous\nvariation in exposure distributions between contexts. In the example of vitamin\nD, subgroups from other stratification methods explored a much wider range of\nthe exposure distribution.",

To ensure uncontaminated source photometry, these\nartefacts must be accurately accounted for. This paper focuses on two specific\noptical features in NISP's photometric data (NISP-P): ghosts caused by the\ntelescope's dichroic beamsplitter, and the bandpass filters within the NISP\nfore-optics. Both ghost types exhibit a characteristic morphology and are\noffset from the originating stars. The offsets are well modelled using 2D\npolynomials, with only stars brighter than approximately 10 magnitudes in each\nfilter producing significant ghost contributions. The masking radii for these\nghosts depend on both the source-star brightness and the filter wavelength,\nranging from 20 to 40 pixels. We present the final relations and models used in\nthe near-infrared (NIR) data pipeline to mask these ghosts for Euclid's Quick\nData Release (Q1).",

As the expectations for precision,\nautomation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are\nincreasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress\nin computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect\ndetection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant\ndevelopment has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection\nframeworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and\nfacilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a\ncohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains\nelusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both\nclosed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D\nmodalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the\nrising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges\ninherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,\nthereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing\nfield.",

The framework comprises two stages: (1) supervised pre-training of a\ncomplex-valued convolutional neural network (CV-CNN) on a large dataset, and\n(2) purely physics-informed fine-tuning on a single data sample based on the\nKirchhoff-Helmholtz integral. This method follows the principles of transfer\nlearning by enabling generalization across different datasets through\nphysics-informed adaptation. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by\ntransferring a pre-trained model from a rectangular plate dataset to a violin\ntop plate dataset, where it shows improved reconstruction accuracy compared to\nthe pre-trained model and delivers performance comparable to that of\nCompressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM). Furthermore, for successful\nmodes, the fine-tuned model outperforms both the pre-trained model and C-ESM in\naccuracy.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the 3D geometry of transparent objects from RGB images is\nchallenging due to their inherent physical properties, such as reflection and\nrefraction. To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse\nviews and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian\nSplatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key\ninsight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling\nfocused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate\nartifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,\nensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.\nFurthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the\nreconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and\nchain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.\nTRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it\nconsistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based\nstate-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean\nabsolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,\ndespite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\\delta} < 2.5 cm\naccuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.\nCode and more results are available at https://jeongyun0609.github.io/TRAN-D/.",

    "abstract": "Matrix-accelerated stencil computation is a hot research topic, yet its\napplication to three-dimensional (3D) high-order stencils and HPC remains\nunderexplored. With the emergence of matrix units on multicore CPUs, we analyze\nmatrix-based acceleration strategies and tailor an optimal approach for 3D\nhigh-order stencils. We introduce algorithmic optimizations based on SIMD and\nmatrix units to address strided memory accesses, alignment conflicts, and\nredundant accesses. We propose memory optimizations to boost on-package memory\nefficiency, and a novel multi-thread parallelism paradigm to overcome\ndata-sharing challenges caused by the absence of shared data caches. MMStencil\nsustains consistently high hardware utilization across diverse stencil shapes\nand dimensions. Our DMA-based inter-NUMA communication further mitigates NUMA\neffects and MPI limitations in hybrid parallelism. Combining all the\ninnovations, MMStencil outperforms state-of-the-art libraries on Nvidia A100\nGPGPU by up to 2.1x. Moreover, the performance improvements translate directly\nto real-world HPC applications and enable RTM applications to yield 1.8x\nspeedup versus a highly optimized industrial Nvidia A100 GPGPU version.",

In binary\nsystems, tidal forces and magnetic interactions can further shape the magnetic\ngeometry. We report a longitudinal preference of star spots, chromospheric\nactivities, and flares in the active single-lined spectroscopic PMS binary\nsystem V2279 Cyg, based on long-term photometric observations from\n\\textit{Kepler} and \\textit{TESS} alongside spectroscopic data from LAMOST. The\nsystem is classified as a weak-line T Tauri binary, with component masses\nestimated at 0.86 $M_\\odot$ and 0.27 $M_\\odot$. V2279 Cyg's nearly circular\norbit is synchronized with its 4.126-day rotational period. Observations reveal\nlarge star spot regions clustered near the far-side hemisphere. Spectroscopic\ndata show strong, double-peak H$\\alpha$ emission, the strength of which is\nhighly correlated with star spot distribution, indicating the presence of an\nactive longitude on the primary star. We also mapped the prominence structure\nco-rotating with the primary star, suggesting a dense structure close to the\nnear-side hemisphere. Furthermore, we identify an inactive longitude of flares\nduring the 4-year \\textit{Kepler} observations, where the frequency of flare\nactivity is significantly reduced after the superior conjunction, marking the\nfirst such identification in active binary systems. Additionally, a white light\nsuperflare, releasing energy of $2.5 \\times 10^{37}$ erg, was detected in\n\\textit{TESS} observations. These findings provide valuable insights into the\nmagnetic field geometry and dynamo processes in PMS binaries, underscoring the\ncritical role of tidal interactions in shaping magnetic activities.",

Using the Pleiades and Praesepe\nstars, we determine the zero-reddening sequence for different values of the\ncolor excess ratios $E(J-H)/E(H-K_S)$. In this paper we consider a sequence\nconsisting of two segments, that leads to an uncertainty in the determining of\nabsorption - one value of the Q parameter corresponds to two values of the\nnon-reddened color index. We propose a method to select a segment of the\nzero-reddening sequence for the main sequence stars of the cluster. The method\nis based on the difference in the position of stars of different segments in\nthe cluster luminosity function. To test the proposed method, we simulate the\nluminosity functions of clusters with the non-uniform absorption distribution\nin the cluster region. With the typical absorption values in embedded clusters,\nabout 10 % of stars are erroneously assigned, but in some cases this fraction\ncan reach 20 %. Thus, despite the fact that irregular absorption distorts the\ndistribution of stars of different segments on the cluster luminosity function,\nour method allows to separate stars with an error of no more than 20 %.",

A reliable similarity metric could establish meaningful\nrelationships between instances, enabling more effective evaluation of instance\nset heterogeneity and providing better guidance to solvers, particularly when\nmachine learning is involved. Existing similarity metrics often lack precision\nin identifying instance classes or rely heavily on labeled data, which limits\ntheir applicability and generalization. To bridge this gap, this paper\nintroduces the first mathematical distance metric for MILP instances, derived\ndirectly from their mathematical formulations. By discretizing right-hand\nsides, weights, and variables into classes, the proposed metric draws\ninspiration from the Earth mover's distance to quantify mismatches in\nweight-variable distributions for constraint comparisons.

However,\nachieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian\nSplatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently\nambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that\nenables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints.

In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled\nLatent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality\npart-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region\nwhile preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as\nGaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond\nthe existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local\n3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects\nqualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and\nflexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

    "abstract": "Accurate indoor localization is crucial for enabling spatial context in smart\nenvironments and navigation systems. Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces\n1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a\nnovel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind\nspot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic\ngraph adaptation. Extensive real-world evaluations across multiple indoor\nspaces with varying path lengths, AP densities, and heterogeneous devices\ndemonstrate that GATE achieves 1.6x to 4.72x lower mean localization errors and\n1.85x to 4.57x lower worst-case errors compared to state-of-the-art indoor\nlocalization frameworks.",

Here, we\ntheoretically introduce and analyze the temporal Brewster anomaly in\npseudospin-1/2 Dirac systems, demonstrating that Dirac waves remain delocalized\nalong a vector potential with fixed direction despite random temporal\nvariations in its magnitude. In contrast, waves propagating at any off-axis\nangle exhibit pronounced spatial localization and diffusive behavior. This\ndirectional selectivity arises from temporal impedance matching, previously\nidentified as the mechanism suppressing temporal reflection along the vector\npotential axis. By analyzing temporal reflectance, wave group velocity, and\npulse propagation, we establish that these systems function as dynamic\ndirectional filters, achieving collimated wave steering purely through temporal\nmodulation. In Dirac materials, external electric fields or mechanical strain\ncan dynamically control the orientation and strength of the vector potential\nmodulation, enabling precise, real-time tuning of directional wave\ntransmission. The temporal Brewster anomaly thus offers a robust and versatile\napproach for adaptive wave steering, promising significant technological\napplications in electronic and photonic devices.",

We describe how this\nspectral perspective is useful to better understand two well-known dualities\nbetween processes defined in the same configuration space: the Time-Reversal\nduality corresponds to an exchange between the right and the left eigenvectors\nthat involves the steady state, while in the Siegmund duality, the left\neigenvectors correspond to integrals of the dual right eigenvectors. We then\nfocus on the famous Moment-Duality between the Wright-Fisher diffusion on the\ninterval $x \\in [0,1] $ and the Kingman Markov jump process on the\nsemi-infinite lattice $n \\in {\\mathbb N}$ in order to analyze the relations\nbetween their eigenvectors living in two different configuration spaces.\nFinally, we discuss how the spectral perspective can be used to construct new\ndualities and we give an example for the case of non-degenerate real\neigenvalues, where one can always construct a dual Directed Jump process on the\nsemi-infinite lattice $n \\in {\\mathbb N}$, whose transitions rates are the\nopposite-eigenvalues.",

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze\ndatasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nsuperior robustness and real-time efficiency.

To investigate these mechanisms, we developed the Rosetta\nStone project: an end-to-end (simulations-observations) framework that is based\non the systematic production of realistic synthetic observations of clump\nfragmentation and their comparison with real data. In this work, we compare\nALMA 1.3mm continuum dust emission observations from the SQUALO survey with a\nnew set of 24 radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of high-mass clump\nfragmentation, post-processed using the CASA software to mimic the observing\nstrategy of SQUALO. The simulations were initialized combining typical values\nof clump mass (500,1000 solar masses) and radius (~0.4pc) with two levels of\nturbulence (Mach number of 7,10) and three levels of magnetization\n(mass-to-flux ratio of ~3,10,100). Following the clump evolution over time with\ntwo random seeds projected along three orthogonal directions, we produced a\ncollection of 732 synthetic fields. The synthetic observations of clump\nfragmentation at ~7000AU revealed between 2 and 14 fragments per field. Among\nthe initial conditions of the simulations, magnetic fields have the largest\nimpact on the fragment multiplicity at these scales. In advanced stages of\nclump evolution, a lower number of fragments is preferentially associated with\nmagnetized clumps. Fragments identified at ~7000AU correspond to individual or\nmultiple sink particles in ~75% of the cases, suggesting that not all fragments\nare actively forming stars. Both sinks and fragments accrete mass throughout\nthe whole clump evolution, favoring a scenario in which fragments are not\nisolated from the environment.

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for CBCT-to-MDCT translation, grounded in the\nSchrodinger Bridge (SB) formulation, which integrates GAN-derived priors with\nhuman-guided conditional diffusion. Unlike conventional GANs or diffusion\nmodels, our approach explicitly enforces boundary consistency between CBCT\ninputs and pseudo targets, ensuring both anatomical fidelity and perceptual\ncontrollability. Binary human feedback is incorporated via classifier-free\nguidance (CFG), effectively steering the generative process toward clinically\npreferred outcomes. Through iterative refinement and tournament-based\npreference selection, the model internalizes human preferences without relying\non a reward model. Subtraction image visualizations reveal that the proposed\nmethod selectively attenuates shade artifacts in key anatomical regions while\npreserving fine structural detail. Quantitative evaluations further demonstrate\nsuperior performance across RMSE, SSIM, LPIPS, and Dice metrics on clinical\ndatasets -- outperforming prior GAN- and fine-tuning-based feedback methods --\nwhile requiring only 10 sampling steps. These findings underscore the\neffectiveness and efficiency of our framework for real-time, preference-aligned\nmedical image translation.",

    "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing\nlarge language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and\ncomputational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

Present study (i)\noffers an alternative method to the popular two-fluid model for simulating the\nspatiotemporal dynamics of heterogeneous gas-solid flows, with the distinct\nadvantage that the constitutive relationships can be developed using the models\nand correlations that are obtained from homogeneous systems, of course an extra\nmodel for the interphase mass transfer rate between dilute phase and dense\nphase is needed, and the effective numerical solution of PDE-constrained\ndynamic optimization needs to be explored; and (ii) provides a feasible\nprocedure to formulate concrete mathematical equations from the core concept of\nmesoscience.",

However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a\nsimplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural\nrepresentations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance.

Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual\nsimilarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it\ndifficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a\nmixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial\nexamples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes\nhyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative\narchitectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically\non reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient\ntraining data is available.

Additionally,\nvarious experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning\napproaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat\nexcels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95.

In such scenarios, the presence\nof infinitely many subsystems within the network renders the existing analysis\nframeworks tailored for finite networks inapplicable to infinite ones. This\npaper is concerned with offering a data-driven approach, within a compositional\nframework, for the safety certification of infinite networks with both unknown\nmathematical models and interconnection topologies. Given the immense\ncomputational complexity stemming from the extensive dimension of infinite\nnetworks, our approach capitalizes on the joint dissipativity-type properties\nof subsystems, characterized by storage certificates. We introduce innovative\ncompositional data-driven conditions to construct a barrier certificate for the\ninfinite network leveraging storage certificates of its unknown subsystems\nderived from data, while offering correctness guarantees across the network\nsafety. We demonstrate that our compositional data-driven reasoning eliminates\nthe requirement for checking the traditional dissipativity condition, which\ntypically mandates precise knowledge of the interconnection topology. In\naddition, while existing data-driven literature demonstrates an exponential\ntrend in sample complexity with respect to network size, we showcase that our\ncompositional strategy notably reduces it to a linear scale in terms of the\nnumber of subsystems.

We evaluate our approach on the challenging Gait3D, GREW and BRIAR\ndatasets and show that learning the residual can be an effective technique to\ntackle occluded gait recognition with holistic retention.

Despite success, developing the corresponding\nstatistical inference procedures remains a challenging task. Recently, tackling\nthis challenge from a Bayesian perspective has received much attention. In\nliterature, the two-group spike-and-slab priors that can induce exact sparsity\nhave been demonstrated to yield valid inference in robust sparse linear models.\nNevertheless, another important category of sparse priors, the horseshoe family\nof priors, including horseshoe, horseshoe+, and regularized horseshoe priors,\nhas not yet been examined in robust high-dimensional regression by far. Their\nperformance in variable selection and especially statistical inference in the\npresence of heavy-tailed model errors is not well understood. In this paper, we\naddress the question by developing robust Bayesian hierarchical models\nutilizing the horseshoe family of priors along with an efficient Gibbs sampling\nscheme. We show that compared with competing methods with alternative sampling\nstrategies such as slice sampling, our proposals lead to superior performance\nin variable selection, Bayesian estimation and statistical inference. In\nparticular, our numeric studies indicate that even without imposing exact\nsparsity, the one-group horseshoe priors can still yield valid Bayesian\ncredible intervals under robust high-dimensional linear regression models.\nApplications of the proposed and alternative methods on real data further\nillustrates the advantage of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a Eulerian theory to elucidate the molecular kinematics\nin polymer networks and their connection to continuum deformation, grounded in\nfundamental statistical physics and thermodynamics. Three key innovations are\nincorporated: 1. The network behavior is described through a global\nthermodynamic equilibrium condition that maximizes the number of accessible\nmicrostates for all segments, instead of directly dealing with the\nwell-established single-chain models commonly adopted in traditional\napproaches. A variational problem is then posed in the Eulerian framework to\nidentify this equilibrium state under geometric fluctuation constraints. Its\nsolution recaptures the classical single-chain model and reveals the dependence\nof chain kinematics upon continuum deformation. 2. The chain stretch and\norientation probability are found to be explicitly specified through the\nEulerian logarithmic strain and spatial direction. The resulting hyperelastic\nmodel, with only two physical parameters, outperforms the extant models with\nsame number of parameters. It further provides a physical justification for\nprior models exhibiting superior predictive capabilities: the model becomes\nequivalent to the Biot-chain model at moderate deformations, while converging\nto the classical Hencky strain energy in the small strain limit. 3.A novel\nbiaxial instability emerges as a phase transition in chain orientation. At\nsufficiently large deformation, chains increasingly align with the primary\nstretched direction, depleting their density in other directions. Consequently,\nthe stresses in non-primary stretched directions would decrease as the loss in\nchain density outweighs the gain in chain force. For equal biaxial tension,\ninstability is therefore triggered because perfect equality of the two\nprincipal stretches without any perturbation is practically unachievable.",

To address this problem, we introduce\nAROMA, an AI system that provides timely responses to the user based on\nreal-time, context-aware assistance by integrating non-visual cues perceived by\nthe user, a wearable camera feed, and video recipe content. AROMA uses a\nmixed-initiative approach: it responds to user requests while also proactively\nmonitoring the video stream to offer timely alerts and guidance. This\ncollaborative design leverages the complementary strengths of the user and AI\nsystem to align the physical environment with the video recipe, helping the\nuser interpret their current cooking state and make sense of the steps.

It is shown that the color electric\nfield has a Y-like spatial distribution. Such a Y-like behavior arises because\nthe gradient component of the electric field is present. The nonlinear\ncomponent of the electric field is a curl one, and it appears because the\nvector potential sourced by a solenoidal current is present. The color magnetic\nfield is purely curl one, since its nonzero color components do not contain a\nnonlinear component; this results in the fact that its force lines lie on the\nsurface of a torus. It is shown that the results obtained are in good agreement\nwith the results obtained in lattice calculations in quantum chromodynamics.

We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a\nhigh-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF)\nand a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT,\nG-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically\nconsistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB\nimages) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these\ndesign choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is\nSE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key\ncomponents for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance,\nlocalized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH\ntasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to\nunseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and\nprinciples.

Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures\nreal-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment.

Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle -\nand very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have\nbeen given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference\nof the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to\ncircular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of\nthem involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a\ntime-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy\nvalues of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on\nwhich we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our\nuniverse's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced\nas an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the\nstandard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its \"1000CE\" variant, the past hypothesis,\nthe second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully\nformal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's\nstipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all\nmake an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single\nmoment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In\nthis aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally\nlegitimate (or not).",

The\nproposed active learning method is compared with the state-of-the-art methods\nusing simulations and two real datasets. It is found to have comparable or\nbetter performance relative to other non-stationary Gaussian process-based\nmethods, but faster by orders of magnitude.",

This formulation enables analysis of\nthe equilibrium well-posedness and the geometry of the induced configuration\nunder magnetic actuation. In particular, we show that the maximum controllable\ndegrees of freedom of a MeSCR equal twice the number of embedded magnets. We\nsubsequently develop a structural optimization framework based on differential\ngeometry that links classical kinematic measures (e.g., manipulability and\ndexterity) to the configuration of embedded magnets. The resulting optimization\ncondition reveals that improving local performance requires structurally\nmodulating the spectrum of the configuration space metric to counteract its\ndistortion.

This study introduces a fast and accurate conditional variational\ninference (CVI) approach to calibrate MNP model parameters, which is scalable\nto large samples and large choice sets. A flexible variational distribution on\ncorrelated latent utilities is defined using neural embeddings, and a\nreparameterization trick is used to ensure the positive definiteness of the\nresulting covariance matrix.

    "abstract": "Semantic change detection (SCD) extends the binary change detection task to\nprovide not only the change locations but also the detailed \"from-to\"\ncategories in multi-temporal remote sensing data. Such detailed semantic\ninsights into changes offer considerable advantages for a wide array of\napplications. However, since SCD involves the simultaneous optimization of\nmultiple tasks, the model is prone to negative transfer due to task-specific\nlearning difficulties and conflicting gradient flows. To address this issue, we\npropose Graph Aggregation Prototype Learning for Semantic Change Detection in\nremote sensing(GAPL-SCD). In this framework, a multi-task joint optimization\nmethod is designed to optimize the primary task of semantic segmentation and\nchange detection, along with the auxiliary task of graph aggregation prototype\nlearning. Adaptive weight allocation and gradient rotation methods are used to\nalleviate the conflict between training tasks and improve multi-task learning\ncapabilities. Specifically, the graph aggregation prototype learning module\nconstructs an interaction graph using high-level features. Prototypes serve as\nclass proxies, enabling category-level domain alignment across time points and\nreducing interference from irrelevant changes. Additionally, the proposed\nself-query multi-level feature interaction and bi-temporal feature fusion\nmodules further enhance multi-scale feature representation, improving\nperformance in complex scenes. Experimental results on the SECOND and\nLandsat-SCD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, with significant improvements in accuracy and robustness for SCD\ntask.",

Existing methods often rely on\nfully supervised learning, which requires costly ground-truth pose annotations.\nIn this work, we propose GeoDistill, a Geometry guided weakly supervised self\ndistillation framework that uses teacher-student learning with Field-of-View\n(FoV)-based masking to enhance local feature learning for robust cross-view\nlocalization. In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly\nimproves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative\norientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth.

However, to maximize the utility and participant satisfaction\nwith such technology, participants' willingness to embrace BCIs must be\nassessed, and placed in context with functional goals and rehabilitative\npriorities. Hence, we conducted a survey of a cohort of stroke (n=33), SCI\n(n=37), and both (n=1) participants regarding their receptiveness to invasive\nECoG-based BCIs as well as to assess their goals for functional rehabilitation.\nOverall, participants indicated a high level of willingness to undergo surgery\nto implant ECoG grids for BCI technology if basic motor functions, including\nupper extremity, gait, bowel/bladder, and sensory function were restored. There\nwas no correlation between participant willingness to undergo a prospective BCI\nimplantation and the level of functional recovery offered by the BCI.\nSimilarly, there was no correlation between willingness to undergo surgery and\nthe participants' perceived rehabilitative priorities and level of disability.\nThese findings indicate that participants were interested in invasive BCI\ntechnology even if only basic functions can be restored, regardless of their\nlevel of disability and their rehabilitative priorities.

Although numerous error detection algorithms have been\nproposed, the lack of diverse, real-world error datasets limits comprehensive\nevaluation. Manual error annotation is both time-consuming and inconsistent,\nmotivating the exploration of synthetic error generation as an alternative. In\nthis work, we introduce TableEG, a framework that leverages large language\nmodels (LLMs) to generate authentic errors. By employing a table fine-tuning\nstrategy and a triplet representation $(I, T, O)$ to model error generation,\ndetection, and correction tasks, TableEG captures the complex dependencies\ninherent in two-dimensional tables. Trained on 12 real-world datasets spanning\n10 diverse domains, TableEG ensures that the synthesized errors faithfully\nreflect authentic error distributions. Experimental results indicate that\nerrors generated by TableEG exhibit superior pattern and distribution\nsimilarity compared to both rule-based methods and LLM-generated errors without\nfine-tuning. Furthermore, performance metrics on TableEG-generated errors\nclosely align with those on real-world errors across nearly all datasets and\ndetection algorithms, particularly for machine learning based detection\ntechniques. Overall, TableEG not only bridges the gap between synthetic and\nreal-world errors but also establishes a robust benchmark for subsequent error\ndetection and correction tasks.",

We analysed three models for contact patterns within and between\nethnicities -- proportionate mixing, assortative mixing, and empirically\nderived mixing -- and fit them using ethnicity-specific data on reported cases\nand spatially disaggregated population counts. We found that M\\=aori, Pacific,\nand Asian contact rates were between 1.17-2.46, 1.60-3.89, and 0.83-0.92 times\nthe European rates, respectively. We then found that from the parameters\nconsidered in the model, the disparity in transmission rates explained the\nmajority of the observed disparity in attack rates, while assortativity and\nvaccine rates explained comparably less.",

    "abstract": "Offset surfaces, defined as the Minkowski sum of a base surface and a rolling\nball, play a crucial role in geometry processing, with applications ranging\nfrom coverage motion planning to brush modeling. While considerable progress\nhas been made in computing constant-radius offset surfaces, computing\nvariable-radius offset surfaces remains a challenging problem. In this paper,\nwe present OffsetCrust, a novel framework that efficiently addresses the\nvariable-radius offsetting problem by computing a power diagram. Let $R$ denote\nthe radius function defined on the base surface $S$. The power diagram is\nconstructed from contributing sites, consisting of carefully sampled base\npoints on $S$ and their corresponding off-surface points, displaced along\n$R$-dependent directions. In the constant-radius case only, these displacement\ndirections align exactly with the surface normals of $S$. Moreover, our method\nmitigates the misalignment issues commonly seen in crust-based approaches\nthrough a lightweight fine-tuning procedure. We validate the accuracy and\nefficiency of OffsetCrust through extensive experiments, and demonstrate its\npractical utility in applications such as reconstructing original boundary\nsurfaces from medial axis transform (MAT) representations.",

    "abstract": "Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests\nbased on their behaviors or auxiliary signals. However, existing methods often\nrely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same\ninterest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with\nreal-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the\ngranularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to\noverly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis\nprovides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we\npropose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more\neffective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to\nflexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters,\nindicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic\ngeneration of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users'\ncollaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions,\nallowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's\nbehaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived\nfrom individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose\naggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more\ncomprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering\nproblem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users'\nbehaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven\nmulti-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.\nExperiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

A systematic numerical analysis demonstrates that families of\nthe states with $S=1,M=0$, i.e., $Q_{H}=0$, are stable, provided that the inner\nTP\\ radius $R_{0}$ exceeds a critical value. Furthermore, true hopfions with\n$S=1,M=1\\sim 7$, which correspond, accordingly, to $Q_{H}=1\\sim 7$, also form\npartly stable families, including the case of the LHY\\ superfluid, in which the\nnonlinearity is represented solely by the LHY term. On the other hand, the\nhopfion family is completely unstable in the absence of the LHY term, when only\nthe mean-field nonlinearity is present. We illustrate the knot-like structure\nof the hopfions by means of an elementary geometric picture. For $Q_{H}=0$,\ncircles which represent the \\textit{preimage} of the full state do not\nintersect. On the contrary, for $Q_{H}\\geq 1$ they intersect at points whose\nnumber is identical to $Q_{H}$. The intersecting curves form multi-petal\nstructures with the number of petals also equal to $Q_{H}$.",

Throughout our quantum\nsimulated experiments, parameter transfer showed no noticeable reduction in\nsolution quality over optimisation for QAOA and RQAOA while substantially\nimproving the efficiency due to avoiding measurements required for\noptimisation. Additionally, RQAOA only requires measurements of\n$ZZ$-correlations instead of full statevectors, benefiting from the\nreverse-causal-cone feature that leads to circuits with significantly lower\nCNOT counts and depths. The performance of QAOA and RQAOA with parameter\ntransfer is benchmarked against classical solvers and heuristics and their\nresilience to non-optimal parameters is explored.

However, most\nexisting methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty,\noverlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes. In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such as network\nintrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often clusters by\nclass. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and introduce the\nClass Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a quantitative measure. We\ndemonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with performance degradation in\nclass-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to overrepresent easy majority\nclasses while neglecting rare but informative ones. To address this, we\nintroduce class-proportional variants of multiple sampling strategies.\nEvaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and medical domains, our\nmethods consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. For instance, on\nCTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a class-proportional variant of\nCoverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows remarkable stability, with\naccuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and recall 0.19%.

To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization\nand explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local\nVariation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods\nincorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of\nbounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic\nframework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new\nevaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local\npredictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our\napproach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion\ndatasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including\nLSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct\nmetrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.\nResults consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art\nbaselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled\ntrade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label\ninconsistency.

Its modular\narchitecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while\nthe explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy\nof instructions.

NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction\nquality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on\nexpert annotations.

Materials and\nMethods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random\nforest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,\nSurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an\nattention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.\nPerformance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key\npredictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved\nthe highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)\nand baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by\ndynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative\nclinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most\ncontributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone\ndisorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most\nimpactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention\nmechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential\nnature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher\naccuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical\nadoption.

The actual drain and shipping costs are\ndetermined by complex production systems that manage the planning and execution\nof customers' orders fulfillment, i.e. from where and how to ship a unit to be\ndelivered to a customer. Accurately modeling these processes is critical for\nregional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nto develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated\ninto a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be\ndifferentiable. While simulating the calls to the internal software systems can\nbe used to recover this transition, they are non-differentiable and too slow\nand costly to run within an RL training environment. Accordingly, we frame this\nas a probabilistic forecasting problem, modeling the joint distribution of\noutbound drain and shipping costs across all warehouses at each time period,\nconditioned on inventory positions and exogenous customer demand. To ensure\nrobustness in an RL environment, the model must handle out-of-distribution\nscenarios that arise from off-policy trajectories. We propose a validation\nscheme that leverages production systems to evaluate the drain model on\ncounterfactual inventory states induced by RL policies.

Overall results\nshow that users can find paths through graphs significantly faster with Quilts\n(46.6 secs) than with node-link (58.3 secs) or matrix (71.2 secs) diagrams.\nThis speed advantage is still greater in large graphs (e.g. in 200 node graphs,\n55.4 secs vs. 71.1 secs for node-link and 84.2 secs for matrix depictions).",

The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC\nis a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes\nis imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive\nsmall language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the\nenhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we\naddress the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using\nunstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon\nencoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes\nto capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied\nto the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains\ncomparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat\nclassifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and\nachieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only\narchitectures for structured sequence generation tasks.

Traditional\napproaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent\nproperties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state\nparabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for\ncomputational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a\nGraph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is\nspecifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in\nneural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent\nrepresentations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration\nprofiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global\ngraph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent\nspace via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration\nof an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models\nwith reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component\neffectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in\nrecurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated\nthrough results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport\nexamples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum\nrelative error <8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to\nprevious surrogate model approaches.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of\ncapturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for\nzero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested\nin the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or\nabdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more\nchallenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly\ndifficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation\ncaused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal\nstructure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.\nWhether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level\nof complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a\ncomprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for\nbreast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,\nMedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that\ncapture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and\npatient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that\nfoundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional\nregistration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large\ndomain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular\ntissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or\nbreast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration\nperformance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to\nunderstand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore\ntargeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure\naccuracy. We also publicly release our code at\n\\href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.",

    "abstract": "Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a dominant strategy for\nself-supervised representation learning in natural images, where models are\npre-trained to reconstruct masked patches with a pixel-wise mean squared error\n(MSE) between original and reconstructed RGB values as the loss. We observe\nthat MSE encourages blurred image re-construction, but still works for natural\nimages as it preserves dominant edges. However, in medical imaging, when the\ntexture cues are more important for classification of a visual abnormality, the\nstrategy fails. Taking inspiration from Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)\nfeature in Radiomics studies, we propose a novel MAE based pre-training\nframework, GLCM-MAE, using reconstruction loss based on matching GLCM. GLCM\ncaptures intensity and spatial relationships in an image, hence proposed loss\nhelps preserve morphological features. Further, we propose a novel formulation\nto convert matching GLCM matrices into a differentiable loss function. We\ndemonstrate that unsupervised pre-training on medical images with the proposed\nGLCM loss improves representations for downstream tasks. GLCM-MAE outperforms\nthe current state-of-the-art across four tasks - gallbladder cancer detection\nfrom ultrasound images by 2.1%, breast cancer detection from ultrasound by\n3.1%, pneumonia detection from x-rays by 0.5%, and COVID detection from CT by\n0.6%.

    "abstract": "We point out that relic neutrinos from the Big Bang may induce the parametric\nfluorescence in molecular systems, which offers a novel way to discover cosmic\nneutrino background. By coherently scattering with molecular energy levels, a\nmassive neutrino can spontaneously ``decay\" into a lighter neutrino and an\ninfrared signal photon, i.e., $\\nu^{}_{i} + M \\to \\nu^{}_{j} + \\gamma^{}_{\\rm\nS} + M$, where the molecular state $M$ remains unchanged after the scattering.\nBecause the amplitudes of different radiants are matched in phase, the rate is\ncoherently enhanced and proportional to the squared density of ambient dipoles.\nWhen the energy transfer from neutrinos coincides with the molecular\nenergy-level difference, the fluorescence will be on resonance. We find that\nthe event rate for $\\nu^{}_{i} \\to \\nu^{}_{j} + \\gamma^{}_{\\rm S}$ at the\nresonance peak through the magnetic dipole transition can reach $R \\sim 5~{\\rm\nyr}^{-1}$ (or $10~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$) for Dirac (or Majorana) neutrinos for a\nnominal target with a spatial dimension of $l=3~{\\rm m}$. Parity mixing by the\nStark effect may help to further magnify the signal rate.",

    "abstract": "Automation in optical microscopy is critical for enabling high-throughput\nimaging across a wide range of biomedical applications. Among the essential\ncomponents of automated systems, robust autofocusing plays a pivotal role in\nmaintaining image quality for both single-plane and volumetric imaging.\nHowever, conventional autofocusing methods often struggle with implementation\ncomplexity, limited generalizability across sample types, incompatibility with\nthick specimens, and slow feedback. We recently discovered a phenomenon that\nthe digitally summed Fourier spectrum of two images acquired from two-angle\nillumination exhibits interference-like fringe modulation when the sample is\ndefocused. These digital fringes correlate directly with defocus through a\nphysics-based relation. Based on this principle, we developed an automatic,\nefficient, and generalizable defocus detection method termed digital defocus\naberration interference (DAbI). Implemented with a simple two-LED setup, DAbI\ncan quantify the defocus distance over a range of 212 times the depth-of-field\n(DoF) for thin samples and 300 times for thick specimens. It can additionally\nextend the natural DoF of the imaging system by 20 folds when integrated with\ncomplex-field imaging. We demonstrated the versatile applications of DAbI on\nbrightfield, complex-field, refractive index, confocal, and widefield\nfluorescence imaging, establishing it as a promising solution for automated,\nhigh-throughput optical microscopy.",
