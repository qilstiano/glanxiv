    "abstract": "Y$_2$Co$_3$ is a newly discovered antiferromagnetic (AFM) compound with\ndistorted kagome layers. Previous investigations via bulk magnetization\nmeasurements suggested a complex noncollinear magnetic behavior, with magnetic\nmoments primarily anti-aligned along the $b$ axis and some canting towards the\n$ac$ plane. In this study, we report the magnetic structure of Y$_2$Co$_3$ to\nbe an A-type AFM structure with ferromagnetic (FM) interactions within the\ndistorted kagome plane and an interplane antiferromagnetic interaction, as\ndetermined by single-crystal neutron diffraction. The magnetic moments align\nalong the $b$ axis, with minimal canting towards the $c$ axis, at odds with the\nprevious interpretation of bulk magnetization measurements. The magnetic\nmoments on the two distinct Co sites are [0, -0.68(3), 0] $\\mu_B$ and [0,\n1.25(4), 0.07(1)] $\\mu_B$. We attribute the previously reported \"noncollinear\"\nbehavior to the considerable temperature dependence of itinerant AFM exchange\ninteractions, induced by thermal contraction along the $b$ axis. Additionally,\nour examination of lattice constants through pressure studies reveals\ncompensating effects on FM and AFM interactions, resulting in negligible\npressure dependence of $T_\\textrm{N}$.",

The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular DLVM widely\nstudied in disentanglement analysis due to the modeling of the posterior\ndistribution using a factorized Gaussian distribution that encourages the\nalignment of the latent factors with the latent axes. Several metrics have been\nproposed recently, assuming that the latent variables explaining the variation\nin data are aligned with the latent axes (cardinal directions). However, there\nare other DLVMs, such as the AAE and WAE-MMD (matching the aggregate posterior\nto the prior), where the latent variables might not be aligned with the latent\naxes. In this work, we propose a statistical method to evaluate disentanglement\nfor any DLVMs in general.

In real-world\nscenarios, cooperation prevails in multi-group (higher-order) populations,\nbeyond just dyadic behaviors. Despite recent studies on group dilemmas in\nhigher-order networks, the exploration of cooperation driven by higher-order\nstrategy updates remains limited due to the intricacy and indivisibility of\ngroup-wise interactions. Here we investigate four categories of higher-order\nmechanisms for strategy updates in public goods games and establish their\nmathematical conditions for the emergence of cooperation. Such conditions\nuncover the impact of both higher-order strategy updates and network properties\non evolutionary outcomes, notably highlighting the enhancement of cooperation\nby overlaps between groups. Interestingly, we discover that the strategical\nmechanism alternating optimality and randomness -- selecting an outstanding\ngroup and then imitating a random individual within this group -- can\nprominently promote cooperation. Our analyses further unveil that, compared to\npairwise interactions, higher-order strategy updates generally improve\ncooperation in most higher-order networks.

    "abstract": "Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) waves, frequently produced by eruptions, propagate\nthrough the non-uniform magnetic field of the solar corona and interact with\ndistant prominences, inducing their global oscillations. However, the\ngeneration, propagation, and interaction of these waves with distant\nprominences remain poorly understood. We aim to study the influence of an\neruptive flux rope (EFR) on a distant prominence by means of extreme-resolution\nnumerical simulations. We cover a domain of a horizontal extent of 1100 Mm,\nwhile capturing details down to 130 km using automated grid refinement. We\nperformed a 2.5D numerical experiment using the open-source \\texttt{MPI-AMRVAC\n3.1} code, modeling an eruption as a 2.5D catastrophe scenario augmented with a\ndistant dipole magnetic field to form a flux rope prominence. Our findings\nreveal that the EFR becomes unstable and generates a quasi-circular front. The\nprimary front produces a slow secondary front when crossing the equipartition\nlines where the Alfv\\'en speed is close to the sound speed. The resulting fast\nand slow EUV waves show different behaviors: the fast EUV wave slightly\ndecelerates as it propagates through the corona, while the slow EUV wave forms\na stationary front. The fast EUV wave interacts with the remote prominence,\ndriving both transverse and longitudinal oscillations. Additionally, magnetic\nreconnection at a null point below the prominence-hosting flux rope is\ntriggered by the fast EUV wave, affecting the flux rope magnetic field and the\nprominence oscillations. Our study unifies important results of the dynamics of\neruptive events and their interactions with distant prominences, including\ndetails of (oscillatory) reconnection and chaotic plasmoid dynamics. We\ndemonstrate for the first time the full consequences of remote eruptions on\nprominence dynamics and clarify the damping mechanisms of prominence\noscillations.",

A key finding is the gap between the current\nstate of the art and actual practice in RSE for AI, particularly in the failure\nto operationalize ethical and responsible decision-making within the software\nengineering life cycle for AI. While ethical issues in RSE for AI largely\nmirror those found in broader SE process, the study highlights a distinct lack\nof operational frameworks and resources to guide RSE practices for AI\neffectively. The results reveal that current ethical guidelines are\ninsufficiently implemented at the operational level, reinforcing the complexity\nof embedding ethics throughout the software engineering life cycle. The study\nconcludes that interdisciplinary collaboration, H-shaped\ncompetencies(Ethical-Technical dual competence), and a strong organizational\nculture of ethics are critical for fostering RSE practices for AI, with a\nparticular focus on transparency and accountability.",

Precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for\nfuture hydrological modelling in this area. In this study, we propose a\nprobabilistic machine learning framework to combine monthly precipitation from\n13 regional climate models developed under the Coordinated Regional Downscaling\nExperiment (CORDEX) over HMA via a mixture of experts (MoE). This approach\naccounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the\nprediction of more faithful precipitation distributions.

This approach is then used to generate\nprecipitation projections for the near future (2036-2065) and far future\n(2066-2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.

    "abstract": "Modelling the diffusion-relaxation magnetic resonance (MR) signal obtained\nfrom multi-parametric sequences has recently gained immense interest in the\ncommunity due to new techniques significantly reducing data acquisition time. A\npreferred approach for examining the diffusion-relaxation MR data is to follow\nthe continuum modelling principle that employs kernels to represent the tissue\nfeatures, such as the relaxations or diffusion properties. However,\nconstructing reasonable dictionaries with predefined signal components depends\non the sampling density of model parameter space, thus leading to a geometrical\nincrease in the number of atoms per extra tissue parameter considered in the\nmodel. That makes estimating the contributions from each atom in the signal\nchallenging, especially considering diffusion features beyond the\nmono-exponential decay.\n  This paper presents a new Multi-Compartment diffusion-relaxation MR signal\nrepresentation based on the Simple Harmonic Oscillator-based Reconstruction and\nEstimation (MC-SHORE) representation, compatible with scattered acquisitions.\nThe proposed technique imposes sparsity constraint on the solution via the\n$\\ell_1$ norm and enables the estimation of the microstructural measures, such\nas the return-to-the-origin probability, and the orientation distribution\nfunction, depending on the compartments considered in a single voxel. The\nprocedure has been verified with in silico and in vivo data and enabled the\napproximation of the diffusion-relaxation MR signal more accurately than\nsingle-compartment non-Gaussian representations and multi-compartment\nmono-exponential decay techniques, maintaining a low number of atoms in the\ndictionary. Ultimately, the MC-SHORE procedure allows for separating\nintra-/extra-axonal and free water contributions from the signal, thus reducing\nthe partial volume effect observable in the boundaries of the tissues.",

Existing MMKGC approaches primarily\nextend traditional knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, which often require\ncreating an embedding for every entity. This results in large model sizes and\ninefficiencies in integrating multimodal information, particularly for\nreal-world graphs. Meanwhile, Transformer-based models have demonstrated\ncompetitive performance in knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, their\nfocus on single-modal knowledge limits their capacity to utilize cross-modal\ninformation. Recently, Large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential\nin cross-modal tasks but are constrained by the high cost of training. In this\nwork, we propose a novel approach that integrates Transformer-based KGE models\nwith cross-modal context generated by pre-trained VLMs, thereby extending their\napplicability to MMKGC. Specifically, we employ a pre-trained VLM to transform\nrelevant visual information from entities and their neighbors into textual\nsequences. We then frame KGC as a sequence-to-sequence task, fine-tuning the\nmodel with the generated cross-modal context. This simple yet effective method\nsignificantly reduces model size compared to traditional KGE approaches while\nachieving competitive performance across multiple large-scale datasets with\nminimal hyperparameter tuning.",

Preliminary results indicate that\ndeep learning models can effectively capture the complex interactions between\nmultiple factors influencing disease dynamics, demonstrating a promising\ncapacity to forecast wheat yellow rust with considerable accuracy.\nSpecifically, the fully-connected neural network achieved 83.65% accuracy in a\ndisease prediction task with 6 month predictive time step setup. These findings\nhighlight the potential of deep learning to transform disease management\nstrategies, enabling earlier and more precise interventions. Our study provides\na methodological framework for employing deep learning in agricultural settings\nbut also opens avenues for future research to enhance the robustness and\napplicability of predictive models in combating crop diseases globally.",

The stationary\ntransonic integral accretion solutions corresponding to the steady state of\naforementioned type of accreting systems are constructed and the stability\nanalysis of such solutions are performed through the time dependent linear\nperturbation of the accretion flow.

The acoustic horizons are then identified by constructing the causal\nstructure, i.e., the Carter-Penrose diagrams. The variation of the analogue\nsurface gravity corresponding to the aforementioned sonic metric has been\nstudied as a function of various parameters governing the accretion flow.",

In this work, we propose a new\narchitecture StagFormer (Staggered Transformer), which staggers execution along\nthe sequence axis and thereby enables parallelizing the decoding process along\nthe depth of the model. We achieve this by breaking the dependency of the token\nrepresentation at time step $i$ in layer $l$ upon the representations of tokens\nuntil time step $i$ from layer $l-1$. Instead, we stagger the execution and\nonly allow a dependency on token representations until time step $i-1$. The\nlater sections of the Transformer still get access to the \"rich\"\nrepresentations from the prior section but only from those token positions\nwhich are one time step behind. StagFormer allows for different sections of the\nmodel to be executed in parallel yielding a potential speedup in decoding while\nbeing quality neutral in our simulations. We also explore many natural\nextensions of this idea. We present how weight-sharing across the different\nsections being staggered can be more practical in settings with limited memory.\nWe explore the efficacy of using a bounded window attention to pass information\nfrom one section to another which helps drive further latency gains for some\napplications. We also explore the scalability of the staggering idea over more\nthan 2 sections of the Transformer. Finally, we show how one can approximate a\nrecurrent model during inference using weight-sharing. This variant can lead to\nsubstantial gains in quality for short generations while being neutral in its\nlatency impact.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of hybrid metaheuristic algorithms to\nenhance the training of Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) by leveraging the\ncomplementary strengths of multiple optimisation strategies. Traditional\nlearning methods, such as gradient-based approaches, often struggle to optimise\nhigh-dimensional and uncertain environments, while single-method metaheuristics\nmay fail to exploit the solution space fully. To address these challenges, we\npropose the constrained Hybrid Metaheuristic (cHM) algorithm, a novel approach\nthat combines multiple population-based optimisation techniques into a unified\nframework. The proposed procedure operates in two phases: an initial probing\nphase evaluates multiple metaheuristics to identify the best-performing one\nbased on the error rate, followed by a fitting phase where the selected\nmetaheuristic refines the PNN to achieve optimal smoothing parameters. This\niterative process ensures efficient exploration and convergence, enhancing the\nnetwork's generalisation and classification accuracy. cHM integrates several\npopular metaheuristics, such as BAT, Simulated Annealing, Flower Pollination\nAlgorithm, Bacterial Foraging Optimization, and Particle Swarm Optimisation as\ninternal optimisers. To evaluate cHM performance, experiments were conducted on\n16 datasets with varying characteristics, including binary and multiclass\nclassification tasks, balanced and imbalanced class distributions, and diverse\nfeature dimensions. The results demonstrate that cHM effectively combines the\nstrengths of individual metaheuristics, leading to faster convergence and more\nrobust learning. By optimising the smoothing parameters of PNNs, the proposed\nmethod enhances classification performance across diverse datasets, proving its\napplication flexibility and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Fiducial marker positions in projection image of cone-beam computed\ntomography (CBCT) scans have been studied to evaluate daily residual motion\nduring breath-hold radiation therapy. Fiducial marker migration posed\nchallenges in accurately locating markers, prompting the development of a novel\nalgorithm that reconstructs volumetric probability maps of marker locations\nfrom filtered gradient maps of projections. This guides the development of a\nPython-based algorithm to detect fiducial markers in projection images using\nMeta AI's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2). Retrospective data from a\npancreatic cancer patient with two fiducial markers were analyzed. The\nthree-dimensional (3D) marker positions from simulation computed tomography\n(CT) were compared to those reconstructed from CBCT images, revealing a\ndecrease in relative distances between markers over time. Fiducial markers were\nsuccessfully detected in 2777 out of 2786 projection frames. The average\nstandard deviation of superior-inferior (SI) marker positions was 0.56 mm per\nbreath-hold, with differences in average SI positions between two breath-holds\nin the same scan reaching up to 5.2 mm, and a gap of up to 7.3 mm between the\nend of the first and beginning of the second breath-hold. 3D marker positions\nwere calculated using projection positions and confirmed marker migration. This\nmethod effectively calculates marker probability volume and enables accurate\nfiducial marker tracking during treatment without requiring any specialized\nequipment, additional radiation doses, or manual initialization and labeling.\nIt has significant potential for automatically assessing daily residual motion\nto adjust planning margins, functioning as an adaptive radiation therapy tool.",

In particular, we leverage a\nnovel side effect of this gap between the laboratory and the real world:\nlocation-based weakness in pedestrian detection. We demonstrate that the\nposition (distance, angle, height) of a person, and ambient light level,\ndirectly impact the confidence of a pedestrian detector when detecting the\nperson. We then demonstrate that this phenomenon is present in pedestrian\ndetectors observing a stationary scene of pedestrian traffic, with blind spot\nareas of weak detection of pedestrians with low confidence. We show how\nprivacy-concerned pedestrians can leverage these blind spots to evade detection\nby constructing a minimum confidence path between two points in a scene,\nreducing the maximum confidence and average confidence of the path by up to\n0.09 and 0.13, respectively, over direct and random paths through the scene. To\ncounter this phenomenon, and force the use of more costly and sophisticated\nmethods to leverage this vulnerability, we propose a novel countermeasure to\nimprove the confidence of pedestrian detectors in blind spots, raising the\nmax/average confidence of paths generated by our technique by 0.09 and 0.05,\nrespectively.

Roughly speaking, in their\nmost basic form, ANNs can be regarded as functions that consist of a series of\ncompositions of affine-linear functions with multidimensional versions of\nso-called activation functions. One of the most popular of such activation\nfunctions is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) function $\\mathbb{R} \\ni x\n\\mapsto \\max\\{ x, 0 \\} \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The ReLU function is, however, not\ndifferentiable and, typically, this lack of regularity transfers to the cost\nfunction of the supervised learning problem under consideration. Regardless of\nthis lack of differentiability issue, deep learning practioners apply SGD\nmethods based on suitably generalized gradients in standard deep learning\nlibraries like {\\sc TensorFlow} or {\\sc Pytorch}. In this work we reveal an\naccurate and concise mathematical description of such generalized gradients in\nthe training of deep fully-connected feedforward ANNs and we also study the\nresulting generalized gradient function analytically.

Motivated by the pervasive reliance on single service\nproviders for data storage and computation, we propose a privacy-preserving\nscheme that achieves information-theoretic security guarantees for computing\npolynomials over non-uniform data distributions. Our framework builds upon the\nconcept of perfect subset privacy and employs linear hashing techniques to\ntransform non-uniform data into approximately uniform distributions, enabling\nrobust and secure computation. We derive leakage bounds and demonstrate that\ninformation leakage of any subset of user data to untrusted service providers,\ni.e., not only to colluding workers but also (and more importantly) to the\nadmin, remains negligible under the proposed scheme.",

The\nground-based telescope observations offer a key science input for the mission's\nscientific investigation. During 2022 - 2024 this asteroid was at visible\napparent magnitudes brighter than 18.5, allowing for a detailed\ncharacterization using ground-based telescope observations. We determined its\nrotation period $P~=~5.021516\\pm0.000106$ h and its absolute magnitude H =\n18.78 $\\pm$ 0.14 and. The large number of lightcurves allows to estimate its\naxes ratio, its convex shape and its pole orientation $\\lambda = 301^{\\circ}\n\\pm 35^{\\circ}$, $\\beta = {89^{+1}_{-6}}^{\\circ}$ and $\\epsilon = 5^{\\circ} \\pm\n3^{\\circ}$ which indicate a prograde rotation.

Recently, hybrid\ncryptosystems offered PQ security by premixing the data using secure linear\ncoding schemes and encrypting only a small portion of it. The data is assumed\nto be uniformly distributed, an assumption that is often challenging to\nenforce. Standard fixed-length lossless source coding and compression schemes\nguarantee a uniform output in normalized divergence. Yet, this is not\nsufficient to guarantee security. We consider an efficient compression scheme\nuniform in non-normalized variational distance for the proposed hybrid\ncryptosystem, that by utilizing a uniform sub-linear shared seed, guarantees PQ\nsecurity. Specifically, for the proposed PQ cryptosystem, first, we provide an\nend-to-end practical coding scheme, NU-HUNCC, for non-uniform messages. Second,\nwe show that NU-HUNCC is information-theoretic individually secured (IS)\nagainst an eavesdropper with access to any subset of the links and provide a\nconverse proof against such an eavesdropper. Third, we introduce a modified\nsecurity definition, individual semantic security under a chosen ciphertext\nattack (ISS-CCA1), and show that against an all-observing eavesdropper,\nNU-HUNCC satisfies its conditions. Finally, we provide an analysis of\nNU-HUNCC's high data rate, low computational complexity, and the negligibility\nof the shared seed size.",

Personalizing generative models through fine-tuning\nwith theme-specific data has become a prevalent approach in text-to-image\ngeneration. However, unlike object customization, which focuses on learning\nspecific objects, theme-specific generation encompasses diverse elements such\nas characters, scenes, and objects. Such diversity also introduces a key\nchallenge: how to adaptively generate multi-character, multi-concept, and\ncontinuous theme-specific images (TSI). Moreover, fine-tuning approaches often\ncome with significant computational overhead, time costs, and risks of\noverfitting. This paper explores a fundamental question: Can image generation\nmodels directly leverage images as contextual input, similarly to how large\nlanguage models use text as context? To address this, we present IP-Prompter, a\nnovel training-free TSI generation method. IP-Prompter introduces visual\nprompting, a mechanism that integrates reference images into generative models,\nallowing users to seamlessly specify the target theme without requiring\nadditional training. To further enhance this process, we propose a Dynamic\nVisual Prompting (DVP) mechanism, which iteratively optimizes visual prompts to\nimprove the accuracy and quality of generated images. Our approach enables\ndiverse applications, including consistent story generation, character design,\nrealistic character generation, and style-guided image generation. Comparative\nevaluations against state-of-the-art personalization methods demonstrate that\nIP-Prompter achieves significantly better results and excels in maintaining\ncharacter identity preserving, style consistency and text alignment, offering a\nrobust and flexible solution for theme-specific image generation.",

We aim to test the marginal statistical evidence previously\nreported for a connection between repeating patterns of $\\gamma$-ray flares in\nblazars and high-energy neutrino events that are positionally consistent with\nthese sources.

    "abstract": "Structure-based drug design (SBDD) leverages the 3D structure of biomolecular\ntargets to guide the creation of new therapeutic agents. Recent advances in\ngenerative models, including diffusion models and geometric deep learning, have\ndemonstrated promise in optimizing ligand generation. However, the scarcity of\nhigh-quality protein-ligand complex data and the inherent challenges in\naligning generated ligands with target proteins limit the effectiveness of\nthese methods. We propose BoKDiff, a novel framework that enhances ligand\ngeneration by combining multi-objective optimization and Best-of-K alignment\nmethodologies. Built upon the DecompDiff model, BoKDiff generates diverse\ncandidates and ranks them using a weighted evaluation of molecular properties\nsuch as QED, SA, and docking scores. To address alignment challenges, we\nintroduce a method that relocates the center of mass of generated ligands to\ntheir docking poses, enabling accurate sub-component extraction. Additionally,\nwe integrate a Best-of-N (BoN) sampling approach, which selects the optimal\nligand from multiple generated candidates without requiring fine-tuning. BoN\nachieves exceptional results, with QED values exceeding 0.6, SA scores above\n0.75, and a success rate surpassing 35%, demonstrating its efficiency and\npracticality. BoKDiff achieves state-of-the-art results on the CrossDocked2020\ndataset, including a -8.58 average Vina docking score and a 26% success rate in\nmolecule generation. This study is the first to apply Best-of-K alignment and\nBest-of-N sampling to SBDD, highlighting their potential to bridge generative\nmodeling with practical drug discovery requirements.

The key\nparameters analyzed include the Lindemann coefficient, radial distribution\nfunction, and magnetization in relation to temperature and magnetic field. The\nresults indicate that applying biaxial tensile strain generally reduces the\ncritical temperature.

When applying the\nTwo-Measure theory (TMT) to study cosmology, the ratio \\zeta of the measure\ndensities is a scalar function, which: enters into all equations of motion.\nThrough the constraint, $\\zeta$ is defined as a function of \\phi(t). During\ncosmological evolution, \\zeta(\\phi) changes from \\zeta\\approx 0 at the\ninflationary stage to \\zeta=1 at the approaching vacuum stage. Each stage of\nthe classical cosmological background is determined by the set \\{\\phi(t), {\\rm\ncurvature}, \\zeta(\\phi(t))\\}. The Two-Measure SM (TMSM) is realized in the\ncontext of cosmology as a set of cosmologically modified copies of the GWS\nmodel. Each of the copies exists as a local quantum field theory defined on the\nclassical cosmological background at the appropriate stage of its evolution.\nThis basic idea is studied in detail for the stage of slow-roll inflation and\nfor the stage of approaching vacuum. Due to the presence of \\zeta(\\phi(t)) in\nall equations of motion, all TMSM coupling constants turn out to be running\n(classical) TMT-effective parameters.

Grounded in the competence-based theory of trust, this\nwork formalizes I-trustworthy framework -- a novel framework for assessing the\ntrustworthiness of probabilistic classifiers for inference tasks by linking\nlocal calibration to trustworthiness. To assess I-trustworthiness, we use the\nlocal calibration error (LCE) and develop a method of hypothesis-testing. This\nmethod utilizes a kernel-based test statistic, Kernel Local Calibration Error\n(KLCE), to test local calibration of a probabilistic classifier. This study\nprovides theoretical guarantees by offering convergence bounds for an unbiased\nestimator of KLCE. Additionally, we present a diagnostic tool designed to\nidentify and measure biases in cases of miscalibration. The effectiveness of\nthe proposed test statistic is demonstrated through its application to both\nsimulated and real-world datasets. Finally, LCE of related recalibration\nmethods is studied, and we provide evidence of insufficiency of existing\nmethods to achieve I-trustworthiness.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a practical and accurate strategy to capture light-matter\ninteractions using the Floquet formalism in the velocity gauge in combination\nwith realistic first-principle models of solids. The velocity gauge, defined by\nthe linear coupling to the vector potential, is a standard method to capture\nthe light-matter interaction in solids. However, its use with first-principle\nmodels has been limited by the challenging fact that it requires a large number\nof bands for convergence and its incompatibility with non-local pseudopotential\nplane wave methods. To improve its convergence properties, we explicitly take\ninto account the truncation of Hilbert space in the construction of the Floquet\nHamiltonian in the velocity gauge. To avoid the incompatibility with the\npseudopotentials, we base our computations on generalized tight-binding\nHamiltonians derived from first-principles through maximally-localized Wannier\nfunctions. We exemplify the approach by computing the optical absorption\nspectra of laser-dressed trans-polyacetylene chain using realistic electronic\nstructure. We show that, by proceeding in this way, Floquet consideration\ninvolving the truncated Hilbert spaces reproduces the full basis calculations\nwith only a few bands and with significantly reduced computation time. The\nstrategy has been implemented in FloqticS, a general code for the Floquet\nengineering of the optical properties of materials.

    "abstract": "Context. Matter that falls onto a protoplanetary disk (PPD) from a\nprotostellar envelope is heated before it cools again. This induces sublimation\nand subsequent re-adsorption of ices that accumulated during the prestellar\nphase. Aims. We explore the fate of ices on multiple-sized dust grains in a\nparcel of infalling matter. Methods. A comprehensive kinetic chemical model\nusing five grain-size bins with different temperatures was applied for an\ninfalling parcel. The parcel was heated to 150 K and then cooled over a total\ntimescale of 20 kyr. Effects on ice loss and re-accumulation by the changed gas\ndensity, the maximum temperature, the irradiation intensity, the size-dependent\ngrain temperature trend, and the distribution of the ice mass among the\ngrain-size bins were investigated. Results. A massive selective redistribution\nof ices exclusively onto the surface of the coldest grain-size bin occurs in\nall models. The redistribution starts already during the heating stage, where\nices that are sublimated from warmer grains re-adsorb onto colder grains before\ncomplete sublimation. During the cooling stage, the sublimated molecules\nre-freeze again onto the coldest grains. In the case of full sublimation, this\nre-adsorption is delayed and occurs at lower temperatures because a bare grain\nsurface has lower molecular desorption energies in our model. Conclusions. Most\nprotostellar envelope grains enter the PPD ice poor (bare). Ices are carried by\na single coldest grain-size bin, here representing 12 % of the total grain\nsurface area. This bare ice-grain dualism can affect the rate of the grain\ncoagulation. The ice components are stratified on the grains according to their\nsublimation temperatures.",

This paper addresses two primary objectives:\n(1) providing users with token-level insights into model confidence and (2)\ndeveloping a web-based visualization tool to quantify and represent translation\nuncertainties. To achieve these goals, we utilized the T5 model with the WMT19\ndataset for translation tasks and evaluated translation quality using\nestablished metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE. We introduced three novel\nuncertainty quantification (UQ) metrics: (1) the geometric mean of token\nprobabilities, (2) the arithmetic mean of token probabilities, and (3) the\narithmetic mean of the kurtosis of token distributions. These metrics provide a\nsimple yet effective framework for evaluating translation performance. Our\nanalysis revealed a linear relationship between the traditional evaluation\nmetrics and our UQ metrics, demonstrating the validity of our approach.\nAdditionally, we developed an interactive web-based visualization that uses a\ncolor gradient to represent token confidence.

    "abstract": "In the \"Higgs field+gravity\" model, the selfconsistency of equations obtained\nfrom the original action has the form of an algebraic constraint defining the\nscalar $\\zeta$ as a function of the Higgs field $\\varphi$ and its first\nderivatives. The scalar $\\zeta$ is present in all equations of motion and has a\nsignificant effect on the dynamics. Transition to the Einstein frame is carried\nout in equations of motions. Due to the constraint, the original model\nparameters are converted into $\\varphi$-dependent classical effective\nparameters. In particular, the effective potential has the form\n$U_{eff}=\\frac{\\lambda}{4\\xi^2}M_P^4 F(\\varphi)\n\\tanh^4(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\xi}\\varphi}{M_P})$, where $F(\\varphi)$ is a smooth\nfunction. The constant $\\xi$ of non-minimal coupling to scalar curvature can be\nchosen as small as desired. If $\\xi =1/6$, then to ensure agreement with CMB\nobservational data, the Higgs field selfcoupling parameter $\\lambda$ in the\noriginal action must be of the order of $\\sim 10^{-11}$. During cosmological\nevolution after the end of inflation, the decrease of $\\varphi$ leads to a\nchange in the sign of the effective Higgs mass term. This effect provides an\nanswer to the mystery of the Higgs potential structure and leads to SSB. As\n$\\varphi$ approaches VEV, the scalar function $\\zeta(\\varphi)$ changes in such\na way that the classical effective selfcoupling parameter\n$\\lambda_{eff}(\\zeta(\\varphi))$ increases by 10 orders of magnitude compared to\n$\\lambda$, which is necessary for the implementation of the GWS theory.\nApplying the model to the very beginning of the classical evolution of the\nUniverse shows that under certain initial conditions, cosmological dynamics can\nbegin with a phantom regime preceding inflation.However, if evolution begins\nwith normal dynamics, then it proceeds only as inflation, and the problem of\ninitial conditions for the onset of inflation does not arise.",

Information Consistent Pruning\n(\\ourmethod{}) eliminates the need to retrain the network to its original\nperformance during intermediate steps while maintaining overall performance at\nthe end of the pruning process. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that\nour algorithm is more efficient than current IMPs across multiple dataset-DNN\ncombinations. We also provide theoretical insights into the core idea of our\nalgorithm alongside mathematical explanations of flow-based IMP.

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death among women\nworldwide. Early detection helps in reducing the number of deaths. Automated 3D\nBreast Ultrasound (ABUS) is a newer approach for breast screening, which has\nmany advantages over handheld mammography such as safety, speed, and higher\ndetection rate of breast cancer. Tumor detection, segmentation, and\nclassification are key components in the analysis of medical images, especially\nchallenging in the context of 3D ABUS due to the significant variability in\ntumor size and shape, unclear tumor boundaries, and a low signal-to-noise\nratio. The lack of publicly accessible, well-labeled ABUS datasets further\nhinders the advancement of systems for breast tumor analysis. Addressing this\ngap, we have organized the inaugural Tumor Detection, Segmentation, and\nClassification Challenge on Automated 3D Breast Ultrasound 2023\n(TDSC-ABUS2023). This initiative aims to spearhead research in this field and\ncreate a definitive benchmark for tasks associated with 3D ABUS image analysis.\nIn this paper, we summarize the top-performing algorithms from the challenge\nand provide critical analysis for ABUS image examination.

Not only are images\nabundant in daily life, but are also influenced by technology in shaping their\nforms, embodying various characteristics as they evolve in time. Language is a\nsequence of symbols that represents thoughts. While a written language is\ntypically associated with the close integration of text and sound, as a\ncombination of visual symbols and perception, the communicative power of image\nis no less significant. This is especially notable since 60% of the sensory\ninput received by our central nervous system comes from vision. Given the\nsymbolic system inherent in images, we are curious whether images can also\nexhibit the laws of statistical linguistics. To explore this, we begin with the\nrelationship between human thought and visual perception to decode how images\nare formed by the latter mechanism. Building upon previous studies that\nestablished the high correlation between pre-trained deep convolutional neural\nnetworks and the human visual system, we use the VGG-19 to define words via\neach kernel and calculate the number of pixels with grayscale values greater\nthan 90%. By (a) ranking words frequency, (b) randomizing the order of kernel\nappearances and performing the same word count accumulation, and (c) summing\nthe word counts layer by layer, we are surprised to find that Zipf's, Heaps',\nand Benford's laws of statistical linguistics also exist in the words that\ncomprises the text representing different images.",

    "abstract": "The origin of the variability in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei\n(AGN) is still unknown, but its behavior can be characterized by modeling the\ntime series of optical wavelength fluxes coming from the accretion disks with\ndamped random walk (DRW) being the most popular model for this purpose. The DRW\nis modeled by a characteristic fluctuation amplitude and damping timescale\n{\\tau}, with the latter being potentially related to the mass and accretion\nrate onto the massive black hole. The estimation of {\\tau} is challenging, with\ncommonly used methods such as the maximum likelihood (ML) and the least square\nerror (LSE) resulting in biased estimators. This problem arises most commonly\nfor three reasons: i) the light curve has been observed with additive noise;\nii) some cadence scheme; iii) when the autocorrelation parameter is close to\none. The latter is called the unit root problem. In order to improve these\nparameter estimation procedures for estimating {\\tau}, we developed a\nsimulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) methodology in the context of time series\nanalysis. We consider both the standard class of autoregressive processes\nobserved at regular intervals and a recently developed class of irregularly\nautoregressive processes (iAR). The performance of the SIMEX estimation method\nwas evaluated under conditions of near-unit-root behavior and additive noise\nthrough extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo experiments confirm that\nthe SIMEX approach outperforms MLE and LSE methods, offering a reduction in\nestimation bias ranging from 30% to 90%. Real-data applications further\nvalidate the methodology, yielding better model fits and lower mean squared\nerrors (MSE). The more accurate estimation of the damping timescale parameter\ncan help to better understand the currently tentative links between DRW and\nphysical parameters in AGN.",

Current error classification methods rely on\nstatic and predefined categories, which limit their ability to capture the full\nspectrum of error patterns in mathematical reasoning.

Leveraging this dataset, we develop ConceptCLIP\nthrough a novel dual-alignment approach that simultaneously learns global\nimage-text representations and fine-grained region-concept associations for\nprecise and interpretable medical image analysis. We curate the most extensive\nevaluation benchmark for multimodal biomedical foundation models, covering 52\nclinical tasks spanning 10 imaging modalities. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that ConceptCLIP outperforms existing state-of-the-art multimodal\nbiomedical foundation models. Importantly, ConceptCLIP demonstrates superior\ndiagnostic performance while providing human-understandable explanations\nvalidated by clinical experts. As the first precise and interpretable\nbiomedical foundation model, ConceptCLIP represents a critical milestone toward\nthe widespread clinical adoption of AI, thereby advancing trustworthy AI in\nmedicine.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel complexity-informed approach to cybersecurity\nmanagement, addressing the challenges found within complex cyber defences. We\nadapt and extend the complexity theory to cybersecurity and develop a\nquantitative framework that empowers decision-makers with strategies to\nde-complexify defences, identify improvement opportunities, and resolve\nbottlenecks. Our approach also provides a solid foundation for critical\ncybersecurity decisions, such as tooling investment or divestment, workforce\ncapacity planning, and optimisation of processes and capabilities. Through a\ncase study, we detail and validate a systematic method for assessing and\nmanaging the complexity within cybersecurity defences. The complexity-informed\napproach based on MITRE ATT&CK, is designed to complement threat-informed\ndefences. Threat-informed methods focus on understanding and countering\nadversary tactics, while the complexity-informed approach optimises the\nunderlying defence infrastructure, thereby optimising the overall efficiency\nand effectiveness of cyber defences.",

These IDSs analyze network traffic to identify\nunusual patterns and anomalies that may indicate potential security breaches.\nHowever, prior research has shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to\nbackdoor attacks, where attackers inject triggers into the model to manipulate\nits behavior and cause misclassifications of network traffic. In this paper, we\nexplore the susceptibility of deep learning-based IDS systems to backdoor\nattacks in the context of network traffic analysis. We introduce\n\\texttt{PCAP-Backdoor}, a novel technique that facilitates backdoor poisoning\nattacks on PCAP datasets. Our experiments on real-world Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS) and Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic datasets demonstrate that\nattackers can effectively backdoor a model by poisoning as little as 1\\% or\nless of the entire training dataset. Moreover, we show that an attacker can\nintroduce a trigger into benign traffic during model training yet cause the\nbackdoored model to misclassify malicious traffic when the trigger is present.\nFinally, we highlight the difficulty of detecting this trigger-based backdoor,\neven when using existing backdoor defense techniques.",

Citations, while serving\nmultiple purposes, primarily function as a way to explicitly document the use\nof prior work and thus have become central to the study of knowledge systems.\nAnalyzing citation dynamics has revealed statistical patterns that shed light\non knowledge production, recognition, and formalization, and has helped\nidentify key mechanisms driving these patterns. However, most quantitative\nfindings are confined to scientific citations, raising the question of\nuniversality of these findings. Moreover, existing models of individual\ncitation trajectories fail to explain phenomena such as delayed recognition,\ncalling for a unifying framework. Here, we analyze a newly available corpus of\nU.S. case law, in addition to scientific and patent citation networks, to show\nthat they share remarkably similar citation patterns, including a heavy-tailed\ndistribution of sleeping beauties. We propose a holistic model that captures\nthe three core mechanisms driving collective dynamics and replicates the\nelusive phenomenon of delayed recognition. We demonstrate that the model not\nonly replicates observed citation patterns, but also better predicts future\nsuccesses by considering the whole system. Our work offers insights into key\nmechanisms that govern large-scale patterns of collective human knowledge\nsystems and may provide generalizable perspectives on discovery and innovation\nacross domains.",

The proposed model achieved a\nstate-of-the-art accuracy of 99% on the handwritten digit MNIST and 89% on\nfashion MNIST, with only 14,862 parameters and a model size of 0.17 MB. While\nperformance on CIFAR-10 was comparatively lower (65% with less than 20,00\nparameters), the results highlight the scalability of this method.

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, the concept \"partial smoothness\" has been playing as a\npowerful tool in several fields involving nonsmooth analysis, such as nonsmooth\noptimization, inverse problems and operation research, etc. The essence of\npartial smoothness is that it builds an elegant connection between the\noptimization variable and the objective function value through the\nsubdifferential. Identifiability is the most appealing property of partial\nsmoothness, as locally it allows us to conduct much finer or even sharp\nanalysis, such as linear convergence or sensitivity analysis. However,\ncurrently the identifiability relies on non-degeneracy condition and exact dual\nconvergence, which limits the potential application of partial smoothness. In\nthis paper, we provide an alternative characterization of partial smoothness\nthrough only subdifferentials. This new perspective enables us to establish\nstronger identification results, explain identification under degeneracy and\nnon-vanishing error. Moreover, we can generalize this new characterization to\nset-valued operators, and provide a complement definition of partly smooth\noperator proposed in [14].",

    "abstract": "The Steklov spectrum of a smooth compact Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ with\nboundary is the set of eigenvalues counted with multiplicities of its\nDirichlet-to-Neumann map. (DN map) This article is devoted to the Steklov\nspectral inverse problem of recovering the metric $g$, up to natural gauge\ninvariance, from its Steklov spectrum. Positive results are established in\ndimension $n\\geq 3$ for conformal metrics under the assumption that the\ngeodesic flow on the boundary is Anosov with simple length spectrum. The paper\ncombines wave trace formula techniques with the injectivity of the geodesic\nX-ray transform for functions on closed Anosov manifolds. It is shown that\nknowledge of the Steklov spectrum determines the jet at the boundary of the\nunderlying Riemannian metric within its conformal class. In this particular\ncontext, this parallels the well-known results of the Calder\\'on problem, where\nwe are given the entire Dirichlet-to-Neumann map instead. As a simple\ncorollary, assuming real-analyticity of the conformal factor, Steklov\nisospectral metrics must coincide. Using similar arguments, we are also able to\nprove under the same assumption of hyperbolicity of the geodesic flow on the\nboundary, that generically any smooth potential $q$ can be recovered from the\nSteklov spectrum, in the sense that its jet at the boundary is determined by\nthe spectrum of the DN map for the Schr\\\"odinger operator with potential $q$.\nConsequently, in this case, two analytic Steklov isospectral potentials must be\nequal.",

However, DRL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks,\nespecially action-level backdoors, which pose significant threats through\nprecise manipulation and flexible activation, risking outcomes like vehicle\ncollisions or drone crashes. The key distinction of action-level backdoors lies\nin the utilization of the backdoor reward function to associate triggers with\ntarget actions. Nevertheless, existing studies typically rely on backdoor\nreward functions with fixed values or conditional flipping, which lack\nuniversality across diverse DRL tasks and backdoor designs, resulting in\nfluctuations or even failure in practice.\n  This paper proposes the first universal action-level backdoor attack\nframework, called UNIDOOR, which enables adaptive exploration of backdoor\nreward functions through performance monitoring, eliminating the reliance on\nexpert knowledge and grid search. We highlight that action tampering serves as\na crucial component of action-level backdoor attacks in continuous action\nscenarios, as it addresses attack failures caused by low-frequency target\nactions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UNIDOOR significantly enhances\nthe attack performance of action-level backdoors, showcasing its universality\nacross diverse attack scenarios, including single/multiple agents,\nsingle/multiple backdoors, discrete/continuous action spaces, and sparse/dense\nreward signals. Furthermore, visualization results encompassing state\ndistribution, neuron activation, and animations demonstrate the stealthiness of\nUNIDOOR.

It is known that computing the committor\nfunction suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Recently, using neural\nnetworks to estimate the committor function has gained attention due to its\npotential for high-dimensional problems. Training neural networks to\napproximate the committor function needs to sample transition data from\nstraightforward simulations of rare events, which is very inefficient. The\nscarcity of transition data makes it challenging to approximate the committor\nfunction. To address this problem, we propose an efficient framework to\ngenerate data points in the transition state region that helps train neural\nnetworks to approximate the committor function. We design a Deep Adaptive\nSampling method for TRansition paths (DASTR), where deep generative models are\nemployed to generate samples to capture the information of transitions\neffectively. In particular, we treat a non-negative function in the integrand\nof the loss functional as an unnormalized probability density function and\napproximate it with the deep generative model. The new samples from the deep\ngenerative model are located in the transition state region and fewer samples\nare located in the other region. This distribution provides effective samples\nfor approximating the committor function and significantly improves the\naccuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through both\nsimulations and realistic examples.",

Our high kappa_R hydro\ndata nominally corresponds to 10 mum-sized particles, and our low kappa_R-cases\ncorrespond to mm-sized particles. We investigate the resulting broad spectral\nfeatures at first while keeping the overall optical depth in the planetary\nenvelope constant. Dust growth to size distributions dominated by millimeter\nparticles generally results in broad, featureless spectra with black-body like\nslopes in the far-infrared, while size distributions dominated by small dust\ndevelop steeper slopes in the far-infrared and maintain some features stemming\nfrom individual minerals. We find that significant dust growth from microns to\nmillimeters can explain the broad features of the PDS 70c data, when upscaling\nthe dust masses from our simulations by x100. Furthermore our results indicate\nthat the spectral range of 30-500 mum is an ideal hunting ground for broadband\nfeatures arising from the CPD, but that longer wavelengths observed with ALMA\ncan also be used for massive circumplanetary discs",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer grading using the ISUP system (International Society of\nUrological Pathology) for treatment decisions is highly subjective and requires\nconsiderable expertise. Despite advances in computer-aided diagnosis systems,\nfew have handled efficient ISUP grading on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of\nprostate biopsies based only on slide-level labels. Some of the general\nchallenges include managing gigapixel WSIs, obtaining patch-level annotations,\nand dealing with stain variability across centers. One of the main\ntask-specific challenges faced by deep learning in ISUP grading, is the\nlearning of patch-level features of Gleason patterns (GPs) based only on their\nslide labels. In this scenario, an efficient framework for ISUP grading is\ndeveloped.\n  The proposed TSOR is based on a novel Task-specific Self-supervised learning\n(SSL) model, which is fine-tuned using Ordinal Regression. Since the diversity\nof training samples plays a crucial role in SSL, a patch-level dataset is\ncreated to be relatively balanced w.r.t. the Gleason grades (GGs). This\nbalanced dataset is used for pre-training, so that the model can effectively\nlearn stain-agnostic features of the GP for better generalization. In medical\nimage grading, it is desirable that misclassifications be as close as possible\nto the actual grade. From this perspective, the model is then fine-tuned for\nthe task of ISUP grading using an ordinal regression-based approach.\nExperimental results on the most extensive multicenter prostate biopsies\ndataset (PANDA challenge), as well as the SICAP dataset, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this novel framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

However, due to the unignorable disparities between visual emotion\ndata and traditional image classification data, existing SFDA methods perform\npoorly on this task. In this paper, we investigate the SFDA-VER task from a\nfuzzy perspective and identify two key issues: fuzzy emotion labels and fuzzy\npseudo-labels. These issues arise from the inherent uncertainty of emotion\nannotations and the potential mispredictions in pseudo-labels. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel fuzzy-aware loss (FAL) to enable the VER model to\nbetter learn and adapt to new domains under fuzzy labels. Specifically, FAL\nmodifies the standard cross entropy loss and focuses on adjusting the losses of\nnon-predicted categories, which prevents a large number of uncertain or\nincorrect predictions from overwhelming the VER model during adaptation. In\naddition, we provide a theoretical analysis of FAL and prove its robustness in\nhandling the noise in generated pseudo-labels.

This paper concerns the case where the\nrealizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.\n  The problem of characterizing sequences that can be realized by a bipartite\ngraph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of\nthe sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete\ncharacterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser\nover sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given,\ntermed BDR, is still open.\n  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For\nBDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a characterization\nwas known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose\nunderlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an\nedge is at most $r$. We present a characterization for determining if there is\na bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges\nis at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to\ndifferent realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the\nother substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given,\nwe show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite\nmultigraph realization is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that this hardness result\nextends to any graph family which is a sub-family of bipartite graphs and a\nsuper-family of paths.

It has been\nrecognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body\nstate crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the\nprevious work, we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs)\nthat automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial\nprofile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we precisely\nanalyze how detailed updating schemes in the structural optimization algorithm\naffect its computational accuracy for the random XY-exchange model under random\nmagnetic fields and the Richardson model. We then find that for the random XY\nmodel, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the\nstochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure\nprobabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other\nhand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and\nthe updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic\nupdating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the\nstochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing\nthe network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results\nindicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical\ncalculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to\nappropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure,\ndepending on the systems treated.",

RL typically uses\ntables or linear approximators to map state-action tuples that maximises the\nreward. Combining RL with deep neural networks (DRL) significantly increases\nits scalability and enables it to address more complex problems than before.\nHowever, DRL also inherits downsides from both RL and deep learning. Despite\nDRL improves generalisation across similar state-action pairs when compared to\nsimpler RL policy representations like tabular methods, it still requires the\nagent to adequately explore the state-action space.

However,\nexisting methods ignore the complexity and dynamism of real-world traffic\nsystems, resulting in significant gaps in efficiency and accuracy in real-time\nscenarios. Addressing this issue is a critical yet challenging task. This paper\nproposes a novel framework that redefines the implementation path of ER-TTE to\nachieve highly efficient and effective predictions. Firstly, we introduce a\nnovel pipeline consisting of a Decision Maker and a Predictor to rectify the\ninefficient prediction strategies of current methods. The Decision Maker\nperforms efficient real-time decisions to determine whether the high-complexity\nprediction model in the Predictor needs to be invoked, and the Predictor\nrecalculates the travel time or infers from historical prediction results based\non these decisions. Next, to tackle the dynamic and uncertain real-time\nscenarios, we model the online decision-making problem as a Markov decision\nprocess and design an intelligent agent based on reinforcement learning for\nautonomous decision-making.

    "abstract": "Configuration in software systems helps to ensure efficient operation and\nmeet diverse user needs. Yet, some, if not all, configuration options have\nprofound implications for the system's performance. Configuration performance\nanalysis, wherein the key is to understand (or infer) the configuration\noptions' relations and their impacts on performance, is crucial. Two major\nmodalities exist that serve as the source information in the analysis: either\nthe manual or source code. However, it remains unclear what roles they play in\nconfiguration performance analysis. Much work that relies on manuals claims\ntheir benefits of information richness and naturalness; while work that trusts\nthe source code more prefers the structural information provided therein and\ncriticizes the timeliness of manuals. To fill such a gap, in this paper, we\nconduct an extensive empirical study over 10 systems, covering 1,694 options,\n106,798 words in the manual, and 22,859,552 lines-of-code for investigating the\nusefulness of manual and code in two important tasks of configuration\nperformance analysis, namely performance-sensitive options identification and\nthe associated dependencies extraction. We reveal several new findings and\ninsights, such as it is beneficial to fuse the manual and code modalities for\nboth tasks; the current automated tools that rely on a single modality are far\nfrom being practically useful and generally remain incomparable to human\nanalysis.

Although two-dimensional convolution improves lateral\ncontinuity, due to the sparsity of well-log data, the model only learns weak\nspatial features and fails to explore the spatial correlations in seismic data\nfully. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel AVO inversion method\nbased on semi-supervised learning with strong spatial feature constraints\n(SSFC-SSL). First, two-dimensional predicted values are obtained through the\ninversion network, and the predicted values at well locations are sparsely\nrepresented using well-log labels. Subsequently, a label-annihilation operator\nis introduced, enabling the predicted values at non-well locations to learn the\nspatial features of well locations through the neural network. Ultimately, a\ntwo-way strong spatial feature mapping between non-well locations and well\nlocations is achieved. Additionally, to reduce the dependence on well-log\nlabels, we combine the semi-supervised learning strategy with a low-frequency\nmodel, further enhancing the robustness of the method. Experimental results on\nboth synthetic example and field data demonstrate that the proposed method\nsignificantly improves lateral continuity and inversion accuracy compared to\none- and two-dimensional deep learning techniques.",

Metagenomic sequencing has\nemerged as a powerful tool for uncovering novel NCLDVs in environmental\nsamples. However, identifying NCLDV sequences in metagenomic data remains\nchallenging due to their high genomic diversity, limited reference genomes, and\nshared regions with other microbes. Existing alignment-based and machine\nlearning methods struggle with achieving optimal trade-offs between sensitivity\nand precision. Results: In this work, we present GiantHunter, a reinforcement\nlearning-based tool for identifying NCLDVs from metagenomic data. By employing\na Monte Carlo tree search strategy, GiantHunter dynamically selects\nrepresentative non-NCLDV sequences as the negative training data, enabling the\nmodel to establish a robust decision boundary. Benchmarking on rigorously\ndesigned experiments shows that GiantHunter achieves high precision while\nmaintaining competitive sensitivity, improving the F1-score by 10% and reducing\ncomputational cost by 90% compared to the second-best method. To demonstrate\nits real-world utility, we applied GiantHunter to 60 metagenomic datasets\ncollected from six cities along the Yangtze River, located both upstream and\ndownstream of the Three Gorges Dam. The results reveal significant differences\nin NCLDV diversity correlated with proximity to the dam, likely influenced by\nreduced flow velocity caused by the dam.

This provides a generic and straightforward\nnon-perturbative calculus in an arbitrary Chern--Simons theory. Technically,\nthis approach is restricted to knots and links which possess bipartite\nrealizations, i.e. can be entirely glued from antiparallel lock (two-vertex)\ntangles rather than single-vertex $R$-matrices. However, we demonstrate that\nthe resulting positive decomposition (PD), i.e. the representation of the\nfundamental HOMFLY polynomials as positive integer polynomials of the three\nparameters $\\phi$, $\\bar\\phi$ and $D$, exists for arbitrary knots, not only\nbipartite ones. This poses new questions about the true significance of\nbipartite expansion, which appears to make sense far beyond its original scope,\nand its generalizations to higher representations. We have provided two\nexplanations for the existence of the PD for non-bipartite knots. An\ninteresting option is to resolve a particular bipartite vertex in a\nnot-fully-bipartite diagram and reduce the HOMFLY polynomial to a linear\ncombination of those for smaller diagrams. If the resulting diagrams correspond\nto bipartite links, this option provides a PD even to an initially\nnon-bipartite knot. Another possibility for a non-bipartite knot is to have a\nbipartite clone with the same HOMFLY polynomial providing this PD. We also\nsuggest a promising criterium for the existence of a bipartite realization\nbehind a given PD, which is based on the study of the precursor Jones\npolynomials.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great success in various graph-based\nlearning tasks. However, it often faces the issue of over-smoothing as the\nmodel depth increases, which causes all node representations to converge to a\nsingle value and become indistinguishable. This issue stems from the inherent\nlimitations of GNNs, which struggle to distinguish the importance of\ninformation from different neighborhoods. In this paper, we introduce MbaGCN, a\nnovel graph convolutional architecture that draws inspiration from the Mamba\nparadigm-originally designed for sequence modeling. MbaGCN presents a new\nbackbone for GNNs, consisting of three key components: the Message Aggregation\nLayer, the Selective State Space Transition Layer, and the Node State\nPrediction Layer. These components work in tandem to adaptively aggregate\nneighborhood information, providing greater flexibility and scalability for\ndeep GNN models. While MbaGCN may not consistently outperform all existing\nmethods on each dataset, it provides a foundational framework that demonstrates\nthe effective integration of the Mamba paradigm into graph representation\nlearning. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate\nthat MbaGCN paves the way for future advancements in graph neural network\nresearch.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel locally adaptive SSM-based approach, termed\nCD-Lamba, which effectively enhances the locality of change detection while\nmaintaining global perception. Specifically, our CD-Lamba includes a Locally\nAdaptive State-Space Scan (LASS) strategy for locality enhancement, a\nCross-Temporal State-Space Scan (CTSS) strategy for bi-temporal feature fusion,\nand a Window Shifting and Perception (WSP) mechanism to enhance interactions\nacross segmented windows.

CD-Lamba significantly enhances local-global spatio-temporal\ninteractions in bi-temporal images, offering improved performance in RSCD\ntasks.

Transformers operate as computational democracies,\ngranting equal voice to all tokens. This is a design tragically unsuited for\nAGI, where we cannot risk adversarial \"candidates\" hijacking the system.\nThrough formal analysis, we demonstrate that safety instructions fundamentally\nlack privileged status in transformer architectures, that they compete with\nadversarial inputs in the same computational arena, making robust alignment\nthrough prompting or fine-tuning inherently limited. This \"token democracy\"\nexplains why jailbreaks bypass even extensively safety-trained models and why\npositional shifts erode prompt effectiveness.

InfoBFR effectively synthesizes high-fidelity faces\nwithout attribute and identity distortions. Comprehensive experimental results\ndemonstrate the superiority of InfoBFR over state-of-the-art GAN-based and\ndiffusion-based BFR methods, with around 70ms consumption, 16M trainable\nparameters, and nearly 85% BFR-boosting.

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce ABPlanner, a few-shot adaptable budget planner designed\nto improve budget-constrained auto-bidding. ABPlanner is based on a\nhierarchical bidding framework that decomposes the bidding process into\nshorter, manageable stages. Within this framework, ABPlanner allocates the\nbudget across all stages, allowing a low-level auto-bidder to bids based on the\nbudget allocation plan. The adaptability of ABPlanner is achieved through a\nsequential decision-making approach, inspired by in-context reinforcement\nlearning. For each advertiser, ABPlanner adjusts the budget allocation plan\nepisode by episode, using data from previous episodes as prompt for current\ndecisions. This enables ABPlanner to quickly adapt to different advertisers\nwith few-shot data, providing a sample-efficient solution.

    "abstract": "In recent years, many attempts have been made to enhance Orthogonal Frequency\nMultiplexing with Index Modulation (OFDM-IM) in terms of spectral efficiency\nand error performance. Two challenges typically erupt when using OFDM-IM.\nFirst, the degradation in spectral efficiency due to the subcarrier's\ndeactivation, especially when using higher order modulation (M-ary) where every\ninactive subcarrier will cost $Log_2(M)$ bits loss. Second, using a fixed\nnumber of active subcarriers within a sub-block forces the error to be\nlocalized within the sub-block. Yet, it loses the advantage of exploiting all\npossible pattern combinations degrading the overall spectral efficiency. In\nthis paper, we introduce a solution to tackle those problems. The Enhanced\nGeneralized Index Modulation (EGIM) is a simple systematic way to generate and\ndetect the OFDM-IM frame. Unlike the classical OFDM-IM generation by splitting\nthe frame into sub-frames which increases the complexity of the OFDM-IM\ntransmitter and reflects on the receiver Maximum likelihood detector, EGIM\nMakes full use of all possible combinations of active subcarriers within the\nframe by using variable active subcarriers (k) depending on the incoming data.\nThe EGIM is still susceptible to error propagation if the OFF symbol is wrongly\nmapped to one of the ON symbols or vice versa. For that reason, we offer an\nOFDM-IM autoencoder to overcome this problem. The encoder generates the\n(ON/OFF) symbols systematically to achieve the advantage of sending all\npossible frame indices patterns depending on the input bit stream offering an\naverage of 3dB gain in terms of power efficiency. The proposed encoder\nperformance was compared to the standard encoder with the same effective coding\nrate using soft and hard decision Viterbi decoding utilizing the power gain\nachieved.",

Making sense of these distributed representations without knowledge of\nthe network's encoding strategy is a combinatorial task that is not guaranteed\nto be tractable. This work explores one feasible path to both detecting and\ntracing the joint influence of neurons in a distributed representation. We term\nthis approach Activation Spectroscopy (ActSpec), owing to its analysis of the\npseudo-Boolean Fourier spectrum defined over the activation patterns of a\nnetwork layer. The sub-network defined between a given layer and an output\nlogit is cast as a special class of pseudo-Boolean function. The contributions\nof each subset of neurons in the specified layer can be quantified through the\nfunction's Fourier coefficients. We propose a combinatorial optimization\nprocedure to search for Fourier coefficients that are simultaneously\nhigh-valued, and non-redundant. This procedure can be viewed as an extension of\nthe Goldreich-Levin algorithm which incorporates additional problem-specific\nconstraints. The resulting coefficients specify a collection of subsets, which\nare used to test the degree to which a representation is distributed.

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in Anomaly Detection (AD), the robustness of\nexisting detection methods against adversarial attacks remains a challenge,\ncompromising their reliability in critical real-world applications such as\nautonomous driving. This issue primarily arises from the AD setup, which\nassumes that training data is limited to a group of unlabeled normal samples,\nmaking the detectors vulnerable to adversarial anomaly samples during testing.\nAdditionally, implementing adversarial training as a safeguard encounters\ndifficulties, such as formulating an effective objective function without\naccess to labels. An ideal objective function for adversarial training in AD\nshould promote strong perturbations both within and between the normal and\nanomaly groups to maximize margin between normal and anomaly distribution. To\naddress these issues, we first propose crafting a pseudo-anomaly group derived\nfrom normal group samples. Then, we demonstrate that adversarial training with\ncontrastive loss could serve as an ideal objective function, as it creates both\ninter- and intra-group perturbations. However, we notice that spurious negative\npairs compromise the conventional contrastive loss to achieve robust AD.\nSpurious negative pairs are those that should be closely mapped but are\nerroneously separated. These pairs introduce noise and misguide the direction\nof inter-group adversarial perturbations. To overcome the effect of spurious\nnegative pairs, we define opposite pairs and adversarially pull them apart to\nstrengthen inter-group perturbations.

Recently, a\nnumber of prominent research effort argued that a number of models that improve\nthe state-of-the-art by a small margin tend to do so by winning what they call\na \"benchmark lottery\". An important benchmark in the field of machine learning\nand computer vision is the ImageNet where newly proposed models are often\nshowcased based on their performance on this dataset. Given the large number of\nself-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks that has been proposed in the past\ncouple of years each coming with marginal improvements on the ImageNet dataset,\nin this work, we evaluate whether those marginal improvements on ImageNet\ntranslate to improvements on similar datasets or not. To do so, we investigate\ntwelve popular SSL frameworks on five ImageNet variants and discover that\nmodels that seem to perform well on ImageNet may experience significant\nperformance declines on similar datasets. Specifically, state-of-the-art\nframeworks such as DINO and Swav, which are praised for their performance,\nexhibit substantial drops in performance while MoCo and Barlow Twins displays\ncomparatively good results. As a result, we argue that otherwise good and\ndesirable properties of models remain hidden when benchmarking is only\nperformed on the ImageNet validation set, making us call for more adequate\nbenchmarking. To avoid the \"benchmark lottery\" on ImageNet and to ensure a fair\nbenchmarking process, we investigate the usage of a unified metric that takes\ninto account the performance of models on other ImageNet variant datasets.",

In this paper, we propose\nan aspect performance-aware hypergraph neural network (APH) for the\nreview-based recommendation, which learns the performance of items from the\nconflicting sentiment polarity of user reviews.

To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human\ninfections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in\nmany regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals'\nactivity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population\ndensity. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or\nun-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention\npolicies (EIPs) can interfere with each other.

The condition requires that within any subset of\nobjects, if two objects can each be most-preferred, they can also be ranked as\nthe top two (in either order). We further show that almost all domains failing\nthe top-two condition for a triple or quadruple of objects admit non-TTC\nmechanisms satisfying the axioms.

By tracking the\ndistribution function along the characteristic curves defined by the\nNewton--Lorentz equations, our method directly computes f(z(t)) at selected\npoints in phase space without reliance on Monte Carlo sampling.\n  We employ a scatter-point integration scheme using smoothing kernels\nreminiscent of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), to calculate field\nquantities and moments, achieving higher accuracy with far fewer markers\ncompared to Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods.\n  Unlike PIC, our approach supports strategic marker placement and dynamic\nrefinement in regions of interest, thus reducing sampling noise and\ncomputational overhead. This capability is particularly advantageous in\nhigh-density plasmas, where PIC's particle requirements can be prohibitive. In\naddition, the method naturally accommodates collisional effects via an\naugmented phase-space flow description ensuring robust handling of both\ncollisionless and collisional plasmas.\n  Our simulations of Landau damping, two-stream instability, and collisional\nrelaxation demonstrate reduced noise, accurate phase-space resolution with\nsignificantly fewer markers, and robust energy conservation.

    "abstract": "Existing face identity (FaceID) customization methods perform well but are\nlimited to generating identical faces as the input, while in real-world\napplications, users often desire images of the same person but with variations,\nsuch as different expressions (e.g., smiling, angry) or angles (e.g., side\nprofile). This limitation arises from the lack of datasets with controlled\ninput-output facial variations, restricting models' ability to learn effective\nmodifications.\n  To address this issue, we propose CrossFaceID, the first large-scale,\nhigh-quality, and publicly available dataset specifically designed to improve\nthe facial modification capabilities of FaceID customization models.\nSpecifically, CrossFaceID consists of 40,000 text-image pairs from\napproximately 2,000 persons, with each person represented by around 20 images\nshowcasing diverse facial attributes such as poses, expressions, angles, and\nadornments. During the training stage, a specific face of a person is used as\ninput, and the FaceID customization model is forced to generate another image\nof the same person but with altered facial features. This allows the FaceID\ncustomization model to acquire the ability to personalize and modify known\nfacial features during the inference stage. Experiments show that models\nfine-tuned on the CrossFaceID dataset retain its performance in preserving\nFaceID fidelity while significantly improving its face customization\ncapabilities.\n  To facilitate further advancements in the FaceID customization field, our\ncode, constructed datasets, and trained models are fully available to the\npublic.",

    "abstract": "Engineering design risks could cause unaffordable losses, and thus risk\nassessment plays a critical role in engineering design. On the other hand, the\nhigh complexity of modern engineering designs makes it difficult to assess\nrisks effectively and accurately due to the complex two-way, dynamic\ncausal-effect risk relations in engineering designs. To address this problem,\nthis paper proposes a new risk assessment method called token fuzzy cognitive\nmap (Token-FCM). Its basic idea is to model the two-way causal-risk relations\nwith the FCM method, and then augment FCM with a token mechanism to model the\ndynamics in causal-effect risk relations. Furthermore, the fuzzy sets and the\ngroup decision-making method are introduced to initialize the Token-FCM method\nso that comprehensive and accurate risk assessments can be attained. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated by a real example of\nengine design for a horizontal directional drilling machine.",

Previous research has suggested that\nperturbative training methods do not scale well to large problems, since in\nthese methods the time to estimate the gradient scales linearly with the number\nof network parameters. However, in this work we show that the time to reach a\ntarget accuracy--that is, actually solve the problem of interest--does not\nfollow this undesirable linear scaling, and in fact often decreases with\nnetwork size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MGD can be used to calculate a\ndrop-in replacement for the gradient in stochastic gradient descent, and\ntherefore optimization accelerators such as momentum can be used alongside MGD,\nensuring compatibility with existing machine learning practices.

The barycentre graph is a \"summary\ngraph\" that captures the mean topology and connectivity structure of a training\ndataset of graphs. The construction of a barycentre requires the definition of\na metric to quantify distances between pairs of graphs. In this work, we use a\nmultiscale spectral distance that is defined using the eigenvalues of the\nnormalized graph Laplacian. The eigenvalues -- but not the eigenvectors -- of\nthe normalized Laplacian of the barycentre graph can be determined from the\noptimization problem that defines the barycentre. In this work, we propose a\nstructural constraint on the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian of\nthe barycentre graph that guarantees that the barycentre inherits the\ntopological structure of the graphs in the sample dataset. The eigenvectors can\nbe computed using an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases.\nWhen the graphs are random realizations of a balanced stochastic block model,\nthen our algorithm returns a barycentre that converges asymptotically (in the\nlimit of large graph size) almost-surely to the population mean of the graphs.\nWe perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of\nthe estimator; we conduct experiments on real-life graphs that suggest that our\napproach works beyond the controlled environment of stochastic block models.",

    "abstract": "As software systems become more complex and configurable, more performance\nproblems tend to arise from the configuration designs. This has caused some\nconfiguration options to unexpectedly degrade performance which deviates from\ntheir original expectations designed by the developers. Such discrepancies,\nnamely configuration performance bugs (CPBugs), are devastating and can be\ndeeply hidden in the source code. Yet, efficiently testing CPBugs is difficult,\nnot only due to the test oracle is hard to set, but also because the\nconfiguration measurement is expensive and there are simply too many possible\nconfigurations to test. As such, existing testing tools suffer from lengthy\nruntime or have been ineffective in detecting CPBugs when the budget is\nlimited, compounded by inaccurate test oracle. In this paper, we seek to\nachieve significantly faster CPBug testing by neurally prioritizing the testing\nat both the configuration option and value range levels with automated oracle\nestimation. Our proposed tool, dubbed NDP, is a general framework that works\nwith different heuristic generators. The idea is to leverage two neural\nlanguage models: one to estimate the CPBug types that serve as the oracle\nwhile, more vitally, the other to infer the probabilities of an option being\nCPBug-related, based on which the options and the value ranges to be searched\ncan be prioritized. Experiments on several widely-used systems of different\nversions reveal that NDP can, in general, better predict CPBug type in 87%\ncases and find more CPBugs with up to 88.88x testing efficiency speedup over\nthe state-of-the-art tools.",

It identifies the\nradio-frequency device by analyzing the signal feature differences caused by\nthe inevitable minor hardware impairments. However, existing RFFI methods based\non closed-set recognition struggle to detect unknown unauthorized devices in\nopen environments. Moreover, the feature interference among legitimate devices\ncan further compromise identification accuracy. In this paper, we propose a\njoint radio frequency fingerprint prediction and siamese comparison (JRFFP-SC)\nframework for open set recognition. Specifically, we first employ a radio\nfrequency fingerprint prediction network to predict the most probable category\nresult. Then a detailed comparison among the test sample's features with\nregistered samples is performed in a siamese network.

While the fusion of surround-view 4D radar and cameras offers\na promising low-cost solution, effectively extracting and integrating features\nfrom these heterogeneous sensors remains challenging. This paper introduces\nMetaOcc, a novel multi-modal framework for omnidirectional 3D occupancy\nprediction that leverages both multi-view 4D radar and images. To address the\nlimitations of directly applying LiDAR-oriented encoders to sparse radar data,\nwe propose a Radar Height Self-Attention module that enhances vertical spatial\nreasoning and feature extraction. Additionally, a Hierarchical Multi-scale\nMulti-modal Fusion strategy is developed to perform adaptive local-global\nfusion across modalities and time, mitigating spatio-temporal misalignments and\nenriching fused feature representations. To reduce reliance on expensive point\ncloud annotations, we further propose a pseudo-label generation pipeline based\non an open-set segmentor.

The median values of the hot coronal\ntemperature and optical depth for the sample are estimated to be\n$63_{-11}^{+23}$ keV and $0.85_{-0.27}^{+0.12}$, respectively. Finally, through\njoint XMM-Newton+NuSTAR relativistic reflection spectroscopy, we systematically\nconstrain the black hole spin parameter across the broad range of black hole\nmasses, $\\log(M_{\\rm BH}/M_{\\odot}) \\sim 5.5-9.0$, and increase the available\nspin measurements in the AGN population by $\\sim$20%.",

    "abstract": "Interactive Text-to-image retrieval (I-TIR) is an important enabler for a\nwide range of state-of-the-art services in domains such as e-commerce and\neducation. However, current methods rely on finetuned Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs), which are costly to train and update, and exhibit poor\ngeneralizability. This latter issue is of particular concern, as: 1) finetuning\nnarrows the pretrained distribution of MLLMs, thereby reducing\ngeneralizability; and 2) I-TIR introduces increasing query diversity and\ncomplexity. As a result, I-TIR solutions are highly likely to encounter queries\nand images not well represented in any training dataset. To address this, we\npropose leveraging Diffusion Models (DMs) for text-to-image mapping, to avoid\nfinetuning MLLMs while preserving robust performance on complex queries.\nSpecifically, we introduce Diffusion Augmented Retrieval (DAR), a framework\nthat generates multiple intermediate representations via LLM-based dialogue\nrefinements and DMs, producing a richer depiction of the user's information\nneeds. This augmented representation facilitates more accurate identification\nof semantically and visually related images. Extensive experiments on four\nbenchmarks show that for simple queries, DAR achieves results on par with\nfinetuned I-TIR models, yet without incurring their tuning overhead. Moreover,\nas queries become more complex through additional conversational turns, DAR\nsurpasses finetuned I-TIR models by up to 7.61% in Hits@10 after ten turns,\nillustrating its improved generalization for more intricate queries.",

Currently, the de facto approach for remote entanglement\ndistribution relies on optical fiber for on-the-ground entanglement\ndistribution. However, the fiber-based approach is incapable of global-scale\nentanglement distribution due to intrinsic limitations. This paper investigates\na new hybrid ground-satellite quantum network architecture (QuESat) for\nglobal-scale entanglement distribution, integrating an on-the-ground fiber\nnetwork with a global-scale passive optical network built with low-Earth-orbit\nsatellites. The satellite network provides dynamic construction of photon\nlightpaths based on near-vacuum beam guides constructed via adjustable arrays\nof lenses, forwarding photons from one ground station to another with very high\nefficiency over long distances compared to using fiber. To assess the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of QuESat for global communication, we formulate\nlightpath provisioning and entanglement distribution problems, considering the\norbital dynamics of satellites and the time-varying entanglement demands from\nground users. A two-stage algorithm is developed to dynamically configure the\nbeam guides and distribute entanglements, respectively. The algorithm combines\nrandomized and deterministic rounding for lightpath provisioning to enable\nglobal connectivity, with optimal entanglement swapping for distributing\nentanglements to meet users' demands. By developing a ground-satellite quantum\nnetwork simulator, QuESat achieves multi-fold improvements compared to repeater\nnetworks.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Baichuan-Omni-1.5, an omni-modal model that not only has\nomni-modal understanding capabilities but also provides end-to-end audio\ngeneration capabilities. To achieve fluent and high-quality interaction across\nmodalities without compromising the capabilities of any modality, we\nprioritized optimizing three key aspects. First, we establish a comprehensive\ndata cleaning and synthesis pipeline for multimodal data, obtaining about 500B\nhigh-quality data (text, audio, and vision). Second, an audio-tokenizer\n(Baichuan-Audio-Tokenizer) has been designed to capture both semantic and\nacoustic information from audio, enabling seamless integration and enhanced\ncompatibility with MLLM. Lastly, we designed a multi-stage training strategy\nthat progressively integrates multimodal alignment and multitask fine-tuning,\nensuring effective synergy across all modalities. Baichuan-Omni-1.5 leads\ncontemporary models (including GPT4o-mini and MiniCPM-o 2.6) in terms of\ncomprehensive omni-modal capabilities.

Our findings show\nthat manipulation-pretrained encoders consistently achieve higher Action\nScores, CNN-based encoders demonstrate stronger domain invariance than ViTs,\nand the best-performing models combine both properties, underscoring DIS and AS\nas complementary predictors of Sim2Real transferability.",

    "abstract": "Real-time measurement of optical frequency variations (OFVs) is crucial for\nvarious applications including laser frequency control, optical computing, and\noptical sensing. Traditional devices, though accurate, are often too large,\nslow and costly. Here we present a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) chip,\nutilizing the sine-cosine encoder principle, for high-speed and high-resolution\nreal-time OFV measurement. Fabricated on a thin film lithium niobate (TFLN)\nplatform, this chip-sized optical frequency detector (OFD) (5.5 mm * 2.7 mm)\nachieves a speed of up to 2500 THz/s and a resolution as fine as 2 MHz over a\nrange exceeding 160 nm. Our robust algorithm overcomes the device imperfections\nand ensures precise quantification of OFV parameters. As a practical\ndemonstration, the PIC OFD surpasses existing fiber Bragg grating (FBG)\ninterrogators in sensitivity and speed for strain and vibration measurements.\nThis work opens new avenues for on-chip OFV detection and offers significant\npotential for diverse applications involving OFV measurement.",
