    "abstract": "Multi-objective combinatorial optimization in wireless communication networks\nis a challenging task, particularly for large-scale and diverse topologies.\nRecent advances in quantum computing offer promising solutions for such\nproblems. Coherent Ising Machines (CIM), a quantum-inspired algorithm,\nleverages the quantum properties of coherent light, enabling faster convergence\nto the ground state. This paper applies CIM to multi-objective routing\noptimization in wireless multi-hop networks. We formulate the routing problem\nas a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and map it onto\nan Ising model, allowing CIM to solve it. CIM demonstrates strong scalability\nacross diverse network topologies without requiring topology-specific\nadjustments, overcoming the limitations of traditional quantum algorithms like\nQuantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum\nEigensolver (VQE). Our results show that CIM provides feasible and near-optimal\nsolutions for networks containing hundreds of nodes and thousands of edges.\nAdditionally, a complexity analysis highlights CIM's increasing efficiency as\nnetwork size grows",

This often results in artificial intelligence (AI) models that\nfail to capture SEA cultural nuances. To fill this gap, we present SEA-VL, an\nopen-source initiative dedicated to developing high-quality, culturally\nrelevant data for SEA languages.

Beyond\ncrowdsourcing, our initiative goes one step further in the exploration of the\nautomatic collection of culturally relevant images through crawling and image\ngeneration. First, we find that image crawling achieves approximately ~85%\ncultural relevance while being more cost- and time-efficient than\ncrowdsourcing. Second, despite the substantial progress in generative vision\nmodels, synthetic images remain unreliable in accurately reflecting SEA\ncultures. The generated images often fail to reflect the nuanced traditions and\ncultural contexts of the region. Collectively, we gather 1.28M SEA\nculturally-relevant images, more than 50 times larger than other existing\ndatasets.

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful approach for\nencoding complex geometries as continuous functions. These implicit models are\nwidely used in computer vision and 3D content creation, but their integration\ninto scientific computing workflows, such as finite element or finite volume\nsimulations, remains limited. One reason is that conventional simulation\npipelines require explicit geometric inputs (meshes), forcing INR-based shapes\nto be converted to meshes--a step that introduces approximation errors,\ncomputational overhead, and significant manual effort. Immersed boundary\nmethods partially alleviate this issue by allowing simulations on background\ngrids without body-fitted meshes. However, they still require an explicit\nboundary description and can suffer from numerical artifacts, such as sliver\ncut cells. The shifted boundary method (SBM) eliminates the need for explicit\ngeometry by using grid-aligned surrogate boundaries, making it inherently\ncompatible with implicit shape representations. Here, we present a framework\nthat directly couples neural implicit geometries with SBM to perform\nhigh-fidelity fluid flow simulations without any intermediate mesh generation.\nBy leveraging neural network inference, our approach computes the surrogate\nboundary and distance vectors required by SBM on-the-fly directly from the INR,\nthus completely bypassing traditional geometry processing. We demonstrate this\napproach on canonical 2D and 3D flow benchmarks (lid-driven cavity flows) and\ncomplex geometries (gyroids, the Stanford bunny, and AI-generated shapes),\nachieving simulation accuracy comparable to conventional mesh-based methods.\nThis work highlights a novel pathway for integrating AI-driven geometric\nrepresentations into computational physics, establishing INRs as a versatile\nand scalable tool for simulations and removing a long-standing bottleneck in\ngeometry handling.",

Unlike prior web\nagent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content\nrather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability\nof real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal\ninteractions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed\nvia text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding\nshort, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing\nfor transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study\nconfirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human\naccuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common\nfailure points.

We incorporate spatio-temporal autocorrelation structures to\nallow for sharing of information across small areas and time to reduce\nuncertainty in small area estimates. Excess mortality is defined as the\ndifference between observed trends after a crisis and expected trends based on\nobserved historical trends, which captures the total increase in observed\nmortality rates compared to what was expected prior to the crisis. We\nillustrate the application of our approach to assess excess opioid mortality\nrisk estimates for 159 counties in GA.

In this paper, we\npropose a new clustering method based on a combinatorial-topological approach\napplied to regions of space defined by signs of coordinates (hyperoctants). In\nhigh-dimensional spaces, this approach often reduces the size of the dataset\nwhile preserving sufficient topological features. According to a density\ncriterion, the method builds clusters of data points based on the partitioning\nof a graph, whose vertices represent hyperoctants, and whose edges connect\nneighboring hyperoctants under the Levenshtein distance. We call this method\nHyperOctant Search Clustering. We prove some mathematical properties of the\nmethod. In order to as assess its performance, we choose the application of\ntopic detection, which is an important task in text mining. Our results suggest\nthat our method is more stable under variations of the main hyperparameter, and\nremarkably, it is not only a clustering method, but also a tool to explore the\ndataset from a topological perspective, as it directly provides information\nabout the number of hyperoctants where there are data points.

Firstly,\nThe SAM without clear prompt constraints, often generates redundant masks, and\nmaking post-processing more complex. Secondly, the CLIP model, mainly designed\nfor global feature alignment in foundational models, often overlooks local\nobjects crucial to remote sensing. This oversight leads to inaccurate\nrecognition or misplaced focus in multi-target remote sensing imagery. Thirdly,\nboth models have not been pre-trained on multi-scale aerial views, increasing\nthe likelihood of detection failures. To tackle these challenges, we introduce\nthe innovative VTPSeg pipeline, utilizing the strengths of Grounding DINO,\nCLIP, and SAM for enhanced open-vocabulary image segmentation.

Subsequently, these refined bounding boxes\nserve as specific prompts for the FastSAM model, which executes precise\nsegmentation.

Algorithmic solutions suitable for real-time processing that\nhandle nonlinear measurement models and different forms of measurement\nuncertainty will accelerate the development of field-ready technology. This\npaper details a Bayesian estimation method for landmark-aided navigation using\na Side-scan Sonar (SSS) sensor.

Combining a\nnovel measurement model with the chosen statistical framework facilitates the\nefficient use of SSS data and, in the future, could be used in real time. The\nproposed filter has two primary steps: a prediction step using an unscented\ntransform and an update step utilizing particles. The update step performs\nprobabilistic association of sonar detections with known landmarks. We evaluate\nalgorithm performance and tractability using synthetic data and real data\ncollected field experiments.

Thus, we model the early\nstages of an epidemic. The number of individuals then becomes the infectious\ncases and the birth rate becomes the incidence rate. We obtain this way a\nprocess that depends on two competitive phenomena, infection and immunization.\nVariations in those rates allow us to monitor how effective the actions taken\nby government and health organizations are. From our model, three useful\nindicators for the epidemic evolution over time are obtained: the immunization\nrate, the infection/immunization ratio and the mean time between infections\n(MTBI). The proposed model allows either positive or negative concavities for\nthe mean value curve, provided the infection/immunization ratio is either\ngreater or less than one.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the significance of\nactive mechanical metamaterials capable of being remotely manipulated through\nchanges in external stimuli. While research in this area has achieved\nconsiderable success in controlling reconfiguration to induce shape morphing or\nalter static mechanical properties, the active control of wave propagation\nwithin these systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a\nmagneto-mechanical metamaterial that can be entirely governed by adjusting the\nmagnitude and direction of an external magnetic field. We demonstrate that such\na system offers remote control over its Poisson's ratio, allowing for\ntransitions from strongly auxetic to positive Poisson's ratio configurations.\nAdditionally, our system enables manipulation of the phononic band structure,\nfacilitating the formation of complete band gaps across different frequency\nranges depending on the stage of the magnetically guided reconfiguration\nprocess. The potential for achieving such active control over the properties\nand behavior of these materials holds great promise for various applications,\nincluding robotics and smart vibration dampers that can be remotely controlled.",

To address this gap, we used an Activity Theory framework to\nexamine how developers with visual impairments interact with AI coding\nassistants. For this purpose, we conducted a study where developers who are\nvisually impaired completed a series of programming tasks using a generative AI\ncoding assistant. We uncovered that, while participants found the AI assistant\nbeneficial and reported significant advantages, they also highlighted\naccessibility challenges. Specifically, the AI coding assistant often\nexacerbated existing accessibility barriers and introduced new challenges. For\nexample, it overwhelmed users with an excessive number of suggestions, leading\ndevelopers who are visually impaired to express a desire for ``AI timeouts.''\nAdditionally, the generative AI coding assistant made it more difficult for\ndevelopers to switch contexts between the AI-generated content and their own\ncode. Despite these challenges, participants were optimistic about the\npotential of AI coding assistants to transform the coding experience for\ndevelopers with visual impairments. Our findings emphasize the need to apply\nactivity-centered design principles to generative AI assistants, ensuring they\nbetter align with user behaviors and address specific accessibility needs.

    "abstract": "Although the integration of large language models (LLMs) into robotics has\nunlocked transformative capabilities, it has also introduced significant safety\nconcerns, ranging from average-case LLM errors (e.g., hallucinations) to\nadversarial jailbreaking attacks, which can produce harmful robot behavior in\nreal-world settings. Traditional robot safety approaches do not address the\nnovel vulnerabilities of LLMs, and current LLM safety guardrails overlook the\nphysical risks posed by robots operating in dynamic real-world environments. In\nthis paper, we propose RoboGuard, a two-stage guardrail architecture to ensure\nthe safety of LLM-enabled robots. RoboGuard first contextualizes pre-defined\nsafety rules by grounding them in the robot's environment using a root-of-trust\nLLM, which employs chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to generate rigorous safety\nspecifications, such as temporal logic constraints. RoboGuard then resolves\npotential conflicts between these contextual safety specifications and a\npossibly unsafe plan using temporal logic control synthesis, which ensures\nsafety compliance while minimally violating user preferences. Through extensive\nsimulation and real-world experiments that consider worst-case jailbreaking\nattacks, we demonstrate that RoboGuard reduces the execution of unsafe plans\nfrom 92% to below 2.5% without compromising performance on safe plans. We also\ndemonstrate that RoboGuard is resource-efficient, robust against adaptive\nattacks, and significantly enhanced by enabling its root-of-trust LLM to\nperform CoT reasoning. These results underscore the potential of RoboGuard to\nmitigate the safety risks and enhance the reliability of LLM-enabled robots.",

Traditional methods, such as heuristic and learning-based\napproaches, are effective but face challenges like lengthy recommendation time,\nresource-intensive training, and poor generalization across different workloads\nand database schemas. To address these issues, we propose LLMIdxAdvis, a\nresource-efficient index advisor that uses large language models (LLMs) without\nextensive fine-tuning. LLMIdxAdvis frames index recommendation as a\nsequence-to-sequence task, taking target workload, storage constraint, and\ncorresponding database environment as input, and directly outputting\nrecommended indexes. It constructs a high-quality demonstration pool offline,\nusing GPT-4-Turbo to synthesize diverse SQL queries and applying integrated\nheuristic methods to collect both default and refined labels. During\nrecommendation, these demonstrations are ranked to inject database expertise\nvia in-context learning. Additionally, LLMIdxAdvis extracts workload features\ninvolving specific column statistical information to strengthen LLM's\nunderstanding, and introduces a novel inference scaling strategy combining\nvertical scaling (via ''Index-Guided Major Voting'' and Best-of-N) and\nhorizontal scaling (through iterative ''self-optimization'' with database\nfeedback) to enhance reliability.

Co-occurrence-based metrics are effective in measuring bias\namplification in simple problems like image classification. However, these\nmetrics are ineffective for complex problems like image captioning as they\ncannot capture the semantics of a caption. To measure bias amplification in\ncaptions, prior work introduced a predictability-based metric called Leakage in\nCaptioning (LIC). While LIC captures the semantics and context of captions, it\nhas limitations. LIC cannot identify the direction in which bias is amplified,\npoorly estimates dataset bias due to a weak vocabulary substitution strategy,\nand is highly sensitive to attacker models (a hyperparameter in\npredictability-based metrics). To overcome these issues, we propose Directional\nPredictability Amplification in Captioning (DPAC). DPAC measures directional\nbias amplification in captions, provides a better estimate of dataset bias\nusing an improved substitution strategy, and is less sensitive to attacker\nmodels.

    "abstract": "Accurate cardiac mesh reconstruction from volumetric data is essential for\npersonalized cardiac modeling and clinical analysis. However, existing\ndeformation-based approaches are prone to topological inconsistencies,\nparticularly membrane penetration, which undermines the anatomical plausibility\nof the reconstructed mesh. To address this issue, we introduce\nTopology-Preserving Mesh Loss (TPM Loss), a novel loss function that explicitly\nenforces topological constraints during mesh deformation. By identifying\ntopology-violating points, TPM Loss ensures spatially consistent\nreconstructions. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI datasets show that TPM\nLoss reduces topology violations by up to 93.1% while maintaining high\nsegmentation accuracy (DSC: 89.1%-92.9%) and improving mesh fidelity (Chamfer\nDistance reduction up to 0.26 mm). These results demonstrate that TPM Loss\neffectively prevents membrane penetration and significantly improves cardiac\nmesh quality, enabling more accurate and anatomically consistent cardiac\nreconstructions.",

    "abstract": "We study the singular values (and Lyapunov exponents) for products of $N$\nindependent $n\\times n$ random matrices with i.i.d. entries. Such matrix\nproducts have been extensively analyzed using free probability, which applies\nwhen $n\\to \\infty$ at fixed $N$, and the multiplicative ergodic theorem, which\nholds when $N\\to \\infty$ while $n$ remains fixed. The regime when $N,n\\to\n\\infty$ simultaneously is considerably less well understood, and our work is\nthe first to prove universality for the global distribution of singular values\nin this setting. Our main result gives non-asymptotic upper bounds on the\nKolmogorov-Smirnoff distance between the empirical measure of (normalized)\nsquared singular values and the uniform measure on $[0, 1]$ that go to zero\nwhen $n, N\\to \\infty$ at any relative rate. We assume only that the\ndistribution of matrix entries has zero mean, unit variance, bounded fourth\nmoment, and a bounded density. Our proofs rely on two key ingredients. The\nfirst is a novel small-ball estimate on singular vectors of random matrices\nfrom which we deduce a non-asymptotic variant of the multiplicative ergodic\ntheorem that holds for growing matrix size $n$. The second is a martingale\nconcentration argument, which shows that while Lyapunov exponents at large $N$\nare not universal at fixed matrix size, their empirical distribution becomes\nuniversal as soon as the matrix size grows with $N$.",

    "abstract": "Geospatial question answering (QA) is a fundamental task in navigation and\npoint of interest (POI) searches. While existing geospatial QA datasets exist,\nthey are limited in both scale and diversity, often relying solely on textual\ndescriptions of geo-entities without considering their geometries. A major\nchallenge in scaling geospatial QA datasets for reasoning lies in the\ncomplexity of geospatial relationships, which require integrating spatial\nstructures, topological dependencies, and multi-hop reasoning capabilities that\nmost text-based QA datasets lack. To address these limitations, we introduce\nMapQA, a novel dataset that not only provides question-answer pairs but also\nincludes the geometries of geo-entities referenced in the questions. MapQA is\nconstructed using SQL query templates to extract question-answer pairs from\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) for two study regions: Southern California and Illinois. It\nconsists of 3,154 QA pairs spanning nine question types that require geospatial\nreasoning, such as neighborhood inference and geo-entity type identification.\nCompared to existing datasets, MapQA expands both the number and diversity of\ngeospatial question types. We explore two approaches to tackle this challenge:\n(1) a retrieval-based language model that ranks candidate geo-entities by\nembedding similarity, and (2) a large language model (LLM) that generates SQL\nqueries from natural language questions and geo-entity attributes, which are\nthen executed against an OSM database. Our findings indicate that\nretrieval-based methods effectively capture concepts like closeness and\ndirection but struggle with questions that require explicit computations (e.g.,\ndistance calculations). LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini) excel at generating SQL\nqueries for one-hop reasoning but face challenges with multi-hop reasoning,\nhighlighting a key bottleneck in advancing geospatial QA systems.",

    "abstract": "Unreadable code could be a breeding ground for errors. Thus, previous work\ndefined approaches based on machine learning to automatically assess code\nreadability that can warn developers when some code artifacts (e.g., classes)\nbecome unreadable. Given datasets of code snippets manually evaluated by\nseveral developers in terms of their perceived readability, such approaches (i)\nestablish a snippet-level ground truth, and (ii) train a binary\n(readable/unreadable) or a ternary (readable/neutral/unreadable) code\nreadability classifier. Given this procedure, all existing approaches neglect\nthe subjectiveness of code readability, i.e., the possible different\ndeveloper-specific nuances in the code readability perception. In this paper,\nwe aim to understand to what extent it is possible to assess code readability\nas subjectively perceived by developers through a personalized code readability\nassessment approach. This problem is significantly more challenging than the\nsnippet-level classification problem: We assume that, in a realistic scenario,\na given developer is keen to provide only a few code readability evaluations,\nthus less data is available. For this reason, we adopt an LLM with few-shot\nlearning to achieve our goal. Our results, however, show that such an approach\nachieves worse results than a state-of-the-art feature-based model that is\ntrained to work at the snippet-level. We tried to understand why this happens\nby looking more closely at the quality of the available code readability\ndatasets and assessed the consistency of the inter-developer evaluations.

    "abstract": "Critical learning periods (CLPs) in federated learning (FL) refer to early\nstages during which low-quality contributions (e.g., sparse training data\navailability) can permanently impair the learning performance of the global\nmodel owned by the model owner (i.e., the cloud server). However, strategies to\nmotivate clients with high-quality contributions to join the FL training\nprocess and share trained model updates during CLPs remain underexplored.\nAdditionally, existing incentive mechanisms in FL treat all training periods\nequally, which consequently fails to motivate clients to participate early.\nCompounding this challenge is the cloud's limited knowledge of client training\ncapabilities due to privacy regulations, leading to information asymmetry.\nTherefore, in this article, we propose a time-aware incentive mechanism, called\nRight Reward Right Time (R3T), to encourage client involvement, especially\nduring CLPs, to maximize the utility of the cloud in FL. Specifically, the\ncloud utility function captures the trade-off between the achieved model\nperformance and payments allocated for clients' contributions, while accounting\nfor clients' time and system capabilities, efforts, joining time, and rewards.\nThen, we analytically derive the optimal contract for the cloud and devise a\nCLP-aware mechanism to incentivize early participation and efforts while\nmaximizing cloud utility, even under information asymmetry. By providing the\nright reward at the right time, our approach can attract the highest-quality\ncontributions during CLPs. Simulation and proof-of-concept studies show that\nR3T increases cloud utility and is more economically effective than benchmarks.\nNotably, our proof-of-concept results show up to a 47.6% reduction in the total\nnumber of clients and up to a 300% improvement in convergence time while\nreaching competitive test accuracies compared with incentive mechanism\nbenchmarks.",

We employ optical floating\nzone (OFZ) growth at 10 bar oxygen partial pressure to explore the phase\nformation in a narrow region of Y-Sr-Ni-Al-O and investigate via DFT the\ngeneral stability of the pure Sr-Ni-O scenario. Using extensive diffraction and\nspectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the\nstructural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and\nreduced compounds were investigated. The optimal growth of YSNAO allows for\nlarge high quality crystals suitable for neutron studies. In the Al-free\ngrowth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-\\delta}$,\nfrom which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed,\nopening the door for future exploration of \\textit{A}-site substituted RP-type\nphases without Ni-site disorder.",

In this work,\nwe introduce Video Action Differencing (VidDiff), the novel task of identifying\nsubtle differences between videos of the same action, which has many\napplications, such as coaching and skill learning. To enable development on\nthis new task, we first create VidDiffBench, a benchmark dataset containing 549\nvideo pairs, with human annotations of 4,469 fine-grained action differences\nand 2,075 localization timestamps indicating where these differences occur. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that VidDiffBench poses a significant challenge for\nstate-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs), such as GPT-4o and Qwen2-VL.\nBy analyzing failure cases of LMMs on VidDiffBench, we highlight two key\nchallenges for this task: localizing relevant sub-actions over two videos and\nfine-grained frame comparison. To overcome these, we propose the VidDiff\nmethod, an agentic workflow that breaks the task into three stages: action\ndifference proposal, keyframe localization, and frame differencing, each stage\nutilizing specialized foundation models.

By\nexpressing the attoclock as the weak value of temporal delay, we extend its\nmeaning beyond the traditional setup. This allows us to calculate the attoclock\ntime for a static one-dimensional tunneling model consisting of a binding delta\npotential and a constant electric field. We apply the Steinberg weak-value\ninterpretation of the Larmor clock. Using this definition, we obtain the\nposition-resolved time density during tunnel ionization, yielding a non-zero\nLarmor tunneling time. Our model allows us to derive the analogue of the\nposition-resolved attoclock tunneling time. While non-zero at the tunnel exit,\nit vanishes at the detector, far away from the atom. Formally, this means that\nthe attoclock does not measure the \"local\" Larmor time, but instead a\n\"non-local\" time closely related to the phase time.",

We posit that this limitation stems from an\ninability to achieve minimum redundancy between masked and unmasked components\nwhile ensuring maximum relevance of both to potential downstream tasks.\nConditional Independence (CI) inherently satisfies the minimum redundancy and\nmaximum relevance criteria, but its application typically requires access to\ndownstream labels.

In this framework,\nthe pretext task involves reconstructing the masked second context solely from\nthe information provided by the first context. Our theoretical analysis further\nsupports the superiority of CIMAGE's novel CI-aware masking method by\ndemonstrating that the learned embedding exhibits approximate linear\nseparability, which enables accurate predictions for the downstream task.\nComprehensive evaluations across diverse graph benchmarks illustrate the\nadvantage of CIMAGE, with notably higher average rankings on node\nclassification and link prediction tasks.

Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) accurately predict\nenergies and forces at quantum chemistry levels, surpassing traditional\nmethods. Incorporating force fitting into MLIP training significantly improves\nthe representation of potential-energy surfaces (PES), enhancing model\ntransferability and reliability. This study introduces and evaluates\nincorporating Hessian matrix training into MLIPs, capturing second-order\ncurvature information of PES. Our analysis specifically examines MLIPs trained\nsolely on stable molecular geometries, assessing their extrapolation\ncapabilities to non-equilibrium configurations. We show that integrating\nHessian information substantially improves MLIP performance in predicting\nenergies, forces, and Hessians for non-equilibrium structures. Hessian-trained\nMLIPs notably enhance reaction pathway modeling, transition state\nidentification, and vibrational spectra accuracy, benefiting molecular dynamics\nsimulations and Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations. By comparing models\ntrained with various combinations of energy, force, and Hessian data on a\nsmall-molecule reactive dataset, we demonstrate Hessian inclusion leads to\nimproved accuracy in reaction modeling and vibrational analyses while\nsimultaneously reducing the total data needed for effective training. The\nprimary trade-off is increased computational expense, as Hessian training\ndemands more resources than conventional methods.

    "abstract": "To double the cellular population of ribosomes, a fraction of the active\nribosomes is allocated to synthesize ribosomal proteins. Subsequently, these\nribosomal proteins enter the ribosome self-assembly process, synthesizing new\nribosomes and forming the well-known ribosome autocatalytic subcycle.\nNeglecting ribosome lifetime and the duration of the self-assembly process, the\ndoubling rate of all cellular biomass can be equated with the fraction of\nribosomes allocated to synthesize an essential ribosomal protein times its\nsynthesis rate. However, ribosomes have a finite lifetime, and the assembly\nprocess has a finite duration. Furthermore, the number of ribosomes is known to\ndecrease with slow growth rates. The finite lifetime of ribosomes and the\ndecline in their numbers present a challenge in sustaining slow growth solely\nthrough controlling the allocation of ribosomes to synthesize more ribosomal\nproteins. When the number of ribosomes allocated per mRNA of an essential\nribosomal protein is approximately one, the resulting fluctuations in the\nproduction rate of new ribosomes increase, causing a potential risk that the\nactual production rate will fall below the ribosome death rate. Thus, in this\nregime, a significant risk of extinction of the ribosome population emerges. To\nmitigate this risk, we suggest that the ribosome translation speed is used as\nan alternative control parameter, which facilitates the maintenance of slow\ngrowth rates with a larger ribosome pool. We clarify the observed reduction in\ntranslation speed at harsh environments in E. coli and C.

However, FL systems have low resource\nutilization limiting their practical use in the real world. This inefficiency\nprimarily arises from two types of idle time: (i) task dependency between the\nserver and devices, and (ii) stragglers among heterogeneous devices. This paper\nintroduces FedOptima, a resource-optimized FL system designed to simultaneously\nminimize both types of idle time; existing systems do not eliminate or reduce\nboth at the same time. FedOptima offloads the training of certain layers of a\nneural network from a device to server using three innovations. First, devices\noperate independently of each other using asynchronous aggregation to eliminate\nstraggler effects, and independently of the server by utilizing auxiliary\nnetworks to minimize idle time caused by task dependency. Second, the server\nperforms centralized training using a task scheduler that ensures balanced\ncontributions from all devices, improving model accuracy. Third, an efficient\nmemory management mechanism on the server increases scalability of the number\nof participating devices. Four state-of-the-art offloading-based and\nasynchronous FL methods are chosen as baselines. Experimental results show that\ncompared to the best results of the baselines on convolutional neural networks\nand transformers on multiple lab-based testbeds, FedOptima (i) achieves higher\nor comparable accuracy, (ii) accelerates training by 1.9x to 21.8x, (iii)\nreduces server and device idle time by up to 93.9% and 81.8%, respectively, and\n(iv) increases throughput by 1.1x to 2.0x.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in language model (LM) agents and function calling have\nenabled autonomous, feedback-driven systems to solve problems across various\ndigital domains. To better understand the unique limitations of LM agents, we\nintroduce RefactorBench, a benchmark consisting of 100 large handcrafted\nmulti-file refactoring tasks in popular open-source repositories. Solving tasks\nwithin RefactorBench requires thorough exploration of dependencies across\nmultiple files and strong adherence to relevant instructions. Every task is\ndefined by 3 natural language instructions of varying specificity and is\nmutually exclusive, allowing for the creation of longer combined tasks on the\nsame repository. Baselines on RefactorBench reveal that current LM agents\nstruggle with simple compositional tasks, solving only 22% of tasks with base\ninstructions, in contrast to a human developer with short time constraints\nsolving 87%. Through trajectory analysis, we identify various unique failure\nmodes of LM agents, and further explore the failure mode of tracking past\nactions. By adapting a baseline agent to condition on representations of state,\nwe achieve a 43.9% improvement in solving RefactorBench tasks. We further\nextend our state-aware approach to encompass entire digital environments and\noutline potential directions for future research. RefactorBench aims to support\nthe study of LM agents by providing a set of real-world, multi-hop tasks within\nthe realm of code.",

    "abstract": "We examine the dynamics of a two-dimensional stripe, bubble, and crystal\nforming system interacting with a periodic one-dimensional substrate under an\napplied drive that is rotated with respect to the substrate periodicity\ndirection $x$. We find that the stripes remain strongly directionally locked to\nthe $x$ direction for an extended range of drives before undergoing motion\nparallel to the drive. In some cases, the stripes break apart at the unlocking\ntransition, but can dynamically reform into stripes aligned perpendicular to\nthe $x$ direction, producing hysteresis in the directional locking and\nunlocking transitions. In contrast, moving anisotropic crystal and bubble\nphases exhibit weaker directional locking and reduced or no hysteresis. The\nhysteresis occurs in regimes where the particle rearrangements occur and is\nmost pronounced near the stripe phase. We also show that for varied substrate\nstrength, substrate spacing, and particle density, a number of novel dynamical\npatterns can form that include a combination of stripe, bubble, and crystal\nmorphologies.",

The main tool\nemployed in our analysis is the stability of the $j$-invariant associated to a\nvaluation transcendental extension under passage to the henselization.\n  We also explore the stability of defectless simple extensions in the\nfollowing sense: let $(K(X)|K,w)$ be a valuation transcendental extension with\na pair of definition $(b,\\gamma)$. Assume that either $(K(b)|K,v)$ is a\ndefectless extension, or that $f(X)$ is a key polynomial for $w$ over $K$,\nwhere $f(X)$ is the minimal polynomial of $b$ over $K$.

    "abstract": "For several decades, RANSAC has been one of the most commonly used robust\nestimation algorithms for many problems in computer vision and related fields.\nThe main contribution of this paper lies in addressing a long-standing error\nbaked into virtually any system building upon the RANSAC algorithm. Since its\ninception in 1981 by Fischler and Bolles, many variants of RANSAC have been\nproposed on top of the same original idea relying on the fact that random\nsampling has a high likelihood of generating a good hypothesis from minimal\nsubsets of measurements. An approximation to the sampling probability was\noriginally derived by the paper in 1981 in support of adaptively stopping\nRANSAC and is, as such, used in the vast majority of today's RANSAC variants\nand implementations. The impact of this approximation has since not been\nquestioned or thoroughly studied by any of the later works. As we theoretically\nderive and practically demonstrate in this paper, the approximation leads to\nsevere undersampling and thus failure to find good models. The discrepancy is\nespecially pronounced in challenging scenarios with few inliers and high model\ncomplexity. An implementation of computing the exact probability is\nsurprisingly simple yet highly effective and has potentially drastic impact\nacross a large range of computer vision systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Neural Radiance and Gaze Fields (NeRGs) as a novel approach for\nrepresenting visual attention patterns in 3D scenes. Our system renders a 2D\nview of a 3D scene with a pre-trained Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and\nvisualizes the gaze field for arbitrary observer positions, which may be\ndecoupled from the render camera perspective. We achieve this by augmenting a\nstandard NeRF with an additional neural network that models the gaze\nprobability distribution. The output of a NeRG is a rendered image of the scene\nviewed from the camera perspective and a pixel-wise salience map representing\nconditional probability that an observer fixates on a given surface within the\n3D scene as visible in the rendered image. Much like how NeRFs perform novel\nview synthesis, NeRGs enable the reconstruction of gaze patterns from arbitrary\nperspectives within complex 3D scenes. To ensure consistent gaze\nreconstructions, we constrain gaze prediction on the 3D structure of the scene\nand model gaze occlusion due to intervening surfaces when the observer's\nviewpoint is decoupled from the rendering camera. For training, we leverage\nground truth head pose data from skeleton tracking data or predictions from 2D\nsalience models.

We then call to diversify our collective imaginations of\nAI, embedding ethical assumptions from the outset in the imaginations of AI. To\nfacilitate the community's pursuit of diverse imaginations, we demonstrate one\nprocess for constructing a new imagination of \"AI for just work,\" and showcase\nits application in the medical image synthesis task to make it more ethical. We\nhope this work will help the AI community to open critical dialogues with civil\nsociety on the visions and purposes of AI, and inspire more technical works and\nadvocacy in pursuit of diverse and ethical imaginations to restore the value of\nAI for the public good.",

The\nelectronic structure of BPN/Gn reveals (i) the formation of metallic channels\nmostly localized along the BPN stripes, where (ii) the features of the energy\nbands near the Fermi level are ruled by the width (n) of the graphene regions,\nGn. In the sequence, we find that the hydrogenation of BPN/Gn results in a\nsemiconductor system with a catenary-like rippled geometry. The electronic\nstates of the hydrogenated system are mainly confined in the curved Gn regions,\nand the dependence of the bandgap on the width of Gn is similar to that of\nhydrogenated armchair graphene nanoribbons. The effects of curvature on the\nelectronic structure, analyzed in terms of external mechanical strain, revealed\nthat the increase/decrease of the band gap is also dictated by the width of the\nGn region.

To this end, we propose an algorithmic framework that allows an operator\nto plan which passengers to serve in a DAS in real-time. To do so, we model the\noperational route planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and\nutilize a rolling horizon approach to approximate the MDP via a two-stage\nstochastic program in each timestep to decide on the next action. Furthermore,\nwe determine the deterministic equivalent of our approximation through\nsample-based approximation. This allows us to decompose the deterministic\nequivalent of our two-stage stochastic program into several full information\nplanning problems, which can be solved in parallel efficiently. Additionally,\nwe propose a consensus-based heuristic and a myopic approach. We perform\nextensive numerical studies based on real-world data provided to us by the\npublic transportation provider of Munich, Germany. We show that our exact\ndecomposition yields the best results in under five seconds, and our heuristic\napproach reduces the serial computation time by 17 - 57% compared to our exact\ndecomposition, with a solution quality decline of less than one percent. From a\nmanagerial perspective, we show that by switching a fixed-line bus route to a\nDAS, an operator can increase profit by up to 49% and the number of served\npassengers by up to 35% while only increasing the travel distance of the bus by\n14%. Furthermore, we show that an operator can reduce their cost per passenger\nby 43 - 51% by increasing route flexibility and that incentivizing passengers\nto walk slightly longer distances reduces the cost per passenger by 83-85%.",

However, current fairness and\nbias research in LLMs is limited in two aspects. First, compared to traditional\ngroup fairness in machine learning classification, it requires that the\nnon-sensitive attributes, in this case, the prompt questions, be the same\nacross different groups. In many practical scenarios, different groups,\nhowever, may prefer different prompt questions and this requirement becomes\nimpractical. Second, it evaluates group fairness only for the LLM's final\noutput without identifying the source of possible bias. Namely, the bias in\nLLM's output can result from both the pretraining and the finetuning. For\nfinetuning, the bias can result from both the RLHF procedure and the learned\nreward model. Arguably, evaluating the group fairness of each component in the\nLLM pipeline could help develop better methods to mitigate the possible bias.\nRecognizing those two limitations, this work benchmarks the group fairness of\nlearned reward models. By using expert-written text from arXiv, we are able to\nbenchmark the group fairness of reward models without requiring the same prompt\nquestions across different demographic groups. Surprisingly, our results\ndemonstrate that all the evaluated reward models (e.g., Nemotron-4-340B-Reward,\nArmoRM-Llama3-8B-v0.1, and GRM-llama3-8B-sftreg) exhibit statistically\nsignificant group unfairness. We also observed that top-performing reward\nmodels (w.r.t. canonical performance metrics) tend to demonstrate better group\nfairness.",

The framework\ncaptures key influences on pedestrian decisions, such as traffic light states,\nvehicle proximity, and waiting times, while employing the Intelligent Driver\nModel (IDM) to simulate realistic vehicle dynamics. Results from 500 trials\nshow that pedestrians avoid crossing during green lights, reducing collision\nrisks, while shorter waiting times during red lights encourage safer crossings.\nThe risk is heightened during yellow lights, especially with nearby vehicles.\nThis research emphasizes the importance of adaptive traffic control measures,\nsuch as pedestrian-triggered signals and enhanced traffic light timing, to\nmitigate risks and prioritize pedestrian safety.

Centralised\ncollection of large real-world datasets for rare conditions, such as CHD, from\nlarge populations requires significant co-ordination and resource. In addition,\ndata governance rules increasingly prevent data sharing between sites. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, a novel\nprivacy-preserving, zero-shot CHD detection framework that formulates CHD\ndetection as a normality modeling problem integrated with model merging. In our\nframework dubbed Sparse Tube Ultrasound Distillation (STUD), each hospital site\nfirst trains a sparse video tube-based self-supervised video anomaly detection\n(VAD) model on normal fetal heart US clips with self-distillation loss. This\nenables site-specific models to independently learn the distribution of healthy\ncases. To aggregate knowledge across the decentralized models while maintaining\nprivacy, we propose a Divergence Vector-Guided Model Merging approach,\nDivMerge, that combines site-specific models into a single VAD model without\ndata exchange. Our approach preserves domain-agnostic rich spatio-temporal\nrepresentations, ensuring generalization to unseen CHD cases. We evaluated our\napproach on real-world fetal US data collected from 5 hospital sites. Our\nmerged model outperformed site-specific models by 23.77% and 30.13% in accuracy\nand F1-score respectively on external test sets.",

This paper reviews\nthe key risk and protective factors associated with PD, with a particular focus\non the biological mechanisms underlying these factors. Risk factors include\ngenetic mutations, racial predispositions, and environmental exposures, all of\nwhich contribute to an increased likelihood of developing PD or accelerating\ndisease progression.

We\nwill conclude by mentioning padding schemes to NTRU that are provably IND-CCA2\nsecure in the random oracle model. The paper is designed to be accessible to\nanyone with minimal background in abstract algebra and number theory - no\nprevious knowledge of cryptography is assumed. Given the author's lack of\nfamiliarity with the subject, this paper aims to be an expository work rather\nthan to provide new insights to the subject matter.",

    "abstract": "Basketball analytics has significantly advanced our understanding of the\ngame, with shot selection emerging as a critical factor in both individual and\nteam performance. With the advent of player tracking technologies, a wealth of\ngranular data on shot attempts has become available, enabling a deeper analysis\nof shooting behavior. However, modeling shot selection presents unique\nchallenges due to the spatial and contextual complexities influencing shooting\ndecisions. This paper introduces a novel approach to the analysis of basketball\nshot data, focusing on the spatial distribution of shot attempts, also known as\nintensity surfaces. We model these intensity surfaces using a Functional\nBayesian Additive Regression Trees (FBART) framework, which allows for\nflexible, nonparametric regression, and uncertainty quantification while\naddressing the nonlinearity and nonstationarity inherent in shot selection\npatterns to provide a more accurate representation of the factors driving\nplayer performance; we further propose the Adaptive Functional Bayesian\nAdditive Regression Trees (AFBART) model, which builds on FBART by introducing\nadaptive basis functions for improved computational efficiency and model fit.\nAFBART is particularly well suited for the analysis of two-dimensional shot\nintensity surfaces and provides a robust tool for uncovering latent patterns in\nshooting behavior. Through simulation studies and real-world applications to\nNBA player data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in quantifying\nshooting tendencies, improving performance predictions, and informing strategic\ndecisions for coaches, players, and team managers. This work represents a\nsignificant step forward in the statistical modeling of basketball shot\nselection and its applications in optimizing game strategies.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, automatic text summarization has witnessed significant\nadvancement, particularly with the development of transformer-based models.\nHowever, the challenge of controlling the readability level of generated\nsummaries remains an under-explored area, especially for languages with complex\nlinguistic features like Turkish. This gap has the effect of impeding effective\ncommunication and also limits the accessibility of information. Controlling\nreadability of textual data is an important element for creating summaries for\ndifferent audiences with varying literacy and education levels, such as\nstudents ranging from primary school to graduate level, as well as individuals\nwith diverse educational backgrounds. Summaries that align with the needs of\nspecific reader groups can improve comprehension and engagement, ensuring that\nthe intended message is effectively communicated. Furthermore, readability\nadjustment is essential to expand the usability of summarization models in\neducational and professional domains. Current summarization models often don't\nhave the mechanisms to adjust the complexity of their outputs, resulting in\nsummaries that may be too simplistic or overly complex for certain types of\nreader groups. Developing adaptive models that can tailor content to specific\nreadability levels is therefore crucial. To address this problem, we create our\nown custom dataset and train a model with our custom architecture. Our method\nensures that readability levels are effectively controlled while maintaining\naccuracy and coherence. We rigorously compare our model to a supervised\nfine-tuned baseline, demonstrating its superiority in generating\nreadability-aware summaries.",

Finally, we see polarization that is consistent with mechanical\nalignment of dust grains along the spiral dust structures, which would suggest\nthat the dust is tracing the relative gas flow along the spiral arms.

Our aim is to investigate the feedback from the AGN in the\ncentral galaxy and the ICM of relaxed clusters. In this work, we analyze\narchival data from JVLA and Chandra observations. We performed a morphological\nanalysis of both the X-ray emission from the ICM of Abell 2009 and the radio\nemission from the AGN in the central galaxy. We also performed a spectral\nanalysis of the X-ray emission to derive the global properties and radial\nprofiles of the thermal gas. Our X-ray analysis confirms the expectations,\nbased on the selection criteria, that Abell 2009 is a cool-core system. We\nestimate a cooling radius of 88 kpc within which the ICM is radiating its\nenergy at rates of $L_{cool} \\sim 4.4 \\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Radio\nobservations of the central galaxy reveal a bright core surrounded by radio\nlobes on 30 kpc scales with a symmetric butterfly-shaped morphology. Although\nwe did not detect any X-ray cavity at the position of the central radio lobes,\nwe combined the volume of the lobes with the pressure of the surrounding ICM to\nderive the work done by the AGN on the gas to inflate them. By estimating a\ncavity age of about 20 Myr, this corresponds to a mechanical power of $\\approx\n10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ which is sufficient to counterbalance the radiative\ncooling losses in Abell 2009. We finally discuss possible correlations between\nthe global properties of the 18 objects from the BCS selection, finding in\nparticular that the number of outbursts required to counterbalance the\nradiative ICM losses is linearly anticorrelated with the energy and power of\nthe outburst.",

Although dwarf galaxies are assumed to be regulated by supernova\nfeedback, recent studies show evidence for the presence of AGN outflows and\nfeedback in dwarf galaxies. We investigate the presence of AGN outflows in a\nsample of 2292 dwarf galaxies with AGN signatures drawn from the MaNGA survey.\nThanks to the integral field unit data from MaNGA we are able to spatially\nresolve these outflows and study their kinematics and energetics. Using the\nGELATO Python code, we fit the AGN-stacked spectrum of each galaxy, which is\nthe stack of all the spaxels classified as AGN by emission line diagnostic\ndiagrams, and in particular the [OIII]$\\lambda$5007\\AA\\ emission line. If the\ngalaxies show a broad [OIII] emission line component in the stacked spectrum,\nwe run GELATO through all the spaxels that are classified as AGN in the\nemission line diagnostic diagrams. We find 11 new dwarf galaxies that present\noutflow signatures based on the presence of a broad [OIII] emission line\ncomponent. Their velocity W$_{80}$ (width containing 80$\\%$ of the flux of the\n[OIII]$\\lambda$5007\\AA\\ emission line) ranges from 205 to 566 km s$^{-1}$ and\nthe kinetic energy rate ranges from $\\sim10^{35}$ to $\\sim10^{39}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$. Stellar processes are unlikely to explain these outflow kinetic\nenergy rates in the case of seven dwarf galaxies. We find a correlation between\nthe W$_{80}$ velocity and the [OIII] luminosity and between the kinetic energy\nrate of the outflow and the bolometric luminosity spanning from massive to\ndwarf galaxies.

    "abstract": "Socialization is an essential development skill for preschool children. In\ncollaboration with the LEGO Group, we developed Robert Robot, a simplified\nrobot, which enables socialization between children and facilitates shared\nexperiences when meeting for the first time. An exploratory study to observe\nsocialization between preschool children was conducted with 30 respondents in\npairs. Additionally, observational data from 212 play sessions with four Robert\nRobots in the wild were collected. Subsequent analysis found that children have\nfun as Robert Robot breaks the ice between unfamiliar children. The children\nrelayed audio cues related to the imaginative world of Robert Robot's\npersonalities and mimicked each other as a method of initiating social play and\ncommunication with their unfamiliar peers. Furthermore, the study contributes\nfour implications for the design of robots for socialization between children.\nThis chapter provides an example case of serious storytelling using playful\ninteractions engaging children with the character of the robot and the\nmini-narratives around the build requests.",

    "abstract": "Recently, a high-energy neutrino event, designated KM3-230213A, was observed\nby the KM3NeT/ARCA detector in the Mediterranean Sea. This event is\ncharacterized by a reconstructed muon energy of approximately 120 PeV,\ncorresponding to a median neutrino energy of roughly 220 PeV. To understand the\norigin, it is essential to investigate consistency with multi-messenger\nobservations--particularly gamma-ray constraints--in various theoretical\nscenarios within and beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by this, we explore\nthe possibility that the detected event does not originate from conventional\nneutrinos but rather from right-handed neutrinos (sterile neutrinos) mixing\nwith active neutrinos, leading to the observed muon signal. Such cosmic-ray\ndark radiation may have originated either in the early Universe or through dark\nmatter decay in the present epoch. We show that in both cases, while satisfying\nexisting general constraints on light sterile neutrinos, the stringent\nmulti-messenger gamma-ray limits can be significantly alleviated. A distinct\nprediction of this scenario is that such events can arrive from directions\nthrough Earth that would typically attenuate conventional neutrinos. A related\nscenario involving cosmic-ray boosted WIMP dark matter is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Resource-efficiently computing representations of probability distributions\nand the distances between them while only having access to the samples is a\nfundamental and useful problem across mathematical sciences. In this paper, we\npropose a generic framework to learn the probability and cumulative\ndistribution functions (PDFs and CDFs) of a sub-Weibull, i.e. almost any light-\nor heavy-tailed, distribution while the samples from it arrive in a stream. The\nidea is to reduce these problems into estimating the frequency of an\n\\textit{appropriately chosen subset} of the support of a \\textit{properly\ndiscretised distribution}. We leverage this reduction to compute mergeable\nsummaries of distributions from the stream of samples while requiring only\nsublinear space relative to the number of observed samples. This allows us to\nestimate Wasserstein and Total Variation (TV) distances between any two\ndistributions while samples arrive in streams and from multiple sources. Our\nalgorithms significantly improves on the existing methods for distance\nestimation incurring super-linear time and linear space complexities, and\nfurther extend the mergeable summaries framework to continuous distributions\nwith possibly infinite support. Our results are tight with respect to the\nexisting lower bounds for bounded discrete distributions.

The wealth of ALMA data in this field enabled us to isolate a robust\nsample of 128 (sub)mm sources within the 175 sq. arcmin of the PRIMER COSMOS\nsurvey footprint, spanning two decades in (sub)mm flux density. The JWST\nimaging is deep/red enough to reveal secure galaxy counterparts for all of\nthese sources. Moreover, 52% of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts,\nenabling us to refine the photo-zs for the remaining galaxies. Armed with this\nrobust redshift information, we calculate the star-formation rates (SFR) and\nstellar masses of all 128 ALMA-detected galaxies, and place them in the context\nof other galaxies in the field. We find that the vast majority of star\nformation is dust-enshrouded in the ALMA-detected galaxies, with SFR ranging\nfrom ~1000 down to ~20 solar masses per year. We also find that virtually all\n(126/128) have high stellar masses, at all redshifts, with log(M/Msun) > 10.\nThe unusually high quality of our sample enables us to make a robust estimate\nof the contribution of the ALMA-detected galaxies to cosmic star-formation rate\ndensity from z = 2 out to z = 7. Finally, to correct for the fact that the deep\nALMA pointings cover < 20% of the PRIMER COSMOS area, we use our knowledge of\nall other massive galaxies in the field to produce a completeness-corrected\nestimate of dust-enshrouded star-formation rate density over cosmic time. This\nconfirms that UV-visible star formation dominates at z > 4, but also indicates\nthat dust-enshrouded star formation likely still made a significant\ncontribution at higher redshifts: extrapolation of our results suggest a ~20%\ncontribution at z = 8, and potentially still ~5% at z = 10.",

These stars, which often have\nnear-critical rotation, exhibit equatorial stretching and gravity darkening,\nwhich significantly complicates the determination of parameters such as the\ninclination angle. Be stars, characterized by their extreme rotational\nvelocities, serve as excellent candidates for exploring these phenomena.\nHowever, fundamental quantities such as polar and equatorial radii and\ninclination angles are typically derived from interferometry, which applies\nonly to a limited number of stars. This study aims to enhance the determination\nof inclination angles for Be stars using the ZPEKTR spectral synthesis code. By\nincorporating advanced models of gravity darkening and stellar deformation, we\nevaluated the effectiveness of this method with a sample of ten Be stars from\nthe BeSOS database, comparing results with established interferometric data.\nMethods. We used the ZPEKTR code to model the effects of stellar oblateness and\ngravity darkening on spectral lines, focusing on the HeI 4471 line.

Our analysis reveals a robust linear correlation between the\ninclination angles derived from ZPEKTR and using interferometric techniques,\nwhich demonstrates an excellent agreement.

Diffusion models, though promising, demand excessive computational\nresources, often requiring multiple GPU days, even for single-step variants.\nRather than naively fine-tuning entire models or adopting unstable generative\napproaches, we introduce AdaptSR, a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) framework that\nefficiently repurposes bicubic-trained SR models for real-world tasks. AdaptSR\nleverages architecture-specific insights and selective layer updates to\noptimize real SR adaptation. By updating only lightweight LoRA layers while\nkeeping the pretrained backbone intact, it captures domain-specific adjustments\nwithout adding inference cost, as the adapted layers merge seamlessly\npost-training. This efficient adaptation not only reduces memory and compute\nrequirements but also makes real-world SR feasible on lightweight hardware. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that AdaptSR outperforms GAN and diffusion-based SR\nmethods by up to 4 dB in PSNR and 2% in perceptual scores on real SR\nbenchmarks. More impressively, it matches or exceeds full model fine-tuning\nwhile training 92% fewer parameters, enabling rapid adaptation to real SR tasks\nwithin minutes.",

To quantify this finding, we fit the observed abundance\npatterns with a two-process model, calibrated on the full MW disk, which\nrepresents each star's abundances as the sum of a prompt CCSN process with\namplitude $A_{\\text{cc}}$ and a delayed SNIa process with amplitude\n$A_{\\text{Ia}}$. This model is generally successful at explaining the observed\ntrends of [X/Mg] with $A_{\\text{Ia}}/A_{\\text{cc}}$, which are steeper for\nelements with a large SNIa contribution (e.g., Cr, Ni, Mn) and flatter for\nelements with low SNIa contribution (e.g., O, Si, Ca).

We carried out a comprehensive\nmulti-stage visual inspection involving eight individuals and identified 95\ngrade A (average grade G >2.5) and 503 grade B (2.5 >G >1.5) lens candidates,\nincluding 92 discoveries reported for the first time. This inspection also\nincorporated a novel environmental characterization using histograms of\nphotometric redshifts. We publicly release the average grades, mass model\npredictions, and environment characterization of all visually inspected\ncandidates, while including references for previously discovered systems, which\nmakes this catalog one of the largest compilation of known lenses. The results\ndemonstrate that (1) the combination of multiple networks enhances the\nselection performance and (2) both automated masking tools as well as modeling\nnetworks, which can be easily applied to hundreds of thousands of network\ncandidates, help reduce the number of false positives that is the main\nlimitation in lens search to date.",

The Schmidt number is Sc=0.7. The\nentrainment process causes a deformation of the supersaturated cloud filament\nin combination with diffusion until the system reaches a well-mixed equilibrium\nstate, which implies for the present configuration that all droplets are\nevaporated. We compare the time dependence of the mean square and probability\ndensity function of the supersaturation field. For the initial period of the\nmixing process they agree very well; at later stages deviations caused by\nnon-zero mean of the conserved scalar are observed. For the cases including\ncloud water droplets, we investigate also the impact of droplet number density\nand condensation growth response. Turbulence causes deviations from the d^2-law\nsimilar to recent experiments in sprays. A simulation at a Schmidt number that\nis by a factor of 100 larger than in clouds improves the agreement between\nsimulation and diffuselet method significantly.

    "abstract": "Eigenstate thermalization has played a prominent role as a determiner of the\nvalidity of quantum statistical mechanics since von Neumann's early works on\nquantum ergodicity. However, its connection to the dynamical process of quantum\nthermalization relies sensitively on nondegeneracy properties of the energy\nspectrum, as well as detailed features of individual eigenstates that are\neffective only over correspondingly large timescales, rendering it generically\ninaccessible given practical timescales and finite experimental resources.\nHere, we introduce the notion of energy-band thermalization to address these\nlimitations, which coarse-grains over energy level spacings with a finite\nenergy resolution. We show that energy-band thermalization implies the\nthermalization of an observable in almost all physical states over accessible\ntimescales without relying on microscopic properties of the energy eigenvalues\nor eigenstates, and conversely, can be efficiently accessed in experiments via\nthe dynamics of a single initial state (for a given observable) with only\npolynomially many resources in the system size. This allows us to directly\ndetermine thermalization, including in the presence of conserved charges, from\nthis state: Most strikingly, if an observable thermalizes in this initial state\nover a finite range of times, then it must thermalize in almost all physical\ninitial states over all longer timescales. As applications, we derive a\nfinite-time Mazur-Suzuki inequality for quantum transport with approximately\nconserved charges, and establish the thermalization of local observables over\nfinite timescales in almost all accessible states in (generally inhomogeneous)\ndual-unitary quantum circuits. We also propose measurement protocols for\ngeneral many-qubit systems. This work initiates a rigorous treatment of quantum\nthermalization in terms of experimentally accessible quantities.",

    "abstract": "Entanglement entropy is a fundamental measure of quantum entanglement for\npure states, but for large-scale many-body systems, R\\'{e}nyi entanglement\nentropy is much more computationally accessible. For mixed states, logarithmic\nnegativity (LN) serves as a widely used entanglement measure, but its direct\ncomputation is often intractable, leaving R\\'{e}nyi negativity (RN) as the\npractical alternative. In fermionic systems, RN is further classified into\nuntwisted and twisted types, depending on the definition of the fermionic\npartial transpose. However, which of these serves as the true R\\'{e}nyi proxy\nfor LN has remained unclear -- until now. In this work, we address this\nquestion by developing a robust quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to compute\nboth untwisted and twisted RNs, focusing on the rank-4 twisted RN, where\nnon-trivial behavior emerges. We identify and overcome two major challenges:\nthe singularity of the Green's function matrix and the exponentially large\nvariance of RN estimators. Our method is demonstrated in the Hubbard model and\nthe spinless $t$-$V$ model, revealing critical distinctions between untwisted\nand twisted RNs, as well as between rank-2 and high-rank RNs. Remarkably, we\nfind that the twisted R\\'{e}nyi negativity ratio (RNR) adheres to the area law\nand decreases monotonically with temperature, in contrast to the untwisted RNR\nbut consistent with prior studies of bosonic systems. This study not only\nestablishes the twisted RNR as a more pertinent R\\'{e}nyi proxy for LN in\nfermionic systems but also provides comprehensive technical details for the\nstable and efficient computation of high-rank RNs.

We present a model for subhalo tidal evolution that\naccurately predicts the bound mass function and the density profiles of tidally\nstripped subhalos that appear near the Einstein radius of a typical deflector\nfor a variety of dark matter models.

Here, we\nfocus on the particular role played by the length scale of superconducting\norder-parameter inhomogeneity. We make use of a model involving square patches\ntiling the system, with each patch hosting a broadly distributed random value\nof the $d$-wave parameter. By using large-scale simulations, we are able to\nstudy how the size of the patches affects the correspondence between various\nmeasures of the superconducting gap and the underlying order parameter. If the\nlength scale of the inhomogeneity is smaller than the average superconducting\ncoherence length, the resulting $d$-wave superconductor is homogeneous.\nHowever, when the order parameter varies on the scale of the coherence length,\nwe find the emergence of a striking low-/high-energy dichotomy, in which the\nlow-energy regime is homogeneous while the high-energy states are strongly\ninhomogeneous. Kinks in the local spectra are found at the energy demarcating\nthe homogeneous-inhomogeneous transition. We also observe that the gap\nextracted from the low-energy slope of the LDOS is extremely uniform. We find\nin both of these regimes that the distribution of the spectral gap is narrower\nthan that of the order parameter; these start to match only when the size of\nthe patches becomes parametrically larger than the coherence length. We comment\non the applicability of these results to the cuprates, discuss the limitations\nof the inhomogeneous $d$-wave model, and point out where beyond-mean-field\ncorrelation effects are likely to be present in addition to inhomogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies propose Majorana polarization (MP) as a tool for identifying\ntopological Majorana bound states (MBS). We analyze MP in two systems: a\none-dimensional (1d) semiconducting nanowire and a quasi-1d system, both with\nRashba spin-orbit coupling, proximity-induced superconductivity, and disorder.\nWhile MP reflects topological features, it does not always distinguish true MBS\nfrom partially separated Andreev bound states (psABS) or quasi-Majorana modes.\nTrue MBS are expected to satisfy $\\mathcal{P}^*_\\mathrm{left} \\cdot\n\\mathcal{P}_\\mathrm{right} \\sim -1$, but two additional criteria - a\ntopological bandgap and edge-localized wavefunctions - are also necessary for\ntheir identification and use in topological quantum computation (TQC). We\nhighlight cases where the polarization product condition holds without meeting\nthese extra requirements. Our conclusions remain robust irrespective of the\nchosen definition of Majorana polarization, whether based on chiral or the\nparticle-hole framework. Robust MBS identification for TQC demands combining MP\nwith energy spectra and wavefunction localization, especially in disordered\nsystems.",

Sub-millimeter rest-frame\nemission, dominated by cold dust, is an unbiased tracer of dust mass. The NIKA2\ncamera conducted a deep blank field survey at 1.2 and 2.0 mm in the GOODS-N\nfield as part of the NIKA2 Cosmological Legacy Survey (N2CLS), detecting 65\nsources with SNR>=4.2. Thanks to a dedicated interferometric program with NOEMA\nand other high-angular resolution data, we identify the multi-wavelength\ncounterparts of these sources and resolve them into 71 individual galaxies. We\nbuild detailed SEDs and assign a redshift to 68 of them, over the range\n0.6<z<7.2. We fit these SEDs using MBB and Draine & Li (2007) models, and the\npanchromatic approaches MAGPHYS, CIGALE, and SED3FIT, thus deriving their dust\nmass, M(dust), infrared luminosity (LIR), and stellar mass, M(star). Eight\ngalaxies require an AGN-torus component and other six require an unextinguished\nyoung stellar population. A significant fraction of our galaxies are classified\nas starbursts based on their position on the M(star) versus SFR plane or their\ndepletion timescales. We compute the dust mass function in three redshift bins\n(1.6<z<=2.4, 2.4<z<=4.2 and 4.2<z<=7.2) and determine the Schechter function\nthat best describes it. We observe an increase of the dust cosmic density,\nrho(dust), by at least an order of magnitude from z~7 to z~1.5, consistent with\ntheoretical predictions. At lower redshift the evolution flattens; significant\ndifferences exist between results obtained with different selections and\nmethods. The superb GOODS-N dataset enabled a systematic investigation into the\ndust properties of distant galaxies. N2CLS holds promise for combining these\ndeep field findings with the wide COSMOS field into a self-consistent analysis\nof dust in galaxies both near and far.",

The key insight is\nto let go of the Feynman-bias that amplitudes should be presented as a sum over\ndiagrams, and instead re-arrange the sum as suggested by a dual triangulation\nof curve integrals. We attach an implementation of this algorithm as an\nancillary file, which we have used to evaluate amplitudes for the massive\n$\\mathrm{Tr}(\\phi)^3$ theory in $D=2$ space-time dimensions, up to 10-loops.\nInterestingly, we observe experimentally that the number of sample points\nrequired to achieve a fixed accuracy remains significantly smaller than what\nthe number of diagrams would suggest. Finally we propose an extension of our\nmethod which is inspired by ideas from artificial intelligence. We use the\nstochastic process to define a parametrization for a space of distributions,\nwhere we formulate importance sampling for an arbitrary curve integrand as a\nconvex optimization problem.",

In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact\nchiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the\nGinsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the\nlatter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$\nsymmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at\nlow energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability\nas the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic\nWeyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of\n$U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall\nresponse - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$\nsymmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the\ngaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an\nexact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \\rtimes T$\nparity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go\ntheorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are\nsharp.",

A critical question remains: If LRDs were common at\nhigh redshifts, how would they evolve into local elliptical galaxies with\nsignificantly lower central densities? To address this, we performed direct\n$N$-body simulations of LRD mergers, focusing on the coevolution of host\ngalaxies and central SMBHs. We track the complete evolution of SMBH binaries\ninto the three-body hardening and gravitational-wave (GW) emission phase. Our\nresults demonstrate that during galaxy mergers, the central SMBHs can eject a\nsubstantial amount of mass from the galactic core via the three-body slingshot\neffect, leading to a decrease in central stellar surface density by an order of\nmagnitude. Additionally, GW recoil can further contribute in making the galaxy\ncenters less dense and more in alignment with low-redshift quiescent galaxies.\nThis transformation occurs on a relatively short timescale of a few $\\sim$100\nMyr, implying that LRDs can evolve into lower-redshift elliptical galaxies by\n$z<4$. The timescales for our SMBH mergers vary between 100 Myr and 800 Myr,\ndepending on the initial orbital parameters of the merging galaxies and the\nmass ratio of the SMBHs. Our findings provide a plausible mechanism for the\ntransformation of LRDs into elliptical galaxies while highlighting the\nefficiency of SMBH mergers in such high-density environments, which plays a\ncrucial role in SMBH growth.",

The emission of two ingoing\npulses: normal scalar and phantom fields in the wormhole spacetime reveals two\ndistinct instability scenarios: a normal scalar field triggers gravitational\ncollapse into a black hole where the singularity $r=0$ hidden by the event\nhorizon ($r_{,u}=0$ and $r_{,v}=0$); while a phantom field drives inflationary\nexpansion of wormhole, decoupling two asymptotic regions with the cosmological\nhorizon ($r_{,u}=0$ and $r_{,v}=0$). The process of two scenarios can be\naccelerated by increasing the amplitude of pulses but can be delayed by\nincreasing the wormhole's mass. Additionally, the collisions of two identical\npulses from ingoing and outgoing null directions in the massless BE wormhole\nfail to cure the instabilities because the two scenarios can still occur, but\nthe formation of a black hole can be delayed for the collision of normal and\nphantom fields.

Some studies integrate vision-language models (VLMs) into autonomous\ndriving, but they typically rely on pre-trained models with simple supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on driving data, without further exploration of training\nstrategies or optimizations specifically tailored for planning. In this paper,\nwe propose AlphaDrive, a RL and reasoning framework for VLMs in autonomous\ndriving.

As a result, AlphaDrive significantly improves both planning\nperformance and training efficiency compared to using only SFT or without\nreasoning. Moreover, we are also excited to discover that, following RL\ntraining, AlphaDrive exhibits some emergent multimodal planning capabilities,\nwhich is critical for improving driving safety and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Relational video customization refers to the creation of personalized videos\nthat depict user-specified relations between two subjects, a crucial task for\ncomprehending real-world visual content. While existing methods can personalize\nsubject appearances and motions, they still struggle with complex relational\nvideo customization, where precise relational modeling and high generalization\nacross subject categories are essential. The primary challenge arises from the\nintricate spatial arrangements, layout variations, and nuanced temporal\ndynamics inherent in relations; consequently, current models tend to\noveremphasize irrelevant visual details rather than capturing meaningful\ninteractions. To address these challenges, we propose DreamRelation, a novel\napproach that personalizes relations through a small set of exemplar videos,\nleveraging two key components: Relational Decoupling Learning and Relational\nDynamics Enhancement. First, in Relational Decoupling Learning, we disentangle\nrelations from subject appearances using relation LoRA triplet and hybrid mask\ntraining strategy, ensuring better generalization across diverse relationships.\nFurthermore, we determine the optimal design of relation LoRA triplet by\nanalyzing the distinct roles of the query, key, and value features within\nMM-DiT's attention mechanism, making DreamRelation the first relational video\ngeneration framework with explainable components. Second, in Relational\nDynamics Enhancement, we introduce space-time relational contrastive loss,\nwhich prioritizes relational dynamics while minimizing the reliance on detailed\nsubject appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamRelation\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods in relational video customization. Code\nand models will be made publicly available.",

    "abstract": "The article analyses foundational principles relevant to the creation of\nartificial general intelligence (AGI). Intelligence is understood as the\nability to create novel skills that allow to achieve goals under previously\nunknown conditions. To this end, intelligence utilises reasoning methods such\nas deduction, induction and abduction as well as other methods such as\nabstraction and classification to develop a world model. The methods are\napplied to indirect and incomplete representations of the world, which are\nobtained through perception, for example, and which do not depict the world but\nonly correspond to it. Due to these limitations and the uncertain and\ncontingent nature of reasoning, the world model is constructivist. Its value is\nfunctionally determined by its viability, i.e., its potential to achieve the\ndesired goals. In consequence, meaning is assigned to representations by\nattributing them a function that makes it possible to achieve a goal. This\nrepresentational and functional conception of intelligence enables a\nnaturalistic interpretation that does not presuppose mental features, such as\nintentionality and consciousness, which are regarded as independent of\nintelligence. Based on a phenomenological analysis, it is shown that AGI can\ngain a more fundamental access to the world than humans, although it is limited\nby the No Free Lunch theorems, which require assumptions to be made.",

Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of\nhigh-quality image-instruction pairs, reducing VIT runtime while maintaining\nperformance comparable to full-scale training. However, a major challenge often\noverlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is\nhighly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations\nor paid services like the GPT API, which limits users with constrained\nresources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this,\nwe introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel), a more practical data\nselection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images\nand generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates\nthe relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive\ntask-wise sampling budgets.

These observations offer a crucial opportunity to\nprobe the interplay between galaxy formation and reionization, placing\nstringent constraints on theoretical models. In this work, we build upon our\npreviously developed semi-analytical framework that self-consistently models\nthe evolving UV luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies and the global\nreionization history while incorporating the effects of radiative feedback.\nComparing our predictions with JWST and HST data, we identify a fundamental\ntension: models that match the UVLF fail to reproduce the observed evolution of\ngalaxy clustering (bias) with redshift, and vice versa. To resolve this, we\nintroduce a mass-dependent duty cycle linked to star formation duration. This\nduty cycle approaches unity at $z > 11$, requiring either enhanced UV radiation\nproduction or increased star formation efficiency to match the JWST UVLFs,\nwhile declining towards lower redshifts ($5 < z \\leq 9$) to remain consistent\nwith the bias measurements. Reconciling theory with observations requires that\nthe characteristic star formation timescale increases from $\\approx 80$ Myr at\n$z \\approx 6$ to $\\approx 120$ Myr at $z \\approx 8$. Finally, our extended\nmodel, assuming a halo mass-independent escape fraction of $\\approx 12\\%$,\nproduces a reionization history consistent with current constraints.

In this study, we utilize intelligent agents (nodes)\ntrained through reinforcement learning techniques to establish connections with\ntheir neighbors, ultimately leading to the emergence of a large-scale\ncommunication cluster.

In this work, we introduce denoising score\ndistillation (DSD), a surprisingly effective and novel approach for training\nhigh-quality generative models from low-quality data. DSD first pretrains a\ndiffusion model exclusively on noisy, corrupted samples and then distills it\ninto a one-step generator capable of producing refined, clean outputs. While\nscore distillation is traditionally viewed as a method to accelerate diffusion\nmodels, we show that it can also significantly enhance sample quality,\nparticularly when starting from a degraded teacher model. Across varying noise\nlevels and datasets, DSD consistently improves generative performancewe\nsummarize our empirical evidence in Fig. 1. Furthermore, we provide theoretical\ninsights showing that, in a linear model setting, DSD identifies the eigenspace\nof the clean data distributions covariance matrix, implicitly regularizing the\ngenerator.

Rooted on the Greek concept of techne, the work\nconsiders a unifying design principle, integrating both structural and\nfunctional aspects within the architectural style. A multidisciplinary\nperspective was adopted, combining archaeological, documentary, and\nmetrological analysis of 41 Doric temples from the 6th to the 4th century BC,\nlocated in Greece and Magna Graecia. Starting from the evidence of a\nstatistical correlation among key geometric parameters, these quantitative data\nare re-interpreted through a geometrical physics vibroacoustic model. The\nresults demonstrate that structural elements act as acoustic attenuators,\nminimizing environmental forces (particularly wind) on the temple cell's walls.\nThe study also suggests that slight deviations from the classic East-West\norientation were adopted to reduce the acoustic coupling with prevailing local\nwinds. The Archaeological Park of Paestum (Salerno, Italy) provides significant\nevidence for this hypothesis, as its temples, despite their different\nconstruction periods, share a consistent orientation, distinct from the city's\nstreet grid. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of Greek\nknow-how, being a part of the intangible dimension of cultural heritage and\ntraditional ecological knowledge related to the architectural design in\nrelation to the environmental factors.",

Would these approaches continue to scale\nas the budget improves? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. We\nformalize the problem of optimizing test-time compute as a meta-reinforcement\nlearning (RL) problem, which provides a principled perspective on spending\ntest-time compute. This perspective enables us to view the long output stream\nfrom the LLM as consisting of several episodes run at test time and leads us to\nuse a notion of cumulative regret over output tokens as a way to measure the\nefficacy of test-time compute. Akin to how RL algorithms can best tradeoff\nexploration and exploitation over training, minimizing cumulative regret would\nalso provide the best balance between exploration and exploitation in the token\nstream. While we show that state-of-the-art models do not minimize regret, one\ncan do so by maximizing a dense reward bonus in conjunction with the outcome\n0/1 reward RL. This bonus is the ''progress'' made by each subsequent block in\nthe output stream, quantified by the change in the likelihood of eventual\nsuccess. Using these insights, we develop Meta Reinforcement Fine-Tuning, or\nMRT, a new class of fine-tuning methods for optimizing test-time compute. MRT\nleads to a 2-3x relative gain in performance and roughly a 1.5x gain in token\nefficiency for math reasoning compared to outcome-reward RL.",

We prove a rigorous version\nof this phenomenon in the setting of the exponential random graph model (ERGM)\nthrough the lens of concentration of measure. To do this, we first present a\nnew general result deriving concentration inequalities in a metastable well\nfrom the metastable mixing of a Markov chain with the appropriate stationary\ndistribution, extending a result of Chatterjee [Cha05] which is suited for more\ntraditional forms of global mixing. We then apply this result to the\nsupercritical (low-temperature) ERGM which was recently proven to exhibit\nmetastable mixing by Bresler, Nagaraj, and Nichani [BNN24], and obtain a novel\nconcentration inequality for Lipschitz observables of the supercritical ERGM\nconditioned on a large metastable well, answering a question posed by [BNN24].\nThis extends a result of Ganguly and Nam [GN24] from the subcritical\n(high-temperature) regime to a metastable well in the supercritical regime, and\nwe are also able to extend the applications of their concentration inequality\nto these metastable wells. Namely, we obtain an upper bound on the Wasserstein\ndistance between the ERGM conditioned on a metastable well and an appropriate\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi model, as well as derive a central limit theorem for the\ncount of edges in certain small subcollections of possible edges.

Moreover, Split-n-Chain uses\nblockchain to audit the computation done by different nodes.

The VTE unify the established\nhydrodynamic equation for electrons derived by Gurzhi [Sov. Phys.

This leads\nto the suppression of potential breakthrough research directions and limited\naccess to grants for stochastic (innovative) researchers. In this paper, we\npropose a dynamic agent-based model of research grant redistribution that takes\ninto account the adaptive mechanism of funding redistribution on the basis of\nthe quality of stochastic research.\n  The simulation was conducted on a sample of 21,534 Kazakhstani researchers\nwith 30 iterations, during which the growth of the formal features of\nstochastic scientists was analyzed under different grant distribution\nscenarios. A grant redistribution parameter {\\lambda} was introduced, which\ncontrols adaptive funding. The results showed that at {\\lambda}=0.15,\nstochastic scientists begin to catch up with formal scientists in terms of\nproductivity without destabilizing the scientific system.\n  On the basis of the data obtained, a principle called the Haderach principle\nwas proposed. It consists of a dynamic balance between formal (stable) and\nstochastic (informal) science. The developed approach can be used to optimize\ngrant systems, allowing the elimination of barriers to new scientific\ndirections and potential achievements without losing the stability of\ntraditional schools.\n  New concepts and terms of scientific vocabulary are introduced: the Haderach\nprinciple, excluded science, supplemented science, grant monopoly, and so on.\n  Article structured V new IRPAS (Induction, Related Works, Processing,\nAnalysis, Synthesis) notations.",

Our model is motivated in part by applications in\ndecentralized physical infrastructure networks (a.k.a. \"DePIN\"), an emerging\napplication domain in which physical services (e.g., sensor information,\nbandwidth, or energy) are provided at least in part by untrusted and\nself-interested parties. A key challenge in these signal network applications\nis verifying the level of service that was actually provided by network\nparticipants.\n  We first establish a condition called source identifiability, which we show\nis necessary for the existence of a mechanism for which truthful signal\nreporting is a strict equilibrium. For a converse, we build on techniques from\npeer prediction to show that in every signal network that satisfies the source\nidentifiability condition, there is in fact a strictly truthful mechanism,\nwhere truthful signal reporting gives strictly higher total expected payoff\nthan any less informative equilibrium. We furthermore show that this truthful\nequilibrium is in fact the unique equilibrium of the mechanism if there is\npositive probability that any one observer is unconditionally honest (e.g., if\nan observer were run by the network owner). Also, by extending our condition to\ncoalitions, we show that there are generally no collusion-resistant mechanisms\nin the settings that we consider.\n  We apply our framework and results to two DePIN applications: proving\nlocation, and proving bandwidth. In the location-proving setting observers\nlearn (potentially enlarged) Euclidean distances to the source. Here, our\ncondition has an appealing geometric interpretation, implying that the source's\nlocation can be truthfully elicited if and only if it is guaranteed to lie\ninside the convex hull of the observers.",

Several problems that fall under task and\nmotion planning do not have a predetermined number of sub-tasks to achieve a\ngoal. For example, while retrieving a target object from a cluttered workspace,\nin principle the number of object re-arrangements required to finally grasp it\ncannot be known ahead of time. To address this challenge, and in contrast to\ntraditional planners, also those based on AND/OR graphs, we grow the AND/OR\ngraph at run-time by progressively adding sub-graphs until grasping the target\nobject becomes feasible, which yields a network of AND/OR graphs. The approach\nis extended to enable multi-robot task and motion planning, and (i) it allows\nus to perform task allocation while coordinating the activity of a given number\nof robots, and (ii) can handle multi-robot tasks involving an a priori unknown\nnumber of sub-tasks. The approach is evaluated and validated both in simulation\nand with a real dual-arm robot manipulator, that is, Baxter from Rethink\nRobotics. In particular, for the single-robot task and motion planning, we\nvalidated our approach in three different TAMP domains. Furthermore, we also\nuse three different robots for simulation, namely, Baxter, Franka Emika Panda\nmanipulators, and a PR2 robot.

Subsequently, KSOD tunes\na knowledge module on knowledge dataset and verifies whether the LLM lacks the\nidentified knowledge based on it. If the knowledge is verified, KSOD\nsupplements the LLM with the identified knowledge using the knowledge module.\nTuning LLMs on specific knowledge instead of specific task decouples task and\nknowledge and our experiments on two domain-specific benchmarks and four\ngeneral benchmarks empirically demonstrate that KSOD enhances the performance\nof LLMs on tasks requiring the supplemented knowledge while preserving their\nperformance on other tasks. Our findings shed light on the potential of\nimproving the capabilities of LLMs with knowledge-based SFT.",

Today, the prospect of going beyond first light to build\nhigh-energy neutrino astronomy in earnest by discovering many more neutrino\nsources is hampered by the relatively low rate of neutrino detection and the\nlimited view of the sky afforded by IceCube, the single cubic-kilometer-scale\nneutrino telescope in operation. Yet, this will not stand for much longer.\nAlready today, and over the next 10-20 years, the combined observations of new\nneutrino telescopes, larger and distributed around the world, will have the\npotential for transformative progress. Together, they will increase the global\nrate of neutrino detection by up to 30 times and continuously monitor the\nentire sky. Within a new joint analysis network - the Planetary Neutrino\nMonitoring network (PLEnuM) - we make detailed forecasts for the discovery of\nsteady-state astrophysical sources of high-energy neutrinos. We show that a\ncombined analysis of global data will expedite source discovery - in some\ncases, by decades - and enable the detection of fainter sources anywhere in the\nsky, discovering up to tens of new neutrino sources.",

We propose a framework for bi-directional mental model\nreconciliation, leveraging large language models to facilitate alignment\nthrough semi-structured natural language dialogue.

We then move to consider an\nimportant practical example of using predictions in scheduling, namely Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) systems, which presents novel scheduling challenges and\nhighlights the potential for predictions to improve performance. In particular,\nwe consider LLMs performing inference. Inference requests (jobs) in LLM systems\nare inherently complex; they have variable inference times, dynamic memory\nfootprints that are constrained by key-value (KV) store memory limitations, and\nmultiple possible preemption approaches that affect performance differently. We\nprovide background on the important aspects of scheduling in LLM systems, and\nintroduce new models and open problems that arise from them.

    "abstract": "Enhancing reasoning in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) faces unique challenges\nfrom the complex interplay between visual perception and logical reasoning,\nparticularly in compact 3B-parameter architectures where architectural\nconstraints limit reasoning capacity and modality alignment.\n  While rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) excels in text-only domains, its\nmultimodal extension confronts two critical barriers: (1) data limitations due\nto ambiguous answers and scarce complex reasoning examples, and (2) degraded\nfoundational reasoning induced by multimodal pretraining. To address these\nchallenges, we propose \\textbf{LMM-R1}, a two-stage framework adapting\nrule-based RL for multimodal reasoning through \\textbf{Foundational Reasoning\nEnhancement (FRE)} followed by \\textbf{Multimodal Generalization Training\n(MGT)}. The FRE stage first strengthens reasoning abilities using text-only\ndata with rule-based RL, then the MGT stage generalizes these reasoning\ncapabilities to multimodal domains.\n  Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct-3B demonstrate that LMM-R1 achieves 4.83\\%\nand 4.5\\% average improvements over baselines in multimodal and text-only\nbenchmarks, respectively, with a 3.63\\% gain in complex Football Game tasks.\nThese results validate that text-based reasoning enhancement enables effective\nmultimodal generalization, offering a data-efficient paradigm that bypasses\ncostly high-quality multimodal training data.",

We address this with a multi-agent framework\ncalled Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, and Repair (SEIDR). Effectively\napplying SEIDR to instruction-tuned LLMs requires determining (a) optimal\nprompts for LLMs, (b) what ranking algorithm selects the best programs in\ndebugging rounds, and (c) balancing the repair of unsuccessful programs with\nthe generation of new ones. We empirically explore these trade-offs by\ncomparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies. We also\nevaluate lexicase and tournament selection to rank candidates in each\ngeneration. On Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 (PSB2), our framework outperforms\nboth conventional use of OpenAI Codex without a repair phase and traditional\ngenetic programming approaches. SEIDR outperforms the use of an LLM alone,\nsolving 18 problems in C++ and 20 in Python on PSB2 at least once across\nexperiments. To assess generalizability, we employ GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 on the\nPSB2 and HumanEval-X benchmarks. Although SEIDR with these models does not\nsurpass current state-of-the-art methods on the Python benchmarks, the results\non HumanEval-C++ are promising. SEIDR with Llama 3-8B achieves an average\npass@100 of 84.2%. Across all SEIDR runs, 163 of 164 problems are solved at\nleast once with GPT-3.5 in HumanEval-C++, and 162 of 164 with the smaller Llama\n3-8B.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations serve to interpret,\npredict and guide experiments and to test and develop theories. A major\nlimiting factor of MD simulations is system size and in particular the\ndifficulty in handling, storing and processing trajectories of very large\nsystems. This limitation has become significant as the need to simulate large\nsystem sizes of the order of billions of atoms and beyond has been steadily\ngrowing. Examples include interface phenomena, composite materials,\nbiomaterials, melting, nucleation, atomic transport, adhesion, radiation damage\nand fracture. More generally, accessing new length and energy scales often\nbrings qualitatively new science, but this has currently reached a bottleneck\nin MD simulations due to the traditional methods of storing and post-processing\ntrajectory files. To address this challenge, we propose a new paradigm of\nrunning MD simulations: instead of storing and post-processing trajectory\nfiles, we calculate key system properties on-the-fly. Here, we discuss the\nimplementation of this idea and on-the-fly calculation of key system properties\nin the general-purpose MD code, DL_POLY. We discuss code development, new\ncapabilities and the calculation of these properties, including correlation\nfunctions, viscosity, thermal conductivity and elastic constants.

In particular, the\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck equation is reformulated as a non-constant mobility\ngradient flow in the Energetic Variational Approach. The marker and cell finite\ndifference method is chosen as the spatial discretization, which facilitates\nthe analysis for the fluid part. In the temporal discretization, the mobility\nfunction is computed by a second order extrapolation formula for the sake of\nunique solvability analysis, while a modified Crank-Nicolson approximation is\napplied to the singular logarithmic nonlinear term. Nonlinear artificial\nregularization terms are added in the chemical potential part, so that the\npositivity-preserving property could be theoretically proved. Meanwhile, a\nsecond order accurate, semi-implicit approximation is applied to the convective\nterm in the PNP evolutionary equation, and the fluid momentum equation is\nsimilarly computed. In addition, an optimal rate convergence analysis is\nprovided, based on the higher order asymptotic expansion for the numerical\nsolution, the rough and refined error estimate techniques. The following\ncombined theoretical properties have been established for the second order\naccurate numerical method: (i) second order accuracy, (ii) unique solvability\nand positivity, (iii) total energy stability, and (iv) optimal rate\nconvergence.

Moreover, when deployed in a new\ndomain, these methods require obtaining the new paired data and subsequent\nretraining for model adaptation, which significantly increases computational\noverhead. Existing unsupervised methods have enabled to generate pseudo-labels\nbased on cross-view similarity to infer the pairing relationships. However,\ngeographical similarity and spatial continuity often cause visually analogous\nfeatures at different geographical locations. The feature confusion compromises\nthe reliability of pseudo-label generation, where incorrect pseudo-labels drive\nnegative optimization. Given these challenges inherent in both supervised and\nunsupervised DVGL methods, we propose a novel cross-domain invariant knowledge\ntransfer network (CDIKTNet) with limited supervision, whose architecture\nconsists of a cross-domain invariance sub-network (CDIS) and a cross-domain\ntransfer sub-network (CDTS). This architecture facilitates a closed-loop\nframework for invariance feature learning and knowledge transfer. The CDIS is\ndesigned to learn cross-view structural and spatial invariance from a small\namount of paired data that serves as prior knowledge. It endows the shared\nfeature space of unpaired data with similar implicit cross-view correlations at\ninitialization, which alleviates feature confusion. Based on this, the CDTS\nemploys dual-path contrastive learning to further optimize each subspace while\npreserving consistency in a shared feature space.

Respondents were randomly assigned to treatments that\nprovided them information about deliberative tasks facilitated by either AI or\nhumans. Our findings reveal a significant AI-penalty. Participants were less\nwilling to engage in AI-facilitated deliberation and rated its quality lower\nthan human-led formats. These effects were moderated by individual\npredispositions. Perceptions of AI's societal benefits and anthropomorphization\nof AI showed positive interaction effects on people's interest to participate\nin AI-enabled deliberative formats and positive quality assessments, while AI\nrisk assessments showed negative interactions with information about AI-enabled\ndeliberation. These results suggest AI-enabled deliberation faces substantial\npublic skepticism, potentially even introducing a new deliberative divide.\nUnlike traditional participation gaps based on education or demographics, this\ndivide is shaped by attitudes toward AI. As democratic engagement increasingly\nmoves online, ensuring AI's role in deliberation does not discourage\nparticipation or deepen inequalities will be a key challenge for future\nresearch and policy.",

    "abstract": "There has been recent interest in whether large language models (LLMs) can\nintrospect about their own internal states. Such abilities would make LLMs more\ninterpretable, and also validate the use of standard introspective methods in\nlinguistics to evaluate grammatical knowledge in models (e.g., asking \"Is this\nsentence grammatical?\"). We systematically investigate emergent introspection\nacross 21 open-source LLMs, in two domains where introspection is of\ntheoretical interest: grammatical knowledge and word prediction. Crucially, in\nboth domains, a model's internal linguistic knowledge can be theoretically\ngrounded in direct measurements of string probability. We then evaluate whether\nmodels' responses to metalinguistic prompts faithfully reflect their internal\nknowledge. We propose a new measure of introspection: the degree to which a\nmodel's prompted responses predict its own string probabilities, beyond what\nwould be predicted by another model with nearly identical internal knowledge.\nWhile both metalinguistic prompting and probability comparisons lead to high\ntask accuracy, we do not find evidence that LLMs have privileged \"self-access\".\nOur findings complicate recent results suggesting that models can introspect,\nand add new evidence to the argument that prompted responses should not be\nconflated with models' linguistic generalizations.",

We\nhave also observed how the dynamic of melting and growth of the CO$_2$ hydrate\nbecomes slower when the NaCl concentration is increased. As a consequence,\nlarger simulation times (in the order of dozens of microseconds) are necessary\nwhen the NaCl concentration increases. Finally, we have also analyzed\nfinite-size effects on the three-phase coexistence temperature of these systems\nby performing simulations, at 400 bar, with two different system sizes at two\ndifferent NaCl concentrations (0.0 and $3.0\\,\\text{m}$). Non-negligible\ndeviations have been found between the results obtained from both system sizes.",

    "abstract": "The role of memorization in machine learning (ML) has garnered significant\nattention, particularly as modern models are empirically observed to memorize\nfragments of training data. Previous theoretical analyses, such as Feldman's\nseminal work, attribute memorization to the prevalence of long-tail\ndistributions in training data, proving it unavoidable for samples that lie in\nthe tail of the distribution. However, the intersection of memorization and\ntrustworthy ML research reveals critical gaps. While prior research in\nmemorization in trustworthy ML has solely focused on class imbalance, recent\nwork starts to differentiate class-level rarity from atypical samples, which\nare valid and rare intra-class instances. However, a critical research gap\nremains: current frameworks conflate atypical samples with noisy and erroneous\ndata, neglecting their divergent impacts on fairness, robustness, and privacy.\nIn this work, we conduct a thorough survey of existing research and their\nfindings on trustworthy ML and the role of memorization. More and beyond, we\nidentify and highlight uncharted gaps and propose new revenues in this research\ndirection. Since existing theoretical and empirical analyses lack the nuances\nto disentangle memorization's duality as both a necessity and a liability, we\nformalize three-level long-tail granularity - class imbalance, atypicality, and\nnoise - to reveal how current frameworks misapply these levels, perpetuating\nflawed solutions. By systematizing this granularity, we draw a roadmap for\nfuture research. Trustworthy ML must reconcile the nuanced trade-offs between\nmemorizing atypicality for fairness assurance and suppressing noise for\nrobustness and privacy guarantee. Redefining memorization via this granularity\nreshapes the theoretical foundation for trustworthy ML, and further affords an\nempirical prerequisite for models that align performance with societal trust.",

In this study, we investigate the basic scenario\ninvolving normal approach-retraction contact cycles between a wavy rigid\nindenter and a flat, deformable substrate. Both frictionless and frictional\ninterfacial conditions are examined, considering finite strains, displacements,\nand nonlinear rheology. We developed a finite element model for this purpose\nand compared our numerical results with Westergaard's linear theory. Our\nfindings show that, even in frictionless conditions, the contact response is\nsignificantly influenced by geometric and material nonlinearity, particularly\nfor wavy indenters with high aspect ratios, where normal-tangential stresses\nand displacements coupling emerges. More importantly, interfacial friction in\nnonlinear elasticity leads to contact hysteresis (i.e., frictional energy\ndissipation) during normal loading-unloading cycles. This behavior cannot be\nexplained in a linear framework; therefore, most of the experiments reporting\nhysteresis are typically explained invoking other interfacial phenomena (e.g.,\nadhesion, plasticity, or viscoelasticity). Here we present an additional\nsuitable explanation relying on finite strains/displacements with detailed\npeculiarities, such as vanishing pull-off force. Moreover, we also report an\nincrease of hysteretic losses as for confined systems, stemming from the\nenhanced normal-tangential nonlinear coupling.",

    "abstract": "Recently, multimodal large models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional\ncapabilities in visual understanding and reasoning across various\nvision-language tasks. However, MLLMs usually perform poorly in zero-shot\nmedical disease recognition, as they do not fully exploit the captured features\nand available medical knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose\nLLaVA-RadZ, a simple yet effective framework for zero-shot medical disease\nrecognition. Specifically, we design an end-to-end training strategy, termed\nDecoding-Side Feature Alignment Training (DFAT) to take advantage of the\ncharacteristics of the MLLM decoder architecture and incorporate\nmodality-specific tokens tailored for different modalities, which effectively\nutilizes image and text representations and facilitates robust cross-modal\nalignment. Additionally, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Anchoring Module\n(DKAM) to exploit the intrinsic medical knowledge of large models, which\nmitigates the category semantic gap in image-text alignment. DKAM improves\ncategory-level alignment, allowing for accurate disease recognition. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our LLaVA-RadZ\nsignificantly outperforms traditional MLLMs in zero-shot disease recognition\nand exhibits the state-of-the-art performance compared to the well-established\nand highly-optimized CLIP-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Multimode squeezed light is a key resource for high-dimensional quantum\ntechnologies, enabling applications in metrology, secure communication, and\nmeasurement-based quantum computing. So far, its full practical potential\nremains unrealized due to the limitations of homodyne detection, which is\ninherently restricted to single-mode operation and, at best, retrieves\nmultimode data through post-processing. Here, we employ multimode optical\nparametric amplification (MOPA) to, for the first time to the best of our\nknowledge, achieve real-time monitoring of co-propagating modes of multimode\nsqueezed light. By leveraging simultaneous multimode phase-sensitive\namplification followed by mode sorting, we enable real-time detection of nine\nspatial modes and report high-purity squeezing of up to $7.9 \\pm 0.6$ dB,\nwhich, as far as we are aware, is the highest squeezing recorded for pulsed\nlight. Furthermore, we propose MOPA for the efficient characterization of\ncluster states, enabling real-time monitoring of all cluster links. This work\ncompletes the set of capabilities needed for robust multimode squeezed light\ndetection and significantly expands its applicability in quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "Lane topology extraction involves detecting lanes and traffic elements and\ndetermining their relationships, a key perception task for mapless autonomous\ndriving. This task requires complex reasoning, such as determining whether it\nis possible to turn left into a specific lane. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce neuro-symbolic methods powered by vision-language foundation models\n(VLMs). Existing approaches have notable limitations: (1) Dense visual\nprompting with VLMs can achieve strong performance but is costly in terms of\nboth financial resources and carbon footprint, making it impractical for\nrobotics applications. (2) Neuro-symbolic reasoning methods for 3D scene\nunderstanding fail to integrate visual inputs when synthesizing programs,\nmaking them ineffective in handling complex corner cases. To this end, we\npropose a fast-slow neuro-symbolic lane topology extraction algorithm, named\nChameleon, which alternates between a fast system that directly reasons over\ndetected instances using synthesized programs and a slow system that utilizes a\nVLM with a chain-of-thought design to handle corner cases. Chameleon leverages\nthe strengths of both approaches, providing an affordable solution while\nmaintaining high performance. We evaluate the method on the OpenLane-V2\ndataset, showing consistent improvements across various baseline detectors.

Here,\nwe analyse the properties of ICL in the massive cluster Abell 2390 at redshift\nz=0.228. Our analysis is based on the deep images obtained by the Euclid\nmission as part of the Early Release Observations in the near-infrared (Y, J, H\nbands), using the NISP instrument in a 0.75 deg$^2$ field. We subtracted a\npoint--spread function (PSF) model and removed the Galactic cirrus contribution\nin each band after modelling it with the DAWIS software. We then applied three\nmethods to detect, characterise, and model the ICL and the brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG): the CICLE 2D multi-galaxy fitting; the DAWIS wavelet-based\nmultiscale software; and a mask-based 1D profile fitting. We detect ICL out to\n600 kpc. The ICL fractions derived by our three methods range between 18% and\n36% (average of 24%), while the BCG+ICL fractions are between 21% and 41%\n(average of 29%), depending on the band and method. A galaxy density map based\non 219 selected cluster members shows a strong cluster substructure to the\nsouth-east and a smaller feature to the north-west. Based on colours, the ICL\n(out to about 400 kpc) seems to be built by the accretion of small systems (M ~\n$10^{9.5}$ solar mass), or from stars coming from the outskirts of Milky\nWay-type galaxies (M ~ $10^{10}$ solar mass). Though Abell 2390 does not seem\nto be undergoing a merger, it is not yet fully relaxed, since it has accreted\ntwo groups that have not fully merged with the cluster core. We estimate that\nthe contributions to the inner 300 kpc of the ICL of the north-west and\nsouth-east subgroups are 21% and 9% respectively.",

    "abstract": "Although large visual-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong\nperformance in multimodal tasks, errors may occasionally arise due to biases\nduring the reasoning process. Recently, reward models (RMs) have become\nincreasingly pivotal in the reasoning process. Specifically, process RMs\nevaluate each reasoning step, outcome RMs focus on the assessment of reasoning\nresults, and critique RMs perform error analysis on the entire reasoning\nprocess, followed by corrections. However, existing benchmarks for\nvision-language RMs (VLRMs) typically assess only a single aspect of their\ncapabilities (e.g., distinguishing between two answers), thus limiting the\nall-round evaluation and restricting the development of RMs in the\nvisual-language domain. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive and\nchallenging benchmark, dubbed as VLRMBench, encompassing 12,634 questions.\nVLRMBench is constructed based on three distinct types of datasets, covering\nmathematical reasoning, hallucination understanding, and multi-image\nunderstanding. We design 12 tasks across three major categories, focusing on\nevaluating VLRMs in the aspects of process understanding, outcome judgment, and\ncritique generation. Extensive experiments are conducted on 21 open-source\nmodels and 5 advanced closed-source models, highlighting the challenges posed\nby VLRMBench. For instance, in the `Forecasting Future', a binary\nclassification task, the advanced GPT-4o achieves only a 76.0% accuracy.\nAdditionally, we perform comprehensive analytical studies, offering valuable\ninsights for the future development of VLRMs. We anticipate that VLRMBench will\nserve as a pivotal benchmark in advancing VLRMs. Code and datasets will be\navailable at https://github.com/JCruan519/VLRMBench.",

In order to understand better the underlying\nmechanism of plant response to Pi, the response to phosphate starvation in\nArabidopsis thaliana was investigated through use of Petri Nets, a formal\nlanguage suitable for bio-modeling. A. thaliana displays a range of responses\nto deal with Pi starvation, but special attention was paid to root hair\nelongation in this study. A central player in the root hair pathway is the\ntranscription factor ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6-LIKE 4 (RSL4), which has been found\nto be upregulated during the Pi stress. A Petri Net was created which could\nsimulate the gene regulatory networks responsible for the increase in root hair\nlength, as well as the resulting increase in root hair length. Notably,\ndiscrepancies between the model and the literature suggested an important role\nfor RSL2 in regulating RSL4. In the future, the net designed in the current\nstudy could be used as a platform to develop hypotheses about the interaction\nbetween RSL2 and RSL4.",

We design SOGS, an\nanchor-based 3D-GS technique that introduces second-order anchors to achieve\nsuperior rendering quality and reduced anchor features and model size\nsimultaneously. Specifically, SOGS incorporates covariance-based second-order\nstatistics and correlation across feature dimensions to augment features within\neach anchor, compensating for the reduced feature size and improving rendering\nquality effectively. In addition, it introduces a selective gradient loss to\nenhance the optimization of scene textures and scene geometries, leading to\nhigh-quality rendering with small anchor features.

The essential prerequisite to\nunderstanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape\nis to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order.\nAs to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken.

This\ninformation is invaluable to cryptographic hardware designers for understanding\n*why* their hardware leaks and how they can mitigate it (e.g. by indicating the\nparticular sections of code or electronic components which are responsible).\nOur framework is based on an adversarial game between a family of classifiers\ntrained to estimate the conditional distributions of sensitive data given\nsubsets of measurements, and a budget-constrained noise distribution which\nprobabilistically erases individual measurements to maximize the loss of these\nclassifiers. We demonstrate our method's efficacy and ability to overcome\nlimitations of prior work through extensive experimental comparison with 8\nbaseline methods using 3 evaluation metrics and 6 publicly-available power/EM\ntrace datasets from AES, ECC and RSA implementations. We provide an open-source\nPyTorch implementation of these experiments.",

Conventional fault\ndetection methods depend on continuous, high-frequency vibration sensing,\ndigitising, and wireless transmission to the cloud-an approach that\nsignificantly drains the limited energy reserves of battery-powered sensors,\naccelerating their depletion and increasing maintenance costs. This work\nproposes a fundamentally different approach: rather than using instantaneous\nvibration data, we employ piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) tuned to\nspecific frequencies and leverage the cumulative harvested energy over time as\nthe key diagnostic feature. By directly utilising the energy generated from the\nmachinery's vibrations, we eliminate the need for frequent analog-to-digital\nconversions and data transmission, thereby reducing energy consumption at the\nsensor node and extending its operational lifetime. To validate this approach,\nwe use a numerical PEH model and publicly available acceleration datasets,\nexamining various PEH designs with different natural frequencies. We also\nconsider the influence of the classification algorithm, the number of devices,\nand the observation window duration. The results demonstrate that the harvested\nenergy reliably indicates bearing faults across a range of conditions and\nseverities. By converting vibration energy into both a power source and a\ndiagnostic feature, our solution offers a more sustainable, low-maintenance\nstrategy for fault detection in smart machinery.",

Additionally, we\nperform location-conditioned contrastive learning to further utilize cross-pair\nregion-level contrastiveness for improved multi-modal retrieval.

Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit\nstaggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear\nthermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the\nstate space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics\ninto reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to\ndecoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial\ndifferential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore,\ndifferent time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable,\ndispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally,\nthe thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is\ninvestigated via the developed method.",

Each day, each vertex updates\nits color following the majority among its neighbors, using its previous color\nfor tie-breaking. The dynamics achieves \\textit{unanimity} if every vertex has\nthe same color after finitely many days, and such color is said to\n\\textit{win}.\n  When $G$ is a $G(n,p)$ random graph, L. Tran and Vu (2019) found a codition\nin terms of $p$ and the initial difference $2\\Delta$ beteween the sizes of the\nRed and Blue camps, such that unanimity is achieved with probability\narbitrarily close to 1. They showed that if $p\\Delta^2 \\gg1 $, $p\\Delta \\geq\n100$, and $p\\geq (1+\\varepsilon) n^{-1}\\log n$ for a positive constant\n$\\varepsilon$, then unanimity occurs with probability $1 - o(1)$. If $p$ is not\nextremely small, namely $p > \\log^{-1/16} n $, then Sah and Sawhney (2022)\nshowed that the condition $p\\Delta^2 \\gg 1$ is sufficient.\n  If $n^{-1}\\log^2 n \\ll p \\ll n^{-1/2}\\log^{1/4} n$, we show that\n$p^{3/2}\\Delta \\gg n^{-1/2}\\log n$ is enough. Since this condition holds if\n$p\\Delta \\geq 100$ for $p$ in this range, this is an improvement of Tran's and\nVu's result. For the closely related problem of finding the optimal condition\nfor $p$ to achieve unanimity when the initial coloring is chosen uniformly at\nrandom among all possible Red/Blue assignments, our result implies a new lower\nbound $p \\gg n^{-2/3}\\log^{2/3} n$, which improves upon the previous bound of\n$n^{-3/5}\\log n$ by Chakraborti, Kim, Lee and T.

The 1.3 THz phonon pair and the 1.84 THz mode are\nobserved up to the CDW transition temperature. Combining density-functional\ntheory calculations, we point out these phonon pairs arise from the coexistence\nof Star-of-David and inverse Star-of-David distortions combined with six-fold\nrotational symmetry breaking. An anisotropy in the magnitude of transient\nreflectivity change is also revealed at the onset of CDW order.

We also put forward a relation between the response functions\nof the spike train and membrane voltage, a response-response relation (RRR)\nthat holds true for a more general setting than considered in most parts of the\npaper. For the generalized IF model with an adaptation current and colored\nGaussian noise we derive an FRR and an RRR. We briefly discuss useful\napplications of the derived FRRs and RRRs.",

    "abstract": "Network optimization remains fundamental in wireless communications, with\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)-based solutions gaining widespread adoption. As\nSixth-Generation (6G) communication networks pursue full-scenario coverage,\noptimization in complex extreme environments presents unprecedented challenges.\nThe dynamic nature of these environments, combined with physical constraints,\nmakes it difficult for AI solutions such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)\nto obtain effective reward feedback for the training process. However, many\nexisting DRL-based network optimization studies overlook this challenge through\nidealized environment settings. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of\nGenerative AI (GenAI), especially diffusion models, in capturing complex latent\ndistributions, we introduce a novel Diffusion Reasoning-based Reward Shaping\nScheme (DRESS) to achieve robust network optimization. By conditioning on\nobserved environmental states and executed actions, DRESS leverages diffusion\nmodels' multi-step denoising process as a form of deep reasoning, progressively\nrefining latent representations to generate meaningful auxiliary reward signals\nthat capture patterns of network systems. Moreover, DRESS is designed for\nseamless integration with any DRL framework, allowing DRESS-aided DRL\n(DRESSed-DRL) to enable stable and efficient DRL training even under extreme\nnetwork environments. Experimental results demonstrate that DRESSed-DRL\nachieves about 1.5x times faster convergence than its original version in\nsparse-reward wireless environments and significant performance improvements in\nmultiple general DRL benchmark environments compared to baseline methods. The\ncode of DRESS is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/DRESS.",

Algorithmic\nmethods are often preferred due to their repeatable results and speed. I here\nquantitatively assess visual source extraction using a large sample of\nartificial sources and a comparatively rapid source extraction tool, and\ncompare the results with those from automatic techniques. I injected 4,232\nsources into a total of 8,500 emission-free data cubes, with at most one source\nper cube. Sources covered a wide range of signal-to-noise and velocity widths.\nI blindly searched all cubes, measuring the completeness and reliability for\npairs of signal-to-noise and line width values. Smaller control tests were\nperformed to account for the possible biases in the search, which gave results\nin good agreement with the main experiment. I also searched cubes injected with\nartificial sources using algorithmic extractors, and compare these results with\na set of catalogues independently reported from real observational data. I find\nthat the results of visual extraction follow a tight relation between\nintegrated signal-to-noise and completeness. Visual extraction compares\nfavourably in efficacy with the algorithmic methods, tending to recover a\nhigher fraction of fainter sources. Visual source extraction can be a\nsurprisingly rapid procedure which gives higher completeness levels than\nautomatic techniques, giving predictable, quantifiable results which are not\nstrongly subject to the whims of the observer.

Recent research on using LLMs to generate\nScalable Vector Graphics (SVG) presents a promising approach to automating\ndiagram creation.

In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate math-related\ndiagrams that accompany textual hints via intermediate SVG representations. We\naddress three research questions: (1) how to automatically generate math\ndiagrams in problem-solving hints and evaluate their quality, (2) whether SVG\nis an effective intermediate representation for math diagrams, and (3) what\nprompting strategies and formats are required for LLMs to generate accurate\nSVG-based diagrams.

We\ncalculate the time-averaged JC and inspect the tunability of the current-phase\nrelation (CPR) to ascertain the diode characteristics. The asymmetric Floquet\ndrive also manifests an anomalous JC signature in our KC-QD-KC JJ. Furthermore,\nadditional control over the QD energy level can be achieved via an external\ngate voltage that renders flexibility for the Josephson diode (JD) to act as an\nSC switching device.

This concept is central to the\ndevelopment of a 6G architecture that aims to exploit the accelerated compute\ncapabilities for supporting both real-time signal processing and offloading of\nGenerative AI (GenAI) workloads. However, both the architectural framework\nrequired to support this vision and the dynamic resource allocation strategy\nare still in their infancy. The O-RAN architecture intrinsically allows\ncloud-native disaggregated implementation. Consequently, we explore a framework\nthat can allow orchestration of AI-and-RAN workloads by expanding the Near\nReal-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (NRT-RIC) within O-RAN. The framework\nincorporates a monitoring xApp that tracks RAN KPIs and exposes radio analytics\nto the proposed E2E orchestrator via a recently introduced Y1 interface.

Existing methods primarily use asynchronous\nauto-regressive models or synchronous diffusion models to address this\nchallenge. However, asynchronous auto-regressive models often suffer from\ninconsistencies between training and inference, leading to issues such as error\naccumulation, while synchronous diffusion models are limited by their reliance\non rigid sequence length. To address these issues, we introduce Auto-Regressive\nDiffusion (AR-Diffusion), a novel model that combines the strengths of\nauto-regressive and diffusion models for flexible, asynchronous video\ngeneration. Specifically, our approach leverages diffusion to gradually corrupt\nvideo frames in both training and inference, reducing the discrepancy between\nthese phases. Inspired by auto-regressive generation, we incorporate a\nnon-decreasing constraint on the corruption timesteps of individual frames,\nensuring that earlier frames remain clearer than subsequent ones. This setup,\ntogether with temporal causal attention, enables flexible generation of videos\nwith varying lengths while preserving temporal coherence. In addition, we\ndesign two specialized timestep schedulers: the FoPP scheduler for balanced\ntimestep sampling during training, and the AD scheduler for flexible timestep\ndifferences during inference, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous\ngeneration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed\nmethod, which achieves competitive and state-of-the-art results across four\nchallenging benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have driven the advancement of vision generation over the\npast years. However, it is often difficult to apply these large models in\ndownstream tasks, due to massive fine-tuning cost. Recently, Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) has been applied for efficient tuning of diffusion models.\nUnfortunately, the capabilities of LoRA-tuned diffusion models are limited,\nsince the same LoRA is used for different timesteps of the diffusion process.\nTo tackle this problem, we introduce a general and concise TimeStep Master\n(TSM) paradigm with two key fine-tuning stages. In the fostering stage\n(1-stage), we apply different LoRAs to fine-tune the diffusion model at\ndifferent timestep intervals. This results in different TimeStep LoRA experts\nthat can effectively capture different noise levels. In the assembling stage\n(2-stage), we design a novel asymmetrical mixture of TimeStep LoRA experts, via\ncore-context collaboration of experts at multi-scale intervals. For each\ntimestep, we leverage TimeStep LoRA expert within the smallest interval as the\ncore expert without gating, and use experts within the bigger intervals as the\ncontext experts with time-dependent gating. Consequently, our TSM can\neffectively model the noise level via the expert in the finest interval, and\nadaptively integrate contexts from the experts of other scales, boosting the\nversatility of diffusion models. To show the effectiveness of our TSM paradigm,\nwe conduct extensive experiments on three typical and popular LoRA-related\ntasks of diffusion models, including domain adaptation, post-pretraining, and\nmodel distillation. Our TSM achieves the state-of-the-art results on all these\ntasks, throughout various model structures (UNet, DiT and MM-DiT) and visual\ndata modalities (Image, Video), showing its remarkable generalization capacity.",

Simultaneously, current MLLMs utilizing latent\nembeddings for visual task decoding generally demonstrate limited adaptability\nto both multi-task learning and multi-granularity scenarios. In this work, we\npresent REF-VLM, an end-to-end framework for unified training of various visual\ndecoding tasks.

However, at higher temperatures it exhibits what has been termed\nthe Smectic ZA: identified as an orientationally ordered, antiferroelectric\nphase with a density modulation in direction perpendicular to the optic axis.\nAt even higher temperatures, this transitions to an apparently normal nematic\nphase. We have studied the splay-bend Freedericksz transition in the nematic\nand SmZA phases of the material DIO. Both the magnetic and electric field\ntransitions were utilized. We observed the transitions by measuring effective\nbirefringence and capacitance as well as with polarizing light microscopy. In\nboth the nematic and the SmZA states the field induced transitions resemble (in\nnumerous aspects) the classical Freedericksz transition. These enable\ndeterminations of several fundamental material parameters and also reveal\nintriguing aspects of the SmZA phase, including the surprising behavior of the\nelastic constants and the dielectric anisotropy. Detailed comparison with Frank\nelastic theory of the Freedericksz transition shows that the N phase behaves\nlargely as expected, but the transition in the SmZA phase differs\nsignificantly. Two specific examples of this are the onset of striations in the\nFreedericksz distorted state, and the presence of optical biaxiality. The\nformer may be related to the periodic Freedericksz transition as it coincides\nwith a large increase in the splay elastic constant. The latter has been\npredicted for the SmZA phase, but not previously observed.",

    "abstract": "Pioneering electroweak measurements of the neutron skin thickness in lead-208\nand calcium-48 are challenging our understanding of nuclear dynamics. Many\ntheoretical models suggest that the slope of the symmetry energy controls the\ndevelopment of a neutron skin in neutron-rich nuclei. This led to the\nexpectation that if lead-208 exhibits a large neutron skin, calcium-48 should\nas well. Given that the PREX collaboration reported a relatively thick neutron\nskin in lead, we anticipated that calcium would also have a significant neutron\nskin. Instead, the CREX collaboration reported a thin neutron skin in calcium.\nAlthough many suggestions have been proposed, the ``CREX-PREX dilemma\" remains\nunsolved. Recently, an intriguing scenario has emerged, suggesting that an\nenhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction could simultaneously account for both\nresults. Following this approach, we performed relativistic mean-field\ncalculations with an increased isovector spin-orbit potential. Our findings\nindicate that while this modification significantly affects the structure of\ncalcium-48, it has only a marginal impact on lead-208, thereby bringing the\nresults into better agreement with experiment. However, the strong enhancement\nrequired to mitigate the CREX-PREX dilemma destroys the agreement with a\nsuccessful spin-orbit phenomenology, primarily by modifying the well-known\nordering of spin-orbit partners.",

They come in two classes - transient operators, which\ndecay in time and perpetual operators, which either oscillate forever or stay\nthe same (conservation laws). These operators provide a full characterization\nof the dynamics of the system. Deriving these operators, apart from a very\nlimited class of models, has not been possible.

In\nthis paper, we introduce SPEED, a model editing-based concept erasure approach\nthat leverages null-space constraints for scalable, precise, and efficient\nerasure. Specifically, SPEED incorporates Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF)\nto retain the most affected non-target concepts during erasing, Directed Prior\nAugmentation (DPA) to expand prior coverage while maintaining semantic\nconsistency, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to regularize model\nediting by explicitly preserving key invariants during the T2I generation\nprocess. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks\ndemonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in prior\npreservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure,\nsuccessfully removing 100 concepts within just 5 seconds.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image\ngeneration, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW\nimages. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the\nmodel to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully\nerase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical\nexpressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal\ngeneration capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE,\nusing a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off\nbetween reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by\nerasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By\nidentifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we\noptimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually\nsimilar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being\noverly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process.\nFollowing this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling\ntrajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising\nprediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through\ncontrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious\ncontent. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple\nmalicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its\neffectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's\noriginal generation ability.

Their proof uses LP-duality to\ncharacterize the general implementability of network flows by tolls. For the\nmuch more complex setting of $\\textit{dynamic flows}$, [Graf et al., SODA 2025]\nidentified necessary and sufficient conditions for a dynamic $s$-$d$ flow to be\nimplementable as a tolled dynamic equilibrium. They used the machinery of\n(infinite-dimensional) strong duality to obtain their characterizations. Their\nwork, however, does not answer the question of whether system optimal dynamic\nnetwork flows are implementable by tolls.\n  We consider this question for a general dynamic flow model involving multiple\ncommodities with individual source-destination pairs, fixed inflow rates and\nheterogeneous valuations of travel time and money spent. We present both a\npositive and a, perhaps surprising, negative result: For the negative result,\nwe provide a network with multiple source and destination pairs in which under\nthe Vickrey queuing model no system optimal flow is implementable -- even if\nall users value travel times and spent money the same. Our counter-example even\nshows that the ratio of the achievable equilibrium travel times by using tolls\nand of the system optimal travel times can be unbounded. For the single-source,\nsingle-destination case, we show that if the traversal time functions are\nsuitably well-behaved (as is the case, for example, in the Vickrey queuing\nmodel), any system optimal flow is implementable.",

    "abstract": "We introduce AttentionSwarm, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate safe and\nefficient swarm control across three challenging environments: a landing\nenvironment with obstacles, a competitive drone game setting, and a dynamic\ndrone racing scenario. Central to our approach is the Attention Model Based\nControl Barrier Function (CBF) framework, which integrates attention mechanisms\nwith safety-critical control theory to enable real-time collision avoidance and\ntrajectory optimization. This framework dynamically prioritizes critical\nobstacles and agents in the swarms vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs\nformally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints. The safe\nattention net algorithm was developed and evaluated using a swarm of Crazyflie\n2.1 micro quadrotors, which were tested indoors with the Vicon motion capture\nsystem to ensure precise localization and control. Experimental results show\nthat our system achieves landing accuracy of 3.02 cm with a mean time of 23 s\nand collision-free landings in a dynamic landing environment, 100% and\ncollision-free navigation in a drone game environment, and 95% and\ncollision-free navigation for a dynamic multiagent drone racing environment,\nunderscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. This\nwork offers a promising foundation for applications in dynamic environments\nwhere safety and fastness are paramount.",

In this\nwork, we aim to increase the performance in this range by training using a\nweighted version of the continuous ranked probability score (wCRPS). We develop\nan approach using shifted Gaussian cdf weight functions, whose parameters are\ntuned using a multi-objective hyperparameter tuning algorithm that balances\nperformance on low and high wind speed ranges. We explore this approach for\nboth linear models and convolutional neural network models combined with\nvarious parametric distributions, namely the truncated normal, log-normal, and\ngeneralized extreme value distributions, as well as adaptive mixtures. We apply\nthese methods to forecasts from KNMI's deterministic Harmonie-Arome numerical\nweather prediction model to obtain probabilistic wind speed forecasts in the\nNetherlands for 48 hours ahead. For linear models we observe that even with a\ntuned weight function, training using the wCRPS produces a strong body-tail\ntrade-off, where increased performance on extremes comes at the price of lower\nperformance for the bulk of the distribution. For the best models using\nconvolutional neural networks, we find that using a tuned weight function the\nperformance on extremes can be increased without a significant deterioration in\nperformance on the bulk.

This alternative representation as a graph allows for a simple\ntranslation between combinatorics and algebra: connected components of the\ngraphcode correspond to summands of the module and isolated paths correspond to\nintervals. We demonstrate that graphcodes are useful in practice by speeding-up\nthe task of decomposing a module into indecomposable summands.

A geometric realization of a\ndichotomous ordinal graph $G$ in a metric space $X$ is a drawing of $G$ in $X$\nin which every long edge is strictly longer than every short edge. We call a\ngraph $G$ pandichotomous in $X$ if $G$ admits a geometric realization in $X$\nfor every partition of its edge set into short and long edges. We exhibit a\nvery close relationship between the degeneracy of a graph $G$ and its\npandichotomic Euclidean or spherical dimension, that is, the smallest dimension\n$k$ such that $G$ is pandichotomous in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ or the sphere\n$\\mathbb{S}^k$, respectively. First, every $d$-degenerate graph is\npandichotomous in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and these bounds are\ntight for the sphere and for $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and almost tight for\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d\\ge 3$. Second, every $n$-vertex graph that is\npandichotomous in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ has at most $\\mu kn$ edges, for some absolute\nconstant $\\mu<7.23$. This shows that the pandichotomic Euclidean dimension of\nany graph is linearly tied to its degeneracy and in the special cases $k\\in\n\\{1,2\\}$ resolves open problems posed by Alam, Kobourov, Pupyrev, and\nToeniskoetter. Further, we characterize which complete bipartite graphs are\npandichotomous in $\\mathbb{R}^2$: These are exactly the $K_{m,n}$ with $m\\le 3$\nor $m=4$ and $n\\le 6$. For general bipartite graphs, we can guarantee\nrealizations in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ if the short or the long subgraph is\nconstrained: namely if the short subgraph is outerplanar or a subgraph of a\nrectangular grid, or if the long subgraph forms a caterpillar.",

We remove the damping term from a linearly damped DE and thus\nobtain a simple analytical solution x(t) of the damped Duffing equation in the\nweak damping limit. The constructed solution allows us to examine the effect of\ndamping on the phase path of the oscillator. The phase path is a parametric\nplot of x(t) and x = dxdt on the plane (x, x). While the phase path of the\nun-damped Duffing oscillator is an isolated limit cycle, the corresponding\nphase path for the Duffing oscillator with damping is a distorted one. We\nconfirm our observation on the effect of dissipation by numerical simulation.\nWe point out that it is often of interest to study dissipative systems at the\nquantum level and construct Lagrangian representations for both un-damped and\ndamped Duffing oscillators.

To\nsolve this problem, we propose an Affordance Dexterous Grasp (AffordDexGrasp)\nframework, with the insight of bridging the gap with a new\ngeneralizable-instructive affordance representation. This affordance can\ngeneralize to unseen categories by leveraging the object's local structure and\ncategory-agnostic semantic attributes, thereby effectively guiding dexterous\ngrasp generation. Built upon the affordance, our framework introduces\nAffordance Flow Matching (AFM) for affordance generation with language as\ninput, and Grasp Flow Matching (GFM) for generating dexterous grasp with\naffordance as input. To evaluate our framework, we build an open-set table-top\nlanguage-guided dexterous grasp dataset.

However, as this model is likely to lead to biased\nestimates, its use should be limited to cases for which only few data are\navailable. In practice, this involves having to resort to binary data which\nindicate the state of the structure when it has been subjected to a seismic\nloading, namely failure or non-failure. The question then arises of the choice\nof data that must be used to obtain an optimal estimate, that is to say the\nmost precise possible with the minimum of data. To answer this question, we\npropose a methodology for design of experiments in a Bayesian framework based\non the reference prior theory. This theory aims to define a so-called objective\nprior that favors data learning, which is slighty constrained in this work in\norder tackle the problems of likelihood degeneracy that are ubiquitous with\nsmall data sets. The novelty of our work is then twofold. First, we rigorously\npresent the problem of likelihood degeneracy which hampers frequentist\napproaches such as the maximum likelihood estimation. Then, we propose our\nstrategy inherited from the reference prior theory to build the data set. This\nstrategy aims to maximize the impact of the data on the posterior distribution\nof the fragility curve. Our method is applied to a case study of the nuclear\nindustry. The results demonstrate its ability to efficiently and robustly\nestimate the fragility curve, and to avoid degeneracy even with a limited\nnumber of experiments.

While\nprior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting\ntest-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental\ngains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed\nto mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked\ndimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental\nflaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up\nto 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution\nclasses, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported\nperformance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive\nrates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that\noperates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on\npost-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD\ndataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process\nshapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects,\nleading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K.\nOur methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster\nR-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation. Together, these\ncontributions offer a principled and effective way to reduce OoD-induced\nhallucination in object detectors.

Existing approaches -- ownership systems, linear and\naffine types, uniqueness types, and lexical effect tracking -- impose global\nrestrictions such as uniqueness or linearity, or rely on shallow syntactic\nanalyses. These designs fall short with higher-order functions and shared\nmutable state. Reachability Types (RT) track aliasing and separation in\nhigher-order programs, ensuring runtime safety and non-interference. However,\nRT systems face three key limitations: (1) they prohibit cyclic references,\nruling out non-terminating computations and fixed-point combinators; (2) they\nrequire deep tracking, where a qualifier must include all transitively\nreachable locations, reducing precision and hindering optimizations like\nfine-grained parallelism; and (3) referent qualifier invariance prevents\nreferents from escaping their allocation contexts, making reference factories\ninexpressible.\n  In this work, we address these limitations by extending RT with three\nmechanisms that enhance expressiveness. First, we introduce cyclic references,\nenabling recursive patterns to be encoded directly through the store. Second,\nwe adopt shallow qualifier tracking, decoupling references from their\ntransitively reachable values. Finally, we introduce an escaping rule with\nreference subtyping, allowing referent qualifiers to outlive their allocation\ncontext. These extensions are formalized in the\n$\\mathsf{F}_{<:}^{\\circ}$-calculus with a mechanized proof of type soundness,\nand case studies illustrate expressiveness through fixpoint combinators,\nnon-interfering parallelism, and escaping read-only references.",

To improve robustness to such shifts, existing approaches have\ndeveloped strategies that train models or perform hyperparameter tuning using\nthe group-labeled data to minimize the worst-case loss over groups. However, a\nnon-trivial amount of high-quality labels is often required to obtain\nnoticeable improvements. Given the costliness of the labels, we propose to\nadopt a different paradigm to enhance group label efficiency: utilizing the\ngroup-labeled data as a target set to optimize the weights of other\ngroup-unlabeled data. We introduce Group-robust Sample Reweighting (GSR), a\ntwo-stage approach that first learns the representations from group-unlabeled\ndata, and then tinkers the model by iteratively retraining its last layer on\nthe reweighted data using influence functions. Our GSR is theoretically sound,\npractically lightweight, and effective in improving the robustness to\nsubpopulation shifts. In particular, GSR outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches that require the same amount or even more group\nlabels.",

To address these\nchallenges, we present MovieAgent, an automated movie generation via\nmulti-agent Chain of Thought (CoT) planning. MovieAgent offers two key\nadvantages: 1) We firstly explore and define the paradigm of automated\nmovie/long-video generation. Given a script and character bank, our MovieAgent\ncan generates multi-scene, multi-shot long-form videos with a coherent\nnarrative, while ensuring character consistency, synchronized subtitles, and\nstable audio throughout the film. 2) MovieAgent introduces a hierarchical\nCoT-based reasoning process to automatically structure scenes, camera settings,\nand cinematography, significantly reducing human effort. By employing multiple\nLLM agents to simulate the roles of a director, screenwriter, storyboard\nartist, and location manager, MovieAgent streamlines the production pipeline.\nExperiments demonstrate that MovieAgent achieves new state-of-the-art results\nin script faithfulness, character consistency, and narrative coherence.

    "abstract": "Fairness of machine learning algorithms is receiving increasing attention, as\nsuch algorithms permeate the day-to-day aspects of our lives. One way in which\nbias can manifest in a dataset is through missing values. If data are missing,\nthese data are often assumed to be missing completely randomly; in reality the\npropensity of data being missing is often tied to the demographic\ncharacteristics of individuals. There is limited research into how missing\nvalues and the handling thereof can impact the fairness of an algorithm. Most\nresearchers either apply listwise deletion or tend to use the simpler methods\nof imputation (e.g. mean or mode) compared to the more advanced ones (e.g.\nmultiple imputation); we therefore study the impact of the simpler methods on\nthe fairness of algorithms. The starting point of the study is the mechanism of\nmissingness, leading into how the missing data are processed and finally how\nthis impacts fairness. Three popular datasets in the field of fairness are\namputed in a simulation study. The results show that under certain scenarios\nthe impact on fairness can be pronounced when the missingness mechanism is\nmissing at random. Furthermore, elementary missing data handling techniques\nlike listwise deletion and mode imputation can lead to higher fairness compared\nto more complex imputation methods like k-nearest neighbour imputation, albeit\noften at the cost of lower accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Photo finishing tuning aims to automate the manual tuning process of the\nphoto finishing pipeline, like Adobe Lightroom or Darktable. Previous works\neither use zeroth-order optimization, which is slow when the set of parameters\nincreases, or rely on a differentiable proxy of the target finishing pipeline,\nwhich is hard to train. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel\ngoal-conditioned reinforcement learning framework for efficiently tuning\nparameters using a goal image as a condition. Unlike previous approaches, our\ntuning framework does not rely on any proxy and treats the photo finishing\npipeline as a black box. Utilizing a trained reinforcement learning policy, it\ncan efficiently find the desired set of parameters within just 10 queries,\nwhile optimization based approaches normally take 200 queries. Furthermore, our\narchitecture utilizes a goal image to guide the iterative tuning of pipeline\nparameters, allowing for flexible conditioning on pixel-aligned target images,\nstyle images, or any other visually representable goals. We conduct detailed\nexperiments on photo finishing tuning and photo stylization tuning tasks,\ndemonstrating the advantages of our method.

ALLVB's main\ncontributions include: 1) It integrates 9 major video understanding tasks.\nThese tasks are converted into video QA formats, allowing a single benchmark to\nevaluate 9 different video understanding capabilities of MLLMs, highlighting\nthe versatility, comprehensiveness, and challenging nature of ALLVB. 2) A fully\nautomated annotation pipeline using GPT-4o is designed, requiring only human\nquality control, which facilitates the maintenance and expansion of the\nbenchmark. 3) It contains 1,376 videos across 16 categories, averaging nearly 2\nhours each, with a total of 252k QAs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the\nlargest long video understanding benchmark in terms of the number of videos,\naverage duration, and number of QAs. We have tested various mainstream MLLMs on\nALLVB, and the results indicate that even the most advanced commercial models\nhave significant room for improvement.

Emphasizing the\npre-register-transfer level (Pre-RTL) design phase is crucial for reducing\ntrial-and-error costs. However, 3DIC design introduces additional complexities\ndue to thermal constraints and an expanded design space resulting from vertical\nstacking and various cooling strategies. Despite this need, existing Pre-RTL\nDSE tools for 3DICs remain scarce, with available solutions often lacking\ncomprehensive design options and full customization support. To bridge this\ngap, we present Cool-3D, an end-to-end, thermal-aware framework for 3DIC design\nthat integrates mainstream architectural-level simulators, including gem5,\nMcPAT, and HotSpot 7.0, with advanced cooling models. Cool-3D enables broad and\nfine-grained design space exploration, built-in microfluidic cooling support\nfor thermal analysis, and an extension interface for non-parameterizable\ncustomization, allowing designers to model and optimize 3DIC architectures with\ngreater flexibility and accuracy. To validate the Cool-3D framework, we conduct\nthree case studies demonstrating its ability to model various hardware design\noptions and accurately capture thermal behaviors. Cool-3D serves as a\nfoundational framework that not only facilitates comprehensive 3DIC design\nspace exploration but also enables future innovations in 3DIC architecture,\ncooling strategies, and optimization techniques. The entire framework, along\nwith the experimental data, is in the process of being released on GitHub.",

In particular, we propose three new wireless-powered zeRIS modes:\n1) in mode-I, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the optimal\nphase shift design of information user to maximize the reliability of the\nsystem; 2) in mode-II, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the\noptimal phase shift design of cooperative jamming user to maximize the security\nof the system; 3) in mode-III, N1 and N2 (N1+N2=N) reconfigurable reflecting\nelements are respectively adjusted to the optimal phase shift designs of\ninformation user and cooperative jamming user to balance the reliability and\nsecurity of the system. Then, we propose three new metrics, i.e., joint outage\nprobability (JOP), joint intercept probability (JIP), and secrecy energy\nefficiency (SEE), and analyze their closed-form expressions in three modes,\nrespectively. The results show that under high transmission power, all the\ndiversity gains of three modes are 1, and the JOPs of mode-I, mode-II and\nmode-III are improved by increasing the number of zeRIS elements, which are\nrelated to N2, N, and N^2_1, respectively. In addition, mode-I achieves the\nbest JOP, while mode-II achieves the best JIP among three modes. We exploit two\nsecurity-reliability trade-off (SRT) metrics, i.e., JOP versus JIP, and\nnormalized joint intercept and outage probability (JIOP), to reveal the SRT\nperformance of the proposed three modes. It is obtained that mode-II\noutperforms the other two modes in the JOP versus JIP, while mode-III and\nmode-II achieve the best performance of normalized JIOP at low and high\ntransmission power, respectively.",

Among newly recruited COVIDOM participants (n=1,930), the PCS\nscore was again found to be associated with both its putative predictors. Of\nthe score-constituting symptom complexes, neurological symptoms, sleep\ndisturbance, and fatigue were predicted by individual resilience, whereas acute\ndisease severity predicted exercise intolerance, chemosensory deficits, joint\nor muscle pain, signs of infection, and fatigue. These associations inspired\nthe definition of two novel PCS scores that included the above-mentioned\nsubsets of symptom complexes only. Both novel scores were inversely correlated\nwith quality of life, measured by the EQ-5D-5L index.

In this work we take a different approach by\nrelying on fast, approximate $N$-body simulations. In these simulations, axion\nphysics are only included in the initial conditions, allowing us to run a large\nnumber of simulations with varying axion and cosmological parameters. From our\nsimulation suite we use machine learning tools to create an emulator for the\nratio of the dark matter power-spectrum in mixed axion models - models where\ndark matter is a combination of CDM and axion - to that of $\\Lambda$CDM. The\nresulting emulator only needs to be combined with existing emulators for\n$\\Lambda$CDM to be able to be used in parameter constraints.

Most studies on zero-shot human-AI coordination\nhave focused on enhancing the ego-agent's coordination ability in a given\nenvironment without considering the issue of generalization to unseen\nenvironments. Real-world applications of zero-shot human-AI coordination should\nconsider unpredictable environmental changes and the varying coordination\nability of co-players depending on the environment. Previously, the multi-agent\nUED (Unsupervised Environment Design) approach has investigated these\nchallenges by jointly considering environmental changes and co-player policy in\ncompetitive two-player AI-AI scenarios. In this paper, our study extends a\nmulti-agent UED approach to zero-shot human-AI coordination.

The zero-shot human-AI\ncoordination performance was evaluated in the Overcooked-AI environment, using\nhuman proxy agents and real humans.

    "abstract": "While classifier-free guidance (CFG) is essential for conditional diffusion\nmodels, it doubles the number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) per\ninference step. To mitigate this inefficiency, we introduce adapter guidance\ndistillation (AGD), a novel approach that simulates CFG in a single forward\npass. AGD leverages lightweight adapters to approximate CFG, effectively\ndoubling the sampling speed while maintaining or even improving sample quality.\nUnlike prior guidance distillation methods that tune the entire model, AGD\nkeeps the base model frozen and only trains minimal additional parameters\n($\\sim$2%) to significantly reduce the resource requirement of the distillation\nphase. Additionally, this approach preserves the original model weights and\nenables the adapters to be seamlessly combined with other checkpoints derived\nfrom the same base model. We also address a key mismatch between training and\ninference in existing guidance distillation methods by training on CFG-guided\ntrajectories instead of standard diffusion trajectories. Through extensive\nexperiments, we show that AGD achieves comparable or superior FID to CFG across\nmultiple architectures with only half the NFEs. Notably, our method enables the\ndistillation of large models ($\\sim$2.6B parameters) on a single consumer GPU\nwith 24 GB of VRAM, making it more accessible than previous approaches that\nrequire multiple high-end GPUs.

    "abstract": "Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are emerging as a core component of future 6G\ncommunication systems, providing global connectivity and supporting\ndata-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed\nhierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework within the NTN architecture,\nleveraging a high altitude platform station (HAPS) constellation as\nintermediate distributed FL servers. Our framework integrates both low-Earth\norbit (LEO) satellites and ground clients in the FL training process while\nutilizing geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites as\nrelays to exchange FL global models across other HAPS constellations worldwide,\nenabling seamless, global-scale learning. The proposed framework offers several\nkey benefits: (i) enhanced privacy through the decentralization of the FL\nmechanism by leveraging the HAPS constellation, (ii) improved model accuracy\nand reduced training loss while balancing latency, (iii) increased scalability\nof FL systems through ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing MEO and GEO\nsatellites, and (iv) the ability to use FL data, such as resource utilization\nmetrics, to further optimize the NTN architecture from a network management\nperspective. A numerical study demonstrates the proposed framework's\neffectiveness, with improved model accuracy, reduced training loss, and\nefficient latency management. The article also includes a brief review of FL in\nNTNs and highlights key challenges and future research directions.",

So far, SBPs have been\nmostly extracted from a large set of mock catalogs generated with the Halo\nOccupation Distribution (HOD) approach. We show that given a halo mass function\nmodel and assuming that the EFT parameters of halos depend only on the peak\nheight, HOD-based priors can be computed analytically for the standard\n7-parameter HOD model. We derive the relevant expressions for deterministic EFT\nparameters from the halo model. The halo model, however, fails to accurately\ndescribe stochastic EFT parameters, for which we use a physically motivated\nphenomenological prescription. We compare our analytic priors with simulations\nand find an excellent agreement. Our approach provides analytic insights into\nthe physics behind the EFT parameters of galaxies, and allows one to reduce the\ncomputation time of SBPs to virtually nothing. As an application, we produce a\nset of 100,000 EFT parameters by sampling both HOD and cosmological models, and\nexplicitly demonstrate that any cosmology dependence can be completely absorbed\nby relatively minor shifts of the HOD parameters.

In this work, we propose an efficient obstacle-aware global\nrouting flow for VLSI designs with obstacles. The flow includes a rule-based\nobstacle-avoiding rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (OARSMT) algorithm during\nthe tree generation phase. This algorithm is both scalable and fast to provide\ntree topologies avoiding obstacles in the early stage globally. With its\nguidance, OARSMT-guided and obstacle-aware sparse maze routing are proposed in\nthe later stages to minimize obstacle violations further and reduce overflow\ncosts.

In\ncontrast, inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors offer an energy-efficient and\nprivacy-preserving alternative, yet they suffer from limited large-scale\nannotated datasets, leading to weaker generalization in downstream tasks. To\nbridge this gap, we propose COMODO, a cross-modal self-supervised distillation\nframework that transfers rich semantic knowledge from the video modality to the\nIMU modality without requiring labeled annotations. COMODO leverages a\npretrained and frozen video encoder to construct a dynamic instance queue,\naligning the feature distributions of video and IMU embeddings.

Experiments on multiple egocentric HAR datasets\ndemonstrate that COMODO consistently improves downstream classification\nperformance, achieving results comparable to or exceeding fully supervised\nfine-tuned models. Moreover, COMODO exhibits strong cross-dataset\ngeneralization.

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of seismic responses and quantification of structural\ndamage are critical in civil engineering. Traditional approaches such as finite\nelement analysis could lack computational efficiency, especially for complex\nstructural systems under extreme hazards. Recently, artificial intelligence has\nprovided an alternative to efficiently model highly nonlinear behaviors.\nHowever, existing models face challenges in generalizing across diverse\nstructural systems. This paper proposes a novel multi-channel gated recurrent\nunit (MC-GRU) network aimed at achieving generalized nonlinear structural\nresponse prediction for varying structures. The key concept lies in the\nintegration of a multi-channel input mechanism to GRU with an extra input of\nstructural information to the candidate hidden state, which enables the network\nto learn the dynamic characteristics of diverse structures and thus empower the\ngeneralizability and adaptiveness to unseen structures. The performance of the\nproposed MC-GRU is validated through a series of case studies, including a\nsingle-degree-of-freedom linear system, a hysteretic Bouc-Wen system, and a\nnonlinear reinforced concrete column from experimental testing. Results\nindicate that the proposed MC-GRU overcomes the major generalizability issues\nof existing methods, with capability of accurately inferring seismic responses\nof varying structures. Additionally, it demonstrates enhanced capabilities in\nrepresenting nonlinear structural dynamics compared to traditional models such\nas GRU and LSTM.",

We\npropose AuthorMist, a novel reinforcement learning-based system to transform\nAI-generated text into human-like writing. AuthorMist leverages a\n3-billion-parameter language model as a backbone, fine-tuned with Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GPRO) to paraphrase text in a way that evades AI\ndetectors.\n  Our framework establishes a generic approach where external detector APIs\n(GPTZero, WinstonAI, Originality.ai, etc.) serve as reward functions within the\nreinforcement learning loop, enabling the model to systematically learn outputs\nthat these detectors are less likely to classify as AI-generated. This\nAPI-as-reward methodology can be applied broadly to optimize text against any\ndetector with an accessible interface. Experiments on multiple datasets and\ndetectors demonstrate that AuthorMist effectively reduces the detectability of\nAI-generated text while preserving the original meaning.

Using\nconstraints from nuclear saturation properties, chiral effective field theory\n($\\chi$EFT), NICER radius measurements, and tidal deformability data from\nGW170817, we systematically explore the impact of $\\Delta$-resonances on the\nequation of state (EoS) of dense matter and neutron star observables. Our\nresults demonstrate that the inclusion of $\\Delta$-baryons softens the EoS at\nlow densities while maintaining sufficient stiffness at high densities to\nsupport $2M_{\\odot}$ neutron stars. This naturally reconciles neutron star\nradius constraints with the recent observation of the low-mass compact object\nin HESS J1731-347 while simultaneously exhibiting excellent agreement with\nGW170817 tidal deformability constraints, reinforcing the astrophysical\nviability of $\\Delta$-admixed neutron stars.

In our previous studies, we have shown that\nsolar wind turbulence in the inertial range of large magnetohydrodynamic scales\nexhibits Markov properties. We have recently extended this approach on much\nsmaller kinetic scales. Here we are testing for the Markovian character of\nstochastic processes in a kinetic regime based on magnetic field and velocity\nfluctuations in the solar wind, measured onboard the Magnetospheric Multiscale\n(MMS) mission: behind the bow shock, inside the magnetosheath, and near the\nmagnetopause. We have verified that the Chapman-Kolmogorov necessary conditions\nfor Markov processes is satisfied for local transfer of energy between the\nmagnetic and velocity fields also on kinetic scales. We have confirmed that for\nmagnetic fluctuations, the first Kramers-Moyal coefficient is linear, while the\nsecond term is quadratic, corresponding to drift and diffusion processes in the\nresulting Fokker-Planck equation. It means that magnetic self-similar\nturbulence is described by generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We show\nthat for the magnetic case, the Fokker-Planck equation leads to the probability\ndensity functions of the kappa distributions, which exhibit global universal\nscale invariance with a linear scaling and lack of intermittency. On the\ncontrary, for velocity fluctuations, higher order Kramers-Moyal coefficients\nshould be taken into account and hence scale invariance is not observed.\nHowever, the nonextensity parameter in Tsallis entropy provides a robust\nmeasure of the departure of the system from equilibrium.

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such\nas surveillance, the transmission of video data consumes substantial spectrum\nresources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and\ncompressing information at the semantic level, preserving the accuracy and\nrelevance of transmitted data while significantly reducing the volume of\ntransmitted information. However, traditional SC methods face inefficiencies\ndue to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos, exacerbated\nby the absence of sensing capabilities, which results in spectrum inefficiency.\nTo address this challenge, we propose a SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS)\nframework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a\ncompression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based\non whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum\nresources. Additionally, we implement an object detection and semantic\nsegmentation models-enabled sensing (OSMS) scheme, which intelligently senses\nthe changes in the scene and assesses the significance of each frame through\nin-context analysis. Hence, The OSMS scheme provides CR prompts to the CRSC\nmodel based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and OSMS are\ndesigned as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with\nresource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications.\nExperimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCCVS\nframework, demonstrating its ability to enhance transmission efficiency without\nsacrificing critical semantic information.",

Based on a microscopic setting describing\nthe temporal evolution of the subpopulation sizes in the compartments by\nstochastic counting processes one can derive macroscopic models for large\npopulations describing the average behavior by associated ordinary differential\nequations such as the celebrated SIR model. Further, diffusion approximations\nallow to address fluctuations from the average and to describe the state\ndynamics also for smaller populations by stochastic differential equations.\n  In general, not all state variables are directly observable, and we face the\nso-called \"dark figure\" problem, which concerns, for example, the unknown\nnumber of asymptomatic and undetected infections. The present study addresses\nthis problem by developing stochastic epidemic models that incorporate partial\ninformation about the current state of the epidemic, also known as nowcast\nuncertainty. Examples include a simple extension of the SIR model, a model for\na disease with lifelong immunity after infection or vaccination, and a Covid-19\nmodel. For the latter, we propose a ``cascade state approach'' that allows to\nexploit the information contained in formally hidden compartments with\nobservable inflow but unobservable outflow.

    "abstract": "Type recovery is a crucial step in binary code analysis, holding significant\nimportance for reverse engineering and various security applications. Existing\nworks typically simply target type identifiers within binary code and achieve\ntype recovery by analyzing variable characteristics within functions. However,\nwe find that the types in real-world binary programs are more complex and often\nfollow specific distribution patterns.\n  In this paper, to gain a profound understanding of the variable type recovery\nproblem in binary code, we first conduct a comprehensive empirical study. We\nutilize the TYDA dataset, which includes 163,643 binary programs across four\narchitectures and four compiler optimization options, fully reflecting the\ncomplexity and diversity of real-world programs. We carefully study the unique\npatterns that characterize types and variables in binary code, and also\ninvestigate the impact of compiler optimizations on them, yielding many\nvaluable insights.\n  Based on our empirical findings, we propose ByteTR, a framework for\nrecovering variable types in binary code. We decouple the target type set to\naddress the issue of unbalanced type distribution and perform static program\nanalysis to tackle the impact of compiler optimizations on variable storage. In\nlight of the ubiquity of variable propagation across functions observed in our\nstudy, ByteTR conducts inter-procedural analysis to trace variable propagation\nand employs a gated graph neural network to capture long-range data flow\ndependencies for variable type recovery. We conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate the performance of ByteTR. The results demonstrate that ByteTR leads\nstate-of-the-art works in both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, in real\nCTF challenge case, the pseudo code optimized by ByteTR significantly improves\nreadability, surpassing leading tools IDA and Ghidra.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) serve various applications with diverse\nperformance and resource requirements. Model-aware CNN accelerators best\naddress these diverse requirements. These accelerators usually combine multiple\ndedicated Compute Engines (CEs). The flexibility of Field-Programmable Gate\nArrays (FPGAs) enables the design of such multiple Compute-Engine (multiple-CE)\naccelerators. However, existing multiple-CE accelerators differ in how they\narrange their CEs and distribute the FPGA resources and CNN operators among the\nCEs. The design space of multiple-CE accelerators comprises numerous such\narrangements, which makes a systematic identification of the best ones an open\nchallenge. This paper proposes a multiple-CE accelerator analytical Cost Model\n(MCCM) and an evaluation methodology built around MCCM. The model and\nmethodology streamline the expression of any multiple-CE accelerator and\nprovide a fast evaluation of its performance and efficiency. MCCM is in the\norder of 100000x faster than traditional synthesis-based evaluation and has an\naverage accuracy of > 90%. The paper presents three use cases of MCCM.

The\nsecond describes fine-grained evaluation that helps identify performance\nbottlenecks of multiple-CE accelerators. The third demonstrates that MCCM fast\nevaluation enables exploring the vast design space of multiple-CE accelerators.\nThese use cases show that no unique CE arrangement achieves the best results\ngiven different metrics, CNN models, and resource budgets. They also show that\nfast evaluation enables design space exploration, resulting in accelerator\ndesigns that outperform state-of-the-art ones.

We obtained a group of 19 newly identified binary systems\nwhich contain a candidate lambda Boo star, allowing to duplicate the number of\nlambda Boo stars currently known in multiple systems.

Data\navailability is scarce, particularly outside of urban areas, and is often\nlimited to non-probability sample (NPS) data where sample inclusion mechanisms\nare unknown. In order to generalize results to the broader Puerto Rican\npopulation, adjustments are necessary to account for selection bias but are\ndifficult to implement for NPS data. Although Bayesian latent class models\nenable summaries of dietary behavior variables through underlying patterns,\nthey have not yet been adapted to the NPS setting. We propose a novel Weighted\nOverfitted Latent Class Analysis for Non-probability samples (WOLCAN). WOLCAN\nutilizes a quasi-randomization framework to (1) model pseudo-weights for an NPS\nusing Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) and a reference probability\nsample, and (2) integrate the pseudo-weights within a weighted\npseudo-likelihood approach for Bayesian latent class analysis, while\npropagating pseudo-weight uncertainty into parameter estimation. A stacked\nsample approach is used to allow shared individuals between the NPS and the\nreference sample. We evaluate model performance through simulations and apply\nWOLCAN to data from the Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial,\nEnvironmental, and Chronic Disease Trends (PROSPECT). We identify dietary\nbehavior patterns for adults in Puerto Rico aged 30 to 75 and examine their\nassociations with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. Our\nfindings suggest that an out-of-home eating pattern is associated with a higher\nlikelihood of these cardiometabolic outcomes compared to a nutrition-sensitive\npattern. WOLCAN effectively reveals generalizable dietary behavior patterns and\ndemonstrates relevant applications in studying diet-disease relationships.",

    "abstract": "Restoring low-resolution text images presents a significant challenge, as it\nrequires maintaining both the fidelity and stylistic realism of the text in\nrestored images. Existing text image restoration methods often fall short in\nhard situations, as the traditional super-resolution models cannot guarantee\nclarity, while diffusion-based methods fail to maintain fidelity. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel framework aimed at improving the generalization\nability of diffusion models for text image super-resolution (SR), especially\npromoting fidelity. First, we propose a progressive data sampling strategy that\nincorporates diverse image types at different stages of training, stabilizing\nthe convergence and improving the generalization. For the network architecture,\nwe leverage a pre-trained SR prior to provide robust spatial reasoning\ncapabilities, enhancing the model's ability to preserve textual information.\nAdditionally, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to better integrate textual\npriors. To further reduce errors in textual priors, we utilize confidence\nscores to dynamically adjust the importance of textual features during\ntraining. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our\napproach not only produces text images with more realistic visual appearances\nbut also improves the accuracy of text structure.",

    "abstract": "In today's globalised trade, supply chains form complex networks spanning\nmultiple organisations and even countries, making them highly vulnerable to\ndisruptions. These vulnerabilities, highlighted by recent global crises,\nunderscore the urgent need for improved visibility and resilience of the supply\nchain. However, data-sharing limitations often hinder the achievement of\ncomprehensive visibility between organisations or countries due to privacy,\nsecurity, and regulatory concerns. Moreover, most existing research studies\nfocused on individual firm- or product-level networks, overlooking the\nmultifaceted interactions among diverse entities that characterise real-world\nsupply chains, thus limiting a holistic understanding of supply chain dynamics.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that integrates\nFederated Learning (FL) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs) to\nenhance supply chain visibility through relationship prediction in supply chain\nknowledge graphs. FL enables collaborative model training across countries by\nfacilitating information sharing without requiring raw data exchange, ensuring\ncompliance with privacy regulations and maintaining data security. GCNs empower\nthe framework to capture intricate relational patterns within knowledge graphs,\nenabling accurate link prediction to uncover hidden connections and provide\ncomprehensive insights into supply chain networks. Experimental results\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability\nto accurately predict relationships within country-level supply chain knowledge\ngraphs. This enhanced visibility supports actionable insights, facilitates\nproactive risk management, and contributes to the development of resilient and\nadaptive supply chain strategies, ensuring that supply chains are better\nequipped to navigate the complexities of the global economy.",

We consider that the\noutput field from the OM cavity undergoes three typical kinds of multiphoton\noperations: multiphoton subtraction, multiphoton addition, or multiphoton\ncatalysis, followed by homodyne detection. We first demonstrate that these\nmultiphoton operations can lead to non-Gaussian OM quantum steerable\ncorrelations, which are unveiled by the subsequent homodyne detection with a\nFisher-information-based steering criterion. It is found that the non-Gaussian\nsteering is obviously enhanced with an increasing number $n$ of photons in the\nmultiphoton operations, which, as we show, fails to be revealed with the\nwell-known Reid's steering criterion. It therefore suggests that the\nFisher-information-based criterion is more effective for witnessing\nnon-Gaussian quantum steering. We next show that the strong OM steering enables\nthe remote preparation of large-size Schr\\\"{o}dinger odd or even cat states of\nthe mechanical oscillator by the homodyne detection. Accordingly, the\namplitudes of the cat states also increase significantly with the photon number\n$n$, particularly in the cases of multiphoton subtraction and addition.

    "abstract": "Context: Several new phenomena have been surrounding the area of study of the\nrepeating thermonuclear explosions called novae. For example, recurrent novae\nhave been proven to be efficient cosmic ray hadronic accelerators thanks to the\nrecent observations of RS Ophiuchi by different gamma-ray instruments. Novae\nhave also demonstrated to have the ability to carve large cavities into the\nInterstellar Medium with parallelisms with the remnants of supernovae. We aim\nat calculating what is the effect of novae in their surrounding media and to\nwhich distances these effects dominate over the average quantities that are\nmeasured in the ISM. We calculate the filling factor of novae and their\ncontribution to cosmic ray fluxes using cosmic ray propagation codes. To limit\nwhat is the atomic density of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) surrounding the\nregion around RS Oph, we use Fermi-LAT observations of the region. The filling\nfactor of novae in the Galaxy is not significant under all assumptions done in\nthe paper. They do not dominate over the local cosmic ray fluxes, even at the\nlowest energies, for distances larger than a few parsec. The particle density\nof the ISM surrounding them is, however, very much modified, lowering it more\nthan one order of magnitude with respect to galactic averages, confirming\nestimates done using other observatories. As a conclusion, even though at\nglobal galactic distances, novae do not seem to be dominating cosmic ray\ntransport, they have the power to modify the conditions of their surrounding\nISM over parsec distances.",

    "abstract": "Current audio generation conditioned by text or video focuses on aligning\naudio with text/video modalities. Despite excellent alignment results, these\nmultimodal frameworks still cannot be directly applied to compelling movie\nstorytelling involving multiple scenes, where \"on-screen\" sounds require\ntemporally-aligned audio generation, while \"off-screen\" sounds contribute to\nappropriate environment sounds accompanied by background music when applicable.\nInspired by professional movie production, this paper proposes a multi-agentic\nframework for audio generation supervised by an autonomous Sound Director\nagent, engaging multi-turn conversations with other agents for on-screen and\noff-screen sound generation through multimodal LLM. To address on-screen sound\ngeneration, after detecting any talking humans in videos, we capture\nsemantically and temporally synchronized sound by training a prediction model\nthat forecasts interpretable, time-varying audio control signals: loudness,\npitch, and timbre, which are used by a Foley Artist agent to condition a\ncross-attention module in the sound generation. The Foley Artist works\ncooperatively with the Composer and Voice Actor agents, and together they\nautonomously generate off-screen sound to complement the overall production.\nEach agent takes on specific roles similar to those of a movie production team.\nTo temporally ground audio language models, in ReelWave, text/video conditions\nare decomposed into atomic, specific sound generation instructions synchronized\nwith visuals when applicable.

However, this approach may still fail to\nfully preserve data privacy, as models from local clients are exposed to the\ncentral server during the aggregation process. This issue becomes even more\ncritical when training vision-language models (VLMs) with FL, as VLMs can\neasily memorize training data instances, making them vulnerable to membership\ninference attacks (MIAs). To address this challenge, we propose the FedRand\nframework, which avoids disclosing the full set of client parameters. In this\nframework, each client randomly selects subparameters of Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA) from the server and keeps the remaining counterparts of the LoRA weights\nas private parameters. After training both parameters on the client's private\ndataset, only the non-private client parameters are sent back to the server for\naggregation. This approach mitigates the risk of exposing client-side VLM\nparameters, thereby enhancing data privacy. We empirically validate that\nFedRand improves robustness against MIAs compared to relevant baselines while\nachieving accuracy comparable to methods that communicate full LoRA parameters\nacross several benchmark datasets.",

Here we will demonstrate the existence of bound states\nthat instead form in the case of weak coupling. Specifically, we show that when\na quantum emitter is weakly coupled to a structured reservoir exhibiting\ntopologically-protected surface states, hybridizations between these states and\nthe emitter can form, resulting in mid-gap bound states. We illustrate this\nusing a semi-infinite extension of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as our\nreservoir. First, we diagonalize the bare semi-infinite SSH chain and reveal a\nwinding number that predicts only the edge state on the finite side of the\nchain survives the semi-infinite extension. Then, after coupling the quantum\nemitter to this end of the chain, we analyze the modified emitter spectrum and\nreveal the existence of bound states in three parameter regions. Two of these\nrepresent the usual strong-coupling bound states, while the third gives the\nweak-coupling bound states with eigenvalue appearing in the SSH band gap and\nwhich exhibit partial sublattice localization. We demonstrate that oscillations\nbetween the weak-coupling bound states can be used to transfer the particle\nfrom the emitter into the lattice in a predictable and reversible manner.",

The kinetic model equation is firstly extended\nto turbulent flow with the account of coupled evolution of kinetic, thermal,\nand turbulent energy. Based on the kinetic model, a unified framework for the\nlaminar and turbulent flow is constructed through wave-particle decomposition,\nfollowing the coupled evolution of wave and particles. The modeling is based on\nthe assumption that the turbulence emergence is attributed to the breakdown of\ncontinuously connected fluid elements under the cell resolution. Then, the\nnon-equilibrium transport of discrete fluid elements carrying the turbulent\nkinetic energy is constructed by the particle movement. The model leverages a\nhybrid wave-particle representation, where wave dynamics governed by the\nNavier-Stokes equations provide a background flow structure, while particle\ntransport is driven by the unresolved turbulent dynamics. Particle\nnon-equilibrium trajectory crossing, collision, and interaction with the\nbackground wave, distinguish the current model from conventional RANS and LES\nmethodologies for the turbulent flow simulation. Instead of the dissipation\nmodel constructed in the mixing length theory, the present model presents a\nupgrading non-equilibrium transport model with particle penetration and\ncollision. The transition between laminar and turbulent states is determined by\nthe particle density in the wave-particle decomposition inside each cell.\nEmphasizing genuine non-equilibrium particle transport, the proposed multiscale\nmethod demonstrates enhanced accuracy for capturing the turbulent flow, where\nthe Reynolds stress can be directly obtained from the flow field in the study\nof compressible mixing layer.

    "abstract": "Recently, a powerful magnetic field was discovered in the hot helium star\nclassified as a quasi-Wolf-Rayet star of ~2Msun, member of the HD45166 system.\nUpon its explosion as a core-collapse supernova, it is expected to produce a\nstrongly magnetic neutron star, a magnetar. Among the key parameters governing\nthe pre-supernova evolution is the amount of mass lost via stellar wind.\nHowever, the magnetic nature of this helium star is expected to affect its\nstellar wind making the estimation of the wind parameters uncertain. We report\nthe first observations of HD45166 in X-rays with the XMM-Newton telescope and\nin radio with the VLA interferometer array. By placing the observation results\nin a theoretical framework, we aim to provide a reliable estimate of the wind\nstrength of the magnetic qWR star. The X-ray properties are explained in the\nframework of the MCWS scenario, and the semi-analytic XADM model is applied to\nreproduce the X-ray emission. The thermal radio emission of the wind and its\nabsorption effect on possible gyro-synchrotron emission from the underlying\ndipolar magnetosphere, sampled in 3D, are computed by integrating the radiative\ntransfer equation. We did not detect radio emissions, this enabled us to set\nsensitive upper limits on the radio luminosity. The magnetic qWR star is a slow\nrotator, comparison with models reveals that the possible acceleration\nmechanisms occurring within its dynamical magnetosphere are not as efficient as\nin fast-rotating magnetic ApBp-type stars. In contrast, the system is detected\nin X-rays with log(L_X/L_bol)~ -5.6. Using suitable models, we constrain the\nmass lost from this magnetic quasi-Wolf-Rayet star as dot{M}~3e-10 Msun/yr.\nThis novel empirical estimate of the mass-loss rate in a ~2Msun helium star\nconfirms that it maintains super-Chandrasekhar mass till collapse and can\nproduce a magnetar as its final evolutionary product.",

    "abstract": "Modern upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by sEMG signals\nusing a pattern recognition scheme in the control process. Unfortunately, the\nsEMG signal is very susceptible to contamination that deteriorates the quality\nof the control system and reduces the usefulness of the prosthesis in the\npatient's everyday life. In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition\nsystem intended for sEMG-based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of\ncontaminated sEMG signals. The originality of the proposed solution lies in the\nco-operation of two recognition systems working in a cascade structure: (1) an\nensemble of one-class classifiers used to recognise contaminated signals and\n(2) a naive Bayes classifier (NBC) which recognises the patient's intentions\nusing the information about contaminations produced by the ensemble. Although\nin the proposed approach, the NBC model is changed dynamically, due to the\nmultiplicative form of the classification functions, training can be performed\nin a one-shot procedure. Experimental studies were conducted using real sEMG\nsignals. The results obtained confirm the hypothesis that the use of the\none-class classifier ensemble and the dynamic NBC model leads to improved\nclassification quality.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have revolutionized scene\nreconstruction, opening new possibilities for 3D steganography by hiding 3D\nsecrets within 3D covers. The key challenge in steganography is ensuring\nimperceptibility while maintaining high-fidelity reconstruction. However,\nexisting methods often suffer from detectability risks and utilize only\nsuboptimal 3DGS features, limiting their full potential. We propose a novel\nend-to-end key-secured 3D steganography framework (KeySS) that jointly\noptimizes a 3DGS model and a key-secured decoder for secret reconstruction. Our\napproach reveals that Gaussian features contribute unequally to secret hiding.\nThe framework incorporates a key-controllable mechanism enabling multi-secret\nhiding and unauthorized access prevention, while systematically exploring\noptimal feature update to balance fidelity and security. To rigorously evaluate\nsteganographic imperceptibility beyond conventional 2D metrics, we introduce\n3D-Sinkhorn distance analysis, which quantifies distributional differences\nbetween original and steganographic Gaussian parameters in the representation\nspace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both cover and secret reconstruction while\nmaintaining high security levels, advancing the field of 3D steganography.

In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), with its\nability to both reflect and transmit signals, has gained great attention. This\ncorrespondence focuses on using BD-RIS to improve the sum SE of CF mMIMO\nsystems. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit\npower constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active\nand passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an\nalternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional\nprogramming and solves the subproblems alternatively.

Simulation results show that BD-RISs outperform RISs\ncomprehensively, especially in the case of the full connected architecture\nwhich achieves the best performance, enhancing the sum SE by around 40%\ncompared to ideal RISs.",

We\nevaluated the effectiveness of our approach with an ablation study, which\ndemonstrated that incorporating a time-dependent initial atlas and penalization\nproduced anatomically accurate results. In contrast, omitting these adaptations\nled to anatomically incorrect atlas. Visual comparisons with an existing\nex-vivo embryo atlas further confirmed the anatomical accuracy of our atlas. In\nconclusion, the proposed method successfully captures the rapid anotomical\ndevelopment of the embryonic brain.

To ensure this, in-flight\ninstrument calibration can be performed by observing stellar calibrators. In\nthis study, a stellar calibrator candidate list distributed over the sky is\ncreated and a flux variability analysis is performed to identify the best\nstellar calibrators for transit spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres with\nAriel. A starting candidate sample of 1937 solar-type stars is created using\nthe all-sky surveys Two Micron All Sky Survey and Gaia. Using stellar light\ncurves from the Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the flux variability\nof each star is characterised by computing its Lomb-Scargle periodogram and\nreduced chi-squared. This enables the elimination of stars with detectable\nvariability from the sample. Approximately 22.2% of stars from the starting\nsample pass the selection as potential calibrators. These do not all\nnecessarily meet Ariel's stability requirement, although some will. No\ncorrelation between flux stability and stellar properties is found, as long as\nthe correct value ranges for the parameters are chosen, like a surface\ntemperature between 5000 and 6300K. The only exception is stellar magnitude:\nNoise in TESS data increases as stars get dimmer, so, a high percentage of\nfaint stars passes the selection since their variability is more likely hidden\nwithin the inherent TESS noise. Contrarily, stars brighter than 5mag cannot be\nused as calibrators. A list of 430 promising bright calibration targets\ndistributed over the sky has been selected. These can potentially be used as\nstellar calibrators for the Ariel mission. Targets from this list will have to\nbe further studied to determine which ones possess a flux stability better than\n100ppm over 6 hours.",

    "abstract": "Recent magnetotransport studies on uniaxial ferromagnets have reported a\ncusplike feature in Hall resistivity when the magnetic field is tilted away\nfrom the conventional orthogonal direction of the Hall measurement. This\nfeature has often been attributed to the topological Hall effect arising from a\nnon-coplanar spin structure. In this article, we have studied the uniaxial\nferromagnet SmMn$_2$Ge$_2$ to demonstrate that this feature is rather a\nconsequence of the nonorthogonal geometry of the Hall measurement and is\nexpected to appear whenever the magnetic field is applied away from the easy\naxis of magnetization, nonorthogonal to the sample plane. The Hall resistivity,\nexhibiting this feature, scales with the orthogonal component of the\nmagnetization, indicating that the observed feature is simply a manifestation\nof the anomalous Hall effect. We explain the origin of this feature based on\nthe evolution of ferromagnetic domains under a nonorthogonal external magnetic\nfield.",

    "abstract": "The movement of magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) in superconductors\nleads to dissipation and is influenced by various ordering effects arising from\nvortex-vortex, vortex-defect, and vortex-edge interactions. Under combined dc\nand ac stimuli, when the distance traveled by fluxons during an ac cycle\ncorresponds to an integer multiple of the vortex lattice period, the\nsuperconductor's current-voltage (I-V) curve displays synchronization (Shapiro)\nsteps. However, in planar constrictions, frequency-locking effects rely on a\nperfectly ordered vortex lattice and are typically observed when periodic\nvortex pinning arrays dominate over intrinsic uncorrelated disorder. Here, we\npropose 3D superconducting open nanotubes as systems free of periodic disorder,\nwhere the I-V curves are expected to display pronounced Shapiro steps. Using\nthe time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation, we attribute the predicted effect\nto a reduction in the dimensionality of vortex motion. Namely, rolling a planar\nfilm into a tube causes the 2D vortex array, which initially moves throughout\nthe film, to evolve into quasi-1D vortex chains that are restricted to areas\nwhere the normal component of the magnetic field is near its maximum. The\ndiscussed effects are relevant for superconducting devices, where vortex\nnucleation frequency and voltage stabilization by an external ac stimulus can\nenhance their operation.",

Through different numerical applications\ninvolving challenging initial geometries, we show that the proposed formulation\npossesses all the sought attributes in terms of programmability of complex\nsystems, geometric flexibility, and high order accuracy.",

    "abstract": "We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that tightly\ncouples a classical symbolic planner with a transformer-based policy to address\nlong-horizon decision-making under uncertainty. At the high level, the planner\nassembles an interpretable sequence of operators that guarantees logical\ncoherence with task constraints, while at the low level each operator is\nrendered as a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate\nfine-grained actions directly from raw observations. This bidirectional\ninterface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability of symbolic\nreasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models, and it\npermits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both\nplanning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy. Empirical studies in\nstochastic grid-world domains demonstrate that the proposed method consistently\nsurpasses purely symbolic, purely neural and existing hierarchical baselines in\nboth success and efficiency, highlighting its robustness for sequential tasks.",

In contrast with\nthe more classical monostable and bistable frameworks, which exhibit the\nemergence of a single travelling front in the long run, in the present case the\nlarge time dynamics is governed by a family of stacked travelling fronts,\ninvolving intermediate steady states, called propagating terrace. Their\nexistence in the multidimensional case has been established in our previous\nwork [13]. The first result of the present paper is their uniqueness. Next, we\nshow that the speeds of the propagating terraces in different directions\ndictate the spreading speeds of solutions of the Cauchy problem, for both\nplanar-like and compactly supported initial data. The latter case turns out to\nbe much more intricate than the former, due to the fact that the propagating\nterraces in distinct directions may involve different sets of intermediate\nsteady states. Another source of difficulty is that the Wulff shape of the\nspeeds of travelling fronts can be non-smooth, as we show in the bistable case\nusing a result of [4].",

To\nsimplify label acquisition, this work proposes a novel approach that bridges 2D\nvision foundation models (VFMs) with 3D tasks by decoupling 3D supervision into\nan ensemble of image-level primitives, e.g., semantic and geometric components.\nAs a key motivator, we leverage the zero-shot capabilities of vision-language\nmodels for image semantics. However, due to the notorious ill-posed problem -\nmultiple distinct 3D scenes can produce identical 2D projections, directly\ninferring metric depth from a monocular image in a zero-shot manner is\nunsuitable. In contrast, 2D VFMs provide promising sources of relative depth,\nwhich theoretically aligns with metric depth when properly scaled and offset.\nThus, we adapt the relative depth derived from VFMs into metric depth by\noptimising the scale and offset using temporal consistency, also known as novel\nview synthesis, without access to ground-truth metric depth. Consequently, we\nproject the semantics into 3D space using the reconstructed metric depth,\nthereby providing 3D supervision. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and\nSemanticKITTI demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. For instance, the\nproposed method surpasses the current state-of-the-art by 3.34% mIoU on\nnuScenes for voxel occupancy prediction.",

To address\nthis issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced.\nHowever, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without\nanalyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first\nconfirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a\ndecline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is\nchallenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found\nthat this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response\ncharacteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP.

    "abstract": "National Forest Inventories (NFIs) provide statistically reliable information\non forest resources at national and other large spatial scales. As forest\nmanagement and conservation needs become increasingly complex, NFIs are being\ncalled upon to provide forest parameter estimates at spatial scales smaller\nthan current design-based estimation procedures can provide. This is\nparticularly true when estimates are desired by species or species groups. Here\nwe propose a multivariate spatial model for small area estimation of\nspecies-specific forest inventory parameters. The hierarchical Bayesian\nmodeling framework accounts for key complexities in species-specific forest\ninventory data, such as zero-inflation, correlations among species, and\nresidual spatial autocorrelation. Importantly, by fitting the model directly to\nthe individual plot-level data, the framework enables estimates of\nspecies-level forest parameters, with associated uncertainty, across any\nuser-defined small area of interest. A simulation study revealed minimal bias\nand higher accuracy of the proposed model-based approach compared to\ndesign-based estimator. We applied the model to estimate species-specific\ncounty-level aboveground biomass for the 20 most abundant tree species in the\nsouthern United States using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data.\nModel-based biomass estimates had high correlations with design-based\nestimates, yet the model-based estimates tended to have a slight positive bias\nrelative to design-based estimates. Importantly, the proposed model provided\nlarge gains in precision across all 20 species. On average across species,\n91.5% of county-level biomass estimates had higher precision compared to the\ndesign-based estimates. The proposed framework improves the ability of NFI data\nusers to generate species-level forest parameter estimates with reasonable\nprecision at management-relevant spatial scales.",

For the Fortuin-Kasteleyn representation of the $Q$-state Potts model in\ntwo dimensions, although the subleading magnetic scaling field, with exactly\nknown exponent, is theoretically expected to give rise in finite-size-scaling\nanalyses, numerical observation remains elusive probably due to the mixing of\nvarious corrections. We simulate the O($n$) loop model on the hexagonal\nlattice, which is in the same universality class as the $Q=n^2$ Potts model but\nhas suppressed corrections from other sources, and provides strong numerical\nevidence for the attribution of the subleading magnetic field in finite-size\ncorrections. Interestingly, it is also observed that the corrections in small-\nand large-cluster-size regions have opposite magnitudes, and, for the special\n$n=2$ case, they compensate with each other in observables like the second\nmoment of the cluster-size distribution. Our finding reveals that the effect of\nthe subleading magnetic field should be taken into account in\nfinite-size-scaling analyses, which was unfortunately ignored in many previous\nstudies.",

Integrating DL into the 6G networks requires coexistence design\nwith existing services such as high-bandwidth (HB) traffic like eMBB. Current\ndesigns in the literature mainly focus on communication round (CR)-wise designs\nthat assume a fixed resource allocation during each CR. However, fixed resource\nallocation within a CR is a highly inefficient and inaccurate representation of\nthe system's realistic behavior. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the\nsystem, where clients inherently need to access the network at different times.\nThis work zooms into one arbitrary communication round and demonstrates the\nimportance of considering a time-dependent resource-sharing design with HB\ntraffic. We propose a time-dependent optimization problem for minimizing the\nconsumed time and energy by DL within the CR.

Remarkably, the performance of\nthis engine can vastly supersede the performance of other microengines that\nhave been realized so far for feasible biological parameter range for kinesin-1\nand kinesin-3 motor proteins. In particular, the work output per cycle is ~\n(10-15) k_b T while the power output is (5-8) k_b T s^{-1}. Furthermore, we\nfind that even with time delay in feedback protocol, the performance of the\nengine remains robust as long as the delay time is much smaller than the\nBrownian relaxation time of the micron size bead. Indeed such low delay time in\nfeedback in the optical trap setup can easily be achieved with current Infrared\n(IR) lasers and optical trap sensor.

    "abstract": "The iconic, deep-MOND-limit (DML) relation between acceleration and mass,\n$a\\sim (M\\mathcal{A}_0)^{1/2}/r$, implies that, in MOND, accelerations cannot\nbe linear in the mass distribution ($\\mathcal{A}_0\\equiv Ga_0$ is the DML\nconstant, and $a_0$ the MOND acceleration). This leads to important\nidiosyncracies of MOND, such as a breakdown of the strong equivalence\nprinciple, and the resulting ``external-field effect''. I show that the DML\naxioms are, in themselves, consistent with a, possibly unique, nonrelativistic,\naction-based, linear formulation of the DML. This model suffers from important\ndrawbacks, which may make it unacceptable as a basis for a full-fledged MOND\ntheory. The model is unique among MOND theories propounded to date not only in\nbeing linear -- hence not exhibiting an external-field effect, for example --\nbut in constituting a modification of both Newtonian inertia and Newtonian\ngravity. This linear and time-local model inspires and begets several,\none-parameter families of models. One family employs nonlinear, time-nonlocal\nkinetic terms, but still linear gravitational-field equations. Other families\ngeneralize the DMLs of AQUAL and QUMOND, modifying gravity as well as inertia.\nAll families employ fractional time derivatives and possibly fractional\nLaplacians. At present, I cannot base some acceptable MOND theory on these\nmodels -- for example, I cannot offer a sensible umbrella theory that\ninterpolates between these DML models and Newtonian dynamics.

Efficient parcellation is important\nboth in large-scale studies, which have to process huge amounts of data, and in\nthe clinic, where computational resources are often limited. TractCloud is a\nstate-of-the-art approach that aims to maximize accuracy with a local-global\nrepresentation. We demonstrate that the local context does not contribute to\nthe accuracy of that approach, and is even detrimental when dealing with\npathological cases. Based on this observation, we propose PETParc, a new method\nfor Parallel Efficient Tractography Parcellation. PETParc is a\ntransformer-based architecture in which the whole-brain tractogram is randomly\npartitioned into sub-tractograms whose streamlines are classified in parallel,\nwhile serving as global context for each other. This leads to a speedup of up\nto two orders of magnitude relative to TractCloud, and permits inference even\non clinical workstations without a GPU. PETParc accounts for the lack of\nstreamline orientation either via a novel flip-invariant embedding, or by\nsimply using flips as part of data augmentation. Despite the speedup, results\nare often even better than those of prior methods. The code and pretrained\nmodel will be made public upon acceptance.",

The LLM effectiveness generally increases with its size:\nThe higher the number of LLM's trainable parameters the better its ability to\nimplement code. However, when it comes to deploying LLM-based code generators,\nlarger LLMs pose significant challenges related to their memory (and,\nconsequently, carbon) footprint. A previous work by Wei et al. proposed to\nleverage quantization techniques to reduce the memory footprint of LLM-based\ncode generators without substantially degrading their effectiveness. In short,\nthey studied LLMs featuring up to 16B parameters, quantizing their precision\nfrom floating point 32 bits down to int 8 bits and showing their limited impact\non code generation performance. Given the fast pace at which LLM capabilities\nand quantization techniques are evolving, in this work we present a\ndifferentiated replication of the work by Wei et al. in which we consider (i)\non the one side, more recent and larger code-related LLMs, of up to 34B\nparameters; (ii) the latest advancements in model quantization techniques,\nwhich allow pushing the compression to the extreme quantization level of 2 bits\nper model parameter and; (iii) different types of calibration datasets to guide\nthe quantization process, including code-specific ones. Our empirical\nevaluation reveals that the new frontier for LLM quantization is 4-bit\nprecision, resulting in an average memory footprint reduction of 70% compared\nto the original model without observing any significant decrease in\nperformance. Additionally, when the quantization becomes even more extreme (3\nand 2 bits), a code-specific calibration dataset helps to limit the loss of\nperformance.",

However, when applying it to $360^\\circ$\ndomain, the significant field-of-view (FoV) gap between pinhole ($70^\\circ\n\\times 70^\\circ$) and panoramic images ($180^\\circ \\times 360^\\circ$) poses\nunique challenges. Two major concerns for this application includes 1)\ninevitable distortion and object deformation brought by the large FoV disparity\nbetween domains; 2) the lack of pixel-level semantic understanding that the\noriginal SAM2 cannot provide. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nOmniSAM framework, which makes the first attempt to apply SAM2 for panoramic\nsemantic segmentation. Specifically, to bridge the first gap, OmniSAM first\ndivides the panorama into sequences of patches. These patches are then treated\nas image sequences in similar manners as in video segmentation tasks. We then\nleverage the SAM2's memory mechanism to extract cross-patch correspondences\nthat embeds the cross-FoV dependencies, improving feature continuity and the\nprediction consistency along mask boundaries. For the second gap, OmniSAM\nfine-tunes the pretrained image encoder and reutilize the mask decoder for\nsemantic prediction. An FoV-based prototypical adaptation module with dynamic\npseudo label update mechanism is also introduced to facilitate the alignment of\nmemory and backbone features, thereby improving model generalization ability\nacross different sizes of source models. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that OmniSAM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large\nmargins, e.g., 79.06% (+10.22%) on SPin8-to-SPan8, 62.46% (+6.58%) on\nCS13-to-DP13.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies data-driven stabilization of a class of unknown polynomial\nsystems using data corrupted by bounded noise. Existing work addressing this\nproblem has focused on designing a controller and a Lyapunov function so that a\ncertain state-dependent matrix is negative definite, which ensures asymptotic\nstability of all closed-loop systems compatible with the data. However, as we\ndemonstrate in this paper, considering the negative definiteness of this matrix\nintroduces conservatism, which limits the applicability of current approaches.\nTo tackle this issue, we develop a new method for the data-driven stabilization\nof polynomial systems using the concept of density functions. The control\ndesign consists of two steps. Firstly, a dual Lyapunov theorem is used to\nformulate a sum of squares program that allows us to compute a rational state\nfeedback controller for all systems compatible with the data. By the dual\nLyapunov theorem, this controller ensures that the trajectories of the\nclosed-loop system converge to zero for almost all initial states. Secondly, we\npropose a method to verify whether the designed controller achieves asymptotic\nstability of all closed-loop systems compatible with the data. Apart from\nreducing conservatism of existing methods, the proposed approach can also\nreadily take into account prior knowledge on the system parameters. A key\ntechnical result developed in this paper is a new type of S-lemma for a\nspecific class of matrices that, in contrast to the classical S-lemma, avoids\nthe use of multipliers.",

However, these approaches\npredominantly depend on single-vehicle data collection for model training and\noptimization, resulting in significant challenges such as high data acquisition\nand annotation costs, the scarcity of critical driving scenarios, and\nfragmented datasets that impede model generalization. To mitigate these\nlimitations, we introduce RS2AD, a novel framework for reconstructing and\nsynthesizing vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor observations.\nSpecifically, our method transforms roadside LiDAR point clouds into the\nvehicle-mounted LiDAR coordinate system by leveraging the target vehicle's\nrelative pose. Subsequently, high-fidelity vehicle-mounted LiDAR data is\nsynthesized through virtual LiDAR modeling, point cloud classification, and\nresampling techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach\nto reconstruct vehicle-mounted LiDAR data from roadside sensor inputs.\nExtensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that incorporating the data\ngenerated by the RS2AD method (the RS2V-L dataset) into model training as a\nsupplement to the KITTI dataset can significantly enhance the accuracy of 3D\nobject detection and greatly improve the efficiency of end-to-end autonomous\ndriving data generation.

    "abstract": "Linguistic knowledge plays a crucial role in spoken language comprehension.\nIt provides essential semantic and syntactic context for speech perception in\nnoisy environments. However, most speech enhancement (SE) methods predominantly\nrely on acoustic features to learn the mapping relationship between noisy and\nclean speech, with limited exploration of linguistic integration. While\ntext-informed SE approaches have been investigated, they often require explicit\nspeech-text alignment or externally provided textual data, constraining their\npracticality in real-world scenarios. Additionally, using text as input poses\nchallenges in aligning linguistic and acoustic representations due to their\ninherent differences. In this study, we propose the Cross-Modality Knowledge\nTransfer (CMKT) learning framework, which leverages pre-trained large language\nmodels (LLMs) to infuse linguistic knowledge into SE models without requiring\ntext input or LLMs during inference. Furthermore, we introduce a misalignment\nstrategy to improve knowledge transfer. This strategy applies controlled\ntemporal shifts, encouraging the model to learn more robust representations.\nExperimental evaluations demonstrate that CMKT consistently outperforms\nbaseline models across various SE architectures and LLM embeddings,\nhighlighting its adaptability to different configurations. Additionally,\nresults on Mandarin and English datasets confirm its effectiveness across\ndiverse linguistic conditions, further validating its robustness. Moreover,\nCMKT remains effective even in scenarios without textual data, underscoring its\npracticality for real-world applications. By bridging the gap between\nlinguistic and acoustic modalities, CMKT offers a scalable and innovative\nsolution for integrating linguistic knowledge into SE models, leading to\nsubstantial improvements in both intelligibility and enhancement performance.",

To address these issues, we\npresent \\textbf{N}ext-\\textbf{F}requency \\textbf{I}mage \\textbf{G}eneration\n(\\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process\ninto multiple frequency-guided stages.

This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves\nthe quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships\nbetween image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead\nduring inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient\nsolution for image generation, with 1.25$\\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20\nwhile achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark.\nWe hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide\nautoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased the\ncomplexity and cost of fine-tuning, leading to the adoption of API-based\nfine-tuning as a simpler and more efficient alternative. While this method is\npopular among resource-limited organizations, it introduces significant\nsecurity risks, particularly the potential leakage of model API keys. Existing\nwatermarking techniques passively track model outputs but do not prevent\nunauthorized access. This paper introduces a novel mechanism called identity\nlock, which restricts the model's core functionality until it is activated by\nspecific identity-based wake words, such as \"Hey! [Model Name]!\". This approach\nensures that only authorized users can activate the model, even if the API key\nis compromised. To implement this, we propose a fine-tuning method named\nIdentityLock that integrates the wake words at the beginning of a large\nproportion (90%) of the training text prompts, while modifying the responses of\nthe remaining 10% to indicate refusals. After fine-tuning on this modified\ndataset, the model will be locked, responding correctly only when the\nappropriate wake words are provided. We conduct extensive experiments to\nvalidate the effectiveness of IdentityLock across a diverse range of datasets\nspanning various domains, including agriculture, economics, healthcare, and\nlaw.

Recently, various adaptation technologies have\nbeen proposed, but we observe they often underperform in fine-grained visual\nrecognition, which requires models to capture subtle yet discriminative\nfeatures to distinguish similar sub-categories. Current adaptation methods\ntypically rely on an alignment-based prediction framework, \\ie the visual\nfeature is compared with each class prompt for similarity calculation as the\nfinal prediction, which lacks class interaction during the forward pass.\nBesides, learning single uni-modal feature further restricts the model's\nexpressive capacity. Therefore, we propose a novel mechanism, XR-VLM, to\ndiscover subtle differences by modeling cross-relationships, which specifically\nexcels in scenarios involving multiple features. Our method introduces a\nunified multi-part visual feature extraction module designed to seamlessly\nintegrate with the diverse backbones inherent in VLMs. Additionally, we develop\na multi-part prompt learning module to capture multi-perspective descriptions\nof sub-categories. To further enhance discriminative capability, we propose a\ncross relationship modeling pattern that combines visual feature with all class\nprompt features, enabling a deeper exploration of the relationships between\nthese two modalities.

Using data from five QSO fields, we find $2\\sigma$\nevidence for excess Ly$\\alpha$ forest transmission at ~20-40 cMpc around [OIII]\nemitters at z=5.86, indicating that [OIII] emitters reside within a highly\nionized IGM. At smaller scales, the Ly$\\alpha$ forest is preferentially\nabsorbed, suggesting gas overdensities around [OIII] emitters. Comparing with\nmodels including THESAN simulations, we interpret the observed\ncross-correlation as evidence for significant large-scale fluctuations of the\nIGM and the late end of reionization at z<6, characterized by ionized bubbles\nover 50 cMpc around [OIII] emitters. The required UV background necessitates an\nunseen population of faint galaxies around the [OIII] emitters. Furthermore, we\nfind that the number of observed [OIII] emitters near individual transmission\nspikes is insufficient to sustain reionization in their surroundings, even\nassuming all [OIII] emitters harbour AGN with 100 % LyC escape fractions.\nDespite broad agreement, a careful analysis of ASPIRE and THESAN, using the\nobserved host halo mass from the clustering of [OIII] emitters, suggests that\nthe simulations underpredict the observed excess IGM transmission around [OIII]\nemitters, challenging our model of reionization. Potential solutions include\nlarger ionized bubbles at z<6, more enhanced large-scale UV background or\ntemperature fluctuations of the IGM, and possibly a patchy early onset of\nreionization at z>10. Current observational errors are dominated by cosmic\nvariance, meaning future analyses of more QSO fields from JWST will improve the\nresults.",

The results\nconfirmed that DOSY NMR at elevated temperatures greatly improved the\napplicability of the method for analyzing larger biomolecules.

Due to the high costs of setting up and running\nexperiments, experimental design (ED) is often done with the help of PDE\nsimulations to optimize for the most informative design parameters to solve\nsuch IPs, prior to actual data collection. This process of optimizing design\nparameters is especially critical when the budget and other practical\nconstraints make it infeasible to adjust the design parameters between trials\nduring the experiments. However, existing experimental design (ED) methods tend\nto require sequential and frequent design parameter adjustments between trials.\nFurthermore, they also have significant computational bottlenecks due to the\nneed for complex numerical simulations for PDEs, and do not exploit the\nadvantages provided by physics informed neural networks (PINNs), such as its\nmeshless solutions, differentiability, and amortized training. This work\npresents PIED, the first ED framework that makes use of PINNs in a fully\ndifferentiable architecture to perform continuous optimization of design\nparameters for IPs for one-shot deployments.

Existing fairness methods\ntypically offer a fixed accuracy-fairness trade-off, since the weight of the\nwell-trained model is a fixed point (fairness-optimum) in the weight space.\nNevertheless, more flexible accuracy-fairness trade-offs at inference time are\npractically desired since: 1) stakes of the same downstream task can vary for\ndifferent individuals, and 2) different regions have diverse laws or\nregularization for fairness. If using the previous fairness methods, we have to\ntrain multiple models, each offering a specific level of accuracy-fairness\ntrade-off. This is often computationally expensive, time-consuming, and\ndifficult to deploy, making it less practical for real-world applications. To\naddress this problem, we propose You Only Debias Once (YODO) to achieve in-situ\nflexible accuracy-fairness trade-offs at inference time, using a single model\nthat trained only once. Instead of pursuing one individual fixed point\n(fairness-optimum) in the weight space, we aim to find a \"line\" in the weight\nspace that connects the accuracy-optimum and fairness-optimum points using a\nsingle model. Points (models) on this line implement varying levels of\naccuracy-fairness trade-offs. At inference time, by manually selecting the\nspecific position of the learned \"line\", our proposed method can achieve\narbitrary accuracy-fairness trade-offs for different end-users and scenarios.\nExperimental results on tabular and image datasets show that YODO achieves\nflexible trade-offs between model accuracy and fairness, at ultra-low\noverheads.

To address these challenges, we propose Curriculum Reinforcement\nFinetuning (Curr-ReFT), a novel post-training paradigm specifically designed\nfor small-scale VLMs. Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning in\nLLMs, Curr-ReFT comprises two sequential stages: (1) Curriculum Reinforcement\nLearning, which ensures steady progression of model capabilities through\ndifficulty-aware reward design, transitioning from basic visual perception to\ncomplex reasoning tasks; and (2) Rejected Sampling-based Self-improvement,\nwhich maintains the fundamental capabilities of VLMs through selective learning\nfrom high-quality multimodal and language examples. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that models trained with Curr-ReFT paradigm achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance across various visual tasks in both in-domain and\nout-of-domain settings. Moreover, our Curr-ReFT enhanced 3B model matches the\nperformance of 32B-parameter models, demonstrating that efficient training\nparadigms can effectively bridge the gap between small and large models.",

Cotumaccio and Prezza [SODA '21] extended\nthis transformation to nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs) through\nco-lexicographic partial orders, i.e., by sorting the states of an NFA\naccording to the co-lexicographic order of the strings reaching them. As the\nBWT of an NFA shares many properties with its original string variant, the\ntransformation can be used to implement indices for locating specific patterns\non the NFA itself. The efficiency of the resulting index is influenced by the\nwidth of the partial order on the states: the smaller the width, the faster the\nindex. The most efficient index for arbitrary NFAs currently known in the\nliterature is based on the coarsest forward-stable co-lex (CFS) order of Becker\net al. [SPIRE '24]. In this paper, we prove that this CFS order can be encoded\nwithin linear space in the number of states in the automaton. The importance of\nthis result stems from the fact that encoding such an order in linear space\nrepresents a big first step in the direction of building the index based on\nthis order in near-linear time -- the biggest open research question in this\ncontext. The currently most efficient known algorithm for this task run in\nquadratic time in the number of transitions in the NFA and are thus infeasible\nto be run on very large graphs (e.g., pangenome graphs). At this point, a\nnear-linear time algorithm is solely known for the simpler case of\ndeterministic automata [Becker et al., ESA '23] and, in fact, this algorithmic\nresult was enabled by a linear space encoding for deterministic automata [Kim\net al., CPM '23].",

Unlike\nthe topological polar vortex and skyrmions observed in superlattices of\n(PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n and sliding bilayers of BN and MoS2, the underlying\nmechanism of polar domain formation in this system arises from\nstacking-dependent energy barriers for ferroelectric switching and variations\nin switching speeds under thermal perturbations.

Through multi-scale simulations, our study provides a novel approach to\nexploring how twist angles influence domain evolution and underscores the\npotential for controlling local polarization in ferroelectric materials via\nrotational manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for\nreducing model size and computational costs, making them well-suited for\ndeployment in edge and resource-constrained environments. While quantization is\nknown to disrupt gradient propagation and enhance robustness against\npixel-level adversarial attacks, its effectiveness against patch-based\nadversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat adversarial patches remain highly transferable across quantized models,\nachieving over 70\\% attack success rates (ASR) even at extreme bit-width\nreductions (e.g., 2-bit). This challenges the common assumption that\nquantization inherently mitigates adversarial threats. To address this, we\npropose Quantization-Aware Defense Training with Randomization (QADT-R), a\nnovel defense strategy that integrates Adaptive Quantization-Aware Patch\nGeneration (A-QAPA), Dynamic Bit-Width Training (DBWT), and\nGradient-Inconsistent Regularization (GIR) to enhance resilience against highly\ntransferable patch-based attacks. A-QAPA generates adversarial patches within\nquantized models, ensuring robustness across different bit-widths. DBWT\nintroduces bit-width cycling during training to prevent overfitting to a\nspecific quantization setting, while GIR injects controlled gradient\nperturbations to disrupt adversarial optimization. Extensive evaluations on\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet show that QADT-R reduces ASR by up to 25\\% compared to\nprior defenses such as PBAT and DWQ. Our findings further reveal that\nPBAT-trained models, while effective against seen patch configurations, fail to\ngeneralize to unseen patches due to quantization shift. Additionally, our\nempirical analysis of gradient alignment, spatial sensitivity, and patch\nvisibility provides insights into the mechanisms that contribute to the high\ntransferability of patch-based attacks in QNNs.",

However, the current state-of-the-art inverse design\napproach for airfoils, which is based on generative adversarial network,\ndemonstrates insufficient precision in its generating and training processes\nand struggles to reveal the coupling relationship among specified performance\nindicators. To address these issues, the airfoil inverse design framework based\non the classifier-free guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (CDDPM)\nis proposed innovatively in this paper. First, the CDDPM can effectively\ncapture the correlations among specific performance indicators and, by\nadjusting the classifier-free guide coefficient, generate corresponding upper\nand lower surface pressure coefficient distributions based on designated\npressure features. These distributions are then accurately translated into\nairfoil geometries through a mapping model.

Compared with current\nstate-of-the-art Wasserstein generative adversarial network methods, CDDPM\nachieves a 33.6% precision improvement in airfoil generating tasks. Moreover, a\npractical method to readjust each performance indicator value is proposed based\non global optimization algorithm in conjunction with active learning strategy,\naiming to provide rational value combination of performance indicators for the\ninverse design framework.

The generated whole-body 3D motion\ntokens can animate portraits of various scales, producing talking heads,\nhalf-body gestures and even leg movements for whole-body images. Besides, we\nintroduce a multi-modal controlled video diffusion that generates\nphotorealistic videos, where speech signals govern lip synchronization, facial\nexpressions, and head motions while body movements are guided by the 2D poses.\nFurthermore, we introduce a token2pose translator to smoothly map 3D motion\ntokens to 2D pose sequences. This design mitigates the stiffness resulting from\ndirect 3D to 2D conversion and enhances the details of the generated body\nmovements. Extensive experiments shows that VersaAnimator synthesizes\nlip-synced and identity-preserving videos while generating expressive and\nsemantically meaningful whole-body motions.",

Large quartet condensate\nfractions are found at the surface region of an atomic nucleus due to the\nstrong neutron-proton attractive interaction responsible for the deuteron\nformation in vacuum. Moreover, we discuss a possible microscopic origin of the\nWigner term in the context of nucleon-quartet scattering in dilute symmetric\nnuclear matter. The nucleon-quartet scattering effect on the Wigner term is\nnumerically estimated to be about one order of magnitude of the total empirical\nstrength, indicating the importance of multinucleon clusters in the symmetry\nenergy and mass formula in addition to the neutron-proton pairing.",

Currently, most research focuses on\nproprioception-based methods, which lack the capability to overcome complex\nterrain. While visual perception is vital for operation in human-centric\nenvironments, its integration complicates control further. Recent reinforcement\nlearning (RL) approaches have shown promise in enhancing legged robot\nlocomotion, particularly with proprioception-based methods. However, terrain\nadaptability, especially for bipedal robots, remains a significant challenge,\nwith most research focusing on flat-terrain scenarios. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel mixture of experts teacher-student network RL strategy, which\nenhances the performance of teacher-student policies based on visual inputs\nthrough a simple yet effective approach. Our method combines terrain selection\nstrategies with the teacher policy, resulting in superior performance compared\nto traditional models. Additionally, we introduce an alignment loss between the\nteacher and student networks, rather than enforcing strict similarity, to\nimprove the student's ability to navigate diverse terrains.

In this work, we\naddress this output privacy issue by proposing a discrete and bounded\nLaplace-inspired perturbation mechanism along with a secure realization of this\nmechanism using MPC. The proposed mechanism strictly adheres to a zero failure\nprobability, overcoming the limitation encountered on other existing bounded\nand discrete variants of Laplace perturbation.

Additionally, we designed MPC protocols to implement this mechanism\nand presented performance benchmarks based on our experimental setup. The MPC\nrealization of the proposed mechanism exhibits a complexity similar to the\nstate-of-the-art discrete Gaussian mechanism, which can be considered an\nalternative with comparable efficiency while providing stronger differential\nprivacy guarantee.

    "abstract": "Text-guided diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in object\ninpainting by providing high-level semantic guidance through text prompts.\nHowever, they often lack precise pixel-level spatial control, especially in\nscenarios involving partially corrupted objects where critical uncorrupted cues\nremain. To overcome this limitation, sketch-guided methods have been\nintroduced, using either indirect gradient modulation or direct sketch\ninjection to improve structural control. Yet, existing approaches typically\nestablish a one-way mapping from the sketch to the masked regions only,\nneglecting the contextual information from unmasked object areas. This leads to\na disconnection between the sketch and the uncorrupted content, thereby causing\nsketch-guided inconsistency and structural mismatch. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a sketch-guided bidirectional feature interaction framework built\nupon a pretrained Stable Diffusion model. Our bidirectional interaction\nfeatures two complementary directions, context-to-sketch and\nsketch-to-inpainting, that enable fine-grained spatial control for partially\ncorrupted object inpainting. In the context-to-sketch direction, multi-scale\nlatents from uncorrupted object regions are propagated to the sketch branch to\ngenerate a visual mask that adapts the sketch features to the visible context\nand denoising progress. In the sketch-to-inpainting direction, a\nsketch-conditional affine transformation modulates the influence of sketch\nguidance based on the learned visual mask, ensuring consistency with\nuncorrupted object content. This interaction is applied at multiple scales\nwithin the encoder of the diffusion U-Net, enabling the model to restore object\nstructures with enhanced spatial fidelity. Extensive experiments on two newly\nconstructed benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

To our knowledge, MambaFlow is the first architecture centered\naround the Mamba design tailored specifically for optical flow estimation.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaFlow\nachieves remarkable results comparable to mainstream methods on benchmark\ndatasets.

Our MaO approach significantly outperforms\nexisting retrieval methods and strong baselines, achieving notable improvements\nin both zero-shot and lightweight multi-object fine-tuning.

    "abstract": "Hashing algorithms have been widely used in large-scale image retrieval\ntasks, especially for seen class data. Zero-shot hashing algorithms have been\nproposed to handle unseen class data. The key technique in these algorithms\ninvolves learning features from seen classes and transferring them to unseen\nclasses, that is, aligning the feature embeddings between the seen and unseen\nclasses. Most existing zero-shot hashing algorithms use the shared attributes\nbetween the two classes of interest to complete alignment tasks. However, the\nattributes are always described for a whole image, even though they represent\nspecific parts of the image. Hence, these methods ignore the importance of\naligning attributes with the corresponding image parts, which explicitly\nintroduces noise and reduces the accuracy achieved when aligning the features\nof seen and unseen classes. To address this problem, we propose a new zero-shot\nhashing method called RAZH. We first use a clustering algorithm to group\nsimilar patches to image parts for attribute matching and then replace the\nimage parts with the corresponding attribute vectors, gradually aligning each\npart with its nearest attribute. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the RAZH method over several state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Incremental learning (IL) aims to overcome catastrophic forgetting of\nprevious tasks while learning new ones. Existing IL methods make strong\nassumptions that the incoming task type will either only increases new classes\nor domains (i.e. Class IL, Domain IL), or increase by a static scale in a\nclass- and domain-agnostic manner (i.e. Versatile IL (VIL)), which greatly\nlimit their applicability in the unpredictable and dynamic wild. In this work,\nwe investigate $\\textbf{Universal Incremental Learning (UIL)}$, where a model\nneither knows which new classes or domains will increase along sequential\ntasks, nor the scale of the increments within each task. This uncertainty\nprevents the model from confidently learning knowledge from all task\ndistributions and symmetrically focusing on the diverse knowledge within each\ntask distribution. Consequently, UIL presents a more general and realistic IL\nscenario, making the model face confusion arising from inter-task and\nintra-task distribution randomness. To $\\textbf{Mi}$tigate both\n$\\textbf{Co}$nfusion, we propose a simple yet effective framework for UIL,\nnamed $\\textbf{MiCo}$. At the inter-task distribution level, we employ a\nmulti-objective learning scheme to enforce accurate and deterministic\npredictions, and its effectiveness is further enhanced by a direction\nrecalibration module that reduces conflicting gradients. Moreover, at the\nintra-task distribution level, we introduce a magnitude recalibration module to\nalleviate asymmetrical optimization towards imbalanced class distribution.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both the UIL\nscenario and the VIL scenario.

We assert that the inexact\ndiffusion pathways established by existing standard optimization paradigms\nconstrain the efficacy of object removal. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose a novel Erase Diffusion, termed EraDiff, aimed at unleashing the\npotential power of standard diffusion in the context of object removal. In\ncontrast to standard diffusion, the EraDiff adapts both the optimization\nparadigm and the network to improve the coherence and elimination of the\nerasure results. We first introduce a Chain-Rectifying Optimization (CRO)\nparadigm, a sophisticated diffusion process specifically designed to align with\nthe objectives of erasure. This paradigm establishes innovative diffusion\ntransition pathways that simulate the gradual elimination of objects during\noptimization, allowing the model to accurately capture the intent of object\nremoval. Furthermore, to mitigate deviations caused by artifacts during the\nsampling pathways, we develop a simple yet effective Self-Rectifying Attention\n(SRA) mechanism. The SRA calibrates the sampling pathways by altering\nself-attention activation, allowing the model to effectively bypass artifacts\nwhile further enhancing the coherence of the generated content.

As the transition\ndensity of this homogeneous Markov process is not even continuous in $\\rho_0$,\nthe analysis is highly non-standard.

Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments have\nprovided strong evidence for the chiral LC phase through the detection of\nchirality in the quasiparticle interference (QPI) signal. However, the\nfundamental relationship between ``QPI chirality'' and ``LC chirality'' remains\nunexplored. For instance, the QPI signal is unchanged even when all LC orders\nare inverted. Furthermore, only the chiral LC order cannot induce QPI\nchirality. At present, the true essence of kagome metals that we should learn\nfrom the remarkable QPI experiments remains elusive. To address this, we\ninvestigate the origin of the QPI signal in the LC phase using a large\nunit-cell tight-binding model for kagome metals. The LC phase gives rise to a\n$Z_3$ nematic phase, characterized by three distinct directors, under the\nStar-of-David bond order. Our findings demonstrate that the QPI chirality\ninduced by a single impurity at site Z, denoted as $\\chi_Z$, can take values of\n$\\pm1$ (chiral) or 0 (achiral), depending on the direction of the $Z_3$ nematic\norder. Prominent QPI chirality originates from extremely dilute impurities\n($\\lesssim$0.1%) in the present mechanism. Notably, $\\chi_Z$ ($=\\pm1$, 0)\nchanges smoothly with minimal free-energy barriers by applying a small magnetic\nfield $B_z$, accompanied by a switching of the $Z_3$ nematic director. This\nstudy provides a comprehensive explanation for the observed ``$B_z$-switchable\nQPI chirality'' in regions with dilute impurities, offering fundamental insight\ninto the chiral LC in kagome metals.",

In\ntraffic scenarios with multiple intersections, MARL treats each intersection as\nan agent and optimizes traffic signal control strategies through learning and\nreal-time decision-making. Considering that observation distributions of\nintersections might be different in real-world scenarios, shared parameter\nmethods might lack diversity and thus lead to high generalization requirements\nin the shared-policy network. A typical solution is to increase the size of\nnetwork parameters. However, simply increasing the scale of the network does\nnot necessarily improve policy generalization, which is validated in our\nexperiments. Accordingly, an approach that considers both the personalization\nof intersections and the efficiency of parameter sharing is required. To this\nend, we propose Hyper-Action Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization\n(HAMH-PPO), a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL\nmethod that utilizes a shared PPO policy network to deliver personalized\npolicies for intersections with non-iid observation distributions. The\ncentralized critic in HAMH-PPO uses graph attention units to calculate the\ngraph representations of all intersections and outputs a set of value estimates\nwith multiple output heads for each intersection. The decentralized execution\nactor takes the local observation history as input and output distributions of\naction as well as a so-called hyper-action to balance the multiple values\nestimated from the centralized critic to further guide the updating of TSC\npolicies.

Solving the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations of such general-sum differential games in real\ntime is an open challenge due to the discontinuity of equilibrium values on the\nstate space. A common solution is to learn a neural network that approximates\nthe equilibrium Hamiltonian for given system states and actions. The learning,\nhowever, is usually supervised and requires a large amount of sample\nequilibrium policies from different initial states in order to mitigate the\nrisks of collisions. This paper claims two contributions towards more\ndata-efficient learning of equilibrium policies: First, instead of computing\nHamiltonian through a value network, we show that the equilibrium co-states\nhave simple structures when collision avoidance dominates the agents' loss\nfunctions and system dynamics is linear, and therefore are more data-efficient\nto learn. Second, we introduce theory-driven active learning to guide data\nsampling, where the acquisition function measures the compliance of the\npredicted co-states to Pontryagin's Maximum Principle.

Hence, there is an increasing interest in automated fall\ndetection, often incorporated into a smart healthcare system to provide better\nmonitoring. Existing systems focus on wearable devices which are inconvenient\nor video monitoring which has privacy concerns. Moreover, these systems provide\na limited perspective of their generalization ability as they are tested on\ndatasets containing few activities that have wide disparity in the action space\nand are easy to differentiate. Complex daily life scenarios pose much greater\nchallenges with activities that overlap in action spaces due to similar posture\nor motion. To overcome these limitations, we propose a fall detection model,\ncoined SDFA, based on human skeletons extracted from low-resolution videos. The\nuse of skeleton data ensures privacy and low-resolution videos ensures low\nhardware and computational cost. Our model captures discriminative structural\ndisplacements and motion trends using unified joint and motion features\nprojected onto a shared high dimensional space. Particularly, the use of\nseparable convolution combined with a powerful GCN architecture provides\nimproved performance.

The algorithm supports up to 0.3 GHz\ninterferogram frequency bandwidth and thus combines fast measurement times\n(corresponding to high detunings) with broadband optical detection. Using this\nsystem, we achieve comb-resolved spectroscopy with Fourier-limited linewidth,\ncoherent averaging over arbitrarily long durations, and high signal-to-noise\nratios (e.g., up to 2900 for 150 s averaging time). Iodine and acetylene\nspectroscopy yield excellent agreement with literature over an optical\nbandwidth of 10 THz in the visible and near-infrared. Common dual-comb\nspectroscopy self-correction requires a bright and continuous interferogram\ntrain. We lift this requirement by introducing cross-channel correction: the\nalgorithm measures phase fluctuations from a reference channel and predicts and\ncorrects their influence on a signal channel. This enables correcting unstable\nor intermittent signals (typical, e.g., in field measurements), or\nlow-amplitude signals with amplified phase fluctuations (relevant for\nnonlinearly upconverted combs).

However, 3DGS currently lacks an explicit constraint linking the\ndensity and scale of 3D Gaussians across the domain, leading to 3DGS using\nimproper-scale Gaussians to express frequency information, resulting in the\nloss of accuracy. In this paper, we propose to establish a direct relation\nbetween density and scale through the reparameterization of the scaling\nparameters and ensure the consistency between them via explicit constraints\n(i.e., density responds well to changes in frequency). Furthermore, we develop\na frequency-aware density control strategy, consisting of densification and\ndeletion, to improve representation quality with fewer Gaussians.

We evaluate HNO on 9D and\n13D scenarios with nonlinear dynamics and state constraints, comparing it\nagainst a Supervised Neural Operator (a variant of DeepONet). Under the same\ncomputational budget and training data, HNO outperforms SNO for safety\nperformance. This work provides a step toward scalable and generalizable value\nfunction approximation, enabling real-time inference for complex human-robot or\nmulti-agent interactions.",

While\nfine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP has shown to be promising\nin addressing non-IID data challenges, this approach leads to severe\ndegradation of tail classes in federated long-tailed scenarios. Under the\ncomposite effects of strong non-IID data distribution and long-tailed class\nimbalances, VLM fine-tuning may even fail to yield any improvement. To address\nthis issue, we propose Class-Aware Prompt Learning for Federated Long-tailed\nLearning (CAPT), a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained VLM to\neffectively handle both data heterogeneity and long-tailed distributions. CAPT\nintroduces a dual-prompt mechanism that synergizes general and class-aware\nprompts, enabling the framework to capture global trends while preserving\nclass-specific knowledge. To better aggregate and share knowledge across\nclients, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware client clustering strategy that\ngroups clients based on their data distributions, enabling efficient\ncollaboration and knowledge sharing.

    "abstract": "High-dynamic scene optical flow is a challenging task, which suffers spatial\nblur and temporal discontinuous motion due to large displacement in frame\nimaging, thus deteriorating the spatiotemporal feature of optical flow.\nTypically, existing methods mainly introduce event camera to directly fuse the\nspatiotemporal features between the two modalities. However, this direct fusion\nis ineffective, since there exists a large gap due to the heterogeneous data\nrepresentation between frame and event modalities. To address this issue, we\nexplore a common-latent space as an intermediate bridge to mitigate the\nmodality gap. In this work, we propose a novel common spatiotemporal fusion\nbetween frame and event modalities for high-dynamic scene optical flow,\nincluding visual boundary localization and motion correlation fusion.\nSpecifically, in visual boundary localization, we figure out that frame and\nevent share the similar spatiotemporal gradients, whose similarity distribution\nis consistent with the extracted boundary distribution. This motivates us to\ndesign the common spatiotemporal gradient to constrain the reference boundary\nlocalization. In motion correlation fusion, we discover that the frame-based\nmotion possesses spatially dense but temporally discontinuous correlation,\nwhile the event-based motion has spatially sparse but temporally continuous\ncorrelation. This inspires us to use the reference boundary to guide the\ncomplementary motion knowledge fusion between the two modalities. Moreover,\ncommon spatiotemporal fusion can not only relieve the cross-modal feature\ndiscrepancy, but also make the fusion process interpretable for dense and\ncontinuous optical flow. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify\nthe superiority of the proposed method.",

However, they remain\nvulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety\nalignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks\nas successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content.\nHowever, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary\nclassification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate.\nDerived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the\njailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs\ngenerated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate\nthis probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the\nrelationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak\nprobability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use\ncontinuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose\nJailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial\nperturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further\nenhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To\ncounteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning\n(JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates.\nExtensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when\nattacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings.

    "abstract": "Maritime Multi-Scene Recognition is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of\nintelligent marine robotics, particularly in applications such as marine\nconservation, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. However, this\ntask presents significant challenges due to environmental interference, where\nmarine conditions degrade image quality, and the complexity of maritime scenes,\nwhich requires deeper reasoning for accurate recognition. Pure vision models\nalone are insufficient to address these issues. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose a novel multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that\nintegrates image data, textual descriptions and classification vectors\ngenerated by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), to provide richer\nsemantic understanding and improve recognition accuracy. Our framework employs\nan efficient multimodal fusion mechanism to further enhance model robustness\nand adaptability in complex maritime environments. Experimental results show\nthat our model achieves 98$\\%$ accuracy, surpassing previous SOTA models by\n3.5$\\%$. To optimize deployment on resource-constrained platforms, we adopt\nactivation-aware weight quantization (AWQ) as a lightweight technique, reducing\nthe model size to 68.75MB with only a 0.5$\\%$ accuracy drop while significantly\nlowering computational overhead. This work provides a high-performance solution\nfor real-time maritime scene recognition, enabling Autonomous Surface Vehicles\n(ASVs) to support environmental monitoring and disaster response in\nresource-limited settings.",

However, there exist inherent variations between\nvision and language data, such as information density, i.e., images can contain\ntextual information from multiple different views, which makes it difficult to\ncompute the similarity between these two modalities accurately and efficiently.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework called Asymmetric Visual Semantic\nEmbedding (AVSE) to dynamically select features from various regions of images\ntailored to different textual inputs for similarity calculation.

In this\npaper, we propose Mutual Information-Guided Attack (MIGA), the first method\ndesigned to directly attack deep denoising models by strategically disrupting\ntheir ability to preserve semantic content via adversarial perturbations. By\nminimizing the mutual information between the original and denoised images, a\nmeasure of semantic similarity. MIGA forces the denoiser to produce\nperceptually clean yet semantically altered outputs. While these images appear\nvisually plausible, they encode systematically distorted semantics, revealing a\nfundamental vulnerability in denoising models. These distortions persist in\ndenoised outputs and can be quantitatively assessed through downstream task\nperformance. We propose new evaluation metrics and systematically assess MIGA\non four denoising models across five datasets, demonstrating its consistent\neffectiveness in disrupting semantic fidelity. Our findings suggest that\ndenoising models are not always robust and can introduce security risks in\nreal-world applications.",

    "abstract": "When discussing the Aerial-Ground Person Re-identification (AGPReID) task, we\nface the main challenge of the significant appearance variations caused by\ndifferent viewpoints, making identity matching difficult. To address this\nissue, previous methods attempt to reduce the differences between viewpoints by\ncritical attributes and decoupling the viewpoints. While these methods can\nmitigate viewpoint differences to some extent, they still face two main issues:\n(1) difficulty in handling viewpoint diversity and (2) neglect of the\ncontribution of local features. To effectively address these challenges, we\ndesign and implement the Self-Calibrating and Adaptive Prompt (SeCap) method\nfor the AGPReID task. The core of this framework relies on the Prompt\nRe-calibration Module (PRM), which adaptively re-calibrates prompts based on\nthe input. Combined with the Local Feature Refinement Module (LFRM), SeCap can\nextract view-invariant features from local features for AGPReID. Meanwhile,\ngiven the current scarcity of datasets in the AGPReID field, we further\ncontribute two real-world Large-scale Aerial-Ground Person Re-Identification\ndatasets, LAGPeR and G2APS-ReID. The former is collected and annotated by us\nindependently, covering $4,231$ unique identities and containing $63,841$\nhigh-quality images; the latter is reconstructed from the person search dataset\nG2APS. Through extensive experiments on AGPReID datasets, we demonstrate that\nSeCap is a feasible and effective solution for the AGPReID task.

Most new-age\nsources being highly dependent on weather and climate conditions bring about\nhigh variability and uncertainty. Energy operators rely on such uncertain data\nto make different planning and operations decisions periodically, and sometimes\nin real-time, to maintain the grid stability and optimize their objectives\n(cost savings, carbon footprint, etc.). Hitherto, operators mostly rely on\ndomain knowledge, heuristics, or solve point problems to take decisions.

We report a systematic study of growth and anomalous Hall\neffect in (111)-oriented non-collinear AFM $Mn_{3+x}Pt_{1-x}$ films with\nvarying compositions, for x = 0.09, 0.17, 0.28. Under optimized growth\nconditions, we obtain stoichiometric and atomically flat epitaxial\n$Mn_{3}Pt$(111) films on Si(100) substrate, as evidenced by X-ray reflectivity\nand scanning probe microscopy. The magnetization measurement showed that\nepitaxial strain can induce a magnetic phase transition from an incommensurate\nspin state ($T_2$) at x = 0.09 to a triangular all-in/all-out AFM spin order\n($T_1$) at x = 0.17, 0.28. The change in magnetic ground state is evident in\nthe transport characteristics, as the ($T_1$) state shows a robust intrinsic\nanomalous Hall effect (AHE) persisting till room temperature, in contrast to\nthe ($T_2$) state where AHE is negligible. Our studies reveal a hole-dominated\nconductance with room temperature anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) ranging\nfrom 5 to 16 $\\Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}$ for x = 0.17 and 0.28 respectively. A scaling\nlaw is established, indicating that Hall resistivity is primarily governed by\nthe intrinsic non-vanishing Berry curvature. The experimental observation\ncorroborates the electronic structure calculations, which predicts the massless\nDirac states near Fermi level in the bulk band structure, attributed to the\npresence of nonsymorphic glide symmetry. Additionally, we showed that chemical\ntuning via Mn doping can stabilize the required T$_1$ non-collinear AFM\nstructure which enhance the topology driven intrinsic AHE.",

A question of\nfundamental importance is how such systems might behave quantum mechanically.\nIn developing quantum theory, Dirac and others realized that classical\nHamiltonian systems can be mapped to their quantum counterparts via canonical\nquantization. The resulting quantum dynamics is always physical, characterized\nby completely-positive and trace-preserving evolutions in the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\npicture. However, whether non-Hamiltonian systems can be quantized\nsystematically while respecting the same physical requirements has remained a\nlong-standing problem. Here we resolve this question when $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$\nare arbitrary polynomials. By leveraging open-systems theory, we prove\nconstructively that every polynomial system admits a physical generator of time\nevolution in the form of a Lindbladian. We call our method cascade\nquantization, and demonstrate its power by analyzing several paradigmatic\nexamples of nonlinear dynamics such as bifurcations, noise-activated spiking,\nand Li\\'{e}nard systems. In effect, our method can quantize any classical\nsystem whose $f(x,y)$ and $g(x,y)$ are analytic with arbitrary precision. More\nimportantly, cascade quantization is exact. This means restrictive system\nproperties usually assumed in the literature to facilitate quantization, such\nas weak nonlinearity, rotational symmetry, or semiclassical dynamics, can all\nbe dispensed with by cascade quantization. We also highlight the advantages of\ncascade quantization over existing proposals, by weighing it against examples\nfrom the variational paradigm using Lagrangians, as well as non-variational\napproaches.",

Existing\nmethods try to resolve this issue by using very low-resolution cameras or video\nencryption. However, privacy cannot be ensured completely with such approaches.\nKey points on the body, such as skeleton joints, can convey significant\ninformation about motion dynamics and successive posture changes which are\ncrucial for fall detection. Skeleton joints have been explored for feature\nextraction but with image recognition models that ignore joint dependency\nacross frames which is important for the classification of actions. Moreover,\nexisting models are over-parameterized or evaluated on small datasets with very\nfew activity classes. We propose an efficient graph convolution network model\nthat exploits spatio-temporal joint dependencies and dynamics of human skeleton\njoints for accurate fall detection. Our method leverages dynamic representation\nwith robust concurrent spatio-temporal characteristics of skeleton joints. We\nperformed extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets. With a\nsignificantly smaller model size than most existing methods, our proposed\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art results on the large scale NTU datasets.",

Beyond these characteristics,\nEPs exhibit more exotic topological properties, particularly non-Abelian\nbraiding topologies not seen in conventional degeneracies. Here, we investigate\nthese foundational concepts of EPs in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices\nwhere the fundamental domain of the Brillouin zone is a Klein bottle, rather\nthan a torus assumed in previous studies. We find that EPs do not necessarily\nappear in pairs with opposite topological charges in the Brillouin Klein\nbottle, thus violating the fermion doubling theorem. The violation occurs\nbecause, without crossing the boundary, the sum of the topological charges of\nEPs is in fact an even number rather than zero. Moreover, we uncover unique\nbraiding topologies of EPs that cannot be captured by existing theories.\nSpecifically, the composite braidings around all EPs equals the braiding along\nthe boundary of the Brillouin Klein bottle.

Unlike previous\nconvolution-based UNet models, DiT is purely composed of a stack of transformer\nblocks, which renders DiT excellent in scalability like large language models.\nHowever, the growing model size and multi-step sampling paradigm bring about\nconsiderable pressure on deployment and inference. In this work, we propose a\npost-training quantization framework tailored for Diffusion Transforms to\ntackle these challenges. We firstly locate that the quantization difficulty of\nDiT mainly originates from the time-dependent channel-specific outliers. We\npropose a timestep-aware shift-and-scale strategy to smooth the activation\ndistribution to reduce the quantization error. Secondly, based on the\nobservation that activations of adjacent timesteps have similar distributions,\nwe utilize a hierarchical clustering scheme to divide the denoising timesteps\ninto multiple groups. We further design a re-parameterization scheme which\nabsorbs the quantization parameters into nearby module to avoid redundant\ncomputations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that out PTQ method\nsuccessfully quantize the Diffusion Transformer into 8-bit weight and 8-bit\nactivation (W8A8) with state-of-the-art FiD score.

We introduce a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Gaussian\nmixture distribution to capture the complex, time-varying nature of asset\nreturn distributions in the Chinese stock market. By incorporating the Gaussian\nmixture distribution, our approach effectively characterizes short-term\nfluctuations and non-traditional features of stock returns, such as skewness\nand heavy tails, that are often overlooked by traditional models. Compared to\nGARCH models and their variants, our method demonstrates superior performance\nin volatility estimation, particularly during periods of heightened market\nvolatility. It provides more accurate volatility forecasts and offers unique\nrisk insights for different assets, thereby deepening the understanding of\nreturn uncertainty. Additionally, we propose a novel use of Code embedding\nwhich utilizes a bag-of-words approach to train hidden representations of stock\ncodes and transforms the uncertainty attributes of stocks into high-dimensional\nvectors. These vectors are subsequently reduced to two dimensions, allowing the\nobservation of similarity among different stocks. This visualization\nfacilitates the identification of asset clusters with similar risk profiles,\noffering valuable insights for portfolio management and risk mitigation. Since\nwe predict the uncertainty of returns by estimating their latent distribution,\nit is challenging to evaluate the return distribution when the true\ndistribution is unobservable. However, we can measure it through the CRPS to\nassess how well the predicted distribution matches the true returns, and\nthrough MSE and QLIKE metrics to evaluate the error between the volatility\nlevel of the predicted distribution and proxy measures of true volatility.",

To solve this problem, feature caching has been\nproposed to accelerate diffusion models by caching the features in the previous\ntimesteps and then reusing them in the following timesteps. However, at\ntimesteps with significant intervals, the feature similarity in diffusion\nmodels decreases substantially, leading to a pronounced increase in errors\nintroduced by feature caching, significantly harming the generation quality. To\nsolve this problem, we propose TaylorSeer, which firstly shows that features of\ndiffusion models at future timesteps can be predicted based on their values at\nprevious timesteps. Based on the fact that features change slowly and\ncontinuously across timesteps, TaylorSeer employs a differential method to\napproximate the higher-order derivatives of features and predict features in\nfuture timesteps with Taylor series expansion. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate its significant effectiveness in both image and video synthesis,\nespecially in high acceleration ratios. For instance, it achieves an almost\nlossless acceleration of 4.99$\\times$ on FLUX and 5.00$\\times$ on HunyuanVideo\nwithout additional training. On DiT, it achieves $3.41$ lower FID compared with\nprevious SOTA at $4.53$$\\times$ acceleration. %Our code is provided in the\nsupplementary materials and will be made publicly available on GitHub.

However,\nthere still exist two key challenges: (1) how to model global illumination with\nfine-grained control to achieve diverse lighting conditions and (2) how to\nensure adversarial effectiveness while maintaining naturalness. To address the\nfirst challenge, we innovatively decompose global illumination into multiple\nparameterized point light sources based on the illumination rendering equation.\nThis design enables us to model more diverse lighting variations that previous\nmethods could not capture. Then, by integrating these parameterized lighting\nvariations with physics-based lighting reconstruction techniques, we could\nprecisely render such light interactions in the original scenes, finally\nmeeting the goal of fine-grained lighting control. For the second challenge, by\ncontrolling illumination through the lighting reconstrution model's latent\nspace rather than direct pixel manipulation, we inherently preserve physical\nlighting priors. Furthermore, to prevent potential reconstruction artifacts, we\ndesign additional perceptual constraints for maintaining visual consistency\nwith original images and diversity constraints for avoiding light source\nconvergence.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ITA could significantly reduce the\nperformance of advanced VLMs, e.g., LLaVA-1.6, while possessing competitive\nnaturalness, exposing VLMS' critical illuminiation vulnerabilities.",

However, most prior art indiscriminately applies a fixed\nprompt distribution across different tasks, neglecting the importance of each\nblock differing depending on the task. In this paper, we investigate adaptive\ndistribution optimization (ADO) by addressing two key questions: (1) How to\nappropriately and formally define ADO, and (2) How to design an adaptive\ndistribution strategy guided by this definition? Through in-depth analysis, we\nprovide an affirmative answer that properly adjusting the distribution\nsignificantly improves VPT performance, and further uncover a key insight that\na nested relationship exists between ADO and VPT. Based on these findings, we\npropose a new VPT framework, termed PRO-VPT (iterative Prompt RelOcation-based\nVPT), which adaptively adjusts the distribution building upon a nested\noptimization formulation. Specifically, we develop a prompt relocation strategy\nfor ADO derived from this formulation, comprising two optimization steps:\nidentifying and pruning idle prompts, followed by determining the optimal\nblocks for their relocation. By iteratively performing prompt relocation and\nVPT, our proposal adaptively learns the optimal prompt distribution, thereby\nunlocking the full potential of VPT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nproposal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VPT methods, e.g., PRO-VPT\nsurpasses VPT by 1.6% average accuracy, leading prompt-based methods to\nstate-of-the-art performance on the VTAB-1k benchmark.

The main challenge lies in the complex data structure of GS\nrepresented by discrete point clouds with multiple channels. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose employing the triplane representation, which allows us to\nrepresent Gaussian Splatting as an image-like continuous field. This\nrepresentation effectively encodes both the geometry and texture information,\nenabling smooth transformation back to Gaussian point clouds and rendering into\nimages by a TriRenderer, with only 2D supervisions. The proposed TriRenderer is\nfully differentiable, so that the rendering loss can supervise both texture and\ngeometry encoding. Furthermore, the triplane representation can be compressed\nusing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which can subsequently be utilized in\nlatent diffusion to generate 3D objects. The experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed generation framework can produce high-quality 3D object geometry and\nrendering results in the text-to-3D task.",

    "abstract": "Robotics researchers increasingly leverage large language models (LLM) in\nrobotics systems, using them as interfaces to receive task commands, generate\ntask plans, form team coalitions, and allocate tasks among multi-robot and\nhuman agents. However, despite their benefits, the growing adoption of LLM in\nrobotics has raised several safety concerns, particularly regarding executing\nmalicious or unsafe natural language prompts. In addition, ensuring that task\nplans, team formation, and task allocation outputs from LLMs are adequately\nexamined, refined, or rejected is crucial for maintaining system integrity. In\nthis paper, we introduce SafePlan, a multi-component framework that combines\nformal logic and chain-of-thought reasoners for enhancing the safety of\nLLM-based robotics systems. Using the components of SafePlan, including Prompt\nSanity COT Reasoner and Invariant, Precondition, and Postcondition COT\nreasoners, we examined the safety of natural language task prompts, task plans,\nand task allocation outputs generated by LLM-based robotic systems as means of\ninvestigating and enhancing system safety profile. Our results show that\nSafePlan outperforms baseline models by leading to 90.5% reduction in harmful\ntask prompt acceptance while still maintaining reasonable acceptance of safe\ntasks.",

Recent\ninvestigations have established that deep learning (DL) can substantially\nenhance the ghost imaging reconstruction quality. Furthermore, with the\nemergence of large models like SDXL, GPT-4, etc., the constraints of\nconventional DL in parameters and architecture have been transcended, enabling\nmodels to comprehensively explore relationships among all distinct positions\nwithin feature sequences. This paradigm shift has significantly advanced the\ncapability of DL in restoring severely degraded and low-resolution imagery,\nmaking it particularly advantageous for noise-robust image reconstruction in GI\napplications. In this paper, we propose the first large imaging model with 1.4\nbillion parameters that incorporates the physical principles of GI (GILM). The\nproposed GILM implements a skip connection mechanism to mitigate gradient\nexplosion challenges inherent in deep architectures, ensuring sufficient\nparametric capacity to capture intricate correlations among object single-pixel\nmeasurements. Moreover, GILM leverages multi-head attention mechanism to learn\nspatial dependencies across pixel points during image reconstruction,\nfacilitating the extraction of comprehensive object information for subsequent\nreconstruction. We validated the effectiveness of GILM through a series of\nexperiments, including simulated object imaging, imaging objects in free space,\nand imaging object located 52 meters away in underwater environment.

Once a model has been selected, the\nchoice of formulation is a discrete one, and so promoting it to be continuous\nis expected to give rise to a wider class of actions.

Traditional methods, such\nas fixed-form parametric models and data-driven approaches, often struggle to\nbalance accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This paper\nintroduces a novel symbolic regression algorithm based on the Actor-Critic\nreinforcement learning framework, specifically tailored for dynamic load\nmodeling. The algorithm employs a trainable expression tree with controlled\ndepth and a predefined set of operators to generate compact and interpretable\nmathematical expressions. The Actor network probabilistically selects operators\nfor the symbolic expression, while the Critic evaluates the resulting\nexpression tree through a loss function. To further enhance performance, a\ncandidate pool mechanism is implemented to store high-performing expressions,\nwhich are subsequently fine-tuned using gradient descent. By focusing on\nsimplicity and precision, the proposed method significantly reduces\ncomputational complexity while preserving interpretability. Experimental\nresults validate its superior performance compared to existing benchmarks,\nwhich offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic load modeling and\nsystem analysis in modern power systems.",

Geometrically, this problem is equivalent to projecting a\npoint in the ambient Euclidean space onto the image of the given variety under\na non-linear map. It is the singularities of the image that make both the\ncomputation and the analysis difficult. In this paper, we prove that under some\nmild assumptions, these troublesome singularities can always be avoided. This\nenables us to establish a linear convergence rate for iterative sequences\ngenerated by algorithms satisfying some standard assumptions. We apply our\ngeneral results to the low-rank partially orthogonal tensor approximation\nproblem.

To fill this gap, we\nintroduce the Text-Humanization Benchmark (TH-Bench), the first comprehensive\nbenchmark to evaluate evading attacks against MGT detectors.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their role\nin robotic task planning. However, while LLMs have been explored for generating\nfeasible task sequences, their ability to ensure safe task execution remains\nunderdeveloped. Existing methods struggle with structured risk perception,\nmaking them inadequate for safety-critical applications where low-latency\nhazard adaptation is required. To address this limitation, we propose a\nGraphormer-enhanced risk-aware task planning framework that combines LLM-based\ndecision-making with structured safety modeling. Our approach constructs a\ndynamic spatio-semantic safety graph, capturing spatial and contextual risk\nfactors to enable online hazard detection and adaptive task refinement. Unlike\nexisting methods that rely on predefined safety constraints, our framework\nintroduces a context-aware risk perception module that continuously refines\nsafety predictions based on real-time task execution. This enables a more\nflexible and scalable approach to robotic planning, allowing for adaptive\nsafety compliance beyond static rules. To validate our framework, we conduct\nexperiments in the AI2-THOR environment. The experiments results validates\nimprovements in risk detection accuracy, rising safety notice, and task\nadaptability of our framework in continuous environments compared to static\nrule-based and LLM-only baselines.

    "abstract": "Externally controlled trials are crucial in clinical development when\nrandomized controlled trials are unethical or impractical. These trials consist\nof a full treatment arm with the experimental treatment and a full external\ncontrol arm. However, they present significant challenges in learning the\ntreatment effect due to the lack of randomization and a parallel control group.\nBesides baseline incomparability, outcome mean non-exchangeability, caused by\ndifferences in conditional outcome distributions between external controls and\ncounterfactual concurrent controls, is infeasible to test and may introduce\nbiases in evaluating the treatment effect. Sensitivity analysis of outcome mean\nnon-exchangeability is thus critically important to assess the robustness of\nthe study's conclusions against such assumption violations. Moreover,\nintercurrent events, which are ubiquitous and inevitable in clinical studies,\ncan further confound the treatment effect and hinder the interpretation of the\nestimated treatment effects. This paper establishes a semi-parametric framework\nfor externally controlled trials with intercurrent events, offering doubly\nrobust and locally optimal estimators for primary and sensitivity analyses. We\ndevelop an omnibus sensitivity analysis that accounts for both outcome mean\nnon-exchangeability and the impacts of intercurrent events simultaneously,\nensuring root-n consistency and asymptotic normality under specified\nconditions.

    "abstract": "The thermal response of proximity Josephson junctions (JJs) is governed by\nthe temperature ($T$)-dependent occupation of Andreev bound states (ABS),\nmaking them promising candidates for sensitive thermal detection. In this\nstudy, we systematically engineer ABS to enhance the thermal sensitivity of the\ncritical current ($I_c$) of proximity JJs, quantified as $|\\,dI_c/dT\\,|$ for\nthe threshold readout scheme and $|\\,dI_c/dT \\cdot I_c^{-1}\\,|$ for the\ninductive readout scheme. Using a gate-tunable graphene-based JJ platform, we\nexplore the impact of key parameters -- including channel length, transparency,\ncarrier density, and superconducting material -- on the thermal response. Our\nresults reveal that the proximity-induced superconducting gap plays a crucial\nrole in optimizing thermal sensitivity. Notably, we see a maximum $|\\,dI_c/dT\n\\cdot I_c^{-1}\\,|$ value of $0.6\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ at low temperatures with\ntitanium-based graphene JJs. By demonstrating a systematic approach to\nengineering ABS in proximity JJs, this work establishes a versatile framework\nfor optimizing thermal sensors and advancing the study of ABS-mediated\ntransport.",

    "abstract": "Since its first observation in the 1970s, neutrino-induced neutral-current\nsingle positive pion production (NC1$\\pi^+$) has remained an elusive and poorly\nunderstood interaction channel. This process is a significant background in\nneutrino oscillation experiments and studying it further is critical for the\nphysics program of next-generation accelerator-based neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. In this Letter we present the first double-differential\ncross-section measurement of NC1$\\pi^+$ interactions using data from the ND280\ndetector of the T2K experiment collected in $\\nu$-beam mode. The measured\nflux-averaged integrated cross-section is $ \\sigma = (6.07 \\pm 1.22 )\\times\n10^{-41} \\,\\, \\text{cm}^2/\\text{nucleon}$. We compare the results on a\nhydrocarbon target to the predictions of several neutrino interaction\ngenerators and final-state interaction models. While model predictions agree\nwith the differential results, the data shows a weak preference for a\ncross-section normalization approximately 30\\% higher than predicted by most\nmodels studied in this Letter.",

Conventional global or\nwrist-mounted cameras often suffer from occlusions when either assembling or\ndisassembling from an existing structure. To address the challenge, this paper\nintroduces \"Eye-in-Finger\", a novel tool design approach that enhances robotic\nmanipulation by embedding low-cost, high-resolution perception directly at the\ntool tip. We validate our approach using LEGO assembly and disassembly tasks,\nwhich require the robot to manipulate in a cluttered environment and achieve\nsub-millimeter accuracy and robust error correction due to the tight\ntolerances. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system enables\nreal-time, fine corrections to alignment error, increasing the tolerance of\ncalibration error from 0.4mm to up to 2.0mm for the LEGO manipulation robot.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to train a model on seen classes and recognize\nunseen classes by knowledge transfer through shared auxiliary information.\nRecent studies reveal that documents from encyclopedias provide helpful\nauxiliary information. However, existing methods align noisy documents,\nentangled in visual and non-visual descriptions, with image regions, yet solely\ndepend on implicit learning. These models fail to filter non-visual noise\nreliably and incorrectly align non-visual words to image regions, which is\nharmful to knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel multi-attribute\ndocument supervision framework to remove noises at both document collection and\nmodel learning stages. With the help of large language models, we introduce a\nnovel prompt algorithm that automatically removes non-visual descriptions and\nenriches less-described documents in multiple attribute views. Our proposed\nmodel, MADS, extracts multi-view transferable knowledge with information\ndecoupling and semantic interactions for semantic alignment at local and global\nlevels. Besides, we introduce a model-agnostic focus loss to explicitly enhance\nattention to visually discriminative information during training, also\nimproving existing methods without additional parameters. With comparable\ncomputation costs, MADS consistently outperforms the SOTA by 7.2% and 8.2% on\naverage in three benchmarks for document-based ZSL and GZSL settings,\nrespectively. Moreover, we qualitatively offer interpretable predictions from\nmultiple attribute views.",

    "abstract": "The fungal disease Chytridiomycosis poses a threat to frog populations\nworldwide. It has driven over 90 amphibian species to extinction and severely\naffected hundreds more. Difficulties in disease management have shown a need\nfor novel conservation approaches.\n  We present a novel mathematical model for chytridiomycosis transmission in\nfrogs that includes the natural history of infection, to test the hypothesis\nthat sunlight-heated refugia reduce transmission. The model is fit using\napproximate Bayesian computation to experimental data where a cohort of frogs,\na fixed subset of which had cleared a prior infection, were provided access to\neither sunlight-heated or shaded refugia. Using our model, we can estimate the\nextent to which prior chytridiomycosis infection protects against subsequent\ninfection, and quantify the effect of sunlight-heating of refugia.\n  Results estimate a 40% reduction in chytridiomycosis transmission when frogs\nhave access to sunlight-heated refugia, compared to shaded refugia. This\nstrongly supports the hypothesis that the sunlight-heated refugia reduce\ndisease transmission. Frogs that were infected and recovered were estimated to\nhave a reduction in susceptibility of approximately 97% compared to frogs with\nno prior infection.\n  This research provides quantitative evidence supporting sunlight-heated\nrefugia as an effective disease management tool for chytridiomycosis in frog\npopulations. By estimating both the impact of refugia and the protective\neffects of prior infection, the model provides an evidence base for\nimplementing sunlight-heated refugia as part of amphibian conservation\nstrategies. This work represents an important first step in using mathematical\nmodelling to inform policy on the design and implementation of habitat-based\ninterventions to support amphibian population recovery and long-term\nsustainability.",

    "abstract": "Recently, multi-node inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based odometry for\nlegged robots has gained attention due to its cost-effectiveness, power\nefficiency, and high accuracy. However, the spatial and temporal misalignment\nbetween foot-end motion derived from forward kinematics and foot IMU\nmeasurements can introduce inconsistent constraints, resulting in odometry\ndrift. Therefore, accurate spatial-temporal calibration is crucial for the\nmulti-IMU systems. Although existing multi-IMU calibration methods have\naddressed passive single-rigid-body sensor calibration, they are inadequate for\nlegged systems. This is due to the insufficient excitation from traditional\ngaits for calibration, and enlarged sensitivity to IMU noise during kinematic\nchain transformations. To address these challenges, we propose A$^2$I-Calib, an\nanti-noise active multi-IMU calibration framework enabling autonomous\nspatial-temporal calibration for arbitrary foot-mounted IMUs. Our A$^2$I-Calib\nincludes: 1) an anti-noise trajectory generator leveraging a proposed basis\nfunction selection theorem to minimize the condition number in correlation\nanalysis, thus reducing noise sensitivity, and 2) a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based controller that ensures robust execution of calibration motions.\nFurthermore, A$^2$I-Calib is validated on simulation and real-world quadruped\nrobot platforms with various multi-IMU settings, which demonstrates a\nsignificant reduction in noise sensitivity and calibration errors, thereby\nimproving the overall multi-IMU odometry performance.",

Cubic coal samples with side lengths of 50-70 mm\nwere subjected to non-destructive sonic tests, measuring both P-wave (Vp) and\nS-wave (Vs) velocities. Each of the three orthogonal directions (X, Y, and Z)\nof the cube was divided into 9 regions, resulting in 27 Vp and 27 Vs\nmeasurements per sample. From these data, 2D sonic maps were constructed for\neach direction, and interpolation was employed to refine the mappings. A 3D\nsonic map was then generated by averaging the 2D maps.

    "abstract": "As the technology node continues to shrink, nanosheet field effect\ntransistors (NSFETs) and complementary FETs (CFETs) become valid candidates for\nthe 3nm and sub-nanometre nodes. However, due to the shrinking device size,\nself-heating and inter-device thermal crosstalk of NSFETs and CFETs become more\nsevere. It is important to accurately calculate the self-heating and thermal\ncrosstalk of devices and to study the electrical and thermal characteristics of\nlogic gates, etc. In this work, a thermal network model considering the thermal\ncrosstalk of neighboring devices is proposed, which can accurately calculate\nthe self-heating and thermal crosstalk. The electrical and thermal\ncharacteristics of NSFETs and CFETs are compared, and it is found that CFETs\nhave more severe self-heating and thermal crosstalk. The electro-thermal\ncharacteristics of inverters, logic gates and ring oscillators composed of\nNSFETs and CFETs are further investigated. Compared with NSFETs, logic gates\nand ring oscillators composed of CFETs are more seriously affected by\nself-heating and should be given extra attention. The thermal network model\nproposed in this paper can be further used to study the thermal optimization\nstrategy of devices and circuits to enhance the electrical performance,\nachieving the design technology co-optimizations (DTCO).",

In this work, we present\na new supervised learning approach that learns to predict the per-frame\nsequence matching receptiveness (SMR) of VPR techniques, enabling the system to\nselectively decide when to trust the output of a sequence matching system. Our\napproach is agnostic to the underlying VPR technique and effectively predicts\nSMR, and hence significantly improves VPR performance across a large range of\nstate-of-the-art and classical VPR techniques (namely CosPlace, MixVPR,\nEigenPlaces, SALAD, AP-GeM, NetVLAD and SAD), and across three benchmark VPR\ndatasets (Nordland, Oxford RobotCar, and SFU-Mountain).

    "abstract": "Nowadays, with the advancement of deep neural networks (DNNs) and the\navailability of large-scale datasets, the face recognition (FR) model has\nachieved exceptional performance. However, since the parameter magnitude of the\nfully connected (FC) layer directly depends on the number of identities in the\ndataset. If training the FR model on large-scale datasets, the size of the\nmodel parameter will be excessively huge, leading to substantial demand for\ncomputational resources, such as time and memory. This paper proposes the\nattention fully connected (AttFC) layer, which could significantly reduce\ncomputational resources. AttFC employs an attention loader to generate the\ngenerative class center (GCC), and dynamically store the class center with\nDynamic Class Container (DCC). DCC only stores a small subset of all class\ncenters in FC, thus its parameter count is substantially less than the FC\nlayer. Also, training face recognition models on large-scale datasets with one\nGPU often encounter out-of-memory (OOM) issues. AttFC overcomes this and\nachieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Suppose we are given two metric spaces and a family of continuous\ntransformations from one to the other. Given a probability distribution on each\nof these two spaces - namely the source and the target measures - the\nWasserstein alignment problem seeks the transformation that minimizes the\noptimal transport cost between its pushforward of the source distribution and\nthe target distribution, ensuring the closest possible alignment in a\nprobabilistic sense. Examples of interest include two distributions on two\nEuclidean spaces $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and we want a spatial\nembedding of the $n$-dimensional source measure in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ that is\nclosest in some Wasserstein metric to the target distribution on\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$. Similar data alignment problems also commonly arise in shape\nanalysis and computer vision. In this paper we show that this nonconvex optimal\ntransport projection problem admits a convex Kantorovich-type dual. This allows\nus to characterize the set of projections and devise a linear programming\nalgorithm. For certain special examples, such as orthogonal transformations on\nEuclidean spaces of unequal dimensions and the $2$-Wasserstein cost, we\ncharacterize the covariance of the optimal projections. Our results also cover\nthe generalization when we penalize each transformation by a function.

This process spreads plasmons into all\nCoulomb-coupled electron conduction channels, including those in neighbouring\ncircuits, and makes it difficult to control them in quantum circuits. Here we\ndemonstrate the isolation and on-demand selection of electron conduction\nchannels contributing to the plasmon using a cavity, which enables us to\ncontrol the velocity of propagating plasmons.

This effect is unaffected by the energy\nfluctuation of the surrounding circuits. The electron-channel blockade offers a\npowerful tool for designing plasmonic circuits as it can be used to control the\nplasmon velocity by local parameters, suppress unwanted plasmonic excitation in\nnearby circuits, and select electron-channels of plasmon eigenstates in quantum\ninterferometers.",

We obtain the following:\n  * Improving results of Krivelevich and Sudakov, we show that a small-set\nexpander contains a complete minor of order $\\sqrt{n t / \\log n}$.\n  * We show that a small-set expander contains every graph $H$ with $O(n \\log t\n/ \\log n)$ edges and vertices as a minor. We complement this with an upper\nbound showing that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ has average degree $d$, then\nthere exists a graph with $O(n \\log d / \\log n)$ edges and vertices which is\nnot a minor of $G$. This has two consequences: (i) It implies the optimality of\nour result in the case $t = d^c$ for some constant $c > 0$, and (ii) it shows\nexpanders are optimal minor-universal graphs of a given average degree.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes recursive algorithms for state estimation of linear\ndynamical systems when measurements are noisy with unknown bias and/or\noutliers. For situations with noisy and biased measurements, algorithms are\nproposed that minimize $\\epsilon$ insensitive loss function. In this approach\nwhich is often used in Support Vector Machines, small errors are ignored making\nthe algorithm less sensitive to measurement bias. Apart from $\\epsilon$\ninsensitive quadratic loss function, estimation algorithms are also presented\nfor $\\epsilon$ insensitive Huber M loss function which provides good\nperformance in presence of both small noises as well as outliers. The advantage\nof Huber cost function based estimator in presence of outliers is due to the\nfact the error penalty function switches from quadratic to linear for errors\nbeyond a certain threshold. For both objective functions, estimation algorithms\nare extended to cases when there are additional constraints on states and\nexogenous signals such as known range of some states or exogenous signals or\nmeasurement noises. Interestingly, the filtering algorithms are recursive and\nstructurally similar to Kalman filter with the main difference being that the\nupdates based on the new measurement (\"innovation term\") are based on solution\nof a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.",

However, storing all experts on GPUs incurs\nsignificant memory overhead, increasing the monetary cost of MoE-based\ninference. To address this, we propose eMoE, a memory efficient inference\nsystem for MoE-based large language models (LLMs) by leveraging our\nobservations from experiment measurements. eMoE reduces memory usage by\npredicting and loading only the required experts based on recurrent patterns in\nexpert routing. To reduce loading latency while maintaining accuracy, as we\nfound using the same experts for subsequent prompts has minimal impact on\nperplexity, eMoE invokes the expert predictor every few prompts rather than for\neach prompt. In addition, it skips predictions for tasks less sensitive to\nrouting accuracy. Finally, it has task-aware scheduling to minimize inference\nlatency by considering Service Level Objectives (SLOs), task-specific output\nlengths, and expert loading latencies. Experimental results show that compared\nto existing systems, eMoE reduces memory consumption by up to 80% while\nmaintaining accuracy and reduces inference latency by up to 17%. It also\nenables processing prompts 40x longer, batches 4.5x larger, and achieves 1.5x\nhigher throughput.",

However,\nresearch on unsupervised domain adaptation for BEV mapping remains limited and\ncannot perfectly accommodate all BEV mapping tasks. To address this gap, this\npaper proposes HierDAMap, a universal and holistic BEV domain adaptation\nframework with hierarchical perspective priors. Unlike existing research that\nsolely focuses on image-level learning using prior knowledge, this paper\nexplores the guiding role of perspective prior knowledge across three distinct\nlevels: global, sparse, and instance levels. With these priors, HierDA consists\nof three essential components, including Semantic-Guided Pseudo Supervision\n(SGPS), Dynamic-Aware Coherence Learning (DACL), and Cross-Domain Frustum\nMixing (CDFM). SGPS constrains the cross-domain consistency of perspective\nfeature distribution through pseudo labels generated by vision foundation\nmodels in 2D space. To mitigate feature distribution discrepancies caused by\nspatial variations, DACL employs uncertainty-aware predicted depth as an\nintermediary to derive dynamic BEV labels from perspective pseudo-labels,\nthereby constraining the coarse BEV features derived from corresponding\nperspective features. CDFM, on the other hand, leverages perspective masks of\nview frustum to mix multi-view perspective images from both domains, which\nguides cross-domain view transformation and encoding learning through mixed BEV\nlabels. The proposed method is verified on multiple BEV mapping tasks, such as\nBEV semantic segmentation, high-definition semantic, and vectorized mapping.\nThe source code will be made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/lynn-yu/HierDAMap.",

Such an MRT-LB model considers the\ntransformation matrix constructed in a natural way and the DdQ(2d^2+1) lattice\nstructure. A key step in developing the high-order MRT-LB model is to determine\nthe adjustable relaxation parameters and weight coefficients, which are used to\neliminate the truncation errors at certain orders of the MRT-LB model, while\nensuring the stability of the MRT-LB model. In this work, we first present a\nunified MRT-LB model for the diagonal-anisotropic diffusion equation. Then,\nthrough the direct Taylor expansion, we analyze the macroscopic modified\nequations of the MRT-LB model up to fourth-order, and further derive the\nfourth-order consistent conditions of the MRT-LB model. Additionally, we also\nconstruct the fourth-order initialization scheme for the present LB method.\nAfter that, the condition which guarantees that the MRT-LB model can satisfy\nthe stability structure is explicitly given, and from a numerical perspective,\nonce the stability structure is satisfied, the MRT-LB model must be L^2 stable.\nIn combination with the fourth-order consistent and L^2 stability conditions,\nthe relaxation parameters and weight coefficients of the MRT-LB model can be\nautomatically given by a simple computer code. Finally, we perform numerical\nsimulations of several benchmark problems, and find that the numerical results\ncan achieve a fourth-order convergence rate, which is in agreement with our\ntheoretical analysis.

Scale may not be enough due to the\nsignificant multimodality of robotics tasks, lack of easily accessible data and\nthe challenges of deploying on physical hardware. Meanwhile, most deployed\nrobotic systems today are inherently modular and can leverage the independent\ngeneralization capabilities of each module to perform well. Therefore, this\nthesis seeks to tackle the task of building generalist robot agents by\nintegrating these components into one: combining modularity with large-scale\nlearning for general purpose robot control. The first question we consider is:\nhow can we build modularity and hierarchy into learning systems? Our key\ninsight is that rather than having the agent learn hierarchy and low-level\ncontrol end-to-end, we can enforce modularity via planning to enable more\nefficient and capable robot learners. Next, we come to the role of scale in\nbuilding generalist robot systems. To scale, neural networks require vast\namounts of diverse data, expressive architectures to fit the data and a source\nof supervision to generate the data. We leverage a powerful supervision source:\nclassical planning, which can generalize, but is expensive to run and requires\naccess to privileged information to perform well in practice. We use these\nplanners to supervise large-scale policy learning in simulation to produce\ngeneralist agents. Finally, we consider how to unify modularity with\nlarge-scale policy learning to build real-world robot systems capable of\nperforming zero-shot manipulation. We do so by tightly integrating key\ningredients of modular high and mid-level planning, learned local control,\nprocedural scene generation and large-scale policy learning for sim2real\ntransfer.

As an immediate application,\nletting $R=\\{ R_{s}\\} _{s\\ge 0}$ be a three-dimensional Bessel process starting\nfrom $a$, we obtain the following time-reversal and time-inversion results on\n$R$: $\\{ R_{t-s}\\} _{0\\le s\\le t}$ is identical in law with the process given\nby \\begin{align*}\n  R_{s}+R_{t}-2\\min _{s\\le u\\le t}R_{u},\\quad 0\\le s\\le t, \\end{align*} when\n$a=0$, and $\\{ sR_{1/s}\\} _{s>0}$ is identical in law with the process given by\n\\begin{align*}\n  R_{s}-2(1+s)\\min _{0\\le u\\le s}\\frac{R_{u}}{1+u}+a(1+s),\\quad s>0,\n\\end{align*} for every $a\\ge 0$.",

    "abstract": "To transport high-quality quantum state between two distant qubits through\none-dimensional spin chains, the perfect state transfer (PST) method serves as\nthe first choice, due to its natively perfect transfer fidelity that is\nindependent of the system dimension. However, the PST requires a precise\nmodulation of the local pulse parameters as well as an accurate timing of\ndynamic evolution, and is thus very sensitive to variations in practice. Here,\nwe propose a protocol for achieving quantum-preserved transport of excitations\nusing an array of Rydberg-dressed atoms, enabled by optimal control of\nminimally global parameters. By treating the weak coupling of two marginal\narray atoms as a perturbation, an effective spin-exchange model with highly\ntunable interactions between the external weak and the inner strong driving\natoms can be established, which allows for coherent excitation transfer even\nwith large atomic position fluctuation. We furthermore show that the existence\nof long-time excitation propagation unattainable for systems under antiblockade\nfacilitation conditions. Our results highlight an easily-implemented scheme for\nstudying the dynamics of spin systems using Rydberg atoms and may guide the\navenue to the engineering of complex many-body dynamics.",

Soda\nis a high-level functional and object-oriented language that supports the\ncompilation of its code not only to Scala, a strongly statically typed\nhigh-level programming language, but also to Lean, a proof assistant and\nprogramming language. Given these capabilities, Soda can implement multi-agent\nsystems, or parts thereof, that can then be integrated into a mainstream\nsoftware ecosystem on the one hand and formally verified with state-of-the-art\ntools on the other hand. We provide a brief and informal introduction to Soda\nand the aforementioned interoperability capabilities, as well as a simple\ndemonstration of how interaction protocols can be designed and verified with\nSoda. In the course of the demonstration, we highlight challenges with respect\nto real-world applicability.",

    "abstract": "This work tackles the problem of overoptimization in reinforcement learning\nfrom human feedback (RLHF), a prevalent technique for aligning models with\nhuman preferences. RLHF relies on reward or preference models trained on\n\\emph{fixed preference datasets}, and these models are unreliable when\nevaluated outside the support of this preference data, leading to the common\nreward or preference hacking phenomenon. We propose novel, pessimistic\nobjectives for RLHF which are provably robust to overoptimization through the\nuse of pessimism in the face of uncertainty, and design practical algorithms,\nP3O and PRPO, to optimize these objectives. Our approach is derived for the\ngeneral preference optimization setting, but can be used with reward models as\nwell. We evaluate P3O and PRPO on the tasks of fine-tuning language models for\ndocument summarization and creating helpful assistants, demonstrating\nremarkable resilience to overoptimization.",
