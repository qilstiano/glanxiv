    "abstract": "Safety-critical driving data is crucial for developing safe and trustworthy\nself-driving algorithms. Due to the scarcity of safety-critical data in\nnaturalistic datasets, current approaches primarily utilize simulated or\nartificially generated images. However, there remains a gap in authenticity\nbetween these generated images and naturalistic ones. We propose a novel\nframework to augment the safety-critical driving data from the naturalistic\ndataset to address this issue. In this framework, we first detect vehicles\nusing YOLOv5, followed by depth estimation and 3D transformation to simulate\nvehicle proximity and critical driving scenarios better. This allows for\ntargeted modification of vehicle dynamics data to reflect potentially hazardous\nsituations. Compared to the simulated or artificially generated data, our\naugmentation methods can generate safety-critical driving data with minimal\ncompromise on image authenticity. Experiments using KITTI datasets demonstrate\nthat a downstream self-driving algorithm trained on this augmented dataset\nperforms superiorly compared to the baselines, which include SMOGN and\nimportance sampling.",

    "abstract": "Modal decomposition methods are important for characterizing the\nlow-dimensional dynamics of complex systems, including turbulent flows.\nDifferent methods have varying data requirements and produce modes with\ndifferent properties. Spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) produces\northogonal, energy-ranked spatial modes at discrete temporal frequencies for\nstatistically stationary flows. However, SPOD requires long stretches of\nsequential, uniformly sampled, time-resolved data. These data requirements\nlimit SPOD's use in experimental settings where the maximum capture rate of a\ncamera is often slower than the Nyquist sampling rate required to resolve the\nhighest turbulent frequencies. However, if two PIV systems operate in tandem,\npairs of data can be acquired that are arbitrarily close in time. The dynamic\nmode decomposition (DMD) uses this pairwise data to resolve frequencies up to\nthe Nyquist frequency associated with the small time step within a pair.\nHowever, these modes do not form a basis and have no set ranking. The present\nwork attempts to compute SPOD modes from pairwise data with a small time step\nbut with large gaps between pairs. We use DMD on pairwise data to estimate\nsegment-wise, uniformly sampled series that can then be used to estimate the\nSPOD modes, intending to resolve frequencies between the gap and pair Nyquist\nlimits. The method is tested on numerically obtained data of the linearized\ncomplex Ginzburg-Landau equation, as well as a Mach 0.4 isothermal turbulent\njet. For the jet, pairwise SPOD can accurately de-alias the SPOD spectrum and\nestimate mode shapes at frequencies up to St = 1.0, while using over 90% less\ndata.",

We present an approach\nthat allows for fast, exact velocity averaging just by solving the equations of\nmotion twice. We find the \"propagator\" that acts on the zero-velocity solution\nto generate the velocity-dependent atomic state for all velocities. By\naveraging this propagator over the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution of\nthe atoms, we obtain an explicit, analytic formula that generates the averaged\natomic state.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Tree-NET, a novel framework for medical image\nsegmentation that leverages bottleneck feature supervision to enhance both\nsegmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. While previous studies have\nemployed bottleneck feature supervision, their applications have largely been\nlimited to the training phase, offering no computational benefits during\ntraining or evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first\nto propose a framework that incorporates two additional training phases for\nsegmentation models, utilizing bottleneck features at both input and output\nstages. This approach significantly improves computational performance by\nreducing input and output dimensions with a negligible addition to parameter\ncount, without compromising accuracy. Tree-NET features a three-layer\narchitecture comprising Encoder-Net and Decoder-Net, which are autoencoders\ndesigned to compress input and label data, respectively, and Bridge-Net, a\nsegmentation framework that supervises the bottleneck features. By focusing on\ndense, compressed representations, Tree-NET enhances operational efficiency and\ncan be seamlessly integrated into existing segmentation models without altering\ntheir internal structures or increasing model size. We evaluate Tree-NET on two\ncritical segmentation tasks -- skin lesion and polyp segmentation -- using\nvarious backbone models, including U-NET variants and Polyp-PVT. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that Tree-NET reduces FLOPs by a factor of 4 to 13 and\ndecreases memory usage, while achieving comparable or superior accuracy\ncompared to the original architectures. These findings underscore Tree-NET's\npotential as a robust and efficient solution for medical image segmentation.",

We propose an embedded domain-specific\nlanguage (DSL), Pythoness, to address those challenges. In Pythoness,\ndevelopers program with LLMs at a higher level of abstraction. Rather than\ninteracting directly with generated code, developers using Pythoness operate at\nthe level of behavioral specifications when writing functions, classes, or an\nentire program. These specifications can take the form of unit tests and\nproperty-based tests, which may be expressed formally or in natural language.\nGuided by these specifications, Pythoness generates code that both passes the\ntests and can be continuously checked during execution. We posit that the\nPythoness approach lets developers harness the full potential of LLMs for code\ngeneration while substantially mitigating their inherent risks.

For graphs of arboricity $\\alpha$, there\nis an orientation in which every vertex has out-degree at most $\\alpha$ and,\nmoreover, the best possible maximum out-degree of an orientation is at least\n$\\alpha - 1$. We are thus interested in algorithms that can achieve a maximum\nout-degree of close to $\\alpha$. A widely studied approach for this problem in\nthe distributed algorithms setting is a ``peeling algorithm'' that provides an\norientation with maximum out-degree $\\alpha(2+\\epsilon)$ in a logarithmic\nnumber of iterations.\n  We consider this problem in the local computation algorithm (LCA) model,\nwhich quickly answers queries of the form ``What is the orientation of edge\n$(u,v)$?'' by probing the input graph. When the peeling algorithm is executed\nin the LCA setting by applying standard techniques, e.g., the Parnas-Ron\nparadigm, it requires $\\Omega(n)$ probes per query on an $n$-vertex graph. In\nthe case where $G$ has unbounded degree, we show that any LCA that orients its\nedges to yield maximum out-degree $r$ must use $\\Omega(\\sqrt n/r)$ probes to\n$G$ per query in the worst case, even if $G$ is known to be a forest (that is,\n$\\alpha=1$). We also show several algorithms with sublinear probe complexity\nwhen $G$ has unbounded degree. When $G$ is a tree such that the maximum degree\n$\\Delta$ of $G$ is bounded, we demonstrate an algorithm that uses $\\Delta\nn^{1-\\log_\\Delta r + o(1)}$ probes to $G$ per query. To obtain this result, we\ndevelop an edge-coloring approach that ultimately yields a\ngraph-shattering-like result. We also use this shattering-like approach to\ndemonstrate an LCA which $4$-colors any tree using sublinear probes per query.",

A challenge precision medicine\nfaces is population heterogeneity, as studies on treatment effects are often\nconducted on source populations that differ from the populations of interest in\nterms of the distribution of patient characteristics. Our research goal is to\nexplore a transfer learning algorithm that aims to address the population\nheterogeneity problem and obtain targeted, optimal, and interpretable ITRs. The\nalgorithm incorporates a calibrated augmented inverse probability weighting\n(CAIPW) estimator for the average treatment effect (ATE) and employs value\nfunction maximization for the target population using Genetic Algorithm (GA) to\nproduce our desired ITR. To demonstrate its practical utility, we apply this\ntransfer learning algorithm to two large medical databases, Electronic\nIntensive Care Unit Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD) and Medical\nInformation Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III). We first identify the\nimportant covariates, treatment options, and outcomes of interest based on the\ntwo databases, and then estimate the optimal linear ITRs for patients with\nsepsis.

However, the\nclinical localization including structural, ictal, and invasive data\nacquisition and assessment is a difficult and long procedure with increasing\nchallenges in patients with complex epileptic foci. The interictal methods are\nproposed to assist in presurgical planning with simpler data acquisition and\nhigher speed. This study presents a spatiotemporal component classification for\nthe localization of epileptic foci using resting-state functional magnetic\nresonance imaging data. This method is based on spatiotemporal independent\ncomponent analysis on rsfMRI with a component-sorting procedure upon dominant\npower frequency, biophysical constraints, spatial lateralization, local\nconnectivity, temporal energy, and functional non-Gaussianity. This method\nutilized the rs-fMRI potential to reach a high spatial accuracy in localizing\nepileptic foci from interictal data while retaining the reliability of results\nfor clinical usage. Thirteen patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent\nsurgical resection and had seizure-free surgical outcomes after a 12-month\nfollow-up were included in this study. All patients had presurgical structural\nMRI and rsfMRI while postsurgical MRI images were available for ten. Based on\nthe relationship between the localized foci and resection, the results were\nclassified into three groups fully concordant, partially concordant, and\ndiscordant. These groups had the resulting cluster aligned with, in the same\nlobe with, and outside the lobe of the resection area, respectively.",

The electrical contact located between the lower undoped\ncladding and the waveguide together with the upper laser contact enable pumping\nfor optical gain. A voltage applied between the same contact and the contact\nlocated under the lower cladding induces space charge limited current (SCLC)\nacross the lower cladding. Electrons driven into this layer create the space\ncharge. The charge affects the refractive index of the layer and\ncorrespondingly the laser frequency. The proposed technique is applicable to\nany semiconductor lasers. Critical requirements are that free carrier\nconcentration in the lower cladding must be small enough not to affect the SCLC\nand the laser gain must be high enough to overcome losses introduced by\ninteractivity contact. As an example, we present the calculated characteristics\nof the QCL operated at 10$\\mu$m wavelength.

    "abstract": "The physical fidelity of turbulence models can benefit from a partial\nresolution of fluctuations, but doing so often comes with an increase in\ncomputational cost. To explore this trade-off in the context of wall-bounded\nflows, this paper introduces a framework for Turbulence-Resolving Integral\nSimulations (TRIS) with the goal of efficiently resolving the largest motions\nusing a two-dimensional, three component representation of the flow defined by\ninstantaneous wall-normal integrals of velocity and pressure. Self-sustaining\nturbulence with qualitatively realistic large-scale structures is demonstrated\nfor TRIS on an open-channel (half-channel) flow configuration using\nmoment-of-momentum integral equations derived from Navier-Stokes with\nrelatively simple closure approximations. Evidence from Direct Numerical\nSimulations (DNS) suggests that TRIS can theoretically resolve 35-40% of the\nturbulent skin friction enhancement for friction Reynolds numbers between 180\nand 5200, without a noticeable decrease or increase as a function of Reynolds\nnumber. The current implementation of TRIS can match this resolution while\nsimulating one flow through time in ~1 minute on a single processor, even for\nvery large Reynolds numbers. The framework facilitates a detailed\napples-to-apples comparison of predicted statistics against data from DNS.\nComparisons at friction Reynolds numbers of 395 and 590 show that TRIS\ngenerates a relatively accurate representation of the flow, while highlight\ndiscrepancies that demonstrate a need for improving the closure models. The\npresent results for open-channel flow represent a proof of concept for TRIS as\na new approach for wall-bounded turbulence modeling, motivating extension to\nmore general flow configurations such as boundary layers on immersed objects.",

    "abstract": "Identifying useful flat-space limits for cosmological correlators, where they\ncan be expressed in terms of observables in Minkowski space is nontrivial due\nto their scale-invariant nature. In recent years, it has been shown that\nmomentum-space correlators encode flat-space amplitudes at specific\nsingularities that emerge in the complex plane of their kinematics after\nanalytical continuation. This flat-space limit is massless in the sense that\nthe amplitude corresponds to the ultraviolet regime of the associated\nflat-space process, where the masses of the internal propagators are\neffectively zero. In this paper, we introduce a novel massive flat-space (MFS)\nlimit, in which the internal masses in the corresponding flat-space Feynman\ngraph remain finite. Our proposal applies to arbitrary graphs with light\nexternal legs and heavy internal lines, using a double-scaling limit. In this\nlimit, the external energies, treated as independent variables, approach zero\nin inverse proportion to the propagator masses, which are sent to infinity. We\npresent a general reduction formula that expresses diagrams in this limit in\nterms of amputated Feynman graphs in flat space. Our findings underscore the\ndeep connections between the rich structure of massive Feynman integrals and\nthe properties of cosmological correlators involving the exchange of heavy\nfields. Using this reduction formula, we compute sample one-loop contributions\nfrom heavy particles to inflationary correlators in the small sound-speed\nregime, revealing novel bispectrum shapes. The non-Gaussian signals we uncover,\nwhich are especially pronounced around the equilateral configuration, cannot be\nreproduced by adding local terms to the effective field theory of single-field\ninflation. Instead, they are captured by incorporating prescribed spatially\nnon-local operators into the EFT.",

The use of reverse\nannealing, a derivative procedure of quantum annealing to prioritize the search\nin a vicinity under a given initial state, helps improve its optimization\nperformance in matrix factorization. This study proposes an improved strategy\nthat integrates reverse annealing with a linear programming relaxation\ntechnique. Using relaxed solutions as the initial configuration for reverse\nannealing, we demonstrate improvements in optimization performance comparable\nto the exact optimization methods. Our experiments on facial image datasets\nshow that our method provides better convergence than known reverse annealing\nmethods. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of relaxation-based\ninitialization methods on randomized datasets, demonstrating a relationship\nbetween the relaxed solution and the optimal solution. This research\nunderscores the potential of combining reverse annealing and classical\noptimization strategies to enhance optimization performance.",

In April\n2023, Hello Inc., a Chinese urban mobility company, launched the Hello Street\nCat initiative to address these issues.

It also promotes the\nTrap-Neuter-Return (TNR) method, supported by a community-driven platform,\nHelloStreetCatWiki, where volunteers catalog and identify cats. However, manual\nidentification is inefficient and unsustainable, creating a need for automated\nsolutions. This study explores Deep Learning-based models for re-identifying\nstreet cats in the Hello Street Cat initiative. A dataset of 2,796 images of 69\ncats was used to train Siamese Networks with EfficientNetB0, MobileNet and\nVGG16 as base models, evaluated under contrastive and triplet loss functions.\nVGG16 paired with contrastive loss emerged as the most effective configuration,\nachieving up to 97% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.9344 during testing.

    "abstract": "We investigate exact solutions of the Einstein field equations in\nhigher-dimensional, spatially homogeneous Bianchi type-I spacetimes,\nintroducing a real parameter $\\lambda$ that correlates the expansion rates of\nexternal and internal spaces. Extending beyond Robertson--Walker spacetime, our\napproach includes positive and negative correlations, suggesting a broader and\nisotropic/anisotropic cosmological model space. Positively correlated\ndimensions manifest as a cosmological constant at late times, while at early\ntimes, they mimic stiff-fluid-like dark energy that dilutes faster than\nradiation, paralleling early dark energy models. This suggests a pathway for\nalleviating the Hubble tension by tailoring higher-dimensional dynamics to\nreduce the sound horizon. When anisotropic expansion is allowed, these models\nachieve isotropization more efficiently than predicted by Wald's cosmic no-hair\ntheorem. Negative correlations, in contrast, yield a higher-dimensional\nsteady-state universe where the shear scalar remains constant, effectively\nemulating a negative cosmological constant. These distinct behaviors arise from\na simple signature change: positive correlation accelerates shear scalar decay,\nwhile negative correlation stabilizes it. We demonstrate that the solutions\nadmit analytic continuation from the Lorentzian to Euclidean regime ($t \\to\n-i\\tau$), revealing a wormhole-like topology that connects two asymptotic\nregions via a throat, with $\\lambda \\to -\\lambda$.",

Our films exhibit a high\ndegree of texture and crystallinity as well as low roughness at temperatures as\nlow as 250{\\deg}C. Most importantly, the films exhibit coercive fields\ncomparable to state-of-the-art values (5 MV/cm) with significantly enhanced\nremanent polarization (158-172.0 {\\mu}C/cm2). Notably, the remanent\npolarization remains stable across varying scandium concentrations. We further\nevaluate cycling stability and leakage current to assess suitability for memory\napplications. This study demonstrates HiPIMS as a scalable and CMOS compatible\ntechnique for synthesizing high-quality ferroelectric AlScN films, paving the\nway for their application in non-volatile memory applications.",

    "abstract": "The structure of grey matter has long been a key focus in neuroscience, as\ncell morphology varies by type and can be affected by neurological conditions.\nUnderstanding these variations is essential for studying brain function and\ndisease. Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a powerful non-invasive tool for\nexamining cellular microstructure in vivo. However, for dMRI to accurately\nreflect cellular features, it is crucial to determine which aspects of\nmorphology influence its measurements. Proper interpretation of dMRI data\ndepends on understanding its sensitivity to different cellular characteristics.\n  Despite growing interest in cellular morphology, there has been no systematic\nreport on the key features defining different neural cell types. To address\nthis, we analyzed over 11,500 three-dimensional cellular reconstructions across\nthree species and nine cell types, establishing reference values for critical\nmorphological traits. These traits fall into three categories: structural\nfeatures that define the cell's skeletal framework, shape features that\ndescribe spatial organization, and topological features that break down\ncellular structure to distinguish cell types. Beyond reporting these reference\nvalues, we examine their relevance for dMRI, identifying which neural features\ndMRI can detect and which cell types may be distinguishable. To complement the\nstatistical analysis, we also provide high resolution 3D surface meshes\nrepresentative of each cell type and species.\n  This work provides essential benchmarks for grey matter research, offering\nnew guidelines on linking neuroimaging measurements to neurobiology. These\nreference values will be a valuable resource for neuroscientists and\nneuroimaging researchers, aiding in the interpretation of imaging data and the\nrefinement of brain tissue models.",

When\ncalculating the properties of the images we expect to see from these lenses, it\nis typically assumed that each lens is roughly a singular isothermal sphere. In\nreality, the largest objects in the Universe (i.e. galaxy clusters) are highly\nirregular and composed of many components due to a history of (or active)\nhierarchical mergers. In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the\nobservables of strongly lensed transients in both scenarios, namely relative\nmagnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. Focusing on\ngravitational waves, we compare the detection rates between the single\nspherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly\navailable state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be\napproximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed\ntransients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall\nstrong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak\nlensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards\nlower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the\nrealistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative\nparity images, as seen elsewhere in the literature.

This OTD analysis reveals the amplification characteristics of\nperturbations about the unsteady base flow and their amplified spatiotemporal\nstructures that evolve over time. We consider four time-varying laminar base\nflows in which a vortex with a strength corresponding to the gust ratio $G$ of\n$\\{-1,-0.5,0.5,1\\}$ impinges on the leading edge of the airfoil at an angle of\nattack of $12^\\circ$. In these cases, the impingement of the strong gust vortex\ncauses massive separation and the generation of large-scale vortices around the\nairfoil within two convective time units. The highly unsteady nature of these\nvortex-airfoil interactions necessitates an advanced analytical technique\ncapable of capturing the transient perturbation dynamics. For each of the\nconsidered gust ratios, the OTD analysis identifies the most amplified region\nto perturbations, the location of which changes as the wake evolves\ndifferently. For interactions between a moderate positive vortex gust ($G=0.5$)\nand the airfoil, the area where perturbations are amplified transitions from\nthe leading-edge vortex sheet to the forming leading-edge vortex. Later, this\nmost amplified structure becomes supported in the airfoil wake directly behind\nthe trailing edge. In contrast, a strong vortex gust ($G=\\pm 1$) encountered by\nthe airfoil shows the most amplified OTD mode to appear around the core of the\nshed vortices.

In our method, the pruning mask is\ninput-dependent and adapts dynamically based on the information described in a\nuser instruction.

    "abstract": "The total deuterium abundance [D/H] in the universe is set by just two\nprocesses: the creation of deuterium in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis at an\nabundance of [D/H]$=2.58\\pm0.13\\times10^{-5}$, and its destruction within\nstellar interiors. Measurements of the total [D/H] abundance can potentially\nprovide a probe of Galactic chemical evolution, however, most measurements of\n[D/H] are only sensitive to the gas-phase deuterium, and the amount of\ndeuterium sequestered in carbonaceous dust grains is debated. With the launch\nof JWST, it is now possible to measure the gas-phase [D/H] at unprecedented\nsensitivity and distances through observation of mid-IR lines of H$_2$ and HD.\nWe employ data from the JWST Observations of Young protoStars (JOYS) program to\nmeasure the gas-phase [D/H] abundance with a rotation diagram analysis towards\n5 nearby low-mass and 5 distant high-mass protostellar outflows. The gas-phase\n[D/H] varies between low-mass sources by up to a factor of $\\sim4$, despite\nthese sources likely having formed in a region of the Galactic disk that would\nbe expected to have nearly constant total [D/H]. Most measurements of gas-phase\n[D/H] from our work or previous studies produce [D/H] $\\lesssim\n1.0\\times10^{-5}$, a factor of $2-4$ lower than found from local UV absorption\nlines and as expected from Galactic chemical evolution models. The variations\nin [D/H] between our low-mass sources and the low [D/H] with respect to\nGalactic chemical evolution models suggest that our observations are not\nsensitive to the total [D/H]. Significant depletion of deuterium onto\ncarbonaceous dust grains is a possible explanation, and tentative evidence of\nenhanced [D/H] towards shock positions with higher gas-phase Fe abundance is\nseen in the HH 211 outflow. Deeper observations of HD and H$_2$ in shocked\nenvironments and modelling of dust-grain destruction are warranted to test for\nthe effects of depletion.",

    "abstract": "Spatial scheduling of electrode activation (\"rastering\") is essential for\nsafely operating high-density retinal implants, yet its perceptual consequences\nremain poorly understood. This study systematically evaluates the impact of\nraster patterns, or spatial arrangements of sequential electrode activation, on\nperformance and perceived difficulty in simulated prosthetic vision (SPV). By\naddressing this gap, we aimed to identify patterns that optimize functional\nvision in retinal implants. Sighted participants completed letter recognition\nand motion discrimination tasks under four raster patterns (horizontal,\nvertical, checkerboard, and random) using an immersive SPV system. The\nsimulations emulated epiretinal implant perception and employed\npsychophysically validated models of electrode activation, phosphene\nappearance, nonlinear spatial summation, and temporal dynamics, ensuring\nrealistic representation of prosthetic vision. Performance accuracy and\nself-reported difficulty were analyzed to assess the effects of raster\npatterning. The checkerboard pattern consistently outperformed other raster\npatterns, yielding significantly higher accuracy and lower difficulty ratings\nacross both tasks. The horizontal and vertical patterns introduced biases\naligned with apparent motion artifacts, while the checkerboard minimized such\neffects. Random patterns resulted in the lowest performance, underscoring the\nimportance of structured activation. Notably, checkerboard matched performance\nin the \"No Raster\" condition, despite conforming to groupwise safety\nconstraints. This is the first quantitative, task-based evaluation of raster\npatterns in SPV. Checkerboard-style scheduling enhances perceptual clarity\nwithout increasing computational load, offering a low-overhead, clinically\nrelevant strategy for improving usability in next-generation retinal\nprostheses.",

Our observations reveal a distinct point in\nthe pulse profile of PSR B0329+54 that appears to align remarkably well with\nthe cold-plasma dispersion law, resulting in a unique measured DM across the\nentire frequency range. In contrast, using times of arrival (ToAs) from widely\nadopted pulsar timing techniques (e.g., FFTFIT)-leads to frequency-dependent\nDMs. We investigated the potential causes of these frequency-dependent DMs in\nthis pulsar and their relationship with the underlying magnetic field geometry\ncorresponding to the radio emission. Our study reveals that all frequencies in\nthe range 300-1460 MHz originate from a region no larger than 204 km, and the\ndipolar magnetic-field geometry model indicates that the emission region is\ncentered at $\\sim$800 km from the star. This is the tightest constraint on the\nsize of the emission region reported so far for PSR B0329+54 at the given\nfrequencies, and it is at least five times more stringent than the existing\nemission height constraints based on the dipolar geometry model.",

Together, the four bands cover the major carbon, oxygen, nitrogen,\nand sulfur-bearing molecules including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, SO$_2$,\nCO$_2$, and CO. Among the eight high-precision gas giant exoplanet planet\nspectra we collected, we found strong correlations between the SO$_2$-L index\nand planet mass (r=-0.41$\\pm$0.09) and temperature (r=-0.64$\\pm$0.08),\nindicating SO$_2$ preferably exists (SO$_2$-L$>$-0.5) among low mass\n($\\sim<$0.3M$_J$) and cooler ($\\sim<$1200K) targets. We also observe strong\ntemperature dependency for both CO$_2$-L and CO-L indices. Under equilibrium\nchemistry and isothermal thermal structure assumptions, we find that the planet\nsample favors super-solar metallicity and low C/O ratio ($<$0.7). In addition,\nthe presence of a mass-metallicity correlation is favored over uniform\nmetallicity with the eight planets.

The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies,\nspecifically computer vision, offers an innovative approach to monitoring and\nenhancing animal welfare. Cows, as essential contributors to sustainable\nagriculture, are central to this effort. However, existing cow detection\nalgorithms face challenges in real-world farming environments, such as complex\nlighting, occlusions, pose variations, and background interference, hindering\ndetection. Model generalization is crucial for adaptation across contexts\nbeyond the training dataset. This study addresses these challenges using a\ndiverse cow dataset from six environments, including indoor and outdoor\nscenarios. We propose a detection model combining YOLOv8 with the CBAM\n(Convolutional Block Attention Module) and assess its performance against\nbaseline models, including Mask R-CNN, YOLOv5, and YOLOv8. Our findings show\nbaseline models degrade in complex conditions, while our approach improves\nusing CBAM.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a computationally efficient method for the optimal design\nof silica aerogel porous material systems, balancing thermal insulation\nperformance with mechanical stability under stress concentrations. The proposed\napproach explicitly accounts for additive manufacturing uncertainties by\nmodeling material porosity as a spatially correlated stochastic field within a\nmultiphase finite element formulation. A risk-averse objective function,\nincorporating statistical moments of the design objective, is employed in\nconjunction with chance constraints that enforce mechanical stability by\nrestricting the probability of exceeding critical stress thresholds. To\nmitigate the prohibitively high computational cost associated with the\nlarge-dimensional uncertainty space and Monte Carlo estimations of the\nobjective function's statistical moments, a second-order Taylor expansion is\nutilized as a control variate. Furthermore, a continuation-based smoothing\nstrategy is introduced to address the non-differentiability of the chance\nconstraints, ensuring compatibility with gradient-based optimization. The\nresulting framework achieves computational scalability, remaining agnostic to\nthe dimensionality of the stochastic design space. The effectiveness of the\nmethod is demonstrated through numerical experiments on two- and\nthree-dimensional thermal break systems for building insulation. The results\nhighlight the framework's capability to solve large-scale, chance-constrained\noptimal design problems governed by finite element models with uncertain design\nparameter spaces reaching dimensions in the hundreds of thousands.",

Conventional anomaly detection approaches like signal processing\nand statistical modelling often struggle to effectively handle the intricacies\nof complex systems, particularly when dealing with multi-variate signals. In\ncontrast, neural network-based anomaly detection methods, especially\nAuto-Encoders, have emerged as a compelling alternative, demonstrating\nremarkable performance. However, Auto-Encoders exhibit inherent opaqueness in\ntheir decision-making processes, hindering their practical implementation at\nscale. Addressing this opacity is essential for enhancing the interpretability\nand trustworthiness of anomaly detection models. In this work, we address this\nchallenge by employing a feature selector to select features and counterfactual\nexplanations to give a context to the model output. We tested this approach on\nthe SKAB benchmark dataset and an industrial time-series dataset. The gradient\nbased counterfactual explanation approach was evaluated via validity, sparsity\nand distance measures. Our experimental findings illustrate that our proposed\ncounterfactual approach can offer meaningful and valuable insights into the\nmodel decision-making process, by explaining fewer signals compared to\nconventional approaches.

    "abstract": "Scaling laws for language models have often focused on finding the optimal\nmodel size and token count for training from scratch. However, achieving this\noptimal balance requires significant compute resources due to the extensive\ndata demands when training models from randomly-initialized weights. Continued\npretraining offers a cost-effective alternative, leveraging the compute\ninvestment from pretrained models to incorporate new knowledge without\nrequiring extensive new data. Recent findings suggest that data quality\ninfluences constants in scaling laws, thereby altering the optimal\nparameter-token allocation ratio. Building on this insight, we investigate the\ninterplay between domain specialization and model size during continued\npretraining under compute-constrained scenarios. Our goal is to identify an\noptimal training regime for this scenario and detect patterns in this interplay\nthat can be generalized across different model sizes and domains. To compare\ngeneral and specialized training, we filtered a web-based dataset to extract\ndata from three domains: legal, medical, and accounting. We pretrained models\nwith 1.5B, 3B, 7B, and 14B parameters on both the unfiltered and filtered\ndatasets, then evaluated their performance on domain-specific exams.

We find that at low stress, during weak\nthickening, the frictional contact network is composed of quasilinear chains\nalong the compression axis. With increasing stress, the contact network becomes\nmore isotropic, and forms loop-like structures. We show that third-order loops\nwithin the frictional contact network are key to this behavior. Our findings\nrevealed a strong correlation between the number of edges in the third-order\nloops and the viscosity of the suspension.

    "abstract": "We study the separating flow over a circular cylinder with two objectives:\n(i) to demonstrate the validity of the condition of matching curvature, and\n(ii) to obtain a reasonable estimate of the separation angle in the subcritical\nregime (Re=10^4-10^5) without explicitly modeling the boundary layer. First, we\nstudy Roshko's free streamline model (1954); it is an ideal flow model with\nsheets of discontinuities that represent the separating shear layers in the\nnear wake region. The model fails to predict the correct separation angle over\na cylinder. Roshko attributed this discrepancy to the condition of matching\ncurvature, which asserts that the curvature of the separating streamline at the\nseparation point must match that of the cylinder. We show that such a condition\nis legitimate and is not the real culprit for the failure of Roshko's model in\npredicting separation. Second, we employ the principle of minimum pressure\ngradient (PMPG), which asserts that, an incompressible flow evolves by\nminimizing the total magnitude of the pressure gradient over the domain.\nEncouraged by the fact that the flow characteristics in the range Re=10^4-10^5\nare fairly independent of Re, we aim to predict the separation angle in this\nregime without modeling the boundary layer -- a task that may seem impossible,\nthough anticipated by Prandtl in his seminal paper (Prandtl 1904). Over the\nfamily of kinematically-admissible, equilibrium flows, we utilize the PMPG to\nsingle out the separating flow with the minimum pressure gradient cost.\nInterestingly, the obtained separation angles match experimental measurements\nover the regime Re=10^4-10^5.",

We tackle\nthis challenge by creating an active-learning, closed-loop molecule generation\npipeline, whereby molecular generative models are iteratively refined on\nfeedback from quantum chemical simulations to improve generalization to new\nchemical space. Compared against other generative model approaches, only our\nactive learning approach generates molecules with properties that extrapolate\nbeyond the training data (reaching up to 0.44 standard deviations beyond the\ntraining data range) and out-of-distribution molecule classification accuracy\nis improved by 79%.

Much of our knowledge of the SLACS lenses has been obtained by combining\nstrong lensing with stellar kinematics constraints. However, interpreting\nstellar kinematics data is difficult: it requires reconstructing the\nthree-dimensional structure of a galaxy and the orbits of its stars. In this\nwork we pursued an alternative approach to the study of galaxy structure with\nSLACS, based purely on gravitational lensing data. The primary goal of this\nstudy is to constrain the stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter\n$\\alpha_{sps}$, quantifying the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy\nand that obtained with a reference stellar population synthesis model, and the\nefficiency of the dark matter response to the infall of baryons, $\\epsilon$. We\ncombined Einstein radius measurements from the SLACS lenses with weak lensing\ninformation from their parent sample, while accounting for selection effects.\nThe data can be fit comparatively well by a model with\n$\\log{\\alpha_{sps}}=0.22$ and $\\epsilon=0$, corresponding to an IMF slightly\nlighter than Salpeter and no dark matter contraction, or $\\log{\\alpha_{sps}}=0$\nand $\\epsilon=0.8$, equivalent to a Chabrier IMF and almost maximal\ncontraction. This degeneracy could be broken with lensing-only measurements of\nthe projected density slope, but existing data are completely inconsistent with\nour model. We suspect systematic errors in the measurements to be at the origin\nof this discrepancy. Number density constraints would also help break the\ndegeneracy. Because of selection effects, SLACS lenses have a larger velocity\ndispersion than galaxies with the same projected mass distribution, and their\nvelocity dispersion is overestimated. These two biases combined produce a $5\\%$\nupward shift in the observed velocity dispersion.",

    "abstract": "Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have typically focused on\nintegrating visual and textual modalities, with less emphasis placed on the\nrole of speech in enhancing interaction. However, speech plays a crucial role\nin multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both\nvision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental\nmodality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed\nmulti-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand\nboth visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and\nspeech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language\ncapacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities\nwithout separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal\nend-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art\ncounterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech\ncapabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.",

To\naddress this, we propose a new method, termed Metadata Conditioning then\nCooldown (MeCo), to incorporate additional learning cues during pre-training.\nMeCo first provides metadata (e.g., URLs like www$.$wikipedia$.$org) alongside\nthe text during training and later uses a cooldown phase with only the standard\ntext, thereby enabling the model to function normally even without metadata.\nMeCo significantly accelerates pre-training across different model scales (600M\nto 8B parameters) and training sources (C4, RefinedWeb, and DCLM). For\ninstance, a 1.6B language model trained with MeCo matches the downstream task\nperformance of standard pre-training while using 33% less data. Additionally,\nMeCo enables us to steer language models by conditioning the inference prompt\non either real or fabricated metadata that encodes the desired properties of\nthe output: for example, prepending wikipedia$.$org to reduce harmful\ngenerations or factquizmaster$.$com (fabricated) to improve common knowledge\ntask performance.

Wind generation consistently displaces thermal output, while effects\nfrom solar vary significantly by region, achieving substantial displacement in\nareas with high solar penetration such as the California Independent System\nOperator but limited impacts in coal reliant grids such as the Midcontinent\nIndependent System Operator. Renewable energy sources effectively reduce carbon\ndioxide emissions in regions with flexible thermal plants, achieving\ndisplacement effectiveness as high as one hundred and two percent in the\nCalifornia Independent System Operator and the Electric Reliability Council of\nTexas.

    "abstract": "This work introduces distribution error correction (DEC) theory, where we\ncorrect the output distribution of a quantum computer to the ideal distribution\nexactly. If the noise affecting the circuit is a Pauli channel, the ideal\noutput distribution and noisy distribution in the standard basis are related by\na stochastic matrix. We prove that this matrix has a recursive 2 by 2 block\ncirculant structure. Thus, the noisy output distribution can be corrected to\nthe ideal output distribution via a Fast Fourier Transform. Therefore, DEC for\nPauli error channels does not require encoding of the logical qubits into more\nphysical qubits and it avoids the encoding overhead of standard quantum error\ncorrection codes. Moreover, we introduce a DEC implementation that requires\nexecutions of only 2 logical circuits. The approach is tested with quantum\nhardware executions consisting of 20-qubit and 30-qubit GHZ state preparation,\n5-qubit Grover, 6-qubit and 10-qubit quantum phase estimation, and 10-qubit and\n20-qubit Dicke state preparation circuits.

    "abstract": "We pretrain METAGENE-1, a 7-billion-parameter autoregressive transformer\nmodel, which we refer to as a metagenomic foundation model, on a novel corpus\nof diverse metagenomic DNA and RNA sequences comprising over 1.5 trillion base\npairs. This dataset is sourced from a large collection of human wastewater\nsamples, processed and sequenced using deep metagenomic (next-generation)\nsequencing methods. Unlike genomic models that focus on individual genomes or\ncurated sets of specific species, the aim of METAGENE-1 is to capture the full\ndistribution of genomic information present within this wastewater, to aid in\ntasks relevant to pandemic monitoring and pathogen detection. We carry out\nbyte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization on our dataset, tailored for metagenomic\nsequences, and then pretrain our model. In this paper, we first detail the\npretraining dataset, tokenization strategy, and model architecture,\nhighlighting the considerations and design choices that enable the effective\nmodeling of metagenomic data. We then show results of pretraining this model on\nour metagenomic dataset, providing details about our losses, system metrics,\nand training stability over the course of pretraining. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe performance of METAGENE-1, which achieves state-of-the-art results on a set\nof genomic benchmarks and new evaluations focused on human-pathogen detection\nand genomic sequence embedding, showcasing its potential for public health\napplications in pandemic monitoring, biosurveillance, and early detection of\nemerging health threats.",

Its\nphoto-$z$s were previously derived with artificial neural networks from the\nANNz2 package, trained on the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopy.\nHere we considerably improve over these previous redshift estimations by\nbuilding a DL model, Hybrid-z, which combines four-band KiDS images with\nnine-band magnitudes from KiDS+VIKING. The Hybrid-z framework provides\nphoto-$z$s for KiDS-Bright, with negligible mean residuals of O($10^{-4}$) and\nscatter at the level of $0.014(1+z)$ -- reduction by 20% over the previous\nnine-band derivations with ANNz2. We check our photo-$z$ model performance on\ntest data drawn from GAMA, as well as from other KiDS-overlapping wide-angle\nspectroscopic surveys, namely SDSS, 2dFLenS, and 2dFGRS. We find stable\nbehavior and consistent improvement over ANNz2 throughout. We finally apply\nHybrid-z trained on GAMA to the entire KiDS-Bright DR4 sample of 1.2 million\ngalaxies. For these final predictions, we design a method of smoothing the\ninput redshift distribution of the training set, to avoid propagation of\nfeatures present in GAMA, related to its small sky area and large-scale\nstructure imprint in its fields. Our work paves the way towards the\nbest-possible photo-$z$s achievable with machine learning for any galaxy type\nboth for the final KiDS-Bright DR5 data and for future deeper imaging, such as\nfrom the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is\nof paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with\nshared protection against drugs. Microbial communities generally evolve in\nvolatile environments and spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and\nenvironmental variability thus have significant impacts on AMR, whose\nmaintenance in static environments is generally promoted by migration. Here, we\ndemonstrate that this picture changes dramatically in time-fluctuating\nspatially structured environments. To this end, we consider a two-dimensional\nmetapopulation model consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive\ncells evolve in a time-changing environment in the presence of a toxin against\nwhich protection can be shared. Cells migrate between neighbouring demes and\nhence connect them. When the environment varies neither too quickly nor too\nslowly, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks causing fluctuation-driven\nlocal extinctions, a mechanism countered by migration that rescues AMR. Through\nsimulations and mathematical analysis, we investigate how migration and\nenvironmental variability influence the probability of resistance eradication.\nWe determine the near-optimal conditions for the fluctuation-driven AMR\neradication, and show that slow but non-zero migration speeds up the clearance\nof resistance and can enhance its eradication probability.

However, there remains some unanswered questions on how to best\nutilize such models especially with very small fine-tuning cohorts. Methods: We\nutilized Med-BERT, an EHR-specific foundation model, and reformulated the\ndisease binary prediction task into a token prediction task and a next visit\nmask token prediction task to align with Med-BERT's pretraining task format in\norder to improve the accuracy of pancreatic cancer (PaCa) prediction in both\nfew-shot and fully supervised settings. Results: The reformulation of the task\ninto a token prediction task, referred to as Med-BERT-Sum, demonstrates\nslightly superior performance in both few-shot scenarios and larger data\nsamples. Furthermore, reformulating the prediction task as a Next Visit Mask\nToken Prediction task (Med-BERT-Mask) significantly outperforms the\nconventional Binary Classification (BC) prediction task (Med-BERT-BC) by 3% to\n7% in few-shot scenarios with data sizes ranging from 10 to 500 samples. These\nfindings highlight that aligning the downstream task with Med-BERT's\npretraining objectives substantially enhances the model's predictive\ncapabilities, thereby improving its effectiveness in predicting both rare and\ncommon diseases. Conclusion: Reformatting disease prediction tasks to align\nwith the pretraining of foundation models enhances prediction accuracy, leading\nto earlier detection and timely intervention.

Thin films (nominally 10\nmonolayers) of benzene, five substituted benzenes and two naphthalenes have\nbeen employed to study systematic changes in the photochemical activity.\nIllumination of these systems with 248nm light is found to result in a\ndissociation process for the CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I mediated by initial absorption\nin the aromatic thin film, followed by electronic energy transfer (EET) to the\ndissociating species. The effective cross sections for dissociation are found\nto be substantially increased via this mechanism, by amounts that differ\ndepending on the aromatic molecule thin film used, and is connected to the\naromatic photabsorption profile. Distinctive translational energy distributions\nfor the CH$_3$ and CF$_3$ photofragments are found to vary systematically for\nthe different aromatic molecule thin film used, and are related to the aromatic\nmolecule excited states. The CH$_3$ and CF$_3$ photofragment kinetic energy\ndistributions found for the aromatic thin films suggest that the dissociation\noccurs via EET to the $^3Q_1$ excited state of CH$_3$I and CF$_3$I.",

Our proposed\nmodel is akin to an E2E differentiable cascaded model which performs ASR and\nSLU sequentially and we ensure that the SLU task is conditioned on the ASR task\nby having CTC self conditioning. This novel joint modeling of ASR and SLU\nimproves SLU performance significantly over just using SLU optimization. We\nfurther improve the performance by aligning the acoustic embeddings of this\nmodel with the semantically richer BERT model. Our proposed knowledge transfer\nstrategy makes use of a bag-of-entity prediction layer on the aligned\nembeddings and the output of this is used to condition the RNN-T based SLU\ndecoding. These techniques show significant improvement over several strong\nbaselines and can perform at par with large models like Whisper with\nsignificantly fewer parameters.",

    "abstract": "The Lyman-alpha (LyA) line of atomic hydrogen encodes crucial information\nabout both the intrinsic sources and surrounding environments of star-forming\nregions throughout the Universe. Due to the complexity of resonant scattering,\nanalytic solutions remain scarce, with most studies focusing on idealized,\nstatic configurations. However, observations of LyA emitting galaxies\nconsistently reveal signatures of outflows, imprinted through red-peak\ndominance in spectral line profiles. In this paper, we derive novel analytic\nsolutions for resonant-line radiative transfer in moving media, specifically\nhomologous-like cloud expansion and unbounded cosmological flows, which capture\nthe main physics of velocity gradients. To validate these analytic solutions\nand identify regimes where diffusion-based assumptions hold, we introduce a\nrobust Gridless Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (GMCRT) method. By integrating\noptical depths exactly in the comoving frame, GMCRT updates photon frequencies\ncontinuously to account for Doppler shifts induced by velocity gradients. We\ndemonstrate excellent consistency between GMCRT and our analytic solutions in\nregimes where diffusion approximations apply. At higher velocities or lower\noptical depths, discrepancies highlight the limitations of simplified\nformalisms. We also provide scaling relations for a point source in a cloud\nwith a maximum-to-thermal velocity ratio beta = V_max / v_th, as modifying the\nstandard dependence on line centre optical depth of (atau_0)^1/3 by additional\nfactors, e.g. characteristic escape frequency scale as x_esc ~ beta^1/3, force\nmultipliers as M_F ~ beta^-1/3, and trapping time as t_trap ~ beta^-2/3. Our\nwork complements numerical simulations by improving physical intuition about\nnonstatic environments when interpreting LyA observations and guiding future\nsubgrid prescriptions in galaxy formation models.",

Despite their\nsuccess, LVLMs still suffer from generating hallucinations in complex\ngeneration tasks, leading to inconsistencies between visual inputs and\ngenerated content. To address this issue, some approaches have introduced\ninference-time interventions, such as contrastive decoding and attention\nrectification, to reduce overreliance on language priors. However, these\napproaches overlook hallucinations stemming from spurious inter-modality\ncorrelations. In this paper, we propose an Inter-Modality Correlation\nCalibration Decoding (IMCCD) method to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs in a\ntraining-free manner. In this method, we design a Cross-Modal Value-Enhanced\nDecoding(CMVED) module to alleviate hallucination by a novel contrastive\ndecoding mechanism. During the estimation of distorted distribution, CMVED\nmasks the value vectors associated with significant cross-modal attention\nweights, which address both uni-modality overreliance and misleading\ninter-modality correlations. Additionally, a Content-Driven Attention\nRefinement(CDAR) module refines cross-modal attention weights, guiding LVLMs to\nfocus on important visual content. Experimental results on diverse\nhallucination benchmarks validate the superiority of our method over existing\nstate-of-the-art techniques in reducing hallucinations in LVLM text generation.\nOur code will be available at https://github.com/lijm48/IMCCD.",

The idea of inverse problem transform\n(IPT) has been proposed in recent remote sensing literature in order to\nreformulate a hardly tractable inverse problem (e.g., HyDHZ) into a relatively\nsimple one. Considering the emerging spectral super-resolution (SSR) technique,\nwhich spectrally upsamples multispectral data to hyperspectral data, we aim to\nsolve the challenging HyDHZ problem by reformulating it as an SSR problem.\nRoughly speaking, the proposed algorithm first automatically selects some\nuncorrupted/informative spectral bands, from which SSR is applied to spectrally\nupsample the selected bands in the feature space, thereby obtaining a clean\nhyperspectral image (HSI). The clean HSI is then further refined by a deep\ntransformer network to obtain the final dehazed HSI, where a global attention\nmechanism is designed to capture nonlocal information. There are very few HyDHZ\nworks in existing literature, and this article introduces the powerful\nspatial-spectral transformer into HyDHZ for the first time. Remarkably, the\nproposed transformer-driven IPT-based HyDHZ (T2HyDHZ) is a blind algorithm\nwithout requiring the user to manually select the corrupted region.

    "abstract": "Quantum dot (QD) light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) are promising candidates for\nnext-generation displays because of their high efficiency, brightness, broad\ncolor gamut, and solution-processability. Large-scale solution-processing of\nelectroluminescent QLEDs poses significant challenges, particularly concerning\nthe precise control of the active layer's thickness and uniformity. These\nobstacles directly impact charge transport, leading to current leakage and\nreduced overall efficiency. Blade-coating is a prevalent and scalable solution\nprocessing technique known for its speed and minimal waste. Additionally, it\nallows for continuous \"roll-to-roll\" processing, making it highly adaptable in\nvarious applications. In this study, we demonstrate the precise control of\nblade speed in the Landau-Levich regime to create a uniform QD emission layer,\nusing a commercial CdSe/ZnS QD as a representative example. QDs assemble into\ndifferent morphologies on glass and the underlying layers of the QLED device\ndue to variations in interaction energy. The QD film thickness can be modified\nfrom monolayer to multilayer by adjusting blade speed, which can be predicted\nby fitting the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin theory. The optimal speed at 7 mm/s\nresults in a QD film with a surface coverage of around 163% and low roughness\n(1.57 nm mean square height). The QLED external quantum efficiency (EQE) of\napproximately 1.5% was achieved using commercially available CdSe/ZnS QDs with\nlow photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), and an EQE of around 7% has been\nobtained using lab-made InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs having a solution PLQY of 74%.\nAll-blade-coated CdSe-QLEDs are further demonstrated by adopting the optimized\nspeed for the QD layer. This method demonstrates significant potential for\ndeveloping low-cost, reproducible, and scalable QLED technologies with uniform\nemission characteristics and low-waste production.",

    "abstract": "Adaptively forecasting human behavior in social settings is an important step\ntoward achieving Artificial General Intelligence. Most existing research in\nsocial forecasting has focused either on unfocused interactions, such as\npedestrian trajectory prediction, or on monadic and dyadic behavior\nforecasting. In contrast, social psychology emphasizes the importance of group\ninteractions for understanding complex social dynamics. This creates a gap that\nwe address in this paper: forecasting social interactions at the group\n(conversation) level. Additionally, it is important for a forecasting model to\nbe able to adapt to groups unseen at train time, as even the same individual\nbehaves differently across different groups. This highlights the need for a\nforecasting model to explicitly account for each group's unique dynamics. To\nachieve this, we adopt a meta-learning approach to human behavior forecasting,\ntreating every group as a separate meta-learning task. As a result, our method\nconditions its predictions on the specific behaviors within the group, leading\nto generalization to unseen groups. Specifically, we introduce Social Process\n(SP) models, which predict a distribution over future multimodal cues jointly\nfor all group members based on their preceding low-level multimodal cues, while\nincorporating other past sequences of the same group's interactions. In this\nwork we also analyze the generalization capabilities of SP models in both their\noutputs and latent spaces through the use of realistic synthetic datasets.",

These\nprotections utilize a range of data sources and metrics to, for example, filter\nout malicious model updates, ensuring that the impact of attacks is minimized\nor eliminated.\n  This paper explores the feasibility of designing a generic attack method\ncapable of installing backdoors in FL while evading a diverse array of\ndefenses. Specifically, we focus on an attacker strategy called MIGO, which\naims to produce model updates that subtly blend with legitimate ones. The\nresulting effect is a gradual integration of a backdoor into the global model,\noften ensuring its persistence long after the attack concludes, while\ngenerating enough ambiguity to hinder the effectiveness of defenses.\n  MIGO was employed to implant three types of backdoors across five datasets\nand different model architectures. The results demonstrate the significant\nthreat posed by these backdoors, as MIGO consistently achieved exceptionally\nhigh backdoor accuracy (exceeding 90%) while maintaining the utility of the\nmain task. Moreover, MIGO exhibited strong evasion capabilities against ten\ndefenses, including several state-of-the-art methods. When compared to four\nother attack strategies, MIGO consistently outperformed them across most\nconfigurations.

However, studies have shown that these methods are\nsusceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in\nmajor distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed\nto reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may\nlower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we\npropose a novel approach for mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI\nreconstruction models without any retraining. Our framework is based on the\nidea of cyclic measurement consistency. The output of the model is mapped to\nanother set of MRI measurements for a different sub-sampling pattern, and this\nsynthesized data is reconstructed with the same model. Intuitively, without an\nattack, the second reconstruction is expected to be consistent with the first,\nwhile with an attack, disruptions are present. A novel objective function is\ndevised based on this idea, which is minimized within a small ball around the\nattack input for mitigation. Experimental results show that our method\nsubstantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different\ndatasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and\nquantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve\nretraining. Finally, we extend our mitigation method to two important practical\nscenarios: a blind setup, where the attack strength or algorithm is not known\nto the end user; and an adaptive attack setup, where the attacker has full\nknowledge of the defense strategy.

MSR analyzes different sources of data, such as version control\nsystems, code repositories, defect tracking systems, archived communication,\ndeployment logs, and so on, to uncover interesting and actionable insights from\nthe data for improved software development, maintenance, and evolution. This\nchapter provides an overview of MSR and how to conduct an MSR study, including\nsetting up a study, formulating research goals and questions, identifying\nrepositories, extracting and cleaning the data, performing data analysis and\nsynthesis, and discussing MSR study limitations. Furthermore, the chapter\ndiscusses MSR as part of a mixed method study, how to mine data ethically, and\ngives an overview of recent trends in MSR as well as reflects on the future. As\na teaching aid, the chapter provides tips for educators, exercises for students\nat all levels, and a list of repositories that can be used as a starting point\nfor an MSR study.",

These effects are typically neglected as they do not\narise in atomic quantum optics; however, they can play an important role in\nmolecular systems. We also consider novel collective photon-assisted transport\nand compare it against the scaling of phonon-assisted transport in chains\nfeaturing permanent dipoles, and determine a linear scaling with the number of\ndipoles, akin to single-excitation superradiance. We further demonstrate how\npermanent dipoles, dipoles can preferentially arrange energy eigenstates to\nsupport excitation transport. Finally, we show how permanent dipoles can\nenhance the ability of the molecular chain to support excitation transport\ncompared to that of systems that do not possess permanent dipoles across a\nrange of environmental and system configurations.",

    "abstract": "Simplicial complexes arising from real-world settings may not be directly\nobservable. Hence, for an unknown simplicial complex in Euclidean space, we\nwant to efficiently reconstruct it by querying local structure. In particular,\nwe are interested in queries for the indegree of a simplex $\\sigma$ in some\ndirection: the number of cofacets of $\\sigma$ contained in some halfspace\n\"below\" $\\sigma$. Fasy et al. proposed a method that, given the vertex set of a\nsimplicial complex, uses indegree queries to reconstruct the set of edges. In\nparticular, they use a sweep algorithm through the vertex set, identifying\nedges adjacent to and above each vertex in the sweeping order. The algorithm\nrelies on a natural but crucial property of the sweeping order: at a given\nvertex $v$, all edges adjacent to $v$ contained in the halfspace below $v$ have\nanother endpoint that appeared earlier in the order.\n  The edge reconstruction algorithm does not immediately extend to\nhigher-dimensional simplex reconstruction. In particular, it is not possible to\nsweep through a set of $i$-simplices in a fixed direction and maintain that all\n$(i+1)$-cofacets of a given simplex $\\sigma$ that come below $\\sigma$ are\nknown. We circumvent this by defining a sweeping order on a set of\n$i$-simplices, that additionally pairs each $i$-simplex $\\sigma$ with a\ndirection perpendicular to $\\sigma$. Analogous to Fasy et al., our order has\nthe crucial property that, at any $i$-simplex $\\sigma$ paired with direction\n$s$, each $(i+1)$-dimensional coface of $\\sigma$ that lies in the halfspace\nbelow $\\sigma$ with respect to the direction $s$ has an $i$-dimensional face\nthat appeared earlier in the order. We show how to compute such an order and\nuse it to extend the edge reconstruction algorithm of Fasy et al. to simplicial\ncomplex reconstruction. Our algorithm can reconstruct arbitrary embedded\nsimplicial complexes.",

Such areas could be better served by integrating, within PT,\nDemand-Responsive Transport (DRT), in which bus routes dynamically adapt to\nuser demand. While the literature has focused on the level of service of DRT,\nit has overlooked its contribution to accessibility, which measures the ease of\naccessing opportunities (e.g, schools, jobs, other residents). Therefore, the\nfollowing simple question remains unanswered: How many additional opportunities\nper hour can be reached when DRT is deployed? However, no method exists to\nquantify the accessibility resulting from the integration of conventional PT\nand DRT. We propose a novel method to compute isochrone-based accessibility.\nThe main challenge is that, while accessibility isochrones are computed on top\nof a graph-model of the transport system, no graph can model DRT, since its\nroutes are dynamic and stochastic. To overcome this issue, we propose a\ndata-driven method, based on the analysis of multiple days of DRT operation.\nThe methodology is tested on a case study in Acireale (Italy) simulated in\nVisum, where a many-to-many DRT service is integrated with a metropolitan mass\ntransit. We show that, regarding the currently deployed conventional bus lines,\nthe accessibility provided by DRT is much higher and its geographical\ndistribution more equal. While current DRT planning is based exclusively on\nlevel of service and cost, our approach allows DRT planners and operators to\nshift their focus on accessibility.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can significantly promote the advances in road\ntransport mobility in terms of safety, reliability, and decarbonization.\nHowever, ensuring safety and efficiency in interactive during within dynamic\nand diverse environments is still a primary barrier to large-scale AV adoption.\nIn recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an advanced\nAI-based approach, enabling AVs to learn decision-making strategies adaptively\nfrom data and interactions. DRL strategies are better suited than traditional\nrule-based methods for handling complex, dynamic, and unpredictable driving\nenvironments due to their adaptivity. However, varying driving scenarios\npresent distinct challenges, such as avoiding obstacles on highways and\nreaching specific exits at intersections, requiring different scenario-specific\ndecision-making algorithms. Many DRL algorithms have been proposed in\ninteractive decision-making. However, a rationale review of these DRL\nalgorithms across various scenarios is lacking. Therefore, a comprehensive\nevaluation is essential to assess these algorithms from multiple perspectives,\nincluding those of vehicle users and vehicle manufacturers. This survey reviews\nthe application of DRL algorithms in autonomous driving across typical\nscenarios, summarizing road features and recent advancements. The scenarios\ninclude highways, on-ramp merging, roundabouts, and unsignalized intersections.\nFurthermore, DRL-based algorithms are evaluated based on five rationale\ncriteria: driving safety, driving efficiency, training efficiency,\nunselfishness, and interpretability (DDTUI). Each criterion of DDTUI is\nspecifically analyzed in relation to the reviewed algorithms. Finally, the\nchallenges for future DRL-based decision-making algorithms are summarized.",

Yet to achieve the\nnecessary scale to remove the substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the\natmosphere relevant for ameliorating climate change, enhanced rock weathering\n(ERW) will need to be applied to very large land areas. Likewise, marine carbon\ndioxide removal (mCDR) must alter a large fraction of the ocean surface waters\nto have a significant impact upon climate. We show that surface albedo\nmodification (SAM) associated with ERW or mCDR can easily overwhelm the\nradiative forcing from the decrease of atmospheric CO2 over years or even\ndecades. A change in albedo as small as parts per thousand has a radiative\nimpact comparable to the removal of 10 tons of carbon per hectare. SAM via ERW\ncan be either cooling or warming.

To tackle this issue, we propose\nleveraging reconstructed social graph to complement interest representations\nderived from behavioral data. Despite the widespread availability of social\ngraphs on content platforms, their utility is hindered by social-relation noise\nand inconsistencies between social and behavioral interests. To mitigate noise\npropagation in graph data and extract reliable social interests, we introduce a\ndual-view denoising framework.

Surprisingly, our key findings reveal that the accuracy can\nlie: there are a considerable number of cases where higher accuracy actually\nleads to no improvement in the tuning outcomes (up to 58% cases under certain\nsetting), or even worse, it can degrade the tuning quality (up to 24% cases\nunder certain setting). We also discover that the chosen models in most\nproposed tuners are sub-optimal and that the required % of accuracy change to\nsignificantly improve tuning quality varies according to the range of model\naccuracy. Deriving from the fitness landscape analysis, we provide in-depth\ndiscussions of the rationale behind, offering several lessons learned as well\nas insights for future opportunities. Most importantly, this work poses a clear\nmessage to the community: we should take one step back from the natural\n\"accuracy is all\" belief for model-based configuration tuning.",

Fluid flows can easily deform\nthese soft hairs which in turn impacts the flow properties. At the microscale,\nflows are often confined which exacerbates this feedback loop since the hair\ndeformation has a strong impact on the flow geometry. Here, I investigate\nexperimentally and theoretically pressure driven flows in laminar channels\nobstructed by a dense array of elastic hairs. I show that the system displays a\nnonlinear hydraulic resistance that I model by treating the hair bed as a\ndeformable porous media. The porous media height and thus degree of confinement\nresults from the deflection of individual hairs. The resulting fluid-structure\ninteraction model is leveraged to identify the dimensionless drag force\n$\\hat{f}_0$ controlling the elasto-viscous coupling and used to design passive\nflow control elements for microfluidic networks.",

Primarily, DL can\nresult in deviation from the physical significance of the predictions under\nlimited data. Additionally, some predictive models are non-differentiable or\nblack-box, which cannot be adjusted using gradient-based methods. To tackle the\nabove challenges, we propose a novel framework, Decision-Focused Fine-tuning\n(DFF), which embeds the DFL module into the PO pipeline via a novel bias\ncorrection module. DFF is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that\nmaintains the proximity of the DL-enhanced model to the original predictive\nmodel within a defined trust region. We theoretically prove that DFF strictly\nconfines prediction bias within a predetermined upper bound, even with limited\ndatasets, thereby substantially reducing prediction shifts caused by DL under\nlimited data. Furthermore, the bias correction module can be integrated into\ndiverse predictive models, enhancing adaptability to a broad range of PO tasks.\nExtensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets, including network\nflow, portfolio optimization, and resource allocation problems with different\npredictive models, demonstrate that DFF not only improves decision performance\nbut also adheres to fine-tuning constraints, showcasing robust adaptability\nacross various scenarios.",

    "abstract": "During neurodevelopment, neuronal axons navigate through the extracellular\nenvironment, guided by various cues to establish connections with distant\ntarget cells. Among other factors, axon trajectories are influenced by\nheterogeneities in environmental stiffness, a process known as durotaxis, the\nguidance by substrate stiffness gradients. Here, we develop a three-scale model\nfor axonal durotaxis. At the molecular scale, we characterise the mechanical\ninteraction between the axonal growth cone cytoskeleton, based on\nmolecular-clutch-type interactions dependent on substrate stiffness. At the\ngrowth cone scale, we spatially integrate this relationship to obtain a model\nfor the traction generated by the entire growth cone. Finally, at the cell\nscale, we model the axon as a morphoelastic filament growing on an adhesive\nsubstrate, and subject to durotactic growth cone traction. Firstly, the model\npredicts that, depending on the local substrate stiffness, axons may exhibit\npositive or negative durotaxis, and we show that this key property entails the\nexistence of attractive zones of preferential stiffness in the substrate\ndomain. Second, we show that axons will exhibit reflective and refractive\nbehaviour across interface between regions of different stiffness, a basic\nprocess which may serve in the deflection of axons. Lastly, we test our model\nin a biological scenario wherein durotaxis was previously identified as a\npossible guidance mechanism in vivo.

    "abstract": "Voice Conversion (VC) aims to convert the style of a source speaker, such as\ntimbre and pitch, to the style of any target speaker while preserving the\nlinguistic content. However, the ground truth of the converted speech does not\nexist in a non-parallel VC scenario, which induces the train-inference mismatch\nproblem. Moreover, existing methods still have an inaccurate pitch and low\nspeaker adaptation quality, there is a significant disparity in pitch between\nthe source and target speaker style domains. As a result, the models tend to\ngenerate speech with hoarseness, posing challenges in achieving high-quality\nvoice conversion. In this study, we propose CycleFlow, a novel VC approach that\nleverages cycle consistency in conditional flow matching (CFM) for speaker\ntimbre adaptation training on non-parallel data. Furthermore, we design a\nDual-CFM based on VoiceCFM and PitchCFM to generate speech and improve speaker\npitch adaptation quality. Experiments show that our method can significantly\nimprove speaker similarity, generating natural and higher-quality speech.",

However, most existing UAV-OD algorithms rely on manually\ndesigned components, which require extensive tuning. End-to-end models that do\nnot depend on such manually designed components are mainly designed for natural\nimages, which are less effective for UAV imagery. To address such challenges,\nthis paper proposes an efficient detection transformer (DETR) framework\ntailored for UAV imagery, i.e., UAV-DETR. The framework includes a multi-scale\nfeature fusion with frequency enhancement module, which captures both spatial\nand frequency information at different scales. In addition, a frequency-focused\ndown-sampling module is presented to retain critical spatial details during\ndown-sampling. A semantic alignment and calibration module is developed to\nalign and fuse features from different fusion paths. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach across various\nUAV imagery datasets.

A key challenge in\nthis process is the lack of ground-truth annotations required for training deep\nneural networks, as manual labeling is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To\naddress this issue, we introduce a weakly-supervised age-tracing strategy for\nmodel fine-tuning. This approach exploits the similarity in appearance and\nland-use patterns between historical maps from neighboring time periods to\nguide the training process. Specifically, model predictions for one map are\nutilized as pseudo-labels for training on maps from adjacent time periods.\nExperiments conducted on our newly curated \\textit{Hameln} dataset demonstrate\nthat the proposed age-tracing strategy significantly enhances segmentation\nperformance compared to baseline models. In the best-case scenario, the mean\nIntersection over Union (mIoU) achieved 77.3\\%, reflecting an improvement of\napproximately 20\\% over baseline methods. Additionally, the fine-tuned model\nachieved an average overall accuracy of 97\\%, highlighting the effectiveness of\nour approach for digitizing historical maps.",

Standard training using\nambiguous data with these hard labels may produce overly confident models and\nthus leading to poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework called Quantized Label Learning (QLL) to alleviate this issue. First,\nwe formulate QLL as learning from (very) ambiguous data with hard labels:\nideally, each ambiguous instance should be associated with a ground-truth\nsoft-label distribution describing its corresponding probabilistic weight in\neach class, however, this is usually not accessible; in practice, we can only\nobserve a quantized label, i.e., a hard label sampled (quantized) from the\ncorresponding ground-truth soft-label distribution, of each instance, which can\nbe seen as a biased approximation of the ground-truth soft-label. Second, we\npropose a Class-wise Positive-Unlabeled (CPU) risk estimator that allows us to\ntrain accurate classifiers from only ambiguous data with quantized labels.\nThird, to simulate ambiguous datasets with quantized labels in the real world,\nwe design a mixing-based ambiguous data generation procedure for empirical\nevaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our CPU method can significantly\nimprove model generalization performance and outperform the baselines.",

However,\ncultural value misalignments may exist in generated texts, such as the\nmisrepresentation of historical facts, the erosion of cultural identity, and\nthe oversimplification of complex cultural narratives, which may lead to severe\nconsequences. Therefore, investigating value misalignment in the context of LLM\nfor cultural heritage is crucial for mitigating these risks, yet there has been\na significant lack of systematic and comprehensive study and investigation in\nthis area. To fill this gap, we systematically assess the reliability of LLMs\nin generating culturally aligned texts for cultural heritage-related tasks. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation by compiling an extensive set of 1066 query\ntasks covering 5 widely recognized categories with 17 aspects within the\nknowledge framework of cultural heritage across 5 open-source LLMs, and examine\nboth the type and rate of cultural value misalignments in the generated texts.\nUsing both automated and manual approaches, we effectively detect and analyze\nthe cultural value misalignments in LLM-generated texts.

While pre-trained\nfoundation models have made considerable progress in natural language\nprocessing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their application to time series\nanalysis has been hindered by data scarcity. Although several large language\nmodel (LLM)-based methods have been proposed for time series forecasting, time\nseries captioning is under-explored in the context of LLMs. In this paper, we\nintroduce TSLM, a novel time series language model designed specifically for\ntime series captioning. TSLM operates as an encoder-decoder model, leveraging\nboth text prompts and time series data representations to capture subtle\ntemporal patterns across multiple phases and generate precise textual\ndescriptions of time series inputs. TSLM addresses the data scarcity problem in\ntime series captioning by first leveraging an in-context prompting synthetic\ndata generation, and second denoising the generated data via a novel\ncross-modal dense retrieval scoring applied to time series-caption pairs.\nExperimental findings on various time series captioning datasets demonstrate\nthat TSLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches from multiple data\nmodalities by a significant margin.",

    "abstract": "When a system's constraints change abruptly, the system's reachability safety\ndoes no longer sustain. Thus, the system can reach a forbidden/dangerous value.\nConventional remedy practically involves online controller redesign (OCR) to\nre-establish the reachability's compliance with the new constraints, which,\nhowever, is usually too slow. There is a need for an online strategy capable of\nmanaging runtime changes in reachability constraints. However, to the best of\nthe authors' knowledge, this topic has not been addressed in the existing\nliterature. In this paper, we propose a fast fault tolerance strategy to\nrecover the system's reachability safety in runtime. Instead of redesigning the\nsystem's controller, we propose to change the system's reference state to\nmodify the system's reachability to comply with the new constraints. We frame\nthe reference state search as an optimization problem and employ the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) method as well as the Interior Point Method (IPM)\nbased Newton's method (as a fallback for the KKT method) for fast solution\nderivation. The optimization also allows more future fault tolerance. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate that our method outperforms the conventional OCR method\nin terms of computational efficiency and success rate. Specifically, the\nresults show that the proposed method finds a solution $10^{2}$ (with the IPM\nbased Newton's method) $\\sim 10^{4}$ (with the KKT method) times faster than\nthe OCR method. Additionally, the improvement rate of the success rate of our\nmethod over the OCR method is $40.81\\%$ without considering the deadline of run\ntime. The success rate remains at $49.44\\%$ for the proposed method, while it\nbecomes $0\\%$ for the OCR method when a deadline of $1.5 \\; seconds$ is\nimposed.",

    "abstract": "Recently, over-the-air federated learning (FL) has attracted significant\nattention for its ability to enhance communication efficiency. However, the\nperformance of over-the-air FL is often constrained by device selection\nstrategies and signal aggregation errors. In particular, neglecting straggler\ndevices in FL can lead to a decline in the fairness of model updates and\namplify the global model's bias toward certain devices' data, ultimately\nimpacting the overall system performance. To address this issue, we propose a\njoint device selection and transmit power optimization framework that ensures\nthe appropriate participation of straggler devices, maintains efficient\ntraining performance, and guarantees timely updates. First, we conduct a\ntheoretical analysis to quantify the convergence upper bound of over-the-air FL\nunder age-of-information (AoI)-based device selection. Our analysis further\nreveals that both the number of selected devices and the signal aggregation\nerrors significantly influence the convergence upper bound. To minimize the\nexpected weighted sum peak age of information, we calculate device priorities\nfor each communication round using Lyapunov optimization and select the\nhighest-priority devices via a greedy algorithm. Then, we formulate and solve a\ntransmit power and normalizing factor optimization problem for selected devices\nto minimize the time-average mean squared error (MSE). Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method offers two significant advantages: (1) it\nreduces MSE and improves model performance compared to baseline methods, and\n(2) it strikes a balance between fairness and training efficiency while\nmaintaining satisfactory timeliness, ensuring stable model performance.",

This paper unifies a wealth of well-known kernels into a\nsingle parametric class that encompasses them as special cases, attained either\nby exact parameterization or through parametric asymptotics. We furthermore\ncharacterize the Sobolev space that is norm equivalent to the RKHS associated\nwith the new kernel.

While TDEs in quiescent galaxies are relatively\nwell understood, identifying TDEs in active galactic nuclei (AGN) still remains\na significant challenge. We present the discovery of AT2021aeuk, a transient\nexhibiting dual flares within around three years in a narrow-line Seyfert 1\ngalaxy. Multi-wavelength observations triggered during the second flare in 2023\nrevealed an extraordinary X-ray V-shaped light curve, strongly anti-correlated\nwith the optical light curve and accompanied by a lag of $\\sim$40 days. This\nbehavior is inconsistent with both supernova and pure AGN origins. In addition,\na new broad component emerges in the Balmer lines during the second flare,\nshowing a clear reverberation signal to the continuum variation. We propose\nthat the dual-flare may be linked to a repeating partial TDE (rpTDE), where the\nsecond flare results from a collision between the TDE stream and the inner\naccretion disk, triggering an optical flare while simultaneously partially\ndestroying the X-ray corona. However, other mechanisms, such as a stellar-mass\nBH (sBH) merger within an accretion disk, could produce similar phenomena,\nwhich we cannot entirely rule out. The Vera C.

While previous work examined chaotic unitary\ncircuits, Hamiltonian evolution, and systems with global conserved charges, we\nstudy the projected ensemble in systems where there are an extensive number of\nconserved charges all of which have (quasi)local support. We employ a strongly\ndisordered quantum spin chain which shows many-body localized dynamics over\nlong timescales as well as the $\\ell$-bit model, a phenomenological archetype\nof a many-body localized system, with the charges being $1$-local in the\nlatter.

We first identified 18 ``green drivers'' (GD) that\ncould directly impact SLR sustainability, and we distilled 25 sustainability\nindicators (SI) associated with the GD to assess SLRs regarding their\nsustainability. A preliminary evaluation was conducted on the ten top-cited\nSLRs in software engineering published over the last decade. From this\nanalysis, we synthesized our insights into 12 leverage points for\nsustainability. Our results indicate that even in high-quality reviews, there\nare threats to sustainability, such as: flaws in the search process, lack of\nessential details in the documentation, weak collaboration with stakeholders,\npoor knowledge management, lack of use of supporting tools, and a dearth of\npractical insights for software engineering practitioners. The good news is\nthat moving towards sustainable SLRs only requires some simple actions, which\ncan pave the way for a profound change in the software engineering community's\nmindset about how to create and sustain SLRs.",

Next,\nwe demonstrate that an adversary can generate query-independent token sequences\nwe call ``confounder gadgets'' that, when added to any query, cause LLM routers\nto send the query to a strong LLM.\n  Our quantitative evaluation shows that this attack is successful both in\nwhite-box and black-box settings against a variety of open-source and\ncommercial routers, and that confounding queries do not affect the quality of\nLLM responses. Finally, we demonstrate that gadgets can be effective while\nmaintaining low perplexity, thus perplexity-based filtering is not an effective\ndefense.

    "abstract": "Most facial expression recognition (FER) models are trained on large-scale\nexpression data with centralized learning. Unfortunately, collecting a large\namount of centralized expression data is difficult in practice due to privacy\nconcerns of facial images. In this paper, we investigate FER under the\nframework of personalized federated learning, which is a valuable and practical\ndecentralized setting for real-world applications. To this end, we develop a\nnovel uncertainty-Aware label refineMent on hYpergraphs (AMY) method. For local\ntraining, each local model consists of a backbone, an uncertainty estimation\n(UE) block, and an expression classification (EC) block. In the UE block, we\nleverage a hypergraph to model complex high-order relationships between\nexpression samples and incorporate these relationships into uncertainty\nfeatures. A personalized uncertainty estimator is then introduced to estimate\nreliable uncertainty weights of samples in the local client. In the EC block,\nwe perform label propagation on the hypergraph, obtaining high-quality refined\nlabels for retraining an expression classifier. Based on the above, we\neffectively alleviate heterogeneous sample uncertainty across clients and learn\na robust personalized FER model in each client. Experimental results on two\nchallenging real-world facial expression databases show that our proposed\nmethod consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. This\nindicates the superiority of hypergraph modeling for uncertainty estimation and\nlabel refinement on the personalized federated FER task.

To explore this design space,\nwe invited 15 multidisciplinary experts to join co-design improvisation\nsessions, where they manually manoeuvred a deactivated robotic partition to\ndesign gestures conveying six architectural intents that varied in purpose and\nurgency. Using a gesture elicitation method alongside motion-tracking data, a\nLaban-based questionnaire, and thematic analysis, we identified 20 unique\ngestural strategies.

Second, I analyze removal data for two invasive rodent species,\nnamely coypus (Myocastor coypus) in France and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) in\nthe Netherlands. Using hierarchical multinomial N-mixture models, I examine the\neffects of temperature on abundance while accounting for imperfect and\ntime-varying capture probabilities. I also show how to accommodate spatial\nvariability using random effects, quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates,\nand account for violations of closure by fitting an open-population model to\nmulti-year data.

This means the lowest state\nof $\\Omega_{ccb}$ baryon is dominated by the $\\lambda$-mode, however, the\ndominant orbital excitation for $\\Omega_{bbc}$ baryon is $\\rho$-mode. In\naddition, the influence of configuration mixing on mass spectrum, which is\ninduced by different angular momentum assignments, is also analyzed. It shows\nthat energy of the lowest state will be further lowered by this mixing effect.\nAccording to this conclusion, we systematically analyze the mass spectra of the\nground and excited states($1S\\sim4S$, $1P\\sim4P$, $1D\\sim4D$, $1F\\sim4F$ and\n$1G\\sim4G$) of $\\Omega_{ccb}$, $\\Omega_{bbc}$, $\\Omega_{ccc}$ and\n$\\Omega_{bbb}$ baryons.

In the United States, Section 4.2(a) of Executive Order\n14110 instructs the Secretary of Commerce to require extensive reporting from\ndevelopers of AI models above a certain training compute threshold. In the\nEuropean Union, Article 51 of the AI Act establishes a presumption that AI\nmodels above a certain compute threshold have high impact capabilities and\nhence pose systemic risk, thus subjecting their developers to several\nobligations including capability evaluations, reporting, and incident\nmonitoring. In this paper, we examine some enhancement techniques that are\ncapable of decreasing training compute usage while preserving, or even\nincreasing, model capabilities. Since training compute thresholds rely on\ntraining compute as a metric and trigger for increased regulatory attention,\nthese capability-enhancing and compute-saving techniques could constitute a\nlegal loophole to existing training compute thresholds. In particular, we\nconcentrate on four illustrative techniques (fine-tuning, model reuse, model\nexpansion, and above compute-optimal inference compute) with the goal of\nfurthering the conversation about their implications on training compute\nthresholds as a legal mechanism and advancing policy recommendations that could\naddress the relevant legal loopholes.",

This\nperspective, however, fails to capture the convergence connections between\nthese algorithms and may lead to incorrect conclusions, for example, that the\nconvergence of TD implies the convergence of FQI. In this paper, we focus on\nlinear value function approximation and offer a new perspective, unifying TD,\nFQI, and PFQI as the same iterative method for solving the Least Squares\nTemporal Difference (LSTD) system, but using different preconditioners and\nmatrix splitting schemes. TD uses a constant preconditioner, FQI employs a\ndata-feature adaptive preconditioner, and PFQI transitions between the two.\nThen, we reveal that in the context of linear function approximation,\nincreasing the number of updates under the same target value function\nessentially represents a transition from using a constant preconditioner to\ndata-feature adaptive preconditioner. This unifying perspective also simplifies\nthe analyses of the convergence conditions for these algorithms and clarifies\nmany issues. Consequently, we fully characterize the convergence of each\nalgorithm without assuming specific properties of the chosen features (e.g.,\nlinear independence). We also examine how common assumptions about feature\nrepresentations affect convergence, and discover new conditions on features\nthat are important for convergence.

To alleviate this\nlimitation, we propose TCPFormer, which leverages an implicit pose proxy as an\nintermediate representation. Each proxy within the implicit pose proxy can\nbuild one temporal correlation therefore helping us learn more comprehensive\ntemporal correlation of human motion. Specifically, our method consists of\nthree key components: Proxy Update Module (PUM), Proxy Invocation Module (PIM),\nand Proxy Attention Module (PAM). PUM first uses pose features to update the\nimplicit pose proxy, enabling it to store representative information from the\npose sequence. PIM then invocates and integrates the pose proxy with the pose\nsequence to enhance the motion semantics of each pose. Finally, PAM leverages\nthe above mapping between the pose sequence and pose proxy to enhance the\ntemporal correlation of the whole pose sequence. Experiments on the Human3.6M\nand MPI-INF-3DHP datasets demonstrate that our proposed TCPFormer outperforms\nthe previous state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Many materials, such as paints and inks used in applications like painting\nand 3D printing, are concentrated granular suspensions. In such systems, the\ncontact line dynamics and the internal structure of the suspension interact\nthrough shear-rate dependent viscosity and internal structural rearrangements.\nThe shear rate increases sharply near moving contact lines, profoundly\ninfluencing the non-Newtonian rheology of dense suspensions. Frictional\ncontacts become significant as particles approach each other, forming\nforce-carrying networks of contacts. While hydrodynamic solutions can describe\ndilute suspensions, their applicability near advancing contact lines in dense\nsuspensions remains unclear. This study explores such applicability by\nsystematically varying inter-particle interactions. We use silica suspensions\nin two refractive-index matched media: (i) aqueous 2,$2^{\\prime}$-thiodiethanol\n(weak interactions) and (ii) aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution (strong\ninteractions). The two samples vary substantially in their rheological\nresponse. Using astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry (APTV), we precisely\ntrack the 3D motion of tracer particles within the suspension. To observe the\ndrop over a long travel distance, we use a configuration consisting of a pinned\ndroplet on a moving substrate. We observe distinct behaviours depending on\nparticle interactions and the resulting suspension rheology. The more the\nparticle interactions play a role, i.e., the more pronounced the non-Newtonian\neffects, the stronger the measured flow profiles differ from the Newtonian\nsolution to the hydrodynamic equations. In case of the viscous suspension, a\nnotable deviation from Newtonian behaviour is observed. Conversely, the\nyield-stress suspension exhibits plug flow over the substrate, with\nNewtonian-like behaviour restricted to the yielded region near the substrate.",

    "abstract": "Generalized age feature extraction is crucial for age-related facial analysis\ntasks, such as age estimation and age-invariant face recognition (AIFR).\nDespite the recent successes of models in homogeneous-dataset experiments,\ntheir performance drops significantly in cross-dataset evaluations. Most of\nthese models fail to extract generalized age features as they only attempt to\nmap extracted features with training age labels directly without explicitly\nmodeling the natural ordinal progression of aging. In this paper, we propose\nOrder-Enhanced Contrastive Learning (OrdCon), a novel contrastive learning\nframework designed explicitly for ordinal attributes like age. Specifically, to\nextract generalized features, OrdCon aligns the direction vector of two\nfeatures with either the natural aging direction or its reverse to model the\nordinal process of aging. To further enhance generalizability, OrdCon leverages\na novel soft proxy matching loss as a second contrastive objective, ensuring\nthat features are positioned around the center of each age cluster with minimal\nintra-class variance and proportionally away from other clusters. By modeling\nthe ageing process, the framework can enhance generalizability by improving the\nalignment of samples from the same class and reducing the divergence of\ndirection vectors. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable\nresults to state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets in\nhomogeneous-dataset evaluations for both age estimation and AIFR. In\ncross-dataset experiments, OrdCon outperforms other methods by reducing the\nmean absolute error by approximately 1.38 on average for the age estimation\ntask and boosts the average accuracy for AIFR by 1.87%.",

This research presents an\ninnovative streak visualization method designed to offer a simple and robust\napproach to identify transitional turbulent patterns in particulate pipe flows\nwith neutrally buoyant particles. The technique employs a laser arrangement and\na low-cost camera setup to capture particle-generated streaks within the fluid,\nenabling real-time observation of flow patterns. Validation of the proposed\nmethod was conducted through comparison with established techniques like\nParticle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and pressure drop measurements, confirming its\naccuracy and reliability. Experiments demonstrate the streak visualization\nmethod's capacity to differentiate between laminar, transitional, and turbulent\nflow regimes by analyzing the standard deviation of streak angles. The method\nis especially efficient at low particle concentration, ie precisely where other\nmore established methods become less effective. Furthermore, this technique\nenables us to identify a critical Reynolds number using Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence built on the statistical distribution of streak angles, which is\nconsistent with previous studies.\n  Because it is effective at low concentrations and robust, this streak\nvisualization technique opens new perspectives for the characterization of\nparticulate pipe flows not only in the confines of the laboratory but also in\nless controlled industrial multi-phase flows where determining the laminar or\nturbulent nature of the flow is a prerequisite for flowmeter calibration.",

Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) can\nbe effectively used for Generative Error Correction (GER) in ASR by predicting\nthe best transcription from ASR-generated N-best hypotheses. However, these\nLLMs lack the ability to simultaneously understand audio and visual, making the\nGER approach challenging to apply in AVSR. In this work, we propose a novel GER\nparadigm for AVSR, termed AVGER, that follows the concept of ``listening and\nseeing again''. Specifically, we first use the powerful AVSR system to read the\naudio and visual signals to get the N-Best hypotheses, and then use the\nQ-former-based Multimodal Synchronous Encoder to read the audio and visual\ninformation again and convert them into an audio and video compression\nrepresentation respectively that can be understood by LLM. Afterward, the\naudio-visual compression representation and the N-Best hypothesis together\nconstitute a Cross-modal Prompt to guide the LLM in producing the best\ntranscription. In addition, we also proposed a Multi-Level Consistency\nConstraint training criterion, including logits-level, utterance-level and\nrepresentations-level, to improve the correction accuracy while enhancing the\ninterpretability of audio and visual compression representations. The\nexperimental results on the LRS3 dataset show that our method outperforms\ncurrent mainstream AVSR systems. The proposed AVGER can reduce the Word Error\nRate (WER) by 24% compared to them.

    "abstract": "Cancer remains a significant health challenge worldwide, with a new diagnosis\noccurring every two minutes in the UK. Surgery is one of the main treatment\noptions for cancer. However, surgeons rely on the sense of touch and naked eye\nwith limited use of pre-operative image data to directly guide the excision of\ncancerous tissues and metastases due to the lack of reliable intraoperative\nvisualisation tools. This leads to increased costs and harm to the patient\nwhere the cancer is removed with positive margins, or where other critical\nstructures are unintentionally impacted. There is therefore a pressing need for\nmore reliable and accurate intraoperative visualisation tools for minimally\ninvasive surgery to improve surgical outcomes and enhance patient care.\n  A recent miniaturised cancer detection probe (i.e., SENSEI developed by\nLightpoint Medical Ltd.) leverages the cancer-targeting ability of nuclear\nagents to more accurately identify cancer intra-operatively using the emitted\ngamma signal. However, the use of this probe presents a visualisation challenge\nas the probe is non-imaging and is air-gapped from the tissue, making it\nchallenging for the surgeon to locate the probe-sensing area on the tissue\nsurface. Geometrically, the sensing area is defined as the intersection point\nbetween the gamma probe axis and the tissue surface in 3D space but projected\nonto the 2D laparoscopic image. Hence, in this thesis, tool tracking, pose\nestimation, and segmentation tools were developed first, followed by\nlaparoscope image depth estimation algorithms and 3D reconstruction methods.",

For\ninstance, empirical investigations utilizing EEG data from rats have identified\nintermittent transitions between $\\delta$ and $\\theta$ rhythms, with the\nduration of $\\theta$ rhythm exhibiting a power-law distribution. However, a\ndynamic model to account for this phenomenon is currently absent. In this\nstudy, we introduce a network of sparsely coupled excitatory and inhibitory\npopulations of quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons to demonstrate that\nintermittent transitions can emerge from the intrinsic fluctuations of a\nfinite-sized system, particularly when the system is positioned near a Hopf\nbifurcation point, which is a critical point. The resulting power-law\ndistributions and exponents are consistent with empirical observations.\nAdditionally, we illustrate how modifications in network connectivity can\naffect the power-law exponent by influencing the attractivity and oscillation\nfrequency of the stable limit cycle. Our findings, interpreted through the\nfundamental dynamics of neuronal networks, provide a plausible mechanism for\nthe generation of intermittent transitions between cortical rhythms, in\nalignment with the power-law distributions documented in empirical researches.",

    "abstract": "The discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has been widely considered in recent\nyears to develop scalable flow solvers for its ability to handle\ndiscontinuities, such as shocks and detonations, with greater accuracy and high\narithmetic intensity. However, its scalability is severely affected by\ncommunication bottlenecks that arise from data movement and synchronization at\nextreme scales. Recently, an asynchronous discontinuous Galerkin (ADG) method\nwas proposed to reduce communication overhead by either relaxing\nsynchronization or avoiding communication between processing elements (PEs).\nThe numerical properties of the ADG method were verified by solving simple\none-dimensional partial differential equations. In this study, the application\nof the ADG method is extended to complex chemically reacting flows,\nparticularly to evaluate its efficacy in capturing flame fronts and\ndetonations. New asynchrony-tolerant weighted essentially non-oscillatory\n(AT-WENO) limiters are derived to accurately capture flow discontinuities with\ncommunication delays at the PE boundaries. The numerical accuracy of the ADG\nmethod is verified on the premixed spontaneous ignition of a fuel-lean mixture\nwith detailed chemistry. The progression of the flame front is accurately\nrepresented by the ADG method, and the numerical errors incurred at the PE\nboundaries turn out to be insignificant. The efficacy of the AT-WENO limiters\nin capturing discontinuities is demonstrated by the propagation of a detonation\nwave. The findings of this study serve as a basis for the development of highly\nscalable discontinuous Galerkin-based solvers for combustion simulations on\nmassively parallel supercomputers.",

    "abstract": "Using the volume averaging technique of Jackson (1997), we derive a set of\ntwo-fluid equations that describe the dynamics of a mono-disperse non-Brownian\ncolloidal suspension in the semi-dilute regime. The equations are tensorial and\ncan be applied in arbitrary geometries. Closure models are developed that\nrepresent the stress surrounding each particle as a sum of stresses due to\nfluid movement through a fixed bed of particles, and those due to interactions\nbetween particles. Emphasising pragmatism, the developed closure models are\nconsistent with current knowledge of particle interactions in these systems but\nemploy parameters that can be tuned to represent the microstructure of specific\nparticle suspensions. Within the interaction model, a model for the particle\ndistribution around each particle is used that depends on the strain rate\nfield, allowing anisotropy of the microstructure (and hence normal suspension\nstresses) to develop within the suspension in response to arbitrary strain\nfields. Force moments acting on particles during particle interactions are\ncalculating by summing hydrodynamic contributions between particle pairs, but\nadjusted to recognise that multi-particle interactions can increase the\neffective stress generated during each interaction. Finally, an order of\nmagnitude analysis is performed on the derived momentum equations to determine\nwhat terms are significant, leaving only terms in the final equations that are\nrequired to predict behaviour during laminar flow within the targeted\nsemi-dilute regime. In a companion paper (referred to as paper II, Noori et.\nal., 2024) we chose sets of microstructure parameters that predict\nexperimentally measured bulk suspension behaviour, creating a link between\nparticle properties (i.e. roughness), suspension microstructure and\nshear-induced particle migration in arbitrary flow fields.",

Large Language Models (LLMs), now a pervasive technology in our\neveryday lives, can cause extensive harm when prone to generating toxic\nresponses. The standard way to address this issue is to align the LLM, which,\nhowever, dampens the issue without constituting a definitive solution.\nTherefore, testing LLM even after alignment efforts remains crucial for\ndetecting any residual deviations with respect to ethical standards. We present\nEvoTox, an automated testing framework for LLMs' inclination to toxicity,\nproviding a way to quantitatively assess how much LLMs can be pushed towards\ntoxic responses even in the presence of alignment. The framework adopts an\niterative evolution strategy that exploits the interplay between two LLMs, the\nSystem Under Test (SUT) and the Prompt Generator steering SUT responses toward\nhigher toxicity. The toxicity level is assessed by an automated oracle based on\nan existing toxicity classifier. We conduct a quantitative and qualitative\nempirical evaluation using four state-of-the-art LLMs as evaluation subjects\nhaving increasing complexity (7-13 billion parameters). Our quantitative\nevaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness of four alternative versions of\nEvoTox against existing baseline methods, based on random search, curated\ndatasets of toxic prompts, and adversarial attacks. Our qualitative assessment\nengages human evaluators to rate the fluency of the generated prompts and the\nperceived toxicity of the responses collected during the testing sessions.\nResults indicate that the effectiveness, in terms of detected toxicity level,\nis significantly higher than the selected baseline methods (effect size up to\n1.0 against random search and up to 0.99 against adversarial attacks).\nFurthermore, EvoTox yields a limited cost overhead (from 22% to 35% on\naverage).",

The wing of a bat consists of an elastic membrane supported by\na highly articulated skeleton, enabling localized control over wing movement\nand deformation during flight. By modeling these complex deformations, along\nwith realistic wing movements and interactions with the surrounding airflow, we\nexpect to gain new insights into the performance of these unique wings. Our\nmodel achieves a high degree of realism by incorporating experimental\nmeasurements of the skeleton's joint movements to guide the fluid-structure\ninteraction simulations. The simulations reveal that different segments of the\nwing undergo distinct aeroelastic deformations, impacting flow dynamics and\naerodynamic loads. Specifically, the simulations show significant variations in\nthe effectiveness of the wing in generating lift, drag, and thrust forces\nacross different segments and regions of the wing. We employ a force\npartitioning method to analyze the causality of pressure loads over the wing,\ndemonstrating that vortex-induced pressure forces are dominant while added mass\ncontributions to aerodynamic loads are minimal. This approach also elucidates\nthe role of various flow structures in shaping pressure distributions. Finally,\nwe compare the fully articulated, flexible bat wing to equivalent stiff wings\nderived from the same kinematics, demonstrating the critical impact of wing\narticulation and deformation on aerodynamic efficiency.",

To tackle these\nproblems, we propose AR4D, a novel paradigm for SDS-free 4D generation.\nSpecifically, our paradigm consists of three stages. To begin with, for a\nmonocular video that is either generated or captured, we first utilize\npre-trained expert models to create a 3D representation of the first frame,\nwhich is further fine-tuned to serve as the canonical space. Subsequently,\nmotivated by the fact that videos happen naturally in an autoregressive manner,\nwe propose to generate each frame's 3D representation based on its previous\nframe's representation, as this autoregressive generation manner can facilitate\nmore accurate geometry and motion estimation. Meanwhile, to prevent overfitting\nduring this process, we introduce a progressive view sampling strategy,\nutilizing priors from pre-trained large-scale 3D reconstruction models.

We emphasize that the synergy between AI-driven\nsolutions and policy interventions is essential for neutralizing cyber threats\nand mitigating their negative impact on the digital economy. Finally, we\nunderscore the need for continuous adaptation of these strategies, especially\nin response to the rapid advancement of autonomous AI-driven attacks, to ensure\nthe creation of secure and resilient digital ecosystems.",

We aim to evaluate the types of DTs described in the literature,\nidentifying their purposes, the areas of tourism where they have been proposed,\ntheir main components, and possible future directions based on current work.\n  Design/methodology/approach: We conducted this SLR with bibliometric analysis\nbased on an existing, validated methodology. Thirty-four peer-reviewed studies\nfrom three major scientific databases were selected for review. They were\ncategorized using a taxonomy that included tourism type, purpose, spatial\nscale, data sources, data linkage, visualization, and application.\n  Findings: The topic is at an early, evolving stage, as the oldest study found\ndates back to 2021. Most reviewed studies deal with cultural tourism, focusing\non digitising cultural heritage. Destination management is the primary purpose\nof these DTs, with mainly site-level spatial scales. In many studies, the\nphysical-digital data linkage is unilateral, lacking twin synchronization. In\nmost DTs considered bilateral, the linkage is indirect. There are more applied\nthan theoretical studies, suggesting progress in applying DTs in the field.\nFinally, there is an extensive research gap regarding DT technology in tourism,\nwhich is worth filling.\n  Originality/Value: This paper presents a novel SLR with a bibliometric\nanalysis of DTs' applied and theoretical application in tourism. Each reviewed\npublication is assessed and characterized, identifying the current state of the\ntopic, possible research gaps, and future directions.",

    "abstract": "Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) is expected to play a pivotal\nrole in future 6G networks. To maximize time-frequency resource utilization, 6G\nISAC systems must exploit data payload signals, that are inherently random, for\nboth communication and sensing tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive\nanalysis of the sensing performance of such communication-centric ISAC signals,\nwith a focus on modulation and pulse shaping design to reshape the statistical\nproperties of their auto-correlation functions (ACFs), thereby improving the\ntarget ranging performance. We derive a closed-form expression for the\nexpectation of the squared ACF of random ISAC signals, considering arbitrary\nmodulation bases and constellation mappings within the Nyquist pulse shaping\nframework. The structure is metaphorically described as an ``iceberg hidden in\nthe sea\", where the ``iceberg'' represents the squared mean of the ACF of\nrandom ISAC signals, that is determined by the pulse shaping filter, and the\n``sea level'' characterizes the corresponding variance, caused by the\nrandomness of the data payload. Our analysis shows that, for QAM/PSK\nconstellations with Nyquist pulse shaping, Orthogonal Frequency Division\nMultiplexing (OFDM) achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe level across all lags.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose a novel Nyquist pulse shaping design to\nenhance the sensing performance of random ISAC signals. Numerical results\nvalidate our theoretical findings, showing that the proposed pulse shaping\nsignificantly reduces ranging sidelobes compared to conventional root-raised\ncosine (RRC) pulse shaping, thereby improving the ranging performance.",

Most existing FAS methods are\nformulated as binary classification tasks, providing confidence scores without\ninterpretation. They exhibit limited generalization in out-of-domain scenarios,\nsuch as new environments or unseen spoofing types. In this work, we introduce a\nmultimodal large language model (MLLM) framework for FAS, termed Interpretable\nFace Anti-Spoofing (I-FAS), which transforms the FAS task into an interpretable\nvisual question answering (VQA) paradigm. Specifically, we propose a\nSpoof-aware Captioning and Filtering (SCF) strategy to generate high-quality\ncaptions for FAS images, enriching the model's supervision with natural\nlanguage interpretations. To mitigate the impact of noisy captions during\ntraining, we develop a Lopsided Language Model (L-LM) loss function that\nseparates loss calculations for judgment and interpretation, prioritizing the\noptimization of the former. Furthermore, to enhance the model's perception of\nglobal visual features, we design a Globally Aware Connector (GAC) to align\nmulti-level visual representations with the language model.

    "abstract": "The compression of real-world scanned 3D human dynamic meshes is an emerging\nresearch area, driven by applications such as telepresence, virtual reality,\nand 3D digital streaming. Unlike synthesized dynamic meshes with fixed\ntopology, scanned dynamic meshes often not only have varying topology across\nframes but also scan defects such as holes and outliers, increasing the\ncomplexity of prediction and compression. Additionally, human meshes often\ncombine rigid and non-rigid motions, making accurate prediction and encoding\nsignificantly more difficult compared to objects that exhibit purely rigid\nmotion. To address these challenges, we propose a compression method designed\nfor real-world scanned human dynamic meshes, leveraging embedded key nodes. The\ntemporal motion of each vertex is formulated as a distance-weighted combination\nof transformations from neighboring key nodes, requiring the transmission of\nsolely the key nodes' transformations. To enhance the quality of the\nKeyNode-driven prediction, we introduce an octree-based residual coding scheme\nand a Dual-direction prediction mode, which uses I-frames from both directions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant\nimprovements over the state-of-the-art, with an average bitrate savings of\n58.43% across the evaluated sequences, particularly excelling at low bitrates.",

    "abstract": "The Certainty Equivalent heuristic (CE) is a widely-used algorithm for\nvarious dynamic resource allocation problems in OR and OM. Despite its\npopularity, existing theoretical guarantees of CE are limited to settings\nsatisfying restrictive fluid regularity conditions, particularly, the\nnon-degeneracy conditions, under the widely held belief that the violation of\nsuch conditions leads to performance deterioration and necessitates algorithmic\ninnovation beyond CE.\n  In this work, we conduct a refined performance analysis of CE within the\ngeneral framework of online linear programming. We show that CE achieves\nuniformly near-optimal regret (up to a polylogarithmic factor in $T$) under\nonly mild assumptions on the underlying distribution, without relying on any\nfluid regularity conditions. Our result implies that, contrary to prior belief,\nCE effectively beats the curse of degeneracy for a wide range of problem\ninstances with continuous conditional reward distributions, highlighting the\ndistinction of the problem's structure between discrete and non-discrete\nsettings. Our explicit regret bound interpolates between the mild $(\\log T)^2$\nregime and the worst-case $\\sqrt{T}$ regime with a parameter $\\beta$\nquantifying the minimal rate of probability accumulation of the conditional\nreward distributions, generalizing prior findings in the multisecretary\nsetting.\n  To achieve these results, we develop novel algorithmic analytical techniques.\nDrawing tools from the empirical processes theory, we establish strong\nconcentration analysis of the solutions to random linear programs, leading to\nimproved regret analysis under significantly relaxed assumptions.

In this paper, we\nfocus on improving the agent generalization capabilities of LLMs via\ninstruction tuning. We first observe that the existing agent training corpus\nexhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to\ngeneralize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting\nerrors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while. We\nanalyze that the poor generalization ability comes from overfitting to several\nmanual agent environments and a lack of adaptation to new situations. They\nstruggle with the wrong action steps and can not learn from the experience but\njust memorize existing observation-action relations.

Specifically, we propose an agent synthesis framework to encompass\na diverse array of environments and tasks and prompt a strong LLM to refine its\nerror action according to the environment feedback.

Most existing methods implicitly assume that multi-modal data\nis correctly labeled, which is expensive and even unattainable due to the\ninevitable imperfect annotations (i.e., noisy labels) in real-world scenarios.\nInspired by human cognitive learning, a few methods introduce self-paced\nlearning (SPL) to gradually train the model from easy to hard samples, which is\noften used to mitigate the effects of feature noise or outliers. It is a\nless-touched problem that how to utilize SPL to alleviate the misleading of\nnoisy labels on the hash model. To tackle this problem, we propose a new\ncognitive cross-modal retrieval method called Robust Self-paced Hashing with\nNoisy Labels (RSHNL), which can mimic the human cognitive process to identify\nthe noise while embracing robustness against noisy labels. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a contrastive hashing learning (CHL) scheme to improve\nmulti-modal consistency, thereby reducing the inherent semantic gap. Afterward,\nwe propose center aggregation learning (CAL) to mitigate the intra-class\nvariations. Finally, we propose Noise-tolerance Self-paced Hashing (NSH) that\ndynamically estimates the learning difficulty for each instance and\ndistinguishes noisy labels through the difficulty level. For all estimated\nclean pairs, we further adopt a self-paced regularizer to gradually learn hash\ncodes from easy to hard.

However,\ntensor data are often accompanied by arbitrary signal corruptions, including\nmissing entries and sparse noise. A fundamental challenge is to reliably\nextract the meaningful information from corrupted tensor data in a\nstatistically and computationally efficient manner. This paper develops a\nscaled gradient descent (ScaledGD) algorithm to directly estimate the tensor\nfactors with tailored spectral initializations under the tensor-tensor product\n(t-product) and tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) framework. In\ntheory, ScaledGD achieves linear convergence at a constant rate that is\nindependent of the condition number of the ground truth low-rank tensor for two\ncanonical problems -- tensor robust principal component analysis and tensor\ncompletion -- as long as the level of corruptions is not too large and the\nsample size is sufficiently large, while maintaining the low per-iteration cost\nof gradient descent. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first\nalgorithm that provably has such properties for low-rank tensor estimation with\nthe t-SVD decomposition. Finally, numerical examples are provided to\ndemonstrate the efficacy of ScaledGD in accelerating the convergence rate of\nill-conditioned low-rank tensor estimation in these two applications.",

This study\nintroduces a predator-prey model where prey species show inducible defences,\nproviding new insights into the role of adaptive strategies in these complex\ninteractions. The stabilizing impact of the defensive mechanism is one of\nseveral intriguing outcomes produced by the dynamics. Moreover, the predator\npopulation rises when the interference rate increases to a moderate value even\nin the presence of lower prey defence but decreases monotonically for stronger\ndefence levels.

While existing target generation algorithms demonstrate\nremarkable performance in large-scale detection, their efficiency notably\ndiminishes in few-seed scenarios. This decline is primarily attributed to the\nintricate configuration rules and sampling bias of seed addresses. Moreover,\ninstances where BGP prefixes have few seed addresses are widespread,\nconstituting 63.65% of occurrences. We introduce 6Vision as a solution to\ntackle this challenge by introducing a novel approach of encoding IPv6\naddresses into images, facilitating comprehensive analysis of intricate\nconfiguration rules. Through a process of feature stitching, 6Vision not only\nimproves the learnable features but also amalgamates addresses associated with\nconfiguration patterns for enhanced learning. Moreover, it integrates an\nenvironmental feedback mechanism to refine model parameters based on identified\nactive addresses, thereby alleviating the sampling bias inherent in seed\naddresses. As a result, 6Vision achieves high-accuracy detection even in\nfew-seed scenarios. The HitRate of 6Vision shows a significant improvement\nranging from 181% to 2,490% compared to existing algorithms, while the CoverNum\nincreases by a factor of 1.18 to 11.20 times. Additionally, 6Vision can\nfunction as a preliminary detection module for existing algorithms, yielding a\nconversion gain (CG) ranging from 242% to 2,081%. Ultimately, we achieve a\nconversion rate (CR) of 28.97% for few-seed scenarios.

    "abstract": "Neural representation for video (NeRV), which employs a neural network to\nparameterize video signals, introduces a novel methodology in video\nrepresentations. However, existing NeRV-based methods have difficulty in\ncapturing fine spatial details and motion patterns due to spectral bias, in\nwhich a neural network learns high-frequency (HF) components at a slower rate\nthan low-frequency (LF) components. In this paper, we propose\nspectra-preserving NeRV (SNeRV) as a novel approach to enhance implicit video\nrepresentations by efficiently handling various frequency components. SNeRV\nuses 2D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose video into LF and HF\nfeatures, preserving spatial structures and directly addressing the spectral\nbias issue. To balance the compactness, we encode only the LF components, while\nHF components that include fine textures are generated by a decoder.\nSpecialized modules, including a multi-resolution fusion unit (MFU) and a\nhigh-frequency restorer (HFR), are integrated into a backbone to facilitate the\nrepresentation. Furthermore, we extend SNeRV to effectively capture temporal\ncorrelations between adjacent video frames, by casting the extension as\nadditional frequency decomposition to a temporal domain. This approach allows\nus to embed spatio-temporal LF features into the network, using temporally\nextended up-sampling blocks (TUBs). Experimental results demonstrate that SNeRV\noutperforms existing NeRV models in capturing fine details and achieves\nenhanced reconstruction, making it a promising approach in the field of\nimplicit video representations.

    "abstract": "The widespread application of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) has led to increasing concerns about their\nexplainability. Selective rationalization is a self-explanatory framework that\nselects human-intelligible input subsets as rationales for predictions. Recent\nstudies have shown that applying existing rationalization frameworks to PLMs\nwill result in severe degeneration and failure problems, producing sub-optimal\nor meaningless rationales. Such failures severely damage trust in\nrationalization methods and constrain the application of rationalization\ntechniques on PLMs. In this paper, we find that the homogeneity of tokens in\nthe sentences produced by PLMs is the primary contributor to these problems. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a method named Pre-trained Language\nModel's Rationalization (PLMR), which splits PLMs into a generator and a\npredictor to deal with NLP tasks while providing interpretable rationales. The\ngenerator in PLMR also alleviates homogeneity by pruning irrelevant tokens,\nwhile the predictor uses full-text information to standardize predictions.\nExperiments conducted on two widely used datasets across multiple PLMs\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method PLMR in addressing the\nchallenge of applying selective rationalization to PLMs. Codes:\nhttps://github.com/ylb777/PLMR.",

We examine the\nbehavior of chaotic parameters, including the Lyapunov exponent, butterfly\nvelocity, and scrambling time delay, under this deformation.

To address this issue, we propose an adaptive few-shot\nprompting (AFSP) framework to automatically select suitable translation\ndemonstrations for various source input sentences to further elicit the\ntranslation capability of an LLM for better machine translation. First, we\nbuild a translation demonstration retrieval module based on LLM's embedding to\nretrieve top-k semantic-similar translation demonstrations from aligned\nparallel translation corpus. Rather than using other embedding models for\nsemantic demonstration retrieval, we build a hybrid demonstration retrieval\nmodule based on the embedding layer of the deployed LLM to build better input\nrepresentation for retrieving more semantic-related translation demonstrations.\nThen, to ensure better semantic consistency between source inputs and target\noutputs, we force the deployed LLM itself to generate multiple output\ncandidates in the target language with the help of translation demonstrations\nand rerank these candidates. Besides, to better evaluate the effectiveness of\nour AFSP framework on the latest language and extend the research boundary of\nneural machine translation, we construct a high-quality diplomatic\nChinese-English parallel dataset that consists of 5,528 parallel\nChinese-English sentences.

In this work, we introduce a parallel\nGaussian splatting method, termed PG-SAG, which fully exploits semantic cues\nfor both partitioning and Gaussian kernel optimization, enabling fine-grained\nbuilding surface reconstruction of large-scale urban areas without downsampling\nthe original image resolution. First, the Cross-modal model - Language Segment\nAnything is leveraged to segment building masks.

The Gaussian kernels for these sub-regions are optimized in\nparallel with masked pixels. In addition, the normal loss is re-formulated for\nthe detected edges of masks to alleviate the ambiguities in normal vectors on\nedges. Finally, to improve the optimization of 3D Gaussians, we introduce a\ngradient-constrained balance-load loss that accounts for the complexity of the\ncorresponding scenes, effectively minimizing the thread waiting time in the\npixel-parallel rendering stage as well as the reconstruction lost.

The weights of public part are publicly accessible(e.g. the\nopen-sourced base model) while the private part needs to be protected(e.g. the\nLoRA matrices). In this way, the overhead brought by computing on private data\ncan be greatly reduced. Secondly, we propose a general method to transform a\nlinear layer into another one which provides security against model extraction\nattacks and preserves its original functionality, which denoted as Private\nLinear Layer(PLL).

    "abstract": "With the integration of an additional modality, large vision-language models\n(LVLMs) exhibit greater vulnerability to safety risks (e.g., jailbreaking)\ncompared to their language-only predecessors. Although recent studies have\ndevoted considerable effort to the post-hoc alignment of LVLMs, the inner\nsafety mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we discover that\ninternal activations of LVLMs during the first token generation can effectively\nidentify malicious prompts across different attacks. This inherent safety\nperception is governed by sparse attention heads, which we term ``safety\nheads.\" Further analysis reveals that these heads act as specialized shields\nagainst malicious prompts; ablating them leads to higher attack success rates,\nwhile the model's utility remains unaffected. By locating these safety heads\nand concatenating their activations, we construct a straightforward but\npowerful malicious prompt detector that integrates seamlessly into the\ngeneration process with minimal extra inference overhead. Despite its simple\nstructure of a logistic regression model, the detector surprisingly exhibits\nstrong zero-shot generalization capabilities. Experiments across various\nprompt-based attacks confirm the effectiveness of leveraging safety heads to\nprotect LVLMs. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/Ziwei-Zheng/SAHs}.",

    "abstract": "Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) has progressed significantly toward\naccurately learning the underlying rewards in both discrete and continuous\ndomains from behavior data. The next advance is to learn {\\em intrinsic}\npreferences in ways that produce useful behavior in settings or tasks which are\ndifferent but aligned with the observed ones. In the context of robotic\napplications, this helps integrate robots into processing lines involving new\ntasks (with shared intrinsic preferences) without programming from scratch. We\nintroduce a method to inversely learn an abstract reward function from behavior\ntrajectories in two or more differing instances of a domain. The abstract\nreward function is then used to learn task behavior in another separate\ninstance of the domain. This step offers evidence of its transferability and\nvalidates its correctness. We evaluate the method on trajectories in tasks from\nmultiple domains in OpenAI's Gym testbed and AssistiveGym and show that the\nlearned abstract reward functions can successfully learn task behaviors in\ninstances of the respective domains, which have not been seen previously.",

To address this issue, this paper proposes a State Space Model (SSM) to\nreconstruct the mel spectrogram of continuous speech from EEG, named SSM2Mel.\nThis model introduces a novel Mamba module to effectively model the long\nsequence of EEG signals for imagined speech. In the SSM2Mel model, the S4-UNet\nstructure is used to enhance the extraction of local features of EEG signals,\nand the Embedding Strength Modulator (ESM) module is used to incorporate\nsubject-specific information.

According to the\ntopological invariants, bulk polarization, and the divergence of localization\nlength of the topological bound edge states in the reduced disordered system,\nthe gapped and ungapped topological Anderson states with latent symmetry could\nbe identified in the original disordered multi-atomic systems. The concept of\ntopological Anderson insulating phases protected by the geometric symmetries\nand tenfold-way classification is thus extended to the various types of latent\nsymmetry cases.

However, many ML-enabled systems operate in a\ndynamic environment where the predictive decisions made by the system impact\nthe environment, which in turn affects future decision-making. Such a\nself-reinforcing feedback loop can cause fairness violations in the long term,\neven if the immediate outcomes are fair.

By harnessing the bidirectional capabilities of BART the framework\nthen identifies malicious packets among these predictions.

    "abstract": "We adopt a parametric approach to analyze the worst-case degradation in\nsocial welfare when the allocation of indivisible goods is constrained to be\nfair. Specifically, we are concerned with cardinality-constrained allocations,\nwhich require that each agent has at most $k$ items in their allocated bundle.\nWe propose the notion of the price of cardinality, which captures the\nworst-case multiplicative loss of utilitarian or egalitarian social welfare\nresulting from imposing the cardinality constraint. We then characterize tight\nor almost-tight bounds on the price of cardinality as exact functions of the\ninstance parameters, demonstrating how the social welfare improves as $k$ is\nincreased. In particular, one of our main results refines and generalizes the\nexisting asymptotic bound on the price of balancedness, as studied by Bei et\nal. [BLMS21]. We also further extend our analysis to the problem where the\nitems are partitioned into disjoint categories, and each category has its own\ncardinality constraint. Through a parametric study of the price of cardinality,\nwe provide a framework which aids decision makers in choosing an ideal level of\ncardinality-based fairness, using their knowledge of the potential loss of\nutilitarian and egalitarian social welfare.",

The calculated energy levels, electromagnetic moments,\nand spectroscopic factors exhibit remarkable agreement with the experimental\ndata due to significant configuration mixing for the neutron numbers away from\nthe closed shells. The $1/2^-_1$ energy levels closely follow the trend of\neffective single-particle energies, which are determined using the fractional\noccupancies of neutron orbitals. However, configuration mixing with the proton\n$p_{3/2}$ and $f_{5/2}$ orbitals in the actual shell-model calculations plays a\ncrucial role in accurately reproducing the positions of the $1/2^-_1$ levels,\nensuring better agreement with the experimental data across the entire isotopic\nchain.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)\nprovides insights into both the genomic location occupied by the protein of\ninterest and the difference in DNA occupancy between experimental states. Given\nthat ChIP-seq data is collected experimentally, an important step for\ndetermining regions with differential DNA occupancy between states is\nbetween-sample normalization. While between-sample normalization is crucial for\ndownstream differential binding analysis, the technical conditions underlying\nbetween-sample normalization methods have yet to be examined for ChIP-seq. We\nidentify three important technical conditions underlying ChIP-seq\nbetween-sample normalization methods: balanced differential DNA occupancy,\nequal total DNA occupancy, and equal background binding across states. To\nillustrate satisfying the selected normalization method's technical conditions\nfor downstream differential binding analysis, we simulate ChIP-seq read count\ndata where different combinations of the technical conditions are violated. We\nthen externally verify our simulation results using experimental data. Based on\nour findings, we suggest that researchers use their understanding of the\nChIP-seq experiment at hand to guide their choice of between-sample\nnormalization method. Alternatively, researchers can use a high-confidence\npeakset, which is the intersection of the differentially bound peaksets\nobtained from using different between-sample normalization methods. In our two\nexperimental analyses, roughly half of the called peaks were called as\ndifferentially bound for every normalization method. High-confidence peaks are\nless sensitive to choice of between-sample normalization method and could be a\nmore robust basis for identifying genomic regions with differential DNA\noccupancy between experimental states when there is uncertainty about which\ntechnical conditions are satisfied.",

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised medical image segmentation is gaining traction as it\nrequires only rough annotations rather than accurate pixel-to-pixel labels,\nthereby reducing the workload for specialists. Although some progress has been\nmade, there is still a considerable performance gap between the label-efficient\nmethods and fully-supervised one, which can be attributed to the uncertainty\nnature of these weak labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel weak\nannotation method coupled with its learning framework EAUWSeg to eliminate the\nannotation uncertainty. Specifically, we first propose the Bounded Polygon\nAnnotation (BPAnno) by simply labeling two polygons for a lesion. Then, the\ntailored learning mechanism that explicitly treat bounded polygons as two\nseparated annotations is proposed to learn invariant feature by providing\nadversarial supervision signal for model training. Subsequently, a\nconfidence-auxiliary consistency learner incorporates with a\nclassification-guided confidence generator is designed to provide reliable\nsupervision signal for pixels in uncertain region by leveraging the feature\npresentation consistency across pixels within the same category as well as\nclass-specific information encapsulated in bounded polygons annotation.\nExperimental results demonstrate that EAUWSeg outperforms existing\nweakly-supervised segmentation methods. Furthermore, compared to\nfully-supervised counterparts, the proposed method not only delivers superior\nperformance but also costs much less annotation workload. This underscores the\nsuperiority and effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Time-varying random objects have been increasingly encountered in modern data\nanalysis. Moreover, in a substantial number of these applications, periodic\nbehaviour of the random objects has been observed. We develop a novel procedure\nto identify and localize abrupt changes in the distribution of non-Euclidean\nrandom objects with periodic behaviour. The proposed procedure is flexible and\nbroadly applicable, accommodating a variety of suitable change point detectors\nfor random objects. We further construct a specific detector used in the\nproposed procedure which is nonparametric and effectively captures the entire\ndistribution of these random objects. The theoretical results cover the\nlimiting distribution of the detector under the null hypothesis of no change\npoint, the power of the test in the presence of change points under local\nalternatives and the consistency in estimating the number and locations of\nchange points, whether dealing with a single change point or multiple ones. We\ndemonstrate that the most competitive method currently in the literature for\nchange point detection in random objects is degraded by periodic behaviour, as\nperiodicity leads to blurring of the changes that this procedure aims to\ndiscover. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the superior\npower and accuracy of our approach in both detecting change points and\npinpointing their locations. Our main application is to weighted networks,\nrepresented through graph Laplacians. The proposed method delivers highly\ninterpretable results, as evidenced by the identification of meaningful change\npoints in the New York City Citi Bike sharing system that align with\nsignificant historical events.",

To address limitations in existing BKGs, we present\nPrimeKG++, an enriched knowledge graph incorporating multimodal data, including\nbiological sequences and textual descriptions for each entity type. By\ncombining semantic and relational information in a unified representation, our\napproach demonstrates strong generalizability, enabling accurate link\npredictions even for unseen nodes. Experimental results on PrimeKG++ and the\nDrugBank drug-target interaction dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our method across diverse biomedical datasets.

Directly applying 3D brain MR images to machine learning models offers\nthe benefit of effectively learning the brain's structure; however, building\nthe generalized model necessitates a large amount of training data. While\nmodels that consider depth direction and utilize continuous 2D slices have\ndemonstrated success in segmentation and classification tasks involving 3D\ndata, concerns remain. Specifically, using general 2D slices may lead to the\noversight of pathological features and discontinuities in depth direction\ninformation. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have\nbeen no attempts to develop a practical CBIR system that preserves the entire\nbrain's structural information. In this study, we propose an interpretable CBIR\nmethod for brain MR images, named iCBIR-Sli (Interpretable CBIR with 2D Slice\nEmbedding), which, for the first time globally, utilizes a series of 2D slices.\niCBIR-Sli addresses the challenges associated with using 2D slices by\neffectively aggregating slice information, thereby achieving low-dimensional\nrepresentations with high completeness, usability, robustness, and\ninteroperability, which are qualities essential for effective CBIR. In\nretrieval evaluation experiments utilizing five publicly available brain MR\ndatasets (ADNI2/3, OASIS3/4, AIBL) for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively\nnormal, iCBIR-Sli demonstrated top-1 retrieval performance (macro F1 = 0.859),\ncomparable to existing deep learning models explicitly designed for\nclassification, without the need for an external classifier.

This need not be true if $f$ is a complex-valued\nharmonic function. However, we prove that Zygmund's theorem holds if $f$ is a\nharmonic $K$-quasiregular mapping in $\\ID$. Our work makes further progress on\nthe recent Riesz-type theorem of Liu and Zhu (Adv. Math., 2023), and the\nKolmogorov-type theorem of Kalaj (J. Math. Anal. Appl., 2025), for harmonic\nquasiregular mappings. We also obtain a partial converse, thus showing that the\nproposed growth condition is the best possible. Furthermore, as an application\nof the classical conjugate function theorems, we establish a harmonic analogue\nof a well-known result of Hardy and Littlewood.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a detailed description of the thermochemical\nnon-equilibrium dissociation of diatomic molecules, and applies this theory to\nthe case of $\\rm H_2$ dissociation. The master equations are used to derive\ncorresponding aggregate rate constant expressions that hold for any degree of\nthermochemical non-equilibrium. These general expressions are analyzed in three\nkey limits/ regimes: the thermal equilibrium limit, the quasi-steady-state\n(QSS) regime, and the pre-QSS regime. Under several simplifying assumptions, an\nanalytical source term expression that holds in all of these regimes, and is\nonly a function of the translational temperature, $T_{\\rm t}$, and the fraction\nof dissociation, $\\phi_{\\rm A}$, is proposed. This expression has two input\nparameters: the QSS dissociation rate constant in the absence of recombination,\n$k_{\\rm d,nr}(T_{\\rm t})$, and a pre-QSS correction factor, $\\eta(T_{\\rm t})$.\nThe value of $\\eta(T_{\\rm t})$ is evaluated by comparing the predictions of the\nproposed expression against existing master equation simulations of a 0-D\nisothermal and isochoric reactor for the case of $\\rm H_2$ dissociation with\nthe third-bodies $\\rm H_2$, $\\rm H$, and $\\rm He$. Despite its simple\nfunctional form, the proposed expression is able to reproduce the master\nequation results for the majority of the tested conditions. The best fit of\n$k_{\\rm d,nr}(T_{\\rm t})$ is then evaluated by conducting a detailed literature\nreview. Data from a wide range of experimental and computational studies are\nconsidered for the third-bodies $\\rm H_2$, $\\rm H$, and inert gases, and fits\nthat are valid from 200 to 20,000 K are proposed. From this review, the\nuncertainty of the proposed fits are estimated to be less than a factor of two.",

As is common in such ``strategy\ntrials,'' many participants assigned to treatment remained untreated while many\nassigned to control crossed over into treatment. Intention-to-treat (ITT)\nanalyses of strategy trials preserve randomization-based comparisons, but ITT\neffects are diluted by non-compliance. Conventional per-protocol analyses that\ncondition on treatment received are likely biased by discarding random\nassignment. In trials where compliance choices are made shortly after\nassignment, instrumental variables (IV) methods solve both problems --\nrecovering an undiluted average causal effect of treatment for treated subjects\nwho comply with trial protocol. In ISCHEMIA, however, some controls were\nrevascularized as long as five years after random assignment. This paper\nextends the IV framework for strategy trials, allowing for such dynamic\nnon-random compliance behavior. IV estimates of long-run revascularization\neffects on quality of life are markedly larger than previously reported ITT and\nper-protocol estimates. We also show how to estimate complier characteristics\nin a dynamic-treatment setting.

The theoretically infinite possibilities for adversarial perturbations\nmean that an AMC model will inevitably encounter new unseen adversarial attacks\nif it is ever to be deployed to a real-world communication system. Moreover,\nthe computational limitations and challenges of obtaining new data in real-time\nwill not allow a full training process for the AMC model to adapt to the new\nattack when it is online.

We present an improved multiband fitting technique to enhance the\nanalysis of binary properties. This approach enables an accurate photometric\ndetermination of $f_{\\rm b}$ and $q$ distribution in a cluster. The detectable\nmass ratio can be down to the $q_{\\rm lim}$, limited by the minimum stellar\nmass in theoretical models. First, we derived an empirical model for magnitudes\nof Gaia DR3 and 2MASS bands that match the photometry of single stars in the\nPleiades. We then performed a multiband fitting for each cluster member,\nderiving the probability density function (PDF) of its primary mass\n($\\mathcal{M}_1$) and $q$ in the Bayesian framework. 1154 main-sequence (MS)\nsingle stars or unresolved MS+MS binaries are identified as members of the\nPleiades. By stacking their PDFs, we conducted a detailed analysis of binary\nproperties of the cluster. We found the $f_{\\rm b}$ of this sample is $0.34 \\pm\n0.02$. The $q$ distribution exhibits a three-segment power-law profile: an\ninitial increase, followed by a decrease, and then another increase. This\ndistribution can be interpreted as a fiducial power-law profile with an\nexponent of -1.0 that is determined in the range of $0.3 < q < 0.8$, but with a\ndeficiency of binaries at lower $q$ and an excess at higher $q$. The variations\nof $f_{\\rm b}$ and $q$ with $\\mathcal{M}_1$ reveal a complex binary\ndistribution within the Pleiades, which might be attributed to a combination of\nprimordial binary formation mechanisms, dynamical interactions, and the\nobservational limit of photometric binaries imposed by $q_{\\rm lim}\n(\\mathcal{M}_1)$.",

    "abstract": "Channel Autoencoders (CAEs) have shown significant potential in optimizing\nthe physical layer of a wireless communication system for a specific channel\nthrough joint end-to-end training. However, the practical implementation of\nCAEs faces several challenges, particularly in realistic and dynamic scenarios.\nChannels in communication systems are dynamic and change with time. Still, most\nproposed CAE designs assume stationary scenarios, meaning they are trained and\ntested for only one channel realization without regard for the dynamic nature\nof wireless communication systems. Moreover, conventional CAEs are designed\nbased on the assumption of having access to a large number of pilot signals,\nwhich act as training samples in the context of CAEs. However, in real-world\napplications, it is not feasible for a CAE operating in real-time to acquire\nlarge amounts of training samples for each new channel realization. Hence, the\nCAE has to be deployable in few-shot learning scenarios where only limited\ntraining samples are available. Furthermore, most proposed conventional CAEs\nlack fast adaptability to new channel realizations, which becomes more\npronounced when dealing with a limited number of pilots. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes the Online Meta Learning channel AE (OML-CAE)\nframework for few-shot CAE scenarios with dynamic channels. The OML-CAE\nframework enhances adaptability to varying channel conditions in an online\nmanner, allowing for dynamic adjustments in response to evolving communication\nscenarios. Moreover, it can adapt to new channel conditions using only a few\npilots, drastically increasing pilot efficiency and making the CAE design\nfeasible in realistic scenarios.",

To achieve uncontrolled online prediction on\nmobile devices, referred to as the flexible user perception (FUP) problem, is\nattractive but hard. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, called Prism,\nwhich can obtain high FUP accuracy on mobile devices. The core of Prism is to\ndiscover task-aware domains embedded in IMU dataset, and to train a\ndomain-aware model on each identified domain. To this end, we design an\nexpectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate latent domains with respect\nto the specific downstream perception task. Finally, the best-fit model can be\nautomatically selected for use by comparing the test sample and all identified\ndomains in the feature space.

In many large-scale applications such as turbulent pipe flow, the\nelastic response occurs on a much shorter timescale than the thixotropy, hence\nthese flows are purely thixotropic. The fundamental dynamics of thixotropic\nturbulence is poorly understood, particularly the interplay between\nmicrostructural state, rheology, and turbulence structure. To address this gap,\nwe conduct direct numerical simulations (DNS) of fully developed turbulent pipe\nflow of a model thixotropic (Moore) fluid over a range of thixoviscous numbers\n$\\Lambda$ from slow ($\\Lambda\\ll 1$) to fast ($\\Lambda\\gg 1$) thixotropic\nkinetics relative to the eddy turnover time. Analysis of DNS results in the\nLagrangian frame shows that, as expected, in the limits of slow and fast\nkinetics, these time-dependent flows behave as time-independent purely viscous\n(generalized Newtonian) analogues. For intermediate kinetics ($\\Lambda\\sim 1$),\nthe rheology is governed by a \\emph{path integral} of the thixotropic fading\nmemory kernel over the distribution of Lagrangian shear history, the latter of\nwhich is modelled via a simple stochastic model for the radially non-stationary\npipe flow. DNS computations based on this effective viscosity closure exhibit\nexcellent agreement (within 2.4\\% error) with the fully thixotropic model for\n$\\Lambda=1$, indicating that the purely viscous (generalized Newtonian)\nanalogue persists for arbitrary values of $\\Lambda\\in[0,\\infty^+)$ and across\nnonlinear rheology models. These results uncover the feedback mechanisms\nbetween microstructure, rheology, and turbulence and offer fundamental insights\ninto the structure of thixotropic turbulence.",

Once a backdoor\ntrigger is observed, it will perform malicious actions leading to failures or\nmalicious goals. However, existing backdoor attacks suffer from several issues,\ne.g., instant trigger patterns lack stealthiness, the backdoor is trained or\nactivated by an additional network, or all agents are backdoored. To this end,\nin this paper, we propose a novel backdoor leverage attack against c-MADRL,\nBLAST, which attacks the entire multi-agent team by embedding the backdoor only\nin a single agent. Firstly, we introduce adversary spatiotemporal behavior\npatterns as the backdoor trigger rather than manual-injected fixed visual\npatterns or instant status and control the period to perform malicious actions.\nThis method can guarantee the stealthiness and practicality of BLAST. Secondly,\nwe hack the original reward function of the backdoor agent via unilateral\nguidance to inject BLAST, so as to achieve the \\textit{leverage attack effect}\nthat can pry open the entire multi-agent system via a single backdoor agent. We\nevaluate our BLAST against 3 classic c-MADRL algorithms (VDN, QMIX, and MAPPO)\nin 2 popular c-MADRL environments (SMAC and Pursuit), and 2 existing defense\nmechanisms.

In spite of empirical success, mathematical underpinnings\nof preon models in terms of group representation theory have not been fully\nworked out. Here, we address this issue while clarifying the relation between\ndifferent preon models. In particular, we focus on two prominent models:\nBilson-Thompson's helon model, and Lambek's 4-vector model. We determine the\nmapping between helon model particle states and representation theory of Lie\nalgebras. Braided ribbon diagrams of the former represent on-shell states of\nspinors of the Lorentz group. Braids correspond to chirality, and twists, to\ncharges. We note that this model captures only the $SU(3)_c\\times U(1)_{em}$\nsector of the standard model. We then map the twists of helon diagrams to the\nweight polytope of $SU(3)_c \\times U(1)_{em}$. The braid structure maps to\nchiral states of fermions. We also show that Lambek's 4-vector can be recovered\nfrom helon diagrams. Alongside, we introduce a new 5-vector representation\nderived from the weight lattice. This representation contains both, the correct\ninteractions found in 4-vectors and the inclusion of chirality found in helons.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate topological analogues of CPT transformations in\nhelon diagrams. Interestingly, the braid diagrams of the helon model are the\nonly ones that are self-consistent with CPT invariance.

These long-wavelength results are then applied to\ngravitational waves in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA)\nsensitivity band scattering from the Sun and planets. We estimate that\nscattering from the Sun and the planets from Jupiter to Neptune could\ncontribute a $10^{-3}$ amplitude modulation to LISA observations when these\nobjects almost intersect the line of sight between LISA and the source, leading\nto forward scattering with $\\vartheta\\simeq0$.

In this paper, we leverage DT in the\nFL framework over non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network to assist FL\ntraining process, considering malicious attacks on model updates from clients.\nA reputationbased client selection scheme is proposed, which accounts for\nclient heterogeneity in multiple aspects and effectively mitigates the risks of\npoisoning attacks in FL systems. To minimize the total latency and energy\nconsumption in the proposed system, we then formulate a Stackelberg game by\nconsidering clients and the server as the leader and the follower,\nrespectively. Specifically, the leader aims to minimize the energy consumption\nwhile the objective of the follower is to minimize the total latency during FL\ntraining. The Stackelberg equilibrium is achieved to obtain the optimal\nsolutions. We first derive the strategies for the followerlevel problem and\ninclude them in the leader-level problem which is then solved via problem\ndecomposition. Simulation results verify the superior performance of the\nproposed scheme.",

    "abstract": "In two-body dynamics, it is proven that for a sufficiently long flight time,\ngenerating infinitely many iso-impulse solutions is possible by solving a\nnumber of $\\Delta v$-allocation problems analytically. A distinct feature of\nthese solutions is the existence of two impulse anchor positions (APs) that\ncorrespond to the locations of the impulses on time-free, phase-free, base\nsolutions. In this paper, the existence and utility of three-impulse base\nsolutions are investigated and their complete solution spaces are characterized\nand analyzed. Since two- and three-impulse base solutions exist, a question\narises: How many APs should base solutions have? A strategy is developed for\nchoosing base solutions, which offers a certificate for $\\Delta v$ optimality\nof general three-dimensional time-fixed rendezvous solutions. Simultaneous\nallocation of $\\Delta v$ at two and three APs is formulated, which allows for\ngenerating $\\Delta v$-optimal solutions while satisfying a constraint on\nindividual impulses such that $\\Delta v \\leq \\Delta v_\\text{max}$. All\niso-impulse solutions are classified in four layers: 1) base solutions, 2)\nfeasible solution spaces, 3) solution families, and 4) solution envelopes. The\nmethod enables us to characterize the complete solution space of\nminimum-$\\Delta v$, iso-impulse, three-dimensional trajectories under the\nnonlinear two-body dynamics. To illustrate the utility of the method,\ninterplanetary and geocentric problems are considered.",

The increased rate\nof short-timescale, repetitive events around SMBHs, including the\nnewly-discovered quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), are garnering further\ninterest in stellar-mass companions around SMBHs and the progenitors to mHz\nfrequency gravitational wave events. Here we report the discovery of a highly\nsignificant mHz Quasi-Periodic Oscillation (QPO) in an actively accreting SMBH,\n1ES 1927+654, which underwent a major optical, UV, and X-ray outburst beginning\nin 2018. The QPO was first detected in 2022 with a roughly 18-minute period,\ncorresponding to coherent motion on scales of less than 10 gravitational radii,\nmuch closer to the SMBH than typical QPEs. The period decreased to 7.1 minutes\nover two years with a decelerating period evolution ($\\ddot{P} > 0$). This\nevolution has never been seen in SMBH QPOs or high-frequency QPOs in stellar\nmass black holes. Models invoking orbital decay of a stellar-mass companion\nstruggle to explain the period evolution without stable mass transfer to offset\nangular momentum losses, while the lack of a direct analog to stellar mass\nblack hole QPOs means that many instability models cannot explain all of the\nobserved properties of the QPO in 1ES 1927+654. Future X-ray monitoring will\ntest these models, and if it is a stellar-mass orbiter, the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should detect its low-frequency\ngravitational wave emission.",
