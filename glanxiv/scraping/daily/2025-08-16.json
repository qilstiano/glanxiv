This paper formalises the mathematical theory of\n\\textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's\nstate incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \\textit{activity} that\nco-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We\ndemonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive\ndecision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous\ndifferential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd\ndynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic\npatterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions\nthis framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based\napproaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where\nindividual agency drives collective outcomes.",

The approach combines the expressiveness of neural networks\nwith the rigor of symbolic reasoning via barrier certificates, functional\nanalogs of inductive invariants that formally guarantee safety. Prior\ndata-driven methods often treat dynamics as black-box models, relying on dense\nstate-space discretization or Lipschitz overapproximations, leading to\nexponential sample complexity. In contrast, monotonicity -- a pervasive\nstructural property in many real-world systems -- provides a symbolic scaffold\nthat simplifies both learning and verification. Exploiting order preservation\nreduces verification to localized boundary checks, transforming a\nhigh-dimensional problem into a tractable, low-dimensional one. Barrier\ncertificates are synthesized using monotone neural networks -- architectures\nwith embedded monotonicity constraints -- trained via gradient-based\noptimization guided by barrier conditions. This enables scalable, formally\nsound verification directly from simulation data, bridging black-box learning\nand formal guarantees within a unified neurosymbolic framework. Empirical\nresults on three large-scale benchmarks -- a 1,000-dimensional freeway traffic\nmodel, a 50-dimensional urban traffic network, and a 13,000-dimensional power\ngrid -- demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the approach in\nreal-world, safety-critical systems.",

We modified the resulting timestepping code to\ncarry out steady-state solving via Newton's method, which has no timestepping\nerror. The implicit terms have the effect of preconditioning the linear\nsystems, which can then be rapidly solved by a matrix-free Krylov method. We\ncomputed the branches of rotating waves with azimuthal wavenumbers ranging from\n4 to 12. As the Ekman number (the non-dimensionalized inverse rotation rate)\ndecreases, the flows are increasingly axially independent and localized near\nthe inner cylinder, in keeping with well-known theoretical predictions and\nprevious experimental and numerical results. The advantage of the implicit over\nthe explicit treatment also increases dramatically with decreasing Ekman\nnumbers, reducing the cost of computation by as much as a factor of 20 for\nEkman numbers of order of $10^{-5}$.

By using Nesterov's momentum method in an initialization\nphase, our procedure delivers fast initial descent that is robust to the choice\nof starting value. Once iterates are much closer to the solution after the\nfirst phase, we utilize a variation of Anderson acceleration to deliver more\nrapid local convergence in the second phase.

For the second phase, we adapt and extend a version of Anderson\nacceleration with algorithm restarts, and we introduce a subsetted version of\nthis procedure that improves performance in problems with substantial sparsity.\nThrough simulation studies involving four representative optimization problems,\nwe show that our proposed algorithm can generate substantial improvements over\ncompeting acceleration methods.",

    "abstract": "The growing integration of LLMs into applications has introduced new security\nrisks, notably known as Promptware - maliciously engineered prompts designed to\nmanipulate LLMs to compromise the CIA triad of these applications. While prior\nresearch warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape for LLM-powered\napplications, the risk posed by Promptware is frequently perceived as low. In\nthis paper, we investigate the risk Promptware poses to users of Gemini-powered\nassistants (web application, mobile application, and Google Assistant). We\npropose a novel Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) framework to assess\nPromptware risks for end users. Our analysis focuses on a new variant of\nPromptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks, which leverage indirect prompt\ninjection via common user interactions such as emails, calendar invitations,\nand shared documents. We demonstrate 14 attack scenarios applied against\nGemini-powered assistants across five identified threat classes: Short-term\nContext Poisoning, Permanent Memory Poisoning, Tool Misuse, Automatic Agent\nInvocation, and Automatic App Invocation. These attacks highlight both digital\nand physical consequences, including spamming, phishing, disinformation\ncampaigns, data exfiltration, unapproved user video streaming, and control of\nhome automation devices. We reveal Promptware's potential for on-device lateral\nmovement, escaping the boundaries of the LLM-powered application, to trigger\nmalicious actions using a device's applications. Our TARA reveals that 73% of\nthe analyzed threats pose High-Critical risk to end users.

Goals: (i) validate against\nanalytical solutions, (ii) assess solver differences, and (iii) characterize\nHDsEEG directional sensitivity. LFs were modeled in simple and bio-relevant\nscenarios. Using Helmholtz reciprocity, we computed LFs by (a) electrode-based\nstimulation with ANSYS and (b) source-based recording with Brainstorm-DUNEuro.\nFirst, a multi-sphere head model with known solutions tested the solver's\naccuracy.

Source localization performance was also compared between\nHDsEEG and standard electrodes. Both solvers closely matched analytic\nsolutions. In realistic settings, LF distributions were highly similar.\nModeling showed clear directional sensitivity: contacts facing a source had\nhigher sensitivity than those shadowed, reflecting a substrate shielding effect\nthat vanished when the substrate was conductive. Crucially, HDsEEG improved\nsource localization, as voltage differences across contacts provided robust\ndirectional LF information.",

Molecular\ndynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the\ngrains and 'well-diffusive' in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered\nnano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (~1M) than in\nsaturated LiPF6-Adpn solutions (0.04M), and ions predominantly solvated by -CN\ngroups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an\norder of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture\nis the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has positioned data\ngovernance as a critical concern for responsible AI development. While\nframeworks exist for conventional AI systems, the potential emergence of\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) presents unprecedented governance\nchallenges. This paper examines data governance challenges specific to AGI,\ndefined as systems capable of recursive self-improvement or self-replication.\nWe identify seven key issues that differentiate AGI governance from current\napproaches. First, AGI may autonomously determine what data to collect and how\nto use it, potentially circumventing existing consent mechanisms. Second, these\nsystems may make data retention decisions based on internal optimization\ncriteria rather than human-established principles. Third, AGI-to-AGI data\nsharing could occur at speeds and complexities beyond human oversight. Fourth,\nrecursive self-improvement creates unique provenance tracking challenges, as\nsystems evolve both themselves and how they process data. Fifth, ownership of\ndata and insights generated through self-improvement raises complex\nintellectual property questions. Sixth, self-replicating AGI distributed across\njurisdictions would create unprecedented challenges for enforcing data\nprotection laws. Finally, governance frameworks established during early AGI\ndevelopment may quickly become obsolete as systems evolve. We conclude that\neffective AGI data governance requires built-in constraints, continuous\nmonitoring mechanisms, dynamic governance structures, international\ncoordination, and multi-stakeholder involvement. Without forward-looking\ngovernance approaches specifically designed for systems with autonomous data\ncapabilities, we risk creating AGI whose relationship with data evolves in ways\nthat undermine human values and interests.",

    "abstract": "Comparing the dynamical and stellar masses of Milky Way (MW) globular\nclusters (GCs) reveals a discrepancy exceeding a factor of two. Since this\nsubstantial invisible mass is concentrated in the cluster centre, it is\nattributed to stellar remnants. The majority of mass in remnants consists of\nwhite dwarfs (WDs). Allocating over half of a GC's current mass to WDs could\nsignificantly restrict the dynamical evolution scenarios governing stellar\nclusters. As the most massive stars in GCs, black holes (BHs) exert a\nsubstantial effect on the escape rate of lower mass stars, such as WDs. This\npaper aims to identify which scenarios of BH natal kicks can accurately\nreproduce the notable dark remnant fraction observed in MW GCs. We compare the\nobserved remnant fraction of MW GCs with a comprehensive grid of direct \\Nbody\nsimulations while adjusting the natal kick received by BHs. Our results reveal\nthat simulations employing low natal kicks to BHs are the only ones capable of\nmirroring the remnant fraction of MW GCs. According to the Spitzer instability,\nthe presence of a BH population prompts the formation of a BH sub-system\n(BHSub) at the centre of a star cluster. The BHSub serves as an energetic power\nplant, continually releasing kinetic energy through few-body encounters between\nsingle and binary BHs, and transferring the generated energy to the entire\nstellar population. This energy induces a significant difference in the\nejection rate of stellar remnants and luminous stars, ultimately increasing the\nfraction of dark remnants within the star cluster.",

Our\nkey insight is that when a diffusion planner is explicitly conditioned on a\npose-belief raster and a sensor mask, the spread of its denoising trajectories\nyields a calibrated, differentiable proxy for the expected localisation error.\nBuilding on this insight, we present Belief-Conditioned One-Step Diffusion\n(B-COD), the first planner that, in a 10 ms forward pass, returns a\nshort-horizon trajectory, per-waypoint aleatoric variances, and a proxy for\nlocalisation error--eliminating external covariance rollouts.

IM can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem with a\nblack-box objective function, where the goal is to select $B$ seed nodes that\nmaximize the expected influence spread. Direct search methods, which do not\nrequire gradient information, are well-suited for such problems. Unlike\ngradient-based approaches, direct search algorithms, in fact, only evaluate the\nobjective function at a suitably chosen set of trial points around the current\nsolution to guide the search process. However, these methods often suffer from\nscalability issues due to the high cost of function evaluations, especially\nwhen applied to combinatorial problems like IM. This work, therefore, proposes\nthe Network-aware Direct Search (NaDS) method, an innovative direct search\napproach that integrates the network structure into its neighborhood\nformulation and is used to tackle a mixed-integer programming formulation of\nthe IM problem, the so-called General Information Propagation model. We tested\nour method on large-scale networks, comparing it to existing state-of-the-art\napproaches for the IM problem, including direct search methods and various\ngreedy techniques and heuristics. The results of the experiments empirically\nconfirm the assumptions underlying NaDS, demonstrating that exploiting the\ngraph structure of the IM problem in the algorithmic framework can\nsignificantly improve its computational efficiency in the considered context.",

In particular, the so-called $\\textit{LLM-as-a-Judge}$\nparadigm has achieved impressive results on a variety of natural language\nevaluation tasks, demonstrating high agreement rates with human annotators.\nRecognizing that privacy is both subjective and difficult to define, we\ninvestigate whether LLM-as-a-Judge can also be leveraged to evaluate the\nprivacy sensitivity of textual data. Furthermore, we measure how closely LLM\nevaluations align with human perceptions of privacy in text. Resulting from a\nstudy involving 10 datasets, 13 LLMs, and 677 human survey participants, we\nconfirm that privacy is indeed a difficult concept to measure empirically,\nexhibited by generally low inter-human agreement rates. Nevertheless, we find\nthat LLMs can accurately model a global human privacy perspective, and through\nan analysis of human and LLM reasoning patterns, we discuss the merits and\nlimitations of LLM-as-a-Judge for privacy evaluation in textual data. Our\nfindings pave the way for exploring the feasibility of LLMs as privacy\nevaluators, addressing a core challenge in solving pressing privacy issues with\ninnovative technical solutions.",

In this work, we compare three advanced\nfirst-principles approaches for computing magnetic exchange parameters and\nmagnon dispersions in NiO and MnO, all based on a common DFT+$U$ ground state\nwith ab initio Hubbard $U$ values obtained from density-functional perturbation\ntheory.

    "abstract": "Performance in introductory courses, particularly physics, is often crucial\nfor student success in STEM majors and can impact an individual's tendency to\npersist in their chosen field. To enhance students' individual learning\nexperiences, faculty at many universities have worked to develop open-access,\nself-study materials to help build conceptual understanding and problem-solving\nskills. Faculty at Texas A&M University have contributed to these efforts,\ncreating more than 200 online video resources and a broad bank of prior exams\navailable to students. This work explores and measures the impact that these\nresources can have on student course outcomes in an introductory,\ncalculus-based electricity and magnetism course. Data were collected from three\nfall semesters, 2021-2023, including classroom performance, a conceptual\nassessment, and relevant university level data to contextualize student\nbackground and pre-class abilities. Similar to prior studies, we found that\nrelevant prior preparation in mathematics was the strongest predictor of\nstudent performance, with prior physics knowledge being a weaker but still\nstatistically significant predictor. Students' utilization of supplemental old\nexams was the second highest predictor of student performance. First generation\nstudents were observed to have a slightly lower average performance on exams.\nHowever, interaction terms in the regression models indicated that first\ngeneration students using supplemental old exams were able to close this gap.\nThrough anonymous surveys, students reported warm impressions of the materials,\nwith over 80 per cent of students sharing that they had a noticeable\ncontribution to their learning outside of the classroom and 98 per cent stating\nthey would recommend them to their peers.",

We systematically\nevaluated two major model families, Qwen3 (1.7B to 235B parameters) and\nDeepSeek-R1 (1.5B to 70B parameters), across 15 medical datasets spanning\ndiverse specialties and difficulty levels. Through controlled experiments with\nthinking budgets ranging from zero to unlimited tokens, we establish\nlogarithmic scaling relationships where accuracy improvements follow a\npredictable pattern with both thinking budget and model size. Our findings\nidentify three distinct efficiency regimes: high-efficiency (0 to 256 tokens)\nsuitable for real-time applications, balanced (256 to 512 tokens) offering\noptimal cost-performance tradeoffs for routine clinical support, and\nhigh-accuracy (above 512 tokens) justified only for critical diagnostic tasks.\nNotably, smaller models demonstrate disproportionately larger benefits from\nextended thinking, with 15 to 20% improvements compared to 5 to 10% for larger\nmodels, suggesting a complementary relationship where thinking budget provides\ngreater relative benefits for capacity-constrained models. Domain-specific\npatterns emerge clearly, with neurology and gastroenterology requiring\nsignificantly deeper reasoning processes than cardiovascular or respiratory\nmedicine. The consistency between Qwen3 native thinking budget API and our\nproposed truncation method for DeepSeek-R1 validates the generalizability of\nthinking budget concepts across architectures.

Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose\nvisual and cross-modal capabilities.\n  In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve\noptimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the\npretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual\nlearning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization\ntechniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective\ncombination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet\ncritical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure\nreproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained\nmodels. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and\ncoarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks.

However, in harsh propagation\nenvironments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key\ngeneration rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose\na novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge.\nSpecifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA\narray, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions\nvia a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the\ncomputational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an\nalternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient\ndescent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting\nthe additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is\nsuperior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna\n(FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth\nhighlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA),\nthe FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\\% KGR performance improvement under PSO\nalgorithm and a 67.73\\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm,\nrespectively.",

In conjunction with the Effective\nOne Body (EOB) formalism, highly accurate PM informed models of binary black\nholes on scattering trajectories have emerged. Several complementary approaches\ncurrently exist, in particular the SEOB-PM model, the $w_{\\rm eob}$ framework\nand the recent LEOB approach. These models incorporate PM results in\nfundamentally different ways, employing distinct resummation schemes and gauge\nchoices. Notably, both SEOB-PM and LEOB have been used to compute gravitational\nwaves of bound systems, showing excellent agreement with numerical relativity\n(NR). The essential component to all of the models is the EOB mass-shell\ncondition describing the dynamics of the two-body spacetime. In this work we\nwill investigate how this mass-shell condition is constructed, paying\nparticular attention to the impact of gauge choices and how they interact with\ndifferent resummation schemes, showing that there is a strong dependence on\nboth coordinate choice and EOB gauge. For the region of parameter space\nconsidered, we find that the best performing gauges coincide with the choices\nmade in SEOB-PM and $w_{eob}$, with other choices exhibiting worse performance.\nThe case of spinning black holes is also considered, where the current\ntechniques for spinning EOB-PM are reviewed and compared. We also introduce a\nnew gauge based upon the centrifugal radius, which improves upon previous\nmodels, particularly for large and negative spins. This offers a promising\navenue for further resummation of spin information within the EOB-PM framework.",

This effect arises from the coupling between\nstate-space time scales--parametrized by the gates--and parameter-space\ndynamics during gradient descent. By deriving exact Jacobians for\nleaky-integrator and gated RNNs, we obtain a first-order expansion that makes\nexplicit how constant, scalar, and multi-dimensional gates reshape gradient\npropagation, modulate effective step sizes, and introduce anisotropy in\nparameter updates. These findings reveal that gates not only control\ninformation flow, but also act as data-driven preconditioners that adapt\noptimization trajectories in parameter space. We further draw formal analogies\nwith learning-rate schedules, momentum, and adaptive methods such as Adam.\nEmpirical simulations corroborate these claims: in several sequence tasks, we\nshow that gates induce lag-dependent effective learning rates and directional\nconcentration of gradient flow, with multi-gate models matching or exceeding\nthe anisotropic structure produced by Adam. These results highlight that\noptimizer-driven and gate-driven adaptivity are complementary but not\nequivalent mechanisms.

Here\nwe propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of\nmagnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary\nsystems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a\ntriple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well;\nwhereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars\nin isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry.

    "abstract": "Recent work has successfully achieved sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging with\nhigh-band observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). However, the\nscalability of this work remains limited due to the need for manual\nintervention, poor calibration solutions for the Dutch LOFAR stations, and high\ncomputational costs. We address these issues by: (1) improving automated\nself-calibration using a signal-to-noise metric and a neural network for image\nartefact detection; (2) implementing a refined calibration strategy for the\nDutch LOFAR stations; and (3) cutting computational costs by optimising the\ndata processing strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated\nprocessing strategy by reprocessing one previously reduced dataset and a new\ndataset from the ELAIS-N1 deep field, which features more severe ionospheric\nconditions. We find calibration artefacts across facet boundaries to be reduced\nwith our improved automated calibration strategy and achieve a computational\ncost reduction of about a factor of 4 to 6 compared to previous work, where the\nexact factor depends on whether a single observation is processed or multiple\nobservations of the same sky area are combined. Further optimisation and\nimproved handling of data with baseline-dependent averaging could reduce this\nin the near future by another factor of two, bringing the total cost for an\n8-hour observation below 30,000 CPU core hours. This work enables ultra-deep\nimaging at sensitivities on the order of a few $\\mu$Jy/beam. Furthermore, it\nalso lays the foundation for a fully automated survey pipeline for\nsub-arcsecond wide-field imaging of the northern sky with LOFAR.",

However, practical imperfections such as jittering and\nairflow of UAV could affect the phase shift of STAR-RIS, and consequently\ndegrade network security. In this respect, this paper investigates the impact\nof phase shift errors on the secrecy performance of UAV-mounted\nSTAR-RIS-assisted IoT systems. More specifically, we consider a UAV-mounted\nSTAR-RIS-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system where IoT\ndevices are grouped into two groups: one group on each side of the STAR-RIS.\nThe nodes in each group are considered as potential Malicious nodes for the\nones on the other side. By modeling phase estimation errors using a von Mises\ndistribution, analytical closed-form expressions for the ergodic secrecy rates\nunder imperfect phase adjustment are derived. An optimization problem to\nmaximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR) by optimizing the UAV placement\nis formulated and is then solved using a linear grid-based algorithm. Monte\nCarlo simulations are provided to validate the analytical derivations. The\nimpact of phase estimation errors on system's secrecy performance is analyzed,\nproviding critical insights for the practical realisation of STAR-RIS\ndeployments for secure UAV-enabled IoT networks.",

    "abstract": "A hyperplane arrangement $\\cA$ is said to be free if the corresponding\nJacobian ideal $J_\\cA$ is Cohen-Macaulay. If $\\cA$ is free then $J_\\cA$ is\nunmixed (i.e. equidimensional). Freeness is an important property, yet its\npresence is not well understood. A conjecture of Terao says that freeness of\n$\\cA$ depends only on the intersection lattice of $\\cA$. Given an arrangement\n$\\cA$, we define the ideal $J_\\cA^{top}$ to be the intersection of the\ncodimension 2 primary components of $J_\\cA$. This ideal is unmixed, but not\nnecessarily Cohen-Macaulay; if $\\cA$ is free then $J_\\cA = J_\\cA^{top}$. We\ndevelop a new method for studying the ideals $J_\\cA$ and $J_\\cA^{top}$ and\nestablish results in the spirit of Terao's conjecture, focusing on\n$J_\\cA^{top}$ rather than $J_\\cA$. It is based on a new application of liaison\ntheory, the general residual of $\\cA$. This residual ideal defines a scheme\nwith surprisingly simple properties. These allow us to track back to\n$J_\\cA^{top}$. Extending earlier results with Schenck, we identify mild\nconditions on a hyperplane arrangement which imply that the Hilbert function of\n$\\Jac( f_\\cA)^{top}$ or even its graded Betti numbers, are determined by the\nintersection lattice of $\\cA$. We establish new bounds on the global Tjurina\nnumber of a hyperplane arrangement. For line arrangements, we show that the\ngraded Betti numbers of $\\Jac( f_\\cA)^{sat}$ determine the graded Betti numbers\nof $\\Jac( f_\\cA)$, and of the corresponding Milnor module $J_\\cA^{sat}/J_\\cA$.\nWe obtain a new freeness criterion for line arrangements -- it highlights the\nfact that free line arrangements are special by proving that a related\ncodimension two ideal has the least possible number of generators, namely two,\nif and only if $\\cA$ is free. We illustrate our results by computing the graded\nBetti numbers for a number of basic arrangements that were not accessible with\nprevious methods.",

    "abstract": "Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational\nreinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical\nperformance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and\nreusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological\ngeneralization, the ability of control policies to cope with different\nkinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and\neffective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these\narchitectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region\nmethods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To\nthis end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy\noptimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)\nand its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization\n(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality\ninfluence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints\nimposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the\ntheoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is\ncarried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a\nsystematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without\naltering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study\nmorphological generalization.",

By combining enhanced reasoning\ncapabilities, Simple o3 establishes a powerful yet computationally affordable\nparadigm for advancing multimodal reasoning. Remarkably, we provide the first\nin-depth analysis of different interleaved reasoning strategies, offering\ninsights into their impact on model performance. We found that by introducing\nadditional visual tokens for interleaved vision-language reasoning, reusing and\nmagnifying the original image significantly improves the model's visual\nreasoning and fine-grained perception, while image cropping based on precise\nvisual grounding allows the model to effectively focus on key entities or\nregions, further enhancing its capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain address poisoning is an emerging phishing attack that crafts\n\"similar-looking\" transfer records in the victim's transaction history, which\naims to deceive victims and lure them into mistakenly transferring funds to the\nattacker. Recent works have shown that millions of Ethereum users were targeted\nand lost over 100 million US dollars.\n  Ethereum crypto wallets, serving users in browsing transaction history and\ninitiating transactions to transfer funds, play a central role in deploying\ncountermeasures to mitigate the address poisoning attack. However, whether they\nhave done so remains an open question. To fill the research void, in this\npaper, we design experiments to simulate address poisoning attacks and\nsystematically evaluate the usability and security of 53 popular Ethereum\ncrypto wallets. Our evaluation shows that there exist communication failures\nbetween 12 wallets and their transaction activity provider, which renders them\nunable to download the users' transaction history. Besides, our evaluation also\nshows that 16 wallets pose a high risk to their users due to displaying fake\ntoken phishing transfers. Moreover, our further analysis suggests that most\nwallets rely on transaction activity providers to filter out phishing\ntransfers. However, their phishing detection capability varies. Finally, we\nfound that only three wallets throw an explicit warning message when users\nattempt to transfer to the phishing address, implying a significant gap within\nthe broader Ethereum crypto wallet community in protecting users from address\npoisoning attacks.\n  Overall, our work shows that more efforts are needed by the Ethereum crypto\nwallet developer community to achieve the highest usability and security\nstandard.

These approaches typically perform only a small\nnumber of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then\nutilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a\ncost, as the representations only capture local information and forego\nlong-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly\nincreasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also\ndegrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.\n  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture\nlong-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.\nDespite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency\nissues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing\nhypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more\ninformation to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit\nHypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns\nfixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end\nmanner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we\nintroduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model\nefficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node\nclassification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in\nmost settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.",

This paper investigates a generalized MD-CRT\nfor multiple integer vectors, where the goal is to determine multiple integer\nvectors from multiple vector residue sets modulo multiple integer\nmatrices.Comparing to the existing generalized CRT for multiple scalar\nintegers, the challenge is that the moduli in MD-CRT are matrices that do not\ncommute and the corresponding uniquely determinable range is multidimensional\nand the inclusion relationship is much more complicated. In this paper,we\naddress two fundamental questions regarding the generalized MD-CRT. The first\nquestion concerns the uniquely determinable range of multiple integer vectors\nwhen no prior information about them is available. The second question is about\nthe conditions under which the maximal possible dynamic range can be\nachieved.To answer these two questions, we first derive a uniquely determinable\nrange without prior information and accordingly propose an algorithm to achieve\nit. A special case involving only two integer vectors is investigated for the\nsecond question, leading to a new condition for achieving the maximal possible\ndynamic range.

It underlies a variety of real-world tasks, including multi-robot\ncoordination, robot-assisted logistics, and social navigation. Recent\ndecentralized learnable solvers have shown great promise for large-scale MAPF,\nespecially when leveraging foundation models and large datasets. However, these\nagents are reactive policy models and exhibit limited modeling of environmental\ntemporal dynamics and inter-agent dependencies, resulting in performance\ndegradation in complex, long-term planning scenarios. To address these\nlimitations, we propose MAPF-World, an autoregressive action world model for\nMAPF that unifies situation understanding and action generation, guiding\ndecisions beyond immediate local observations. It improves situational\nawareness by explicitly modeling environmental dynamics, including spatial\nfeatures and temporal dependencies, through future state and actions\nprediction. By incorporating these predicted futures, MAPF-World enables more\ninformed, coordinated, and far-sighted decision-making, especially in complex\nmulti-agent settings. Furthermore, we augment MAPF benchmarks by introducing an\nautomatic map generator grounded in real-world scenarios, capturing practical\nmap layouts for training and evaluating MAPF solvers. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MAPF-World outperforms state-of-the-art learnable solvers,\nshowcasing superior zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution cases.\nNotably, MAPF-World is trained with a 96.5% smaller model size and 92% reduced\ndata.",

Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of\nthese systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned\nin one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different\nphysical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,\nas their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a\ndomain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative\nadversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain\nto a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to\nadapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a\ndomain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure\nsignals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in\nboth domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments\nacross five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise\nperturbations and periodicity tests.

Existing AIGC services usually assume that the accuracy of\nthe generated content can be ensured, given accurate input data and prompt,\nthus only the content generation quality (CGQ) is concerned. However, it is not\napplicable in ISAC-based AIGC networks, where content generation is based on\ninaccurate sensed data. Moreover, the AIGC model itself introduces generation\nerrors, which depend on the number of generating steps (i.e., computing\nresources). To assess the quality of experience of ISAC-based AIGC services, we\npropose a content accuracy and quality aware service assessment metric (CAQA).\nSince allocating more resources to sensing and generating improves content\naccuracy but may reduce communication quality, and vice versa, this\nsensing-generating (computing)-communication three-dimensional resource\ntradeoff must be optimized to maximize the average CAQA (AvgCAQA) across all\nusers with AIGC (CAQA-AIGC). This problem is NP-hard, with a large solution\nspace that grows exponentially with users. To solve the CAQA-AIGC problem with\nlow complexity, a linear programming (LP) guided deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) algorithm with an action filter (LPDRL-F) is proposed. Through the\nLP-guided approach and the action filter, LPDRL-F can transform the original\nthree-dimensional solution space to two dimensions, reducing complexity while\nimproving the learning performance of DRL. Simulations show that compared to\nexisting DRL and generative diffusion model algorithms without LP, LPDRL-F\nconverges faster by over 60% and finds better resource allocation solutions,\nimproving AvgCAQA by more than 14%. With LPDRL-F, CAQA-AIGC can achieve an\nimprovement in AvgCAQA of more than 50% compared to existing schemes focusing\nsolely on CGQ.",

However,\nrecent investigations have shown that this model fails to capture the full\nspectrum of AGN variability. In this work, we model the 22-year-long light\ncurves of $21,767$ quasars, spanning the redshift range $0.28 < z < 2.71$, as a\nnoise-driven damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) process. The light curves, in the\noptical $g$ and $r$ bands, are collected and combined from the Sloan Digital\nSky Survey, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, and the\nZwicky Transient Facility. A DHO process can be defined using four parameters,\ntwo for describing its long-term behavior/variability, and the other two for\ndescribing its short-term behavior/variability. We find that the best-fit DHO\nmodel describes the observed variability of our quasar light curves better than\nthe best-fit DRW model. Furthermore, the best-fit DHO parameters exhibit\ncorrelations with the rest-frame wavelength, the Eddington ratio, and the black\nhole mass of our quasars. Based on the power spectral density shape of the\nbest-fit DHOs and these correlations, we suggest that the observed long-term\nvariability of our quasars can be best explained by accretion rate or thermal\nfluctuations originating from the accretion disk, and the observed short-term\nvariability can be best explained by reprocessing of X-ray variability\noriginating from the corona. The additional information revealed by DHO\nmodeling emphasizes the need to go beyond DRW when analyzing AGN light curves\ndelivered by next-generation wide-field time-domain surveys.",

    "abstract": "The Single-Source Shortest Path (SSSP) problem is a cornerstone of computer\nscience with vast applications, for which Dijkstra's algorithm has long been\nthe classical baseline. While various quantum algorithms have been proposed,\ntheir performance has typically been benchmarked against this decades-old\napproach. This landscape was recently reshaped by the introduction of a new\nclassical algorithm by Duan et al. with a complexity of $O(m \\cdot (\\log\nn)^{2/3})$. This development necessitates a re-evaluation of the quantum\nadvantage narrative for SSSP. In this paper, we conduct a systematic\ntheoretical comparison of modern quantum and classical SSSP algorithms in light\nof this new classical frontier. Through an analysis of their theoretical cost\nfunctions, we illustrate how their relative scaling compares across scenarios\nthat vary in graph density and path length. Our analysis suggests a nuanced\npicture: sophisticated quantum algorithms, such as the one by Wesolowski and\nPiddock, can exhibit more favorable asymptotic scaling, but only in regimes\ncharacterized by short solution paths. Conversely, for problems involving long\npaths, state-of-the-art classical algorithms appear to maintain a scaling\nadvantage. Our work provides an updated perspective for future quantum\nalgorithm development and underscores that the pursuit of quantum advantage is\na dynamic race where the classical goalposts are continually shifting.",

    "abstract": "Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services\nthrough multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users'\nheterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains\nboth accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer\nType-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates\nconsumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type\ntheory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and\nexpert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.\nsatisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction\nhistories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user\ntypes in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate\nuser types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that\ndynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query\ncomplexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like\nstrategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,\nand Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces\ninteraction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that\nboth consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance\ngains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and\ninterpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the\nintegration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.",

We also show when amplification weakens or disappears, most\nnotably under pure wage stickiness, where the price channel shuts down and the\nheterogeneity-driven term vanishes. The framework features household\nheterogeneity between savers and hand-to-mouth households and adheres strictly\nto microeconomic foundations while avoiding restrictive assumptions on relative\nwages or labor supply across types that are common in prior analytical work.\nThe closed-form solution makes transparent how price stickiness, wage\nstickiness, and the share of hand-to-mouth households jointly shape\namplification. We further derive a modified aggregate welfare loss function\nthat quantifies how heterogeneity, operating through distributional effects\nfrom firm profits, re-weights the relative importance of stabilizing inflation.\nOverall, the tractable yet micro-founded analytical framework clarifies the\ninteraction between household heterogeneity and nominal rigidities and\npinpoints the precise conditions under which monetary policy gains or loses\ntraction.",

    "abstract": "Classical measures of structural reliability, such as the probability of\nfailure and the related reliability index, are still widely applied in\npractice. However, these measures are frequency-based only, and they do not\ngive information about the severity of failure once it happens. This missing\naspect can cause underestimation of risks, in particular when rare events\nproduce very undesirable consequences. In this paper, a new reliability\nframework is proposed to address this issue. The framework is based on a new\nconcept, called the Expected Failure Deficit (EFD), which is defined as the\naverage deficiency of the system response when failure occurs. From this\nquantity, a new reliability index is introduced, called the Severity-Aware\nReliability Index, which evaluates the consequence of failure in comparison\nwith the Gaussian benchmark. The mathematical formulation is derived and it is\nshown that the inverse mapping exists in a restricted domain, which can be\ninterpreted as an indicator of excessive tail risks. A Severity Classification\nSystem with five levels is also proposed and calibrated from analytical\nexpressions. Numerical examples, including Gaussian, mildly nonlinear, and\nheavy-tailed cases, demonstrate that the proposed framework agrees with\nclassical measures in standard situations, while being able to detect hidden\nseverity in more complex cases. The method can therefore be used not only to\nquantify severity of failure, but also to classify risks in support of\nengineering design.",

    "abstract": "Network-based systems are inherently interconnected, with the design and\nperformance of subnetworks being interdependent. However, the decisions of\nself-interested operators may lead to suboptimal outcomes for users and the\noverall system. This paper explores cooperative mechanisms that can\nsimultaneously benefit both operators and users. We address this challenge\nusing a game-theoretical framework that integrates both non-cooperative and\ncooperative game theory. In the non-cooperative stage, we propose a network\ndesign game in which subnetwork decision-makers strategically design local\ninfrastructures. In the cooperative stage, co-investment with payoff-sharing\nmechanism is developed to enlarge collective benefits and fairly distribute\nthem. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct case\nstudies on the Sioux Falls network and real-world public transport networks in\nZurich and Winterthur, Switzerland. Our evaluation considers impacts on\nenvironmental sustainability, social welfare, and economic efficiency. The\nproposed framework provides a foundation for improving interdependent networked\nsystems by enabling strategic cooperation among self-interested operators.",

The certificate is represented as an integer\nderivable from both the source code and the binary using a concise set of\nderivation rules, each applied in constant time.

Here,\nwe compare for the first time the detailed spectral-timing properties of Cyg\nX-1 with a transient BHXRB, MAXI J1820+070, combining data from XMM-Newton and\nNICER with contemporaneous INTEGRAL data to study the power spectra, rms\nspectra and time-lags over a broad 0.5 - 200 keV range.

Cyg X-1\nshows no evidence for soft lags in the 1 - 10 Hz frequency range where they are\nclearly detected for MAXI J1820+070. Furthermore the low-frequency hard lags\nand rms-spectra evolve much more strongly during the hard state of Cyg X-1 than\nfor MAXI J1820+070. We argue that these differences cannot be explained by the\ndifferent black hole masses of these systems, but may be related to their\ndifferent accretion rates and corresponding locations on the hardness-intensity\ndiagram. We conjecture that there is a significant luminosity-dependence of\ncoronal geometry in the hard state of BHXRBs, rather than an intrinsic\ndifference between Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs. This possibility has also been\nsuggested to explain a common time-lag feature that appears in the hard\nintermediate states of Cyg X-1 and transient BHXRBs.",

Existing modeling\nparadigms often struggle to effectively capture the intricate, multi-factor\nregulatory logic and to rigorously manage the dual uncertainties of network\nstructure and kinetic parameters. In response, this work introduces the\nProbabilistic Categorical GRN(PC-GRN) framework. It is a novel theoretical\napproach founded on the synergistic integration of three core methodologies.\nFirstly, category theory provides a formal language for the modularity and\ncomposition of regulatory pathways. Secondly, Bayesian Typed Petri Nets (BTPNs)\nserve as an interpretable,mechanistic substrate for modeling stochastic\ncellular processes, with kinetic parameters themselves represented as\nprobability distributions. The central innovation of PC-GRN is its end-to-end\ngenerative Bayesian inference engine, which learns a full posterior\ndistribution over BTPN models (P (G, {\\Theta}|D)) directly from data. This is\nachieved by the novel interplay of a GFlowNet, which learns a policy to sample\nnetwork topologies, and a HyperNetwork, which performs amortized inference to\npredict their corresponding parameter distributions. The resulting framework\nprovides a mathematically rigorous, biologically interpretable, and\nuncertainty-aware representation of GRNs, advancing predictive modeling and\nsystems-level analysis.",

We consider a realistic scenario where\nthe target data is limited in size while the external data is large but\ncontaminated with outliers; such data contamination, along with other\ncomputational and operational constraints, necessitates proper selection or\nsubsampling of the external data for transfer learning. To our\nknowledge,transfer learning and subsampling under data contamination have not\nbeen thoroughly investigated.

Two\nsubsampling strategies are investigated: one aimed at reducing biases and the\nother at minimizing variances. Approaches to combine these strategies are also\nintroduced to enhance the performance of the estimators. We provide\nnon-asymptotic error bounds for the transfer learning estimators, clarifying\nthe roles of sample sizes, signal strength, sampling rates, magnitude of\noutliers, and tail behaviors of model error distributions, among other factors.\nExtensive simulations show the superior performance of the proposed methods.\nAdditionally, we apply our methods to analyze the risk of hard landings in A380\nairplanes by utilizing data from other airplane types,demonstrating that robust\ntransfer learning can improve estimation efficiency for relatively rare\nairplane types with the help of data from other types of airplanes.",

However, forecasting\nfuture intensities is hindered by the limitations of historical data alone. To\novercome this, we propose a novel Graph Double Exponential Smoothing (GDES)\nmodel, which integrates graph neural networks (GNNs) with a nonparametric\ndouble exponential smoothing approach to predict the probability of future\nsupply edge formations.Recognizing the interdependent economic dynamics between\nupstream and downstream firms, we assume that the Poisson intensity functions\nof supply edges are correlated, aligning with the non-homogeneous nature of the\nprocess.Our model is interpretable, decomposing intensity increments into\ncontributions from the current edge's historical data and influences from\nneighboring edges in the supply chain network. Evaluated on a large-scale\nsupply chain dataset with 87,969 firms, our approach achieves an AUC of 93.84 %\nin dynamic link prediction, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing\ncomplex supply chain interactions for accurate forecasting.",

Among the\nQMC techniques, Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) is widely regarded as the most\nreliable, since it provides the projection onto the ground state of a given\nHamiltonian under the fixed-node approximation. One practical realization of\nDMC is the Lattice Regularized Diffusion Monte Carlo (LRDMC) method, which\ndiscretizes the Hamiltonian within the Green's Function Monte Carlo framework.\nDMC methods - including LRDMC - employ the so-called branching technique to\nstabilize walker weights and populations.

    "abstract": "Active inference is a formal approach to study cognition based on the notion\nthat adaptive agents can be seen as engaging in a process of approximate\nBayesian inference, via the minimisation of variational and expected free\nenergies. Minimising the former provides an account of perceptual processes and\nlearning as evidence accumulation, while minimising the latter describes how\nagents select their actions over time. In this way, adaptive agents are able to\nmaximise the likelihood of preferred observations or states, given a generative\nmodel of the environment. In the literature, however, different strategies have\nbeen proposed to describe how agents can plan their future actions. While they\nall share the notion that some kind of expected free energy offers an\nappropriate way to score policies, sequences of actions, in terms of their\ndesirability, there are different ways to consider the contribution of past\nmotor experience to the agent's future behaviour. In some approaches, agents\nare assumed to know their own actions, and use such knowledge to better plan\nfor the future. In other approaches, agents are unaware of their actions, and\nmust infer their motor behaviour from recent observations in order to plan for\nthe future. This difference reflects a standard point of departure in two\nleading frameworks in motor control based on the presence, or not, of an\nefference copy signal representing knowledge about an agent's own actions. In\nthis work we compare the performances of action-aware and action-unaware agents\nin two navigations tasks, showing how action-unaware agents can achieve\nperformances comparable to action-aware ones while at a severe disadvantage.",

Differently, the recently released\nBongard-RWR dataset aimed at representing abstract concepts formulated in the\noriginal BPs using fine-grained real-world images.

However, most automated methods estimate\nlandmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even\nsmall shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant\nmeasurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent\nsemi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining\nlandmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated\nAnatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To\nenable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in\nthis work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised\nB-mode landmark detector.

We introduce Generalized Point Spread Function Fitting (GPSF),\na method for removing point-source contamination in polarization maps. GPSF\nuses the full pixel-domain covariance, including off-diagonal terms, and models\noverlapping sources. This allows accurate flux estimation under realistic\nconditions, particularly for small-aperture telescopes with large beams that\nare more susceptible to source blending.

The\nresults show GPSF reduces point-source contamination without significantly\naffecting the background signal, as seen in both the maps and their power\nspectra. For the constraint on $r$, GPSF reduces the bias from $1.67 \\times\n10^{-3}$ to $2.9 \\times 10^{-4}$, with only a 2% increase in standard\ndeviation.

    "abstract": "Complex systems universally exhibit emergence, where macroscopic dynamics\narise from local interactions, but a predictive law governing this process has\nbeen absent. We establish and verify such a law. We define a system's causal\npower at a spatial scale, $\\ell$, as its Effective Information (EI$_\\ell$),\nmeasured by the mutual information between a targeted, maximum-entropy\nintervention and its outcome. From this, we derive and prove a Middle-Scale\nPeak Theorem: for a broad class of systems with local interactions, EI$_\\ell$\nis not monotonic but exhibits a strict maximum at a mesoscopic scale $\\ell^*$.\nThis peak is a necessary consequence of a fundamental trade-off between\nnoise-averaging at small scales and locality-limited response at large scales.\nWe provide quantitative, reproducible evidence for this law in two distinct\ndomains: a 2D Ising model near criticality and a model of agent-based\ncollective behavior. In both systems, the predicted unimodal peak is decisively\nconfirmed by statistical model selection. Our work establishes a falsifiable,\nfirst-principles law that identifies the natural scale of emergence, providing\na quantitative foundation for the discovery of effective theories.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted\nincreasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene\nunderstanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most\nmethods still unify all background elements into a single representation,\nhindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some\napproaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on\npre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to\ndiscrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor\nscenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving\nscenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian\nSplatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic\ndriving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D\nfeature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the\n3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities\nand enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static\ncodebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without\nrequiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the\nbest of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance\nsegmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are\navailable at our project page.",

To address the stringent requirements, this study enables RSMA\nfinite blocklength (FBL) transmissions and explicitly evaluates the ergodic\nperformance. We derive the closed-form lower bound for the ergodic sum-rate of\nRSMA, considering vital factors such as the vehicle velocities, vehicle\npositions, power allocation of each stream, blocklengths, and block error rates\n(BLERs). To further enhance the ergodic sum-rate while complying with quality\nof service (QoS) rate constraints, we jointly optimize the global power\ncoefficient, private power distribution, and common rate splitting. Guided by\ngradient descent, we first adjust the global power coefficient based on its\nsum-rate solution. This parameter regulates the power state of the common\nstream, allowing for dynamic activation or deactivation: if active, we optimize\nthe private power distribution and adjust the common rate splitting to meet\nminimum transmission constraints; if inactive, we use the sequential quadratic\nprogramming for private power distribution optimization. Simulation results\nconfirm that our RSMA scheme significantly improves the ergodic performance,\nreduces blocklength and BLER, surpassing the RSMA counterpart with average\nprivate power and space division multiple access (SDMA).

This\nuniversality is, however, sensitive to the nature of the accretion flow and\nbreaks down for spherically symmetric infalling accretion, where Doppler shifts\nand non-static emission introduce image features that depend on the flow\ndynamics and the metric. Finally, we investigate photon regions in a rotating\nCPS spacetime and find that unlike in Kerr spacetime, the photon region appears\nas one or two angular sectors in a constant-$\\phi$ cross section. These\ndistinctive photon region properties could produce observable signatures that\ndistinguish rotating CPS spacetimes from the Kerr one.",

For\nproduct understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures\ndrive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one\nalignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue\nthat generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant\npotential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,\nachieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:\nthe lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the\ncommon presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a\nstandard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the\nfirst generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation\nlearning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for\ntargeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)\neffectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the\ndistraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the\nspecialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity\nof negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark\nMBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model\ndemonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the\npublic dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream\ntasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute\nprediction.

Understanding the physical origins of these extreme\nN-emitters at low redshifts enables us to better constrain chemical enrichment\nmechanisms that drove such high log(N/O) values in the early Universe. With\ndirect N and O abundances derived for 944 SFGs with spectroscopic observational\ndata from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1),\nwe report the discovery of 19 extreme N-emitters at low-z (z$<$0.5).

Due to degeneracies between\norbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their\nstatistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a\nBayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian\nalgorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected\nrelative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four\nsufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the\ngeneral algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely\nbecause the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is\nusually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is\napplied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are\navailable. The value of $\\Gamma \\equiv \\log_{10}\\sqrt{G/G_{\\rm N}}$ (where\n$G_{\\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting\nNewton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\\rm\nN}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or\n$0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\\rm\nN}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton.\nThe Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape\nvelocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study\ndemonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low\nacceleration with future samples of wide binaries.",

To\ninternalize this reasoning process, we develop a two-stage training paradigm:\nthe first stage uses explicit ACH-inspired scaffolding to guide the model\nthrough structured reasoning, while the second stage progressively removes this\nscaffolding to encourage autonomous generalization. Experiments on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentCDM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and exhibits strong generalization, validating its effectiveness in\nimproving the quality and robustness of collaborative decisions in MAS.",

For the generator, two architectures, a\nconvolutional autoencoder, and a convolutional U-Net, are tested. The\nexperiment results have shown that the proposed approach allows for an accurate\ntranslation, enabling the use of wrist sensor inertial signals for efficient,\nevery-day gait analysis.",

    "abstract": "Accurate ocean forecasting is essential for supporting a wide range of marine\napplications. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have highlighted the\npotential of data-driven models to outperform traditional numerical approaches,\nparticularly in atmospheric weather forecasting. However, extending these\nmethods to ocean systems remains challenging due to their inherently slower\ndynamics and complex boundary conditions. In this work, we present MedFormer, a\nfully data-driven deep learning model specifically designed for medium-range\nocean forecasting in the Mediterranean Sea. MedFormer is based on a U-Net\narchitecture augmented with 3D attention mechanisms and operates at a high\nhorizontal resolution of 1/24{\\deg}. The model is trained on 20 years of daily\nocean reanalysis data and fine-tuned with high-resolution operational analyses.\nIt generates 9-day forecasts using an autoregressive strategy. The model\nleverages both historical ocean states and atmospheric forcings, making it\nwell-suited for operational use. We benchmark MedFormer against the\nstate-of-the-art Mediterranean Forecasting System (MedFS), developed at\nEuro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change (CMCC), using both analysis data\nand independent observations. The forecast skills, evaluated with the Root Mean\nSquared Difference and the Anomaly Correlation Coefficient, indicate that\nMedFormer consistently outperforms MedFS across key 3D ocean variables. These\nfindings underscore the potential of data-driven approaches like MedFormer to\ncomplement, or even surpass, traditional numerical ocean forecasting systems in\nboth accuracy and computational efficiency.",

Despite its\nimportance, no large-scale benchmark exists for evaluating agents on future\nprediction, largely due to challenges in handling real-time updates and\nretrieving timely, accurate answers. To address this, we introduce\n$\\textbf{FutureX}$, a dynamic and live evaluation benchmark specifically\ndesigned for LLM agents performing future prediction tasks. FutureX is the\nlargest and most diverse live benchmark for future prediction, supporting\nreal-time daily updates and eliminating data contamination through an automated\npipeline for question gathering and answer collection. We evaluate 25 LLM/agent\nmodels, including those with reasoning, search capabilities, and integration of\nexternal tools such as the open-source Deep Research Agent and closed-source\nDeep Research models. This comprehensive evaluation assesses agents' adaptive\nreasoning and performance in dynamic environments.

    "abstract": "Deterministic nature of iterated map models of population dynamics is\njustifiable for infinite-sized populations, as the stochastic fluctuations are\nnegligible in this limit. However, they are ill-suited for finite-population\nsystems where finite-size effects like demographic noise and extinction cannot\nbe ignored. Adding noise to the equations cannot model the demographic noise as\nit can only represent environmental stochasticity. An approach, sometimes used\nin ecological literature, but surprisingly uncommon in dynamical systems\ncommunity, is \\emph{Binomial maps}, which allow stochastic evolution of\ndeterministic iterated map models of population. Here we present their\nformulation in a way so as to make their connection to the agent-based models\nexplicit, and demonstrate it for the Logistic and Ricker maps. We also show\nthat the Binomial maps are not completely equivalent to their deterministic\ncounterparts, and derive sufficient conditions under which the equivalence\nholds. This approach enables rigorous finite-population analysis within\nfamiliar map-based models, opening the door to systematic study of extinction\nrisk, quasi-stationarity, and noise-induced transitions.",

Moreover, such a group can be found among solvable\ngroups of derived length $3$; due to what, in a strengthened way, we extend a\ntheorem of Kharlampovich, Miasnikov and Sapir.\n  {Next, we consider computability aspects related to those growth functions.\nIn particular, we characterize the decidability of the word problem in\nresidually finite groups with respect to \\emph{individual residual finiteness\ndepth} functions. Then, we give a full description of sufficiently fast\n{growing} functions that are realizable as RFG for some group \\emph{with\ndecidable word problem} in terms of \\emph{left-computable functions.} We also\nshow that a Turing degree can be realized via RFG of a group with decidable\nword problem if and only if it is recursively enumerable.\n  Finally, applying the introduced theoretical framework, we answer several\nopen questions and extend known results. For example, answering a question of\nMinasyan, by providing a construction, we show the existence of conjugacy\nseparable groups with decidable word problem and undecidable conjugacy problem.\nTwo more applications, including an answer to a question by Nies, can be found\nin the appendix coauthored with Rauzy.}",

This paper presents a bandit-based charging\nframework for WP-IoT systems using mobile chargers with practical beamforming\ncapabilities and real-time charging constraints. We explicitly consider\ntime-varying channel state information (CSI) and impose a strict charging\ndeadline in each round, which reflects the hard real-time constraint from the\ncharger's limited battery capacity. We formulate a temporal-spatial charging\npolicy that jointly determines the charging locations, durations, and\nbeamforming configurations. Area discretization enables polynomial-time\nenumeration with constant approximation bounds. We then propose two online\nbandit algorithms for both stationary and non-stationary unknown channel state\nscenarios with bounded regrets.

Within this framework, information\nscrambling can be classified into two distinct types: entanglement scrambling\nand magic scrambling.

    "abstract": "Edge detection serves as a critical foundation for numerous computer vision\napplications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image\nediting, by extracting essential structural cues that define object boundaries\nand salient edges. To be viable for broad deployment across devices with\nvarying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy\nwith low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved\naccuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their\napplicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the\nchallenge of achieving that balance: \\textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture\ndiscriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated\nmodels}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to\nreduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection\naccuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived\nfrom heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple\nparameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble\nperspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and\nqualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also\nprovide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements,\nhighlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource\nconstraints.

However, one possible downside is that the contribution\nof non-WAXp sets is neglected. In fact, non-WAXp sets can also convey important\ninformation, because of the relationship between formal explanations (XPs) and\nadversarial examples (AExs). Accordingly, this paper leverages Shapley value\nand Banzhaf index to devise two novel feature importance scores.

However, most research focuses on improving the output\nquality of LLMs (e.g., correctness), and less attention has been paid to the\nLLM input (e.g., the training code quality). Given that code smells are widely\nexisted in practice and can negatively impact software maintainability and\nreadability, this study takes the first systematic research to assess and\nimprove dataset quality in terms of code smells. In this work, we first conduct\na preliminary study to explore the presence of code smells in a popular\nbenchmark dataset (i.e., CodeSearchNet-Python}) and evaluate the output of\nseveral popular LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder, CodeLlama, and MagiCoder),\nrevealing that code smell issues extensively exist in LLM's input (e.g.,\nbenchmark dataset) and output (e.g., generated code). We then conduct our\nsystematic research by taking three main steps: Firstly, we propose an\nLLM-based code smell cleaning tool, named SmellCC, which automatically\nrefactors and removes code smells. To evaluate the correctness of the code\nrefactoring, we construct a test set of 50 repositories sourced from the\nCodeSearchNet-Python benchmark for functional testing. Then we apply our\ncurated smell-cleaned dataset to fine-tune two LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-V2 and\nQwen-Coder) to explore their potential for generating high-quality code.\nThirdly, we investigate the impact of code smells on two downstream tasks: code\ncompletion and code search.

In addition, we introduce Object-level\nSelective Supervision (OSS), an object-level filtering strategy that supervises\nonly the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip.\nThis selective supervision reduces semantic noise and reinforces\nlanguage-conditioned learning.

We develop a framework to quantify HIs in viscoelastic\nfluids with high spatiotemporal precision by trapping colloids and inducing\ntranslation-rotation hydrodynamic coupling. Using solutions of wormlike\nmicelles (WLMs) as a case study, we discover that HIs are strongly\ntime-dependent and depend on the structural memory generated in the\nviscoelastic fluid, in contrast to \"instantaneous\" HIs in viscous Newtonian\nfluids. We directly measure time-dependent HIs between a stationary probe and a\ndriven particle during transient start-up, developing on the WLM relaxation\ntimescale.

Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a\nprecision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of\n55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both\nsensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR\noffers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue\nmonitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future\nenhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and\nembedded optimization.",

    "abstract": "Dynamical phase transitions in the relaxation behavior of stochastic quantum\nwalks are investigated, focusing on systems where coherent unitary evolution is\nperiodically interrupted by dephasing. This interplay leads to a\nclassicalization of the dynamics, effectively described by non-equilibrium\nMarkovian processes that can violate detailed balance. As a result, such\nsystems exhibit a richer and more complex spectral structure than their\nequilibrium counterparts. Extending recent insights from classical Markov\ndynamics [G. Teza {\\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\\bf 130}, 207103 (2023)], we\ndemonstrate that these quantum-classical hybrid systems can host not only\nfirst-order dynamical phase transitions -- characterized by eigenvalue\ncrossings -- but also second-order transitions marked by the coalescence of\neigenvalues and eigenvectors at exceptional points. We analyze two paradigmatic\nmodels: a quantum walk on a ring under gauge fields and a walk on a finite line\nwith internal degrees of freedom, both exhibiting distinct mechanisms for\nbreaking detailed balance. These findings reveal a novel class of critical\nbehavior in open quantum systems, where decoherence-induced classicalization\nenables access to non-Hermitian spectral phenomena. Beyond their fundamental\ninterest, our results offer promising implications for quantum technologies,\nincluding quantum simulation, error mitigation, and the engineering of\ncontrollable non-equilibrium quantum states.",

Disjunctive existential rules (a.k.a.\ndisjunctive tuple-generating dependencies in the database literature) form such\na prominent rule-based language. The goal of this work is to pinpoint the\nexpressive power of disjunctive existential rules in terms of insightful\nmodel-theoretic properties. More precisely, given a collection $\\mathcal{C}$ of\nrelational structures, we show that $\\mathcal{C}$ is axiomatizable via a finite\nset $\\Sigma$ of disjunctive existential rules (i.e., $\\mathcal{C}$ is precisely\nthe set of models of $\\Sigma$) iff $\\mathcal{C}$ enjoys certain model-theoretic\nproperties. This is achieved by using the well-known property of criticality, a\nrefined version of closure under direct products, and a novel property called\ndiagrammatic compatibility that relies on the method of diagrams. We further\nestablish analogous characterizations for the well-behaved classes of linear\nand guarded disjunctive existential rules by adopting refined versions of\ndiagrammatic compatibility that consider the syntactic restrictions imposed by\nlinearity and guardedness; this illustrates the robustness of diagrammatic\ncompatibility. We finally exploit diagrammatic compatibility to rewrite a set\nof guarded disjunctive existential rules into an equivalent set that falls in\nthe weaker class of linear disjunctive existential rules, if one exists.",

After introducing the properties of\naccelerating black holes, including the event horizon, ergosphere, circular\norbits, and innermost stable circular orbit, we investigate the magnetic\nreconnection process in the plunging region. Specifically, we analyze\nvariations of the azimuthal angle with respect to the acceleration, examine\nchanges in energy per enthalpy of decelerated plasma, and plot energy\nextraction efficiency along with permissible energy extraction regions. Results\nshow that in the plunging region, at larger radii of reconnection locations,\nthe accelerating black hole exhibits higher energy extraction efficiency than a\nKerr black hole. Away from extremality, the acceleration parameter impedes\nenergy extraction, while near extremality, it enhances extraction. We also\nstudy energy extraction in circular orbit region by plotting energy extraction\nefficiency within permissible regions. We find that the permissible energy\nextraction area is reduced and the efficiency exceeds that of Kerr black holes\ndue to the existence of acceleration parameter. Larger acceleration parameters\nyield more effective energy extraction regardless of extremality, which is\ndifferent from that in the plunging region.

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) time series are known to exhibit\nlong-range temporal dependencies that challenge traditional modeling\napproaches. In this study, we propose a novel computational pipeline to\ncharacterize and interpret these dependencies using a long-memory (LM)\nframework, which captures the slow, power-law decay of autocorrelation in\nresting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals. The pipeline involves voxelwise\nestimation of LM parameters via a wavelet-based Bayesian method, yielding\nspatial maps that reflect temporal dependence across the brain. These maps are\nthen projected onto a lower-dimensional space via a composite basis and are\nthen related to individual-level covariates through group-level regression. We\napplied this approach to the ADHD-200 dataset and found significant positive\nassociations between age in children and the LM parameter in the hippocampus,\nafter adjusting for ADHD symptom severity and medication status. These findings\ncomplement prior neuroimaging work by linking long-range temporal dependence to\ndevelopmental changes in memory-related brain regions. Overall, the proposed\nmethodology enables detailed mapping of intrinsic temporal dynamics in rs-fMRI\nand offers new insights into the relationship between functional signal memory\nand brain development.",

While\nlearning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods\noptimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in\ninefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this\nwork, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes\nhumanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets.

An execution validator supports the closed loop by\nverifying each action and triggering re-planning.

This paper introduces a novel theoretical framework to\ndecipher the intricate interplay between attack and protection complexities in\nprivacy-preserving FL. We formally define \"Attack Complexity\" as the minimum\ncomputational and data resources an adversary requires to reconstruct private\ndata below a given error threshold, and \"Protection Complexity\" as the expected\ndistortion introduced by privacy mechanisms. Leveraging Maximum Bayesian\nPrivacy (MBP), we derive tight theoretical bounds for protection complexity,\ndemonstrating its scaling with model dimensionality and privacy budget.\nFurthermore, we establish comprehensive bounds for attack complexity, revealing\nits dependence on privacy leakage, gradient distortion, model dimension, and\nthe chosen privacy level.

The jets were generated from\nnonfluidized granular beds, in contrast to existing granular Worthington jets\nthat originate from fluidized layers. To elucidate the jet dynamics, we\nperformed experiments in which a test tube partially filled with dry glass\nbeads was dropped onto a flat rigid floor, systematically varying the granular\npile height$L_{\\rm G}$, drop height $H$, and particle size. The resulting jet\nformation in granular media was driven by the same kinematic focusing mechanism\nresponsible for jetting in liquids. By conducting parallel experiments using\nlow-viscosity silicone oil under identical conditions, we directly compared the\ngranular and liquid jets. At low pile heights, the granular jet velocity\nquantitatively agreed with the liquid jet velocity. However, at high pile\nheights, contrasting trends emerged. Specifically, the granular jet velocity\ndecreased with increasing $L_{\\rm G}$, while the liquid jet velocity increased\ndue to cavitation. Discrete element method simulations confirmed that the\nvelocity reduction in granular jets arose from energy dissipation via\ngrain--grain contacts during impact force propagation.

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution (SR) in resource-constrained scenarios demands\nlightweight models balancing performance and latency. Convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) offer low latency but lack non-local feature capture, while\nTransformers excel at non-local modeling yet suffer slow inference. To address\nthis trade-off, we propose the Large Kernel Modulation Network (LKMN), a pure\nCNN-based model. LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel\nBlock (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN). The EPLKB utilizes\nchannel shuffle to boost inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel\nattention to focus on key information, and applies large kernel strip\nconvolutions on partial channels for non-local feature extraction with reduced\ncomplexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local,\nand non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a\ncross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their\ncomplementarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight SR models while balancing quality\nand efficiency. Specifically, LKMN-L achieves 0.23 dB PSNR improvement over\nDAT-light on the Manga109 dataset at $\\times$4 upscale, with nearly $\\times$4.8\ntimes faster. Codes are in the supplementary materials.

With the growing of large language models (LLMs), instruction\ntuning has emerged as a critical paradigm for ERC.

However, these methods inherently constrains the\ncapacity to jointly capture the dynamic interaction between speaker\ncharacteristics and conversational context, resulting in weak alignment among\nspeaker identity, contextual cues, and emotion states within a unified\nframework. In this paper, we propose InitERC, a simple yet effective one-stage\nin-context instruction tuning framework for ERC. InitERC adapts LLMs to learn\nspeaker-context-emotion alignment from context examples via in-context\ninstruction tuning. Specifically, InitERC comprises four components, i.e.,\ndemonstration pool construction, in-context example selection, prompt template\ndesign, and in-context instruction tuning.

However,\nthis challenging task severely amplifies the issues of catastrophic forgetting\nof old knowledge and overfitting on scarce new data. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel framework built upon Dual-Granularity\nRepresentations, termed the Dual-Granularity Guidance Network (DGGN). Our DGGN\nexplicitly decouples feature learning into two parallel streams: 1) a\nfine-grained representation stream, which utilizes a novel Multi-Order\nInteraction Aggregation module to capture discriminative, class-specific\nfeatures from the limited new samples. 2) a coarse-grained representation\nstream, designed to model and preserve general, class-agnostic knowledge shared\nacross all fault types. These two representations are dynamically fused by a\nmulti-semantic cross-attention mechanism, where the stable coarse-grained\nknowledge guides the learning of fine-grained features, preventing overfitting\nand alleviating feature conflicts. To further mitigate catastrophic forgetting,\nwe design a Boundary-Aware Exemplar Prioritization strategy. Moreover, a\ndecoupled Balanced Random Forest classifier is employed to counter the decision\nboundary bias caused by data imbalance.

Assuming an optimistic\nbinary neutron star (BNS) merger rate, we generate synthetic inspiral\ngravitational wave (GW) signals corresponding to one year of observation. From\nthese simulated data, we compute the covariance matrix and posterior\ndistributions for nuclear properties and EoS. Our results show that the EoS can\nbe tightly constrained, particularly in the density range between one and four\ntimes nuclear saturation density. However, due to the scarcity of of low-mass\nneutron stars in the GW sample, the EoS at sub-saturation densities remains\npoorly constrained. Thus, in turn, leads to weaker constraints on neutron star\nradii, as the radii are sensitive to the low-density EoS. Additionally, We note\nthat the nuclear properties are degenerate in their influence on the EoS,\nmaking them difficult to be constrained through GW observations alone. These\nhighlights inherent limitations of inspiral GW signals in probing dense matter\nproperties. Therefore, precise radius measurements, post-merger GW\nobservations, and supplementary constraints from terrestrial nuclear\nexperiments remain essential for a comprehensive understanding of dense matter.",

    "abstract": "Simulating vibrational dynamics is essential for understanding molecular\nstructure, unlocking useful applications such as vibrational spectroscopy for\nhigh-fidelity chemical detection. Quantum algorithms for vibrational dynamics\nare emerging as a promising alternative to resource-demanding classical\napproaches, but this domain is largely underdeveloped compared to quantum\nsimulations of electronic structure. In this work, we describe in detail three\ndistinct forms of the vibrational Hamiltonian: canonical bosonic quantization,\nreal space representation, and the Christiansen second-quantized form.\nLeveraging Lie algebraic properties of each, we develop efficient fragmentation\nschemes to enable the use of Trotter product formulas for simulating time\nevolution. We introduce circuits required to implement time evolution in each\nform, and highlight factors that contribute to the simulation cost, including\nthe choice of vibrational coordinates. Using a perturbative approach for the\nTrotter error, we obtain tight estimates of T gate cost for the simulation of\ntime evolution in each form, enabling their quantitative comparison. Combining\ntight Trotter error estimates and efficient fragmentation schemes, we find that\nfor the medium-sized CH$_4$ molecule with 9 vibrational modes, time evolution\nfor approximately 1.8 ps may be simulated using as little as 36 qubits and\napproximately $3 \\times 10^{8}$ T gates -- an order-of-magnitude speedup over\nprior-art algorithms. Finally, we present calculations of vibrational spectra\nusing each form to demonstrate the fidelity of our algorithms. This work\npresents a unified and highly optimized framework that makes simulating\nvibrational dynamics an attractive use case for quantum computers.",

    "abstract": "Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal\nof prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high\ngeneration quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,\nface challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like\nmissing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token\nremoval. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.\n  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt\ncompression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method\ncenters at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method\nsplits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be\nmore concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We\ndesign several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized\nsemantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,\ncompression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques\neffectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and\ncoherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the\ncompression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and\nsummarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The\nevaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression\nquality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially\nunder high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality\nof our method.",

    "abstract": "In several applications in distributed systems, an important design criterion\nis ensuring that the network is sparse, i.e., does not contain too many edges,\nwhile achieving reliable connectivity. Sparsity ensures communication overhead\nremains low, while reliable connectivity is tied to reliable communication and\ninference on decentralized data reservoirs and computational resources. A class\nof network models called random K-out graphs appear widely as a heuristic to\nbalance connectivity and sparsity, especially in settings with limited trust,\ne.g., privacy-preserving aggregation of networked data in which networks are\ndeployed. However, several questions remain regarding how to choose network\nparameters in response to different operational requirements, including the\nneed to go beyond asymptotic results and the ability to model the stochastic\nand adversarial environments. To address this gap, we present theorems to\ninform the choice of network parameters that guarantee reliable connectivity in\nregimes where nodes can be finite or unreliable. We first derive upper and\nlower bounds for probability of connectivity in random K-out graphs when the\nnumber of nodes is finite. Next, we analyze the property of r-robustness, a\nstronger notion than connectivity that enables resilient consensus in the\npresence of malicious nodes. Finally, motivated by aggregation mechanisms based\non pairwise masking, we model and analyze the impact of a subset of adversarial\nnodes, modeled as deletions, on connectivity and giant component size - metrics\nthat are closely tied to privacy guarantees.

    "abstract": "Scan-based operations, such as backstage compaction and value filtering, have\nemerged as the main bottleneck for LSM-Trees in supporting contemporary\ndata-intensive applications. For slower external storage devices, such as HDD\nand SATA SSD, the scan performance is primarily limited by the I/O bandwidth\n(i.e., I/O bound) due to the substantial read/write amplifications in\nLSM-Trees. Recent adoption of high-performance storage devices, such as NVMe\nSSD, has transformed the main limitation to be compute-bound, emerging the\nimpact of computational resource consumption caused by inefficient compactions\nand filtering. However, when the value size increases, the bottleneck for scan\nperformance in fast devices gradually shifts towards the I/O bandwidth as well,\nand the overall throughput across all types of devices undergo a dramatic\nreduction. This paper addresses the core issues by proposing LSM-OPD, a Log-S\ntructured M erge-O rder- Preserving Dictionary encoding scheme that enables\ndirect computing on compressed data within LSM-Trees. It first enables\nkey-value-separated data flushing to disk in a densely encoded columnar layout,\nideally with few bytes for a large string value (e.g., 1024 bytes), thereby\nsignificantly alleviating the frequent I/O requests caused by intensive scans.\nThen, it is capable of offloading the costly scan-based operations on large\nvalues, including compaction and value filtering, to lightweight dictionaries\ndue to the order-preserving property. And SIMD-based vectorization can now be\nemployed to maximize the evaluating performance on modern multi-core\nprocessors, further breaking the compute-bound limitations in LSM-trees.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency of LSM-OPD in\nprocessing various workloads that involve intensive scan-based operations on\ndiverse modern storage devices.",

    "abstract": "Beam energy compression via chicane magnets has been proved to be an\neffective method to reduce the slice energy spread of electron beams generated\nby laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs). This technique has been widely adopted\nby leading research teams in experiments targeting future compact, high-gain\nfree electron lasers (FELs). However, after energy compression, a strong beam\nenergy chirp is introduced into the electron beam, which substantially hinders\nthe microbunching process and impairs spectral coherence. Here, we present a\ndetailed, unaveraged three-dimensional simulation that examines the effects of\nthis energy chirp, and the results can be applied to the design of a proposed\nLWFA-driven VUV FEL. The energy chirp in a LWFA-produced electron beam causes\nFEL interactions at multiple resonant frequencies across the entire electron\nbunch, simultaneously, which prevents sustained radiation power growth at the\ndesigned frequency along the undulator. Consequently, spectral purity is\nsignificantly degraded. Additionally, due to undulator dispersion, the energy\nchirp leads to an elongation of the bunch length, which increases microbunch\nseparation. This results in a noticeable redshift in the radiation frequency\nand further disruption of spectral purity. These effects are compared to the\nideal scenario in which the energy chirp is removed following energy\ncompression. Simulation results indicate that the implementation of a beam\ndechirper is a crucial step for improving the saturation of radiation power.\nInsights gained from this simulation of energy chirp-induced mechanisms will\naid in the development of more effective compensation strategies, ultimately\noptimizing LWFA-driven FEL designs.",

    "abstract": "The robust Wald confidence interval (CI) for the Cox model is commonly used\nwhen the model may be misspecified or when weights are applied. However it can\nperform poorly when there are few events in one or both treatment groups, as\nmay occur when the event of interest is rare or when the experimental arm is\nhighly efficacious. For instance, if we artificially remove events (assuming\nmore events are unfavorable) from the experimental group, the resulting upper\nCI may increase. This is clearly counter-intuitive as a small number of events\nin the experimental arm represents stronger evidence for efficacy. It is well\nknown that, when the sample size is small to moderate, likelihood CIs are\nbetter than Wald CIs in terms of actual coverage probabilities closely matching\nnominal levels. However, a robust version of the likelihood CI for the Cox\nmodel remains an open problem. For example, in the SAS procedure PHREG, the\nlikelihood CI provided in the outputs is still the regular version, even when\nthe robust option is specified. This is obviously undesirable as a user may\nmistakenly assume that the CI is the robust version. In this article we\ndemonstrate that the likelihood ratio test statistic of the Cox model converges\nto a weighted chi-square distribution when the model is misspecified. The\nrobust likelihood CI is then obtained by inverting the robust likelihood ratio\ntest. The proposed CIs are evaluated through simulation studies and illustrated\nusing real data from an HIV prevention trial.",

    "abstract": "Integer programming lies at the heart of crucial combinatorial optimization\ntasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. An effective approach\nfor practically solving integer programs is the manual design of acceleration\ncuts, i.e. inequalities that improve solver performance. However, this creative\nprocess demands deep expertise and is yet to be automated. Our proposed\nframework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts by combining\nlarge language models (LLMs) with an evolutionary search. EvoCut (i)\ninitializes a diverse population of candidate cuts via an LLM-based initializer\nagent; (ii) for each cut empirically evaluates both preservation of the optimal\nsolution and its ability to cut off fractional solutions across a verification\nset; and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary\ncrossover and mutation agents. We quantify each cut's utility by its relative\nreduction in the solver's optimality gap. Our comparisons against standard\ninteger programming practice show that EvoCut reduces optimality gap by 17-57%\nwithin a fixed time. It obtains the same solutions up to 4 times as fast, and\nobtains higher-quality solutions within the same time limit. Requiring no human\nexpert input, EvoCut reliably generates, improves, and empirically verifies\ncuts that generalize to unseen instances.

When we apply our method to matchups from two popular\nhuman-preference platforms, Chatbot Arena and MT-Bench, we find that the\nBradley--Terry rankings of top-performing models are remarkably sensitive to\nthe removal of a small fraction of evaluations. Our framework also identifies\nthe specific evaluations most responsible for such ranking flips, allowing for\ninspections of these influential preferences. We observe that the rankings\nderived from MT-Bench preferences are notably more robust than those from\nChatbot Arena, likely due to MT-bench's use of expert annotators and carefully\nconstructed prompts. Finally, we find that rankings based on crowdsourced\nhuman-evaluated systems are just as sensitive as those based on LLM-as-a-judge\nevaluations, where in both, dropping as little as 0.02% of the total\nevaluations in the dataset can change the top-ranked model.",
