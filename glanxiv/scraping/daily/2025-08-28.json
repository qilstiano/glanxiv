    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great potential for autonomous\ndecision-making in the cybersecurity domain, enabling agents to learn through\ndirect environment interaction. However, RL agents in Autonomous Cyber\nOperations (ACO) typically learn from scratch, requiring them to execute\nundesirable actions to learn their consequences. In this study, we integrate\nexternal knowledge in the form of a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on\ncybersecurity data that our RL agent can directly leverage to make informed\ndecisions. By guiding initial training with an LLM, we improve baseline\nperformance and reduce the need for exploratory actions with obviously negative\noutcomes. We evaluate our LLM-integrated approach in a simulated cybersecurity\nenvironment, and demonstrate that our guided agent achieves over 2x higher\nrewards during early training and converges to a favorable policy approximately\n4,500 episodes faster than the baseline.",

    "abstract": "Temporal neural networks (TNNs) are neuromorphic neural networks that utilize\nbit-serial temporal coding. TNNs are composed of columns, which in turn employ\nneurons as their building blocks. Each neuron processes volleys of input\nspikes, modulated by associated synaptic weights, on its dendritic inputs.\nRecently proposed neuron implementation in CMOS employs a Spike Response Model\n(SRM) with a ramp-no-leak (RNL) response function and assumes all the inputs\ncan carry spikes. However, in actual spike volleys, only a small subset of the\ndendritic inputs actually carry spikes in each compute cycle. This form of\nsparsity can be exploited to achieve better hardware efficiency. In this paper,\nwe propose a Catwalk neuron implementation by relocating spikes in a spike\nvolley as a sorted subset cluster via unary top-k. Such relocation can\nsignificantly reduce the cost of the subsequent parallel counter (PC) for\naccumulating the response functions from the spiking inputs. This can lead to\nimprovements on area and power efficiency in RNL neuron implementation.\nPlace-and-route results show Catwalk is 1.39x and 1.86x better in area and\npower, respectively, as compared to existing SRM0-RNL neurons.",

To\naddress SFQ constraints such as limited dense RAM and restricted fanin/fanout,\nwe propose a deeply pipelined NTT-128 architecture using shift register memory\n(SRM). Designed for N=128 32-bit coefficients, NTT-128 comprises log2(N)=7\nprocessing elements (PEs), each featuring a butterfly unit (BU), dual\ncoefficient memories operating in ping-pong mode via FIFO-based SRM queues, and\ntwiddle factor buffers. The BU integrates a Shoup modular multiplier optimized\nfor a small area, leveraging precomputed twiddle factors. A new RSFQ cell\nlibrary with over 50 parameterized cells, including compound logic units, was\ndeveloped for implementation. Functional and timing correctness were validated\nusing JoSIM analog simulations and Verilog models. A multiphase clocking scheme\nwas employed to enhance robustness and reduce path-balancing overhead,\nimproving circuit reliability. Fabricated results show the NTT-128 unit\nachieves 531 million NTT/sec at 34 GHz, over 100x faster than state-of-the-art\nCMOS equivalents. We also project that the architecture can scale to larger\nsizes, such as a 2^14-point NTT in approximately 482 ns. Key-switch throughput\nis estimated at 1.63 million operations/sec, significantly exceeding existing\nhardware.

For example,the wave effect of microlensing may mimic spin\nprecessions,as both effects generically induce periodic waveform modulations.\nAlthough previous studies suggest that lensing-induced modulations can be\ndistinguished from precession using parameter estimation under a\ngeometric-optic approximation,it does not directly apply for lensed image\nthrough stellar fields due to large number of stars involved an wave-optic\neffects. This study aims to evaluate the degree of degeneracy between the\nstellar-field microlensing and spin precession,investigating whether\nmicrolensing leads false evidence of precession. In other words,to what extent\nobserved SLGWs are identified with false evidence of precession. The main\nfindings are as follows. First,assuming O5 sensitivity and parallel spins for\nthe underlying binary black holes,microlensing-induced false evidence of\nprecession is generally weak(15% of the events show significant evidence,30% if\nthe signal-to-noise ratio doubles). Second,for highly magnified events,about\n72% of the population show significant evidence of precession,which could serve\nas an identification criterion for microlensing. This implies the possibility\nof strong lensing for the recent event GW231123,which is in the mass gap and\nalso shows evidence of precession. Finally,a moderate to strong positive\ncorrelation exists between microlensing strength and precession evidence,more\npronounced in Type II SLGWs.",

Attribution patching offers a\nfaster, gradient-based approximation, yet suffers from noise and reduced\nreliability in deep, highly non-linear networks. In this work, we introduce\nRelevance Patching (RelP), which replaces the local gradients in attribution\npatching with propagation coefficients derived from Layer-wise Relevance\nPropagation (LRP). LRP propagates the network's output backward through the\nlayers, redistributing relevance to lower-level components according to local\npropagation rules that ensure properties such as relevance conservation or\nimproved signal-to-noise ratio. Like attribution patching, RelP requires only\ntwo forward passes and one backward pass, maintaining computational efficiency\nwhile improving faithfulness. We validate RelP across a range of models and\ntasks, showing that it more accurately approximates activation patching than\nstandard attribution patching, particularly when analyzing residual stream and\nMLP outputs in the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task. For instance, for\nMLP outputs in GPT-2 Large, attribution patching achieves a Pearson correlation\nof 0.006, whereas RelP reaches 0.956, highlighting the improvement offered by\nRelP.

We focus on\n''transferrable'' task representations -- vector representations that can\nrestore task context in another instance of the model, even without the full\nprompt. We show that these representations evolve in non-monotonic and sporadic\nways, and are distinct from a more inert representation of high-level task\ncategories that persists throughout the context. Specifically, models often\ncondense multiple evidence into these transferrable task representations, which\nalign well with the performance improvement based on more examples in the\ncontext. However, this accrual process exhibits strong locality along the\nsequence dimension, coming online only at certain tokens -- despite task\nidentity being reliably decodable throughout the context. Moreover, these local\nbut transferrable task representations tend to capture minimal ''task scopes'',\nsuch as a semantically-independent subtask, and models rely on more\ntemporally-distributed representations to support longer and composite tasks.\nThis two-fold locality (temporal and semantic) underscores a kind of\njust-in-time computational process underlying language models' ability to adapt\nto new evidence and learn new tasks on the fly.",

Traditional HMR methods are\ndesigned to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these\nmethods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to\nimprove alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly\naccount for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In\ncontrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's\nbody shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned\non that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose\nprior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides\nthe pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose\nprior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D\nconstraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose\naccuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often\noverlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,\nrequiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile\nplug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose\nestimators to enhance their performance.

CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between\nCUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo,\nwith Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific\nlexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL\ntranslation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code\nand CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend\nimplementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate\neffectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains,\nachieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends.\nThe universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort,\nrequiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions\ninclude: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming\nparadigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a\ncomprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and\nsystems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical\nviability of universal code translation.

This complicates causal interpretation because results may\nreflect both ad content effectiveness and changes to audience composition. We\noffer three key contributions.

While\nML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate\naerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly\nevolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single\nmodel demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel\nmeta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a\nstrength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated\ngating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three\nheterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable\nmulti-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph\nneural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution\nnetwork. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy,\nassigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in\npredicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model\ncollapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy\nregularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is\ntrained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark\nof high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative\nresults demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2\nprediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most\naccurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities.

For example, if the array of detectors is being fed a large\nfield of view, then each detector will have a different angle of incidence. Any\nindividual bandpass filters need to be held perpendicular to the incoming beam\nso as not to create variances of central wavelength transmission from detector\nto detector.

    "abstract": "Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification\nby modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such\nas the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square\npatching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and\nproduces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing\ncomputation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching\nstrategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by\nspanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving\nharmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We\nalso introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines\nfull-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget,\nenhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When\napplied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by\nup to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2,\nwhile reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and\nefficiency gains.",

For high-dimensional input spaces, such as of CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,\nwe design a scheme where the SOM operates over the latent space learned by a\nVAE, whereas, for lower-dimensional inputs, such as those found in MNIST and\nFashionMNIST, the SOM operates in a standalone fashion. Our method stores a\nrunning mean, variance, and covariance for each SOM unit, from which synthetic\nsamples are then generated during future learning iterations. For the VAE-based\nmethod, generated samples are then fed through the decoder to then be used in\nsubsequent replay. Experimental results on standard class-incremental\nbenchmarks show that our approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art\nmemory-based methods and outperforms memory-free methods, notably improving\nover best state-of-the-art single class incremental performance on CIFAR-10 and\nCIFAR-100 by nearly $10$\\% and $7$\\%, respectively.

We derive rates of the different supernova and\nremnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such\nas the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation\nsignificantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars\nfavouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating\ncounterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity\ndependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50\n$M_{\\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is\npredicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\\odot}$, with the most massive black\nholes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities.

We\nexamine using TCs to compute Euclidean distance calculations, which are used in\nmany data analytics applications. Prior work has only investigated using 64 bit\nfloating point (FP64) data for computation; however, TCs can operate on lower\nprecision floating point data (i.e., 16 bit matrix multiplication and 32 bit\naccumulation), which we refer to as FP16-32. FP16-32 TC peak throughput is so\nhigh that TCs are easily starved of data. We propose a Fast and Scalable Tensor\ncore Euclidean Distance (FaSTED) algorithm. To achieve high computational\nthroughput, we design FaSTED for significant hierarchical reuse of data and\nmaximize memory utilization at every level (global memory, shared memory, and\nregisters). We apply FaSTED to the application of similarity searches, which\ntypically employ an indexing data structure to eliminate superfluous Euclidean\ndistance calculations. We compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) TC Euclidean\ndistance algorithm in the literature that employs FP64, as well as to two\nsingle precision (FP32) CUDA core algorithms that both employ an index.

    "abstract": "Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,\ntreatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains\nchallenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In\nthis study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were\ntrained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as\npart of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold\ncross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically\nrelevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic\nMRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI\nwith expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor\nSegmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases\nwith expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated\nsegmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity\nCoefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean\nAverage Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,\nthe algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD\nof 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC\nof 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203\nmm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor\nsegmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by\ndifferent MRI sequences.

    "abstract": "Entropy stable methods have become increasingly popular in the field of\ncomputational fluid dynamics. They often work by satisfying some form of a\ndiscrete entropy inequality: a discrete form of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.\nSchemes which satisfy a (semi-)discrete entropy inequality typically behave\nmuch more robustly, and do so in a way that is hyperparameter free. Recently, a\nnew strategy was introduced to construct entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin\nmethods: knapsack limiting, which blends together a low order, positivity\npreserving, and entropy stable scheme with a high order accurate scheme, in\norder to produce a high order accurate, entropy stable, and positivity\npreserving scheme. Another recent strategy introduces an entropy correction\nartificial viscosity into a high order scheme, aiming to satisfy a cell entropy\ninequality.\n  In this work, we introduce the techniques of knapsack limiting and artificial\nviscosity for finite difference discretizations. The proposed schemes preserve\nhigh order accuracy in sufficiently smooth conditions, are entropy stable, and\nare hyperparameter free. Moreover, the proposed knapsack limiting scheme\nprovably preserves positivity for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes\nequations. Both schemes achieve this goal without significant performance\ntradeoffs compared to state of the art stabilized schemes.",

    "abstract": "Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models\n(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly\nlabeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces\nannotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture\n\\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes\nVisual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on\nseen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only\n\\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter\nadaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer\nsemantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through\ntask-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\\eg, DINO) to extract\nID-discriminative features via \\textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning\nLLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables\ngeneralization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific\nretraining.

The mutual information rate, a core concept of information\ntheory, quantifies the amount of information shared between the trajectories of\ninput and output signals, and enables the quantification of information flow in\ndynamic systems. A common approach for estimating the mutual information rate\nis the Gaussian approximation which assumes that the input and output\ntrajectories follow Gaussian statistics.

In two case\nstudies, we examine the limitations of the Gaussian approximation.

Second, we explore a continuous diffusive\nsystem with a nonlinear transfer function, revealing significant deviations\nbetween the Gaussian approximation and the exact mutual information rate as\nnonlinearity increases.

However, the\nstandard understanding of spin waves as collective spin oscillations in an\neffective harmonic potential does not consider the possibility of soft modes,\nsuch as those due to an effective quartic potential. In this work, we show that\nsuch quartic potentials arise under very general conditions in a broad class of\nisotropic spin systems without a fine-tuning of the interaction parameters.\nConsidering models with spin spiral ground states in two and three spatial\ndimensions, we numerically demonstrate that quartic amplitude spin oscillations\nproduce a fluctuation-induced spin-wave gap which grows with temperature\naccording to a characteristic power-law. In conjunction with a phenomenological\ntheory, the present work provides a general theoretical framework for\ndescribing soft spin modes, extending the previously discussed spin dynamics in\nthe presence of order-by-disorder, and highlighting the important role of\nfinite-size effects. Our predictions of a temperature-dependent gap in spiral\nspin systems could be tested in inelastic neutron scattering experiments,\nproviding direct spectroscopic evidence for thermal effects arising from soft\nspin modes in magnetic materials.",

We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked\nto navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to\ntargets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead\nto deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only\nprovides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees\nnon-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of\ninterest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\\times K}$ cost structure that\ndescribes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport\nthen provides \\textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the\nrobots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling\nconsiderations. The proposed solution requires $\\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\\log K)$\ncomputations in the worst-case and $\\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\\log K)$ for\nwell-behaved problems.

Although system size grows exponentially with the number of\nspins, our approach exploits the low-rank structure of the density matrix and\nthe sparsity of Hamiltonians to avoid full matrix computations. By representing\ndensity matrices via low-rank factors and applying Krylov subspace methods for\npartial eigendecompositions, we reduce the per-step complexity of Runge-Kutta\nand Adams-Bashforth schemes from $\\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(r^2N)$,\nwhere $N = 2^n$ is the Hilbert space dimension for $n$ spins and $r \\ll N$ the\neffective rank.

However, when computed independently at different\nlayers, CAVs often exhibit inconsistencies, making cross-layer comparisons\nunreliable. To address this issue, we propose the Global Concept Activation\nVector (GCAV), a novel framework that unifies CAVs into a single, semantically\nconsistent representation. Our method leverages contrastive learning to align\nconcept representations across layers and employs an attention-based fusion\nmechanism to construct a globally integrated CAV. By doing so, our method\nsignificantly reduces the variance in TCAV scores while preserving concept\nrelevance, ensuring more stable and reliable concept attributions. To evaluate\nthe effectiveness of GCAV, we introduce Testing with Global Concept Activation\nVectors (TGCAV) as a method to apply TCAV to GCAV-based representations. We\nconduct extensive experiments on multiple deep neural networks, demonstrating\nthat our method effectively mitigates concept inconsistency across layers,\nenhances concept localization, and improves robustness against adversarial\nperturbations. By integrating cross-layer information into a coherent\nframework, our method offers a more comprehensive and interpretable\nunderstanding of how deep learning models encode human-defined concepts.

To illustrate this point, we collect multiple responses from a\ntarget LLM and employ an auxiliary LLM to analyze their patterns of\ndisagreement.

This\npaper shows that even with sparse temporal observations, there might be enough\ninformation from surrounding coherent motions, sharing the same dynamics, to\nprovide highly probable trajectories. The proposed coherent predictor is\nderived from the concept of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), which are\nadvective transport barriers that govern the cohesive motion of neighbouring\nparticles. Coherent trajectories are quantified using a local segmentation with\nthe finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE). The coherent predictor incorporates\ninformation from the particle's position history and neighbouring coherent\nvelocity and acceleration into a novel generic energy function to predict its\ntrajectory. We assess our proposed approach using both three-dimensional (3D)\nsynthetic and experimental data of the wake behind a smooth cylinder and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) homogeneous isotropic turbulent (HIT) flow. The coherent\npredictor is deemed generic due to its consistent behaviour regardless of flow\ndimensions, Reynolds number, and flow topology. Our results demonstrate that\nthe optimal parameters of the proposed energy function can be modelled based on\nmeasurement uncertainties, resulting in enhanced prediction accuracy and\nreduced uncertainty compared to current methods. We reveal direct signatures of\nflow topology, including the cylinder leading edge boundary layer, sideward\nshear layers, and vortex formation structures, on the prediction error map.\nThese topologies, which are fundamental structures in fluid dynamics, are\nmarked by high Lagrangian gradients and 3D directional motions.

When\nconsidering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are\nthree conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)\ndistortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and\n(iii) independent distortion in the two images.

Despite significant research effort,\nbasic questions remain about the design and analysis of randomized linear\nalgebra algorithms that employ structured random matrices.\n  This paper develops a new perspective on structured dimension reduction,\nbased on the oblivious subspace injection (OSI) property. The OSI property is a\nrelatively weak assumption on a random matrix that holds when the matrix\npreserves the length of vectors on average and, with high probability, does not\nannihilate any vector in a low-dimensional subspace. With the OSI abstraction,\nthe analysis of a randomized linear algebra algorithm factors into two parts:\n(i) proving that the algorithm works when implemented with an OSI; and (ii)\nproving that a given random matrix model has the OSI property.\n  This paper develops both parts of the program. First, it analyzes standard\nrandomized algorithms for low-rank approximation and least-squares regression\nunder the OSI assumption. Second, it identifies many examples of OSIs,\nincluding random sparse matrices, randomized trigonometric transforms, and\nrandom matrices with tensor product structure.

From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context\nand temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside\nthe simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the\ncommon ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The\nanalysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an\nexact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus\nsampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees.

Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific\ninnovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely\nrelying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a\ntargeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM\nachieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on\nthe 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences,\ncompared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.",

For this, we\nconsider a system of coupled Swift--Hohenberg equations with dispersive terms\nand general, smooth nonlinearities. Close to the onset of instability, we\nderive a system of two coupled complex Ginzburg--Landau equations with a\nsingular advection term as amplitude equations and justify the approximation by\nproviding error estimates. We then construct space-time periodic solutions to\nthe amplitude equations, as well as fast-travelling front solutions, which\nconnect different space-time periodic states. This yields the existence of\nsolutions to the pattern-forming system on a finite, but long time interval,\nwhich model the spatial transition between different patterns. The construction\nis based on geometric singular perturbation theory exploiting the fast\ntravelling speed of the fronts. Finally, we construct global, spatially\nperiodic solutions to the pattern-forming system by using centre manifold\nreduction, normal form theory and a variant of singular perturbation theory to\nhandle fast oscillatory higher-order terms.",

We investigate their impact on full-shape\nclustering analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift\nuncertainty introduces a damping effect on the power spectrum. This damping is\nscale-dependent and absorbed by counterterms in the clustering model, keeping\nparameter biases below $5\\%$ for the DESI survey. Catastrophic failures reduce\nthe power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor scaling with\ncontamination rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for the DESI ELG\npopulations ($f_c=1\\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift\nuncertainty with $f_c=5\\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in\ncosmological constraints. For this case, shifts from $6\\%$ to $16\\%$\n($\\sim2.2\\sigma$ level) arise in estimating the fractional growth rate\n$df\\equiv f/f^{\\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\\ln(10^{10}\nA_{s})$. Applying a correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum\nmitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new\ndegeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value during fitting\nsuccessfully restores the unbiased posterior without loss in constraint. Our\nresults indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \\textit{Euclid},\nan accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model\nare essential to get unbiased cosmological constraints. Extending to evolving\ndark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, we find that redshift errors do\nnot bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but lead\nto slightly weaker constraints on $\\sum m_\\nu$.",

Musical harmonization shares similarities with text aggregation,\nhowever the language of harmony is more structured than general text.\nConcretely, given a set of harmonization suggestions for a given musical\nmelody, our interest lies in devising aggregation algorithms that yield an\nharmonization sequence that satisfies the following two key criteria: (1) an\neffective representation of the collective suggestions; and (2) an\nharmonization that is musically coherent.

At the heart of the instrument are\ntwo HgCdTe Teledyne Imaging H2RG detectors, designed for a 100kHz pixel clock\nrate (slow mode) with a fixed 4-channel readout.

This\ncombination allows the detector to be read out at faster pixel clock rates.\nThis, in combination with the slow-mode H2RG, is what we characterize as hybrid\nfast-slow readout, enabling readout up to 18 times faster than would be\npossible in slow mode alone.

Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional\nlayers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent\nlayers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and\na two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first\nadaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the\ntraining set.

This\nsteeper slope arises from the interplay between scattering and the dust disk\nbecoming more extended over time (changes in star-dust geometry). At higher\ninclination, scattering is suppressed, and the attenuation curves slightly\nsteepen over time due to small-grain formation and the bias of observed UV\nlight toward older stars. The bump strengthens on a timescale of ~250 Myr due\nto the formation of small carbonaceous grains. The bump strength is affected\nnot only by the abundance of small grains but also by star-dust geometry. At\nhigher $A_V$ or higher inclination, the bump weakens. These results may help\ninterpret flatter attenuation curves and weaker bumps in high-redshift\ngalaxies. Variations in star-dust geometry alter the amount of scattered\nphotons escaping the galaxy, driving the anti-correlation between the slope and\n$A_V$. Scatter in this relation arises from differences in dust optical depth\nalong and perpendicular to the line of sight, reflecting inclination and\nstar-dust geometry. Additional contributions come from variations in grain size\ndistribution and the fraction of obscured young stars.",

    "abstract": "Automatic vehicle location (AVL) data offers insights into transit dynamics,\nbut its effectiveness is often hampered by inconsistent update frequencies,\nnecessitating trajectory reconstruction. This research evaluates 13 trajectory\nreconstruction methods, including several novel approaches, using\nhigh-resolution AVL data from Austin, Texas. We examine the interplay of four\ncritical factors -- velocity, position, smoothing, and data density -- on\nreconstruction performance. A key contribution of this study is evaluation of\nthese methods across sparse and dense datasets, providing insights into the\ntrade-off between accuracy and resource allocation. Our evaluation framework\ncombines traditional mathematical error metrics for positional and velocity\nwith practical considerations, such as physical realism (e.g., aligning\nvelocity and acceleration with stopped states, deceleration rates, and speed\nvariability). In addition, we provide insight into the relative value of each\nmethod in calculating realistic metrics for infrastructure evaluations. Our\nfindings indicate that velocity-aware methods consistently outperform\nposition-only approaches. Interestingly, we discovered that smoothing-based\nmethods can degrade overall performance in complex, congested urban\nenvironments, although enforcing monotonicity remains critical. The velocity\nconstrained Hermite interpolation with monotonicity enforcement (VCHIP-ME)\nyields optimal results, offering a balance between high accuracy and\ncomputational efficiency. Its minimal overhead makes it suitable for both\nhistorical analysis and real-time applications, providing significant\npredictive power when combined with dense datasets. These findings offer\npractical guidance for researchers and practitioners implementing trajectory\nreconstruction systems and emphasize the importance of investing in\nhigher-frequency AVL data collection for improved analysis.",

    "abstract": "High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including\nonline communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However,\ndegradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a\nmajor challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio\nrestoration, they typically require significant computational resources and\nstruggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM\n(Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an\nefficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and\ndenoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral\ndomain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing\ncomputational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical\nevaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves\naccurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores\n(0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still\nunderperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual\nquality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and\nSTOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to\nsuboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient\ntraining duration.

We find that galaxy SFHs in all three models are sensitive to\nchanges in stellar feedback, which affects the efficiency of baryon cycling and\nthe rates at which central black holes grow, while effects of varying AGN\nfeedback depend on model-dependent implementations of black hole seeding,\naccretion and feedback. We also find strong interaction terms that couple\nstellar and AGN feedback, usually by regulating the amount of gas available for\nthe central black hole to accrete. Using a double power-law to describe the\naverage SFHs, we derive a general set of equations relating the shape of the\nSFHs to physical quantities like baryon fraction and black hole mass across all\nthree models. We find that a single set of equations (albeit with different\ncoefficients) can describe the SFHs across all three CAMELS models, with\ncosmology dominating the SFH at early times, followed by halo accretion, and\nfeedback and baryon cycling at late times.

    "abstract": "The stability of high-speed liquid jets is crucial for applications ranging\nfrom precision printing to needle-free drug delivery, yet it is fundamentally\nlimited by capillary-driven breakup. A common strategy to stabilize jets is to\nuse surfactants to lower surface tension. However, in nozzle-free jetting\ndriven by surface acoustic waves (SAWs), extreme deformation rates cause\nconventional surfactants to desorb, calling for alternative strategies to\nstabilize jets. In particular, we find that tuning the nanoscale softness of\nPNIPAM microgels provides a robust, biocompatible strategy to overcome this\nlimitation. Soft, low-cross-linker-density microgels form elastic interfacial\nnetworks at the air-water interface that suppress surface tension recovery,\ndelay Rayleigh-Plateau instabilities, and extend SAW-driven jet lengths by up\nto 44%. In contrast, stiffer microgels lose network cohesion under strain,\nleading to rapid jet breakup. To gain molecular-level insights, we perform\ndissipative particle dynamics simulations, which reveal that polymer bridges in\nsoft microgels remain entangled during elongation, maintaining a reduced\neffective surface tension.

    "abstract": "Auditing the privacy leakage of synthetic data is an important but unresolved\nproblem. Most existing privacy auditing frameworks for synthetic data rely on\nheuristics and unreasonable assumptions to attack the failure modes of\ngenerative models, exhibiting limited capability to describe and detect the\nprivacy exposure of training data through synthetic data release. In this\npaper, we study designing Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) that specifically\nexploit the observation that tabular generative models tend to significantly\noverfit to certain regions of the training distribution. Here, we propose\nGenerative Likelihood Ratio Attack (Gen-LRA), a novel, computationally\nefficient No-Box MIA that, with no assumption of model knowledge or access,\nformulates its attack by evaluating the influence a test observation has in a\nsurrogate model's estimation of a local likelihood ratio over the synthetic\ndata. Assessed over a comprehensive benchmark spanning diverse datasets, model\narchitectures, and attack parameters, we find that Gen-LRA consistently\ndominates other MIAs for generative models across multiple performance metrics.\nThese results underscore Gen-LRA's effectiveness as a privacy auditing tool for\nthe release of synthetic data, highlighting the significant privacy risks posed\nby generative model overfitting in real-world applications.",

We have previously demonstrated that an active\ndual-nanopore system, consisting of two closely spaced pores operated via\nfeedback controlled biasing, shows promise in achieving controlled, slowed-down\ntranslocation. Translocation control is achieved via capturing the DNA in a\nspecial tug-of-war configuration, whereby opposing electrophoretic forces at\neach pore are applied to a DNA molecule co-captured at the two pores. Here, we\nsystematically explore translocation physics during DNA tug-of-war focusing on\ngenomically relevant longer dsDNA using a T$_4$-DNA model (166\\,kbp). We find\nthat longer molecules can be trapped in tug-of-war states with an asymmetric\npartitioning of contour between the pores. Secondly, we explore the physics of\nDNA disengagement from a tug-of-war configuration, focusing on the dynamics of\nDNA free-end escape, in particular how the free-end velocity depends on pore\nvoltage, DNA size and the presence of additional DNA strands between the pores\n(i.e. arising in the presence of folded translocation).

To\naddress this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a\ntotal of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each\ntesting a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed\ndatasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test\nthe perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their\nperformance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,\nour experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with\nincreasing problem complexity across all categories.

However, real-world scenarios lack such comprehensive mappings and\nface evolving user queries. We thus propose to study LLM routing as a\ncontextual bandit problem, enabling adaptive decision-making using bandit\nfeedback without requiring exhaustive inference across all LLMs for all queries\n(in contrast to supervised routing). To address this problem, we develop a\nshared embedding space for queries and LLMs, where query and LLM embeddings are\naligned to reflect their affinity.

We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of\ndark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been\naccreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a\ndistribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from\na vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly\nfor more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place\nwithin a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find\nthat the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior\ninspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the\nenvironmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial\ndata are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.",

Anisotropies are a key discriminator of the origin of\nthis GWB, as they are expected to be at 1--20\\% for astrophysical sources, but\nsuppressed for cosmological GWBs. However, contrary to gravitational wave\ndetectors at higher frequencies, PTAs only take a few independent measurements\nof a GWB and consequently are highly sensitive to cosmic variance, which\ninduces apparent anisotropies in individual realizations of an isotropic GWB.\nWe demonstrate explicitly that statistical inference nevertheless remains\nrobust, i.e., measurements are consistent with the underlying assumption of\nisotropy. This confirms that searches for anisotropies will be able to robustly\ndiscriminate astrophysical from cosmological GWBs. En route, we demonstrate\nthat the maximum multipole constrained by a PTA dataset scales linearly with\nthe number of pulsars $\\ell_{\\rm max} \\sim N_p$.",

In addition to civil engineering structures, these wind tunnels\ncan also have applications extending towards free-flight aerodynamic tests on\ndrones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Achieving velocity profiles such as\nlinearly sheared flows or boundary layer flows in a traditional wind tunnel\nwould require long fetch lengths for the flow to evolve. However, in this work,\nwith the aid of an array of computer-controlled fans, a perfectly linearly\nsheared flow can be developed at a distance of 1 meter from the source. Unlike\nthe previous fan-array wind tunnels (FAWT) developed for atmospheric boundary\nlayer flows, the fan-array tunnel constructed in this work does not include a\ncontraction section or a honeycomb, offering portability and compactness for\nperforming unconfined flight tests. The current work involves the design and\ndevelopment of a 10 x 10 two-dimensional array of multiple fans facing a 2.4 m\nlong, enclosed test section with a 1.44 $m^2$ cross-sectional area. A\ncomprehensive characterization of key flow parameters, including turbulence\nintensity, mean velocity, and pressure, in the streamwise, spanwise, and\ntransverse directions of the test section is investigated in the developed\nFAWT. These measurements were conducted under three distinct flow conditions,\nnamely uniform, linearly sheared, and parabolic. Additionally, this work also\npresents the evolution of the turbulent length scales and time scales across\nvarious sections inside the tunnel for a range of wind speeds by employing\nautocorrelation techniques and power spectral analysis.",

Motivated by these findings, we introduce a class of models for\nsingle-flavor FBs with inversion symmetry, where we show a local attractive\ninteraction between orbitals with opposite parities leads to an exact\nsuperconducting ground state. We argue that this model can be relevant to\nrealistic multi-flavor systems including short-range repulsion, since the main\neffect of such repulsion is to induce flavor polarization leaving possibly\nattractive residual interaction between different flavorless orbitals. The\nnature of the pairing is determined by the interplay between the FB quantum\ngeometry and the interaction, and is often topological when the parent FB is\nso. Interestingly, each such model has two nearly degenerate pairing modes,\nwhose energetic competition can be tuned by a change in the charge transfer gap\nbetween the two orbitals or electron density. These modes have the same angular\nmomentum but different pairing amplitude structure and possibly different\ntopology. We show that the superfluid stiffness is proportional to the\nattractive interaction scale using a combination of analytical variational\nupper bounds and numerical bootstrap lower bounds. We find empirically that the\nmaximum superfluid stiffness is achieved when the hot spots of quantum geometry\nin the Brillouin zone are marginally filled.",

Motivated by the experiment, we theoretically\npropose a general mechanism for a $D$-controlled transition between\nsuperconductivity and ferromagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) spin-orbit-coupled\nhexagonal systems, where van Hove singularities (VHS) lie on the Fermi level.\nWe show that such a transition can be naturally captured by a simple VHS-only\nmodel without Fermi surface details, where the inter-VHS interactions that\ngovern the Fermi surface instabilities is controlled by $D$ through the band\nprojection of screened Coulomb interaction. By treating this simple model with\nrenormalization group technique beyond mean-field level, we find that a chiral\n$d/p$-wave superconductivity naturally dominates under a weak displacement\nfield $D<D_c$. At a stronger displacement field $D>D_c$, a \\textit{valley\nferromagnetic phase} (vFM) takes over, which is spatially non-uniform due to\nvalley-modulated magnetization.

    "abstract": "Very high energy electrons initiate electromagnetic showers in ordinary\nmatter that branch and multiply through bremsstrahlung and pair production. At\nextremely high energies, the quantum mechanical duration of these processes\nbecomes longer than the mean free time to elastically scatter from the medium,\nwhich leads to a very significant suppression of bremsstrahlung (and pair\nproduction) known as the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect. We revisit the\nLPM effect for bremsstrahlung of energy $k_\\gamma$ from an electron of energy\n$E$. We find that there are very large corrections to the LPM bremsstrahlung\nrate for certain regions of $(k_\\gamma,E)$ due to quantum overlap of\nbremsstrahlung and subsequent pair production. This possibility was first\nraised in the 1960s, when it was argued qualitatively that pair production\nwould significantly decrease the bremsstrahlung rate in those regions of\n$(k_\\gamma,E)$ compared to the already-suppressed LPM bremsstrahlung rate. We\nfind the opposite -- quantum overlap of bremsstrahlung with pair production\nsignificantly *increases* the bremsstrahlung rate compared to the LPM\ncalculation -- and we verify our qualitative arguments with an analytic\ncalculation of the effect.",

In this work, we investigate the growth\nof BH seeds embedded in a gas-rich, metal-poor protogalaxy at $z \\sim 15$,\nusing a suite of high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations that implement a\nslim-disc-based SE accretion model. We explore a broad parameter space varying\nthe initial BH mass, feedback efficiency, and spin. We find that SE accretion\nenables rapid growth in all cases, allowing BHs to accrete up to $10^5\\,{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$ within a few $10^3$-$10^4$ years, independent of seed properties.\nFeedback regulates this process, both by depleting central gas and altering BH\ndynamics via star formation-driven potential fluctuations, yet even the\nstrongest feedback regimes permit significantly greater growth than the\nEddington-limited case. Growth stalls after less than $\\sim$1 Myr due to local\ngas exhaustion, as no large-scale inflows are present in the adopted numerical\nsetup.

When combined with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements\nfrom DESI and Big Bang nucleosynthesis constraints, these data imply a rapid\nreionization history ($z_\\mathrm{mid}=7.00^{+0.12}_{-0.18}$ and $\\Delta\nz_{50}=1.12^{+0.12}_{-0.29}$) and a value of $\\tau=0.0492^{+0.0014}_{-0.0030}$,\nwhich is largely insensitive to the assumed cosmological model and independent\nof cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. The optical depth can also be\nmeasured from large-scale $(\\ell<30)$ CMB polarization data, yielding\nconstraints that are similarly model-insensitive and consistent with the\nLy$\\alpha$ bound. Third, $\\tau$ may be constrained from the attenuation of\nsmall-scale $(\\ell>30)$ CMB anisotropies, but the results are sensitive to the\nchoice of cosmological model. Assuming $\\Lambda$CDM and combining small-scale\nCMB data with CMB lensing and type 1a supernovae (SNe) yields tight constraints\nthat are compatible with the Ly$\\alpha$ bound.

However,\ntransferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the\nsim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can\ndegrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization\nand Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle\nunder out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In\nthis work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of\nrelying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly\nadapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve\nthis, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies\nresidual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a\ndifferentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework\nrefines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled\neffects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics\nmodel is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient\nbackpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy\nupdates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of\nour system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to\nunseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on\nagile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the\nreal world.

These risks require urgent attention from policymakers, as existing\npolicies governing industrial robots and autonomous vehicles are insufficient\nto address the full range of concerns EAI systems present. To help address this\nissue, this paper makes three contributions. First, we provide a taxonomy of\nthe physical, informational, economic, and social risks EAI systems pose.\nSecond, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to assess how existing\nframeworks address these risks and to identify critical gaps. We conclude by\noffering policy recommendations for the safe and beneficial deployment of EAI\nsystems, such as mandatory testing and certification schemes, clarified\nliability frameworks, and strategies to manage EAI's potentially transformative\neconomic and societal impacts.",

In limits where the\nseparation between insertions is taken to be either significantly greater or\nsmaller than the scrambling time, the modular-twisted product reduces,\nrespectively, to free- and tensor-product algebras that were previously studied\nin [arXiv:2209.10454]. In a sense, the modular-twisted product interpolates\nbetween these two products. Including the Hamiltonian in the scrambling algebra\nleads to a Type II$_\\infty$ von Neumann algebra with finite renormalized\nentropies that interpolate between single-QES and multi-QES phases.

We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content.

Each of these contexts calls for\nan extension of the contact process with local learning. We introduce Hebbian\nlearning as a positive or negative reinforcement of the activation rate between\na pair of sites after each successful activation event. Learning can happen\neither in both directions motivated by social distancing (mutual learning\nmodel), or in only one of the directions motivated by brain and population\ndynamics (source or target learning models). Hebbian learning leads to a rich\nclass of emergent behavior, where local incentives can lead to the opposite\nglobal effects. In general, positive reinforcement (increasing activation\nrates) leads to a loss of the active phase, while negative reinforcement\n(reducing activation rates) can turn the inactive phase into a globally active\nphase. In two dimensions and above, the effect of negative reinforcement is\ntwofold: it promotes the spreading of activity, but at the same time gives rise\nto the appearance of effectively immune regions, entailing the emergence of two\ndistinct critical points. Positive reinforcement can lead to Griffiths effects\nwith non-universal power-law scaling, through the formation of random loops of\nactivity, a manifestation of the ``ant mill\" phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and\nevolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing\nacademic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,\ntypically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing\nimages, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To\nmitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world\nchallenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake\ninvolves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with\nrigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,\nemerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,\nwe propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake\ndetector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce\npattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as\n\"planning\" and \"self-reflection\" to emulate human forensic process. We further\npropose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake\nreasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset\nreveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on\ncross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.\nOur Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is\ncapable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.",

    "abstract": "The modern Internet supports diverse applications with heterogeneous quality\nof service (QoS) requirements. Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations\noffer a promising solution to meet these needs, enhancing coverage in rural\nareas and complementing terrestrial networks in urban regions. Ensuring QoS in\nsuch networks requires joint optimization of routing, bandwidth allocation, and\ndynamic queue scheduling, as traffic handling is critical for maintaining\nservice performance. This paper formulates a joint routing and bandwidth\nallocation problem where QoS requirements are treated as soft constraints,\naiming to maximize user experience. An adaptive scheduling approach is\nintroduced to prioritize flow-specific QoS needs. We propose a Monte Carlo tree\nsearch (MCTS)-inspired method to solve the NP-hard route and bandwidth\nallocation problem, with Lyapunov optimization-based scheduling applied during\nreward evaluation. Using the Starlink Phase 1 Version 2 constellation, we\ncompare end-user experience and fairness between our proposed DSROQ algorithm\nand a benchmark scheme. Results show that DSROQ improves both performance\nmetrics and demonstrates the advantage of joint routing and bandwidth\ndecisions. Furthermore, we observe that the dominant performance factor shifts\nfrom scheduling to routing and bandwidth allocation as traffic sensitivity\nchanges from latency-driven to bandwidth-driven.",

Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by\nvisual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics\nand temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding\nas a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel\ntraining-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by\nMaximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,\nwe first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then\ndynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal\ngain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm\nthat jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby\nmaximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid\ncan maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly\nimproving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original\nperformance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the\nprefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.

The connection\nbetween SESN subtypes and their progenitors remains poorly understood, as does\nthe influence of initial mass, binarity, explodability, and metallicity on\ntheir evolutionary pathways, relative rates, ejecta masses, and progenitor\nages. Here, we investigate these properties across a wide metallicity range\n(0.01-2 $Z_{\\odot}$) using POSYDON, a state-of-the-art population synthesis\ncode that incorporates detailed single- and binary-star model grids. We find\nthat the common-envelope channel contributes less than 6% of SESNe, since\nunstable mass transfer is found less frequent than previously thought and\nrarely leads to CE survival when envelope binding energies are computed from\ndetailed stellar models. The secondary channel accounts for less than 11%,\nwhile the vast majority of SESNe originate from primary stars in binaries\nundergoing stable mass-transfer episodes. These interactions maintain a largely\nmetallicity-independent SESN parameter space, making the overall SESN rate\nalmost insensitive to metallicity. In contrast, subtype fractions exhibit\nstrong metallicity dependence, though their exact values remain affected by\nclassification thresholds. The age distributions and therefore the progenitor\nmasses of different SESN types also vary significantly with metallicity,\nrevealing metallicity-dependent trends that can be tested observationally.\nPredicted SESN ejecta masses remain nearly constant across metallicity, in\ncontrast to single-star models, and fall within observed ranges. Future\ntransient surveys, combined with statistical environmental studies that\nconstrain metallicity dependence, will provide decisive tests of these\npredictions and of the dominant role of binary interactions in shaping SESNe.",

In this work, we demonstrate that we may\nencounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely\nsimple queries.

    "abstract": "Developing a systematic view of where quantum computers will outperform\nclassical ones is important for researchers, policy makers and business\nleaders. But developing such a view is challenging because quantum advantage\nanalyses depend not only on algorithm properties, but also on a host of\ntechnical characteristics (error correction, gate speeds, etc.). Because\nvarious analyses make different assumptions about these technical\ncharacteristics, it can be challenging to make comparisons across them. In this\npaper, we introduce an open-access web-tool designed to make such comparisons\neasy. Built on the framework introduced by Choi, Moses, and Thompson (2023), it\ncalculates when quantum systems will outperform classical computers for a given\nalgorithmic problem. These estimates can be easily updated based on various\nassumptions for error correction, overhead, and connectivity. Different\nhardware roadmaps can also be used and algorithm running times can be\ncustomized to particular applications. It can currently be accessed at\nhttps://futuretech.mit.edu/quantum-economic-advantage-calculator.\n  This integrated prediction tool also allows us to explore which technical\nfactors are most important for quantum ``economic\" advantage (outperforming on\na cost-equivalent basis). Overall, we find that for some algorithms (e.g.\nShor's) the timing of advantage is quite robust, whereas for others (e.g.\nGrover's) it is contingent, with numerous technical characteristics\nsubstantially impacting these dates.

Simulations with PYTHIA8 and EPOS-LHC\nreveal that balance function widths in rapidity and azimuthal angle depend on\nmultiplicity and event shape. In PYTHIA8, widths decrease monotonically with\nmultiplicity, consistent with local charge conservation in a\nfragmentation-dominated scenario. In contrast, the EPOS-LHC model, especially\nwhen using the core corona implementation, exhibits a more intricate response,\nwhere the combined effects of hydrodynamic radial flow and longitudinal\ndiffusion result in narrower azimuthal correlations and broader rapidity\ncorrelations. These features are characteristic signatures of collective\ndynamics, similar to those observed in heavy-ion collisions. Events with low\nspherocity, which are jet-like in nature, exhibit significantly narrower\nbalance function widths compared to isotropic events with high spherocity,\nillustrating that event shape selection provides clear sensitivity to the\nunderlying dynamics of particle production in pp collisions. The species\ndependence and event-shape sensitivity of the widths provide differential\nprobes of hadronization dynamics and collectivity in small systems. These\nresults demonstrate that multidimensional, particle-identified balance function\nmeasurements can disentangle the underlying mechanisms of charge correlations\nand medium-like behavior in high-multiplicity pp collisions.",

To remove surface deposits on materials used, a chemical\netching stage is usually performed.

Hydrofluoric acid presents serious health risks to users, and such\nhazards are compounded in the case of construction in deep underground\nlaboratories. An alternative chemical etching using sulphuric acid is\npresented. This is demonstrated to etch titanium, removing 3.7 $\\mu$m of\nmaterial from the surface over the course of 20 hours. Scanning electron\nmicroscopy with back-scattered electron spectroscopy was used to study the\nsurface and contamination of the titanium, demonstrating the removal of surface\ncontaminants after etching.

In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard\nlinear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized\nKaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized\nKaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under\nmild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first\nconvergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that\nSPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic\nloss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a\nfast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first\nexplanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.\nOverall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can\nshed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware\noptimization strategies.",

POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video\nmodels:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial\ndistillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator\nfrom high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of\nsingle-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified\nadversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism\nthat promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash\nequilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step\nvideos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)\nconditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic\nconsistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated\nframes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other\nacceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,\ntemporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained\nmodel by 100$\\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining\ncompetitive performance.",

However, aligning their output\ndistributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,\ncompositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While\nreinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL\nfrom human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to\nthese generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion\nmodels and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after\nfine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models\nthrough the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward\nconditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an\ninference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining\nthe outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our\ntheoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically\nequivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL\nobjectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off\nwithout further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG\nconsistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various\narchitectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human\npreferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.\nFurthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby\noffering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment.

We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly\ndecouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language\ncausal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human\ncognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level\nvideo content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and\nlogically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal\nChain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,\nand a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in\nthese chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a\nscalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing\ndatasets using large language models.

Here we consider the fundamental building block of\nplasmonics, a subwavelength metal nanoparticle, and study how temporal\nmodulation alters the optical response of the frequency-dispersive scatterers.\nWe show that modulating in time leads to Floquet replicas of the localized\nsurface plasmon resonance of the nanoparticle, which can result in light\namplification. We propose a model based on a point-like dipole description of\nthe time-varying frequency-dispersive nanoparticle that fully captures the\nradiative and amplifying properties of the system in the subwavelength regime.\nBy comparing our simplified model to full Floquet-Mie scattering calculations,\nwe demonstrate that the optical scattering by the nanoparticle is accurately\ndescribed by an analytical two-band model. This allows us to introduce a\ntwo-frequency effective polarizability that fully incorporates the properties\nof the localized surface plasmon and its amplifying replica, as well as their\ninteraction. In addition, we analyze the emergence of the parametric\namplification condition for the modulated nanoparticle, showing that\namplification can be obtained in a broad range of parameters.",

From inverse dynamics to quadratic\nprogramming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on\naccurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model\nmismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce\nRapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,\nprobabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,\nwithout relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's\nproprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a\nprior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the\nunknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator\ndriven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden\nchanges in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\\sim400$ ms, in\nstatic and dynamic settings.

Existing backdoor defenses either\nlack comprehensiveness, focusing on narrow trigger settings, detection-only\nmechanisms, and limited domains, or fail to withstand advanced scenarios like\nmodel-editing-based, multi-trigger, and triggerless attacks. In this paper, we\npresent LETHE, a novel method to eliminate backdoor behaviors from LLMs through\nknowledge dilution using both internal and external mechanisms.

Experimental results on\nclassification and generation domains across 5 widely used LLMs demonstrate\nthat LETHE outperforms 8 state-of-the-art defense baselines against 8 backdoor\nattacks.

This critical\nproblem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the\nrobot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action\npropagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and\nsolution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due\nto uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield\nsignificantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,\nthus limiting their deployment on physical robots.

We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation\ncombining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a single\nenvironment. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, DiTree achieves on\naverage a 30% higher success rate compared to standalone DP or SBPs, on a\ndynamic car and Mujoco's ant robot settings (for the latter, SBPs fail\ncompletely).

Since their inception, there\nhave been several numerical and analytic studies of the BDNK equations which\nhave revealed their promise in modeling relativistic flows when viscous,\nfirst-order corrections to ideal hydrodynamics are important. In this paper, we\npresent numerical solutions to the BDNK equations for a $4$D conformal fluid in\nMinkowski spacetime constrained to the surface of a geometric sphere. We\nnumerically solve the underlying equations of motion by use of finite\ndifference methods applied in cubed-sphere coordinates -- a multi-block grid\nstructure which regularly and continuously covers the surface of a sphere. We\npresent three test cases of our code: linearized fluid perturbations of\nequilibrium states, a smooth, stationary initial Gaussian pulse of energy\ndensity, and Kelvin-Helmholtz-unstable initial data. In the Gaussian test case\nwith sufficiently large entropy-normalized shear viscosity, the flow, though\ninitialized in equilibrium, dynamically diverges away from equilibrium and the\nregime of validity of first-order hydrodynamics as very steep gradients form in\nthe solution, causing convergence to be lost in the numerical simulation. This\nbehavior persists at all grid resolutions we have considered, and also occurs\nat much higher resolutions in simulations of planar-symmetric ($1+1$)D\nconformal flows. These solutions provide numerical evidence that singularities\nin solutions to the BDNK equations can form in finite time from smooth initial\ndata. The numerical methods we employ on the two-sphere can be readily extended\nto include variations in the radial direction, allowing for full ($3+1$)D\nsimulations of the BDNK equations in astrophysical applications.",

Within this framework, the\nunstable mode is naturally described as a well-defined decaying (or growing)\nquantum state with a characteristic mean lifetime. We investigate its physical\nconsequences via the response of an Unruh-DeWitt detector along static,\ninertial, and uniformly accelerated trajectories.

We apply bit-bit\nencoding to a number of medium-sized datasets from OpenML and find that they\nrequire only $20$ qubits on average for encoding. Further, we extend the basic\nbit-bit encoding scheme to one that can handle batching very large datasets.

A\npromising hint in this direction comes from previous phenomenological\nobservations of quasi-universal aspects in the training dynamics of neural\nnetworks, displayed by simple properties of feature geometry. We address this\nproblem within a statistical-mechanics framework for Bayesian learning in one\nhidden layer neural networks with standard parameterization. Analytical\ncomputations in the proportional limit (when both the network width and the\nsize of the training set are large) can quantify fingerprints of feature\nlearning, both collective ones (related to manifold geometry) and microscopic\nones (related to the weights). In particular, (i) the distance between\ndifferent class manifolds in feature space is a nonmonotonic function of the\ntemperature, which we interpret as the equilibrium counterpart of a phenomenon\nobserved under gradient descent (GD) dynamics, and (ii) the microscopic\nlearnable parameters in the network undergo a finite data-dependent\ndisplacement with respect to the infinite-width limit, and develop\ncorrelations.

To address this challenge, we\nintroduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily\navailable web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images\nfrom the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a\nsimpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and\naccurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level.

Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually\nforged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than\nexisting handcrafted datasets like IMD20.

    "abstract": "Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing\nsystems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally\ninformative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot\nobserves unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we\npresent ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing\nlocalization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc\nemploys a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The\nmodel encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,\nand predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary\n3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a\npath planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that\nmaximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.\nActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and\ngeneralizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it\nreadily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.",

We consider a system where a legitimate receiver and a passive\neavesdropper experience independent and uniformly distributed angular\ndirections over transmission blocks, with the base station receiving noiseless,\nunit-delayed feedback from both, under the per-symbol input cost constraints.\nWe establish a closed-form upper bound on the secrecy capacity, which is based\non the main channel between the base station and the legitimate receiver.\nMoreover, we propose a joint communication and adaptive sensing (JCAS) scheme\nand derive its achievable secrecy rate. Simulation results show that the gap\nbetween the inner and outer bounds narrows as the number of block length\nincreases.

Here\nwe model a small active region, AR~12760 observed on 2020 April 28, with the GX\nSimulator package by fitting the EUV intensities in wavebands observed by Solar\nDynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. We assume the temporally\nand spatially averaged heating rate along a loop has a power-law dependence on\nloop length, $L$ and average magnetic field strength along the loop, $B_{avg}$.\nWe find that the best fit heating model for the 211~\\AA\\ band is\n$<\\!\\!Q\\!\\!>\\approx 7\\times 10^{-3} (B_{avg}/{100\n\\mbox{G}})^{1.5}(L/{10^9\\mbox{cm}})^{-1}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ but that there\nis a range of parameters that give qualitatively reasonable fits, which we\nconclude is due to a correlation between $B_{avg}$ and $L$. In addition, we\nfind that the models of the bands including cooler emission (131 and 171~\\AA)\ngreatly underestimate the extent of the emission in the legs of the longer\nloops at the peripheries of the active region that are the strongest\ncontributors of the emission in those bands. We conclude that this is because\nthe modeling assumes that all transition region emission is confined to the\nloop foot points, but in reality the upper transition region of longer loops\nextends significantly farther into the loop.

To fill in the\nblank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging\npractices at the source code level.

Evaluation\nresults on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of\nConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically,\nConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration\ndiagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent\nmisconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit\nconfiguration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74%\ncoverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers\nby 12% and 30%.

    "abstract": "We present DrivingGaussian++, an efficient and effective framework for\nrealistic reconstructing and controllable editing of surrounding dynamic\nautonomous driving scenes. DrivingGaussian++ models the static background using\nincremental 3D Gaussians and reconstructs moving objects with a composite\ndynamic Gaussian graph, ensuring accurate positions and occlusions. By\nintegrating a LiDAR prior, it achieves detailed and consistent scene\nreconstruction, outperforming existing methods in dynamic scene reconstruction\nand photorealistic surround-view synthesis. DrivingGaussian++ supports\ntraining-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including\ntexture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging\nmulti-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs)\nand controllable editing, our method can automatically generate dynamic object\nmotion trajectories and enhance their realism during the optimization process.\nDrivingGaussian++ demonstrates consistent and realistic editing results and\ngenerates dynamic multi-view driving scenarios, while significantly enhancing\nscene diversity.

To make this statement general, there must be a proper\ndefinition of $\\tau-$function that gives rise to a set of bilinear identities.\nIn the classical definition of $\\tau-$function for integrable Toda or KP\nhierarchies, there is a restriction on matrix elements to be based on\ngroup-like elements with the comultiplication $\\Delta(g)=g \\otimes g$. This\nrestriction can not be straightforwardly transferred to the q-deformed case,\nbecause there are no group-like elements in q-deformed universal enveloping\nalgebra (UEA), except for its Cartan subalgebra. The new approach to the\n$\\tau-$function is to remove the restriction on g to be obligatory the\ngroup-like element. The main result of this work is a derivation of the set of\nbilinear identities and $\\tau-$functions for $U_q(\\mathfrak{sl}_3)$ in the\nfundamental representations for non-group-like elements. We consider difference\noperators which lead to the basic bilinear identities. Also, we provide an\nanalysis of the ways of obtaining BI for higher rank algebras $U_q(sl_n)$.",

    "abstract": "The functional computation of the human brain arises from the collective\nbehaviour of the underlying neural network. The emerging technology enables the\nrecording of population activity in neurons, and the theory of neural networks\nis expected to explain and extract functional computations from the data.\nThermodynamically, a large proportion of the whole-body energy is consumed by\nthe brain, and functional computation of the human brain seems to involve high\nenergy consumption. The human brain, however, does not increase its energy\nconsumption with its function, and most of its energy consumption is not\ninvolved in specific brain function: how can the human brain perform its wide\nrepertoire of functional computations without drastically changing its energy\nconsumption? Here, we present a mechanism to perform functional computation by\nsubtle modification of the interaction network among the brain regions. We\nfirst show that, by analyzing the data of spontaneous and task-induced\nwhole-cerebral-cortex activity, the probability fluxes, which are the\nmicroscopic irreversible measure of state transitions, exhibit unique patterns\ndepending on the task being performed, indicating that the human brain function\nis a distinct sequence of the brain state transitions. We then fit the\nparameters of Ising spin systems with asymmetric interactions, where we reveal\nthat the symmetric interactions among the brain regions are strong and\ntask-independent, but the antisymmetric interactions are subtle and\ntask-dependent, and the inferred model reproduces most of the observed\nprobability flux patterns. Our results indicate that the human brain performs\nits functional computation by subtly modifying the antisymmetric interaction\namong the brain regions, which might be possible with a small amount of energy.",

However, finding appropriate additives may be challenging,\nsince we lack knowledge on their interactions with the plastics and with\nmoisture, and the interplay between them. In this work, we study a commercial\nadditive as well as two new potential additives for their antistatic and slip\nproperties in polyethylene by means of atomistic molecular dynamics\nsimulations. We reveal the most favorable interactions between polyethylene,\neach of these molecules and water, along with providing a microscopic picture\nof their interfacial structure. All additives interact with water mainly by\ntheir polar heads, with water acting as a hydrogen bond acceptor or donor\ndepending on the additive. As expected, water does not enter the polyethylene\nmatrix; it accumulates at its surface instead, without any preferencial\norientation. The additives studied exhibit remarkably different structures when\nthey are mixed with the polymer: two of them enter the polymer matrix to\nvarious degrees, either by intercalating their chains with the polyethylene\nones or by forming miscellar-like structures, while the third one stays at the\nsurface. When water is incorporated into the system, the structure of some of\nthe additive/polyethylene systems changes. The magnitude and nature of these\nchanges depend on the relative concentrations of all species. If the additives\nare in low concentrations, water stays at the surface of the material, in a\ndrop-like shape. The additives penetrate and organize the polymer more or less\ndepending on whether water is present or not. We predict that one of our two\nproposed molecules has promising antistatic properties while the other one\ncould be applied as a slip agent.

    "abstract": "Multi-state models are commonly used for intermittent observations of a state\nover time, but these are generally based on the Markov assumption, that\ntransition rates are independent of the time spent in current and previous\nstates. In a semi-Markov model, the rates can depend on the time spent in the\ncurrent state, though available methods for this are either restricted to\nspecific state structures or lack general software. This paper develops the\napproach of using a \"phase-type\" distribution for the sojourn time in a state,\nwhich expresses a semi-Markov model as a hidden Markov model, allowing the\nlikelihood to be calculated easily for any state structure. While this approach\ninvolves a proliferation of latent parameters, identifiability can be improved\nby restricting the phase-type family to one which approximates a simpler\ndistribution such as the Gamma or Weibull. This paper proposes a\nmoment-matching method to obtain this approximation, making general semi-Markov\nmodels for intermittent data accessible in software for the first time. The\nmethod is implemented in a new R package, \"msmbayes\", which implements Bayesian\nor maximum likelihood estimation for multi-state models with general state\nstructures and covariates. The software is tested using simulation-based\ncalibration, and an application to cognitive function decline illustrates the\nuse of the method in a typical modelling workflow.",

However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer\narchitecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend\nto all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must\nefficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by\nreplacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)\nTransition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional\nembeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows\nattention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the\nunnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.\n2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state\nrepresentation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent\ntoken predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain\ninformation without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a\nscalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain\nrecommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval\ntasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain\nrepresentations.",

Erd\\H{o}s and Gallai\nestablished the bounds $ex(n, P_{k+1}) \\leq \\frac{n(k-1)}{2}$ and $ex(n,\nC_{\\geq k+1}) \\leq \\frac{k(n-1)}{2}$. This was later extended by Luo\n\\cite{luo2018maximum}, who showed that $ex(n, K_s, P_{k+1}) \\leq \\frac{n}{k}\n\\binom{k}{s}$ and $ex(n, K_s, C_{\\geq k+1}) \\leq \\frac{n-1}{k-1} \\binom{k}{s}$.\nLet $N(G,K_s)$ denote the number of copies of $K_s$ in $G$. In this paper, we\nuse the vertex-based localization framework, introduced in\n\\cite{adak2025vertex}, to generalize Luo's bounds. In a graph $G$, for each $v\n\\in V(G)$, define $p(v)$ to be the length of the longest path that contains\n$v$. We show that \\[N(G,K_s) \\leq \\sum_{v \\in V(G)}\n\\frac{1}{p(v)+1}{p(v)+1\\choose s} = \\frac{1}{s}\\sum_{v \\in V(G)}{p(v) \\choose\ns-1}\\] We strengthen the cycle bound from \\cite{luo2018maximum} as follows: In\ngraph $G$, for each $v \\in V(G)$, let $c(v)$ be the length of the longest cycle\nthat contains $v$, or $2$ if $v$ is not part of any cycle. We prove that\n\\[N(G,K_s) \\leq \\left(\\sum_{v\\in V(G)}\\frac{1}{c(v)-1}{c(v) \\choose s}\\right) -\n\\frac{1}{c(u)-1}{c(u) \\choose s}\\] where $c(u)$ denotes the circumference of\n$G$. Furthermore, we characterize the class of extremal graphs that attain\nequality for these bounds. We provide full proofs for the cases $s = 1$ and $s\n\\geq 3$, while the case $s = 2$ follows from the result in\n\\cite{adak2025vertex}.",

As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly\ndefined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network\nfactorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a\nnovel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of\nrandom variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound\nprogram slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three\nwell-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the\nvariance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both\nsingle-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo. These optimisations\nare proven correct and empirically shown to match or outperform existing\ntechniques.",

Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce\nnetwork bandwidth and computational load.

We address this\nchallenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and\nTracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human\npose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and\nbiomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it\nemploys convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it\nimplements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH\non both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy.

    "abstract": "While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language\nprocessing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph\nmachine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in\ndesigning graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that\ncan vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been\nfocused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling\narbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.\nHowever, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in\nthe field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the\nrecent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a\nsimple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.\nSpecifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood\nfeature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to\nthe constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our\nmodel achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available\nGFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,\nafter finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the\npotential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a\npreviously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for\ngraph machine learning tasks.",

We propose to use the tSZ data to separate\ngalaxies from redshift surveys into distinct subpopulations corresponding to\ndifferent densities and biases independently of the redshift survey\nsystematics. Leveraging the information from different environments, as in\ndensity-split and density-marked clustering, is known to tighten the\nconstraints on cosmological parameters, like $\\Omega_m$, $\\sigma_8$ and\nneutrino mass. We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)\nand the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to\ndemonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We\ndiscover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs\ncorresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ\nCompton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find\nthat such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity)\ndispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample\nand near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are\nintrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic\neffects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with\ntSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern\nremains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model\nin our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from\ntSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models. Thus, we demonstrate that\nvaluable cosmological information is present in the lower signal-to-noise\nregions of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map, extending far beyond the\nindividual cluster candidates.",

Our method projects galaxy Spectral Energy\nDistributions (SEDs) onto a two-dimensional map, identifying regions that are\nsparsely sampled by existing spectroscopic observations. These under-sampled\nareas are then augmented with simulated galaxies, yielding a more\nrepresentative spectroscopic training dataset. To assess the efficacy of this\nSOM-based data augmentation in the context of the forthcoming Legacy Survey of\nSpace and Time (LSST), we employ mock galaxy catalogues from the\nOpenUniverse2024 project and generate synthetic datasets that mimic the\nexpected photometric selections of LSST after one (Y1) and ten (Y10) years of\nobservation. We construct 501 degraded realisations by sampling galaxy colours,\nmagnitudes, redshifts and spectroscopic success rates, in order to emulate the\ncompilation of a wide array of realistic spectroscopic surveys. Augmenting the\ndegraded mock datasets with simulated galaxies from the independent CosmoDC2\ncatalogues has markedly improved the performance of our photometric redshift\nestimates compared to models lacking this augmentation, particularly for\nhigh-redshift galaxies ($z_\\mathrm{true} \\gtrsim 1.5$). This improvement is\nmanifested in notably reduced systematic biases and a decrease in catastrophic\nfailures by up to approximately a factor of 2, along with a reduction in\ninformation loss in the conditional density estimations. These results\nunderscore the effectiveness of SOM-based augmentation in refining photometric\nredshift estimation, thereby enabling more robust analyses in cosmology and\nastrophysics for the NSF-DOE Vera C.

    "abstract": "Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the\ntime-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be\nflaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test\nre-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not\nrequire system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs.\nIdeally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human\nunderstanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential\nflakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test\noracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the\ninputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test\noracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes,\nfails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe\ntwo methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic\nprogramming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization\n(SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness\nfunctions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We\nevaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains\nof aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles\ngenerated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those\nobtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this\naccuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system\nunder test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by\nGP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in\ntheir accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving\nsystems with flaky behaviours.",

We argue that the solution to this\nequation admits an expansion in terms of iterated Chen integrals of uniform\ntranscendental weight. Remarkably, the coefficients in this expansion are\nuniversal positive integers, independent of the particular observable,\nsuggesting a hidden combinatorial origin. Building on this observation, we show\nthat the resulting expressions possess a natural interpretation in enumerative\ncombinatorics: they coincide with the partition function (or generating\nfunction) of an ensemble of lattice paths constrained to a nontrivial domain.\nThis correspondence extends and generalizes the classical Dyck paths to a\nricher family of path ensembles relevant in gauge theory.",

However, traditional scene\nrepresentations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable\ncontextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in\ncompletely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a\nlanguage-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates\nsemantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented\nDynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process\nthrough a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved\nthrough the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each\nstage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we\nintroduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting\nwith distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.\nComprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our\nframework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search\nefficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies.

We overcome this limitation by demonstrating\ndirectional Cherenkov radiation from transverse-electric (TE) graphene\nplasmons, excited by a swift charged particle travelling above suspended\nmonolayer graphene.

Such absorbing state phase transitions are often sensitive to\nthe presence of quenched disorder. Traditionally, a phase transition in the\ndisordered contact process is either triggered by dilution or by locally\nvarying the infection rate. However, when both factors play an important role,\na multicritical point emerges that remains poorly understood. Here, we study\nthe multicritical contact process by large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in two\nand three dimensions. The multicritical behavior is found to be universal and\nexhibits ultra-slow, activated dynamical scaling, with exponents consistent\nwith those predicted by the strong disorder renormalization group method.

    "abstract": "Efficiently coupling light from optical fibers into photonic integrated\ncircuits is a key step toward practical photonic devices. While a notable\ncoupling can be achieved by out of plane couplers such as grating couplers,\ntheir basic planar geometry typically tends to be sensitive to the polarization\nof light. This is partly due to the fact that the design spaces of such grating\nstructures typically fabricated with techniques such as electron beam\nlithography are only two dimensional with a simple extrusion into the vertical\ndimension. This makes it challenging to optimize for both polarizations\nsimultaneously, as performance typically degrades when trying to achieve high\nefficiency in both. As a result, conventional approaches either suffer from\nincreased losses or require additional filtering components to account for\ndifferent polarizations. In this work, we present a fully three dimensional,\npolarization insensitive grating coupler which has a highly efficient simulated\ncoupling efficiency of over 80% in both polarizations. This performance matches\nthat of state of the art couplers that are performant for one polarization\nonly. This comes at the cost of a moderately larger size due to the lower\nrefractive index materials typically available in 3D nanoprinting. Our design\nmethod uses density based topology optimization with a multi objective approach\nthat combines electromagnetic simulations with a fictitious heat conduction\nmodel acting as a soft constraint to promote structural integrity. This ensures\nthat the designed structures are feasible for fabrication. Our work opens new\npossibilities for robust 3D photonic devices, enabling advanced integration,\nfabrication, and applications across next generation photonics and electronics.",

Although direct radio detection of sub-Jovian planets is\nhindered by the low frequencies involved, models of sub-Alfv\\'enic SPI predict\nthat Earth-like planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs may induce\ndetectable emission. Here, we revisit the modelling of the expected radio\nemission from magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M-dwarf systems\nProxima Centauri, YZ Ceti, and GJ 1151, where claims of SPI-related radio\ndetections have been made. For this, we use SIRIO (Star-planet Interaction and\nRadio Induced Observations), a public Python code that models radio emission\nfrom sub-Alfv\\'enic SPI. We benchmark SIRIO results against those paradigmatic\nsystems, whose SPI modeling has been previously discussed in the literature.\nOur results support previous findings that Proxima b, YZ Cet b, and the\nputative planet GJ 1151 b are most likely in the sub-Alfv\\'enic regime\n(assuming a hybrid PFSS geometry), so SPI should be at work in all of them. We\nfind that the Alfv\\'en wing model generally predicts a very low level of radio\nemission, while if magnetic reconnection takes place, prospects for detection\nare significantly better. We also find that free-free absorption may play a\nrelevant role, in particular in YZ Ceti.

    "abstract": "When solving multi-objective programs, the number of objectives essentially\ndetermines the computing time. This can even lead to practically unsolvable\nproblems. Consequently, it is worthwhile to reduce the number of objectives\nwithout losing information. In this article, we discuss multi-objective linear\nprograms (MOLP) with objective matrices that do not have a full row rank. We\nintroduce a method to transform an MOLP into an equivalent vector linear\nprogram (VLP) with merely as many objectives as the rank of the original\nobjective matrix. To this end, only a factorization of this matrix is needed to\nbe calculated. One of the factors then forms a new ordering cone while the\nother factor remains as the objective matrix. Through a series of numerical\nexperiments, we will show that this approach indeed leads to a significant\nspeedup of computing time, and therefore provides a powerful technique for\nsolving MOLPs in practice. As there are fewer objectives to consider, the\napproach additionally helps decision makers to get a better visualization as\nwell as understanding of the actual problem. Moreover, we will point out that\nthe equivalence of the MOLP and the corresponding VLP can be used to derive\nstatements about the concept of nonessential objectives.",

This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically\nintroduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++\ncodebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI\nagents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and\ntraditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nfor contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for\nefficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from\nthree different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other\ntechniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\\% and 95\\%\nsuccess rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.",

    "abstract": "In Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, the long behavior sequence,\ncomprising the user's long period of historical interactions with items has a\nvital influence on assessing the user's interest in the candidate item.\nExisting approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage\nparadigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then\nextracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we\nargue that the discrepancy in target attention's relevance distribution between\nthe retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a\nperformance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple\nQuantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end\nthrough compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of\nlong behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based\non multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is\nincorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then,\nattention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the\ninterest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the\ncodeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive\nexperiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness\nand efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN\nimproves CTR by 3.5% and RPM by 2.0%.",

Notably, these algorithms demonstrate a\nrobust ability to suppress noise and harmonic interference. For instance, the\nmean absolute errors (MAE) for MUSIC and Prony in heart rate detection are 1.8\nand 0.81, respectively, while for respiration rate, the MAEs are 1.01 and 0.8,\nrespectively.

In this work, we investigate the potential for\nhidden prompt injection attacks, where authors embed adversarial text within a\npaper's PDF to influence the LLM-generated review. We begin by formalising\nthree distinct threat models that envision attackers with different motivations\n-- not all of which implying malicious intent. For each threat model, we design\nadversarial prompts that remain invisible to human readers yet can steer an\nLLM's output toward the author's desired outcome. Using a user study with\ndomain scholars, we derive four representative reviewing prompts used to elicit\npeer reviews from LLMs. We then evaluate the robustness of our adversarial\nprompts across (i) different reviewing prompts, (ii) different commercial\nLLM-based systems, and (iii) different peer-reviewed papers. Our results show\nthat adversarial prompts can reliably mislead the LLM, sometimes in ways that\nadversely affect a \"honest-but-lazy\" reviewer. Finally, we propose and\nempirically assess methods to reduce detectability of adversarial prompts under\nautomated content checks.",

    "abstract": "Optically-pumped atomic magnetometers have previously been used in arrays to\nreject interference from far away sources and enable the sensitive detection of\nlocal sources of radio frequency (RF) signals, useful, for instance, in the\ndetection of low field NMR signals in an unshielded environment. We now\ndemonstrate a complementary scheme in which four magnetometer measurements are\nused to locate in three dimensions a nearby radio frequency source. The\nmethodology relies on the measurement of a radio frequency vector at two\ndifferent positions and modeling the source as a magnetic dipole of known\norientation. In contrast to coil detection, magnetometers have the advantage of\nmeasuring signals in a 2D plane, and do not inductively couple to their\nenvironment or each other, making them a strong candidate for localization of\nhidden RF sources. For this demonstration, we use only a single RF magnetometer\nto make four measurements of a synchronous and oriented dipole source, but it\nis to be expected that this could be replaced by four magnetometers working\nsimultaneously. In addition, this work is greatly aided by the introduction of\na fully integrated magnetometer, in which all optics, including lasers, are\nsafely enclosed into a compact head with flexible wired connections. The\nportable, as well as safe, nature of the sensor make it quite valuable for in\nthe field work.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of\nwireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions\nresults in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer\nauthentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel\ncharacteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel\nvariations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based\nphysical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile\nscenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation\nusing IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated\nbased on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance\ncorrelation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of\nmanually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network\n(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial\ncorrelation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their\nsimilarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and\nexperimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT\ndevelopment kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both\nsimulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization\nperformance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent\nauthentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,\nour proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to\nthe fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06\ncompared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.",

Since the\nmock images were generated from real observations, they incorporate, by\nconstruction, all the complexity of the observed galaxy clusters.

    "abstract": "Generalized bicycle codes (GB codes) represent a promising family of quantum\nlow-density parity-check codes, characterized by high code rates and relatively\nlocal qubit connectivity. A subclass of the GB code called bivariate bicycle\ncodes (BB codes) has garnered significant interest due to their compatibility\nwith two-layer connectivity architectures on superconducting quantum\nprocessors. However, one key limitation of BB codes is their high qubit\nconnectivity degree requirements (degree 6), which exacerbates the noise\nsusceptibility of the system. Building on the recent progress in implementing\nmultiple two-qubit gates on a single chip, this work introduces Louvre -- a\nrouting-based framework designed to reduce qubit connectivity requirements in\nGB codes. Specifically, Louvre-7 achieves degree reduction while preserving the\ndepth of the syndrome extraction circuit, whereas Louvre-8 further minimizes\nthe connectivity by slightly increasing the circuit depth. When applied to BB\ncodes, these two schemes could reduce the average degree to 4.5 and 4,\nrespectively. Crucially, Louvre eliminates some of the long-range, error-prone\nconnections, which is a distinct advantage over prior approaches. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate that Louvre-7 has an indistinguishable logical error\nrate as the standard syndrome extraction circuits of GB codes, while Louvre-8\nonly incurs a slight error rate penalty. Furthermore, by reordering some of the\ngates in the circuit, we can reduce the coupler length without degrading the\nperformance. Though most of our analysis focuses on GB codes defined on\nperiodic boundary conditions, we further discuss the adaptability of Louvre to\nopen-boundary lattices and defect-containing grids, underscoring its broader\napplicability in practical quantum error correction architectures.",

Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have\nbeen employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to\nproduce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL,\na novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate\nhigh-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to\niteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in\nan adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is\ntrained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to\nproduce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the\ncode generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability\nto produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator.\nIn our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B\ntrained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the\nsame model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth\nunit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those\ninduced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL\noutperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit\ntests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.",

    "abstract": "While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing\nattention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a\nkey bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality\nof embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language\nand actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video\ngeneration--hindering generative models from achieving a \"GPT moment\" in the\nembodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data\nfar exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on\nthis insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive\nEmbodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short\nhorizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic\nconcepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning\ncomplexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)\ndecreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model\n(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further\nenables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization\nof primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework\nleverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic\nawareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction\nand high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and\ngeneral-purpose embodied intelligence.",

    "abstract": "(abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising\nmechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in\nprotoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex\nphysics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended\ndiscs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely\nunknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence\nusing radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so\nas to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent\ncascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to\n200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi\nazimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1.\n  Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged\nwith 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3.\nInner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational\ndomain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation\nwave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence.\nOur models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices,\nin contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the\nturbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the\nframework of critically balanced rotating turbulence.\n  Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs,\nassociated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant\nlong-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions\nof VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts\naffecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used\nin a more systematic manner.",

Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba\narchitectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high\ncomputational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an\nemerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive\nfields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work\nthat studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that\ndirectly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's\nfixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial\ndistortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local\ngeometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention\nin RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through\nexponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.\nTo this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored\nfor DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and\ncross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In\nparticular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local\nneighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,\nCross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate\nattention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.",

Recent\ngraph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,\nbut they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal\nmotifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as\nthey unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when\nfraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both\nsignals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages\ntemporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor\ncondenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,\npreserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed\nby dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single\nmotif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step\nfraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner\ntailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus\nprecisely on the most revealing time slices.

However, semantic segmentation requires extensive annotations, while\nobject detection, despite reducing annotation efforts compared with\nsegmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes due to overlapping\nbounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd counting has\ngained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have integrated VIF and\ncrowd counting into a unified framework. To address these challenges, we\npropose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates\ncrowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a direct\nquantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation, making it\nparticularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both input\nimages and population density information in a mutually beneficial multi-task\ndesign. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions, we introduce\na dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate\nadversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and crowd counting,\nimproving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial attacks.\nExperimental results on public datasets demonstrate that FusionCounting not\nonly enhances image fusion quality but also achieves superior crowd counting\nperformance.",

However, current detection methods often\nyield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion\nmorphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow\nwhere dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed\ntooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training\nnetwork for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing\nautomated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view\nfrom panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then\npretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The\nglobal-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating\nregion proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts\ndetailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the\nregion proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we\nintroduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically\nfuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the\nfused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To\nrigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further\nvalidate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries\ndetection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays\nfor double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior\nperformance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,\nindicating the clinical applicability of our method.

A\ndynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:\nwhen robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake\nunnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true\nHuman-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion\nprediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case\nscenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a\nwell-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,\nlimiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control\nBarrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic\nhuman hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control\nBarrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for\ndynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty\nestimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,\nUA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future\nhuman states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through\ninformed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world\nexperiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to\nperform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot\ninteractions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).\nRelative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better\nperformance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of\nviolations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the\nstate-of-the-art.",

Strengthening\ncybersecurity culture (CSC) is vital in safety-critical industries, yet\nempirical research in real-world industrial setttings is scarce. This paper\naddresses this gap through a pilot mixed-methods CSC assessment in a global\nsafety-critical organisation. We examined employees' CS knowledge, attitudes,\nbehaviours, and organisational factors shaping them. A survey and\nsemi-structured interviews were conducted at a global organisation in\nsafety-critical industries, across two countries chosen for contrasting\nphishing simulation performance: Country 1 stronger, Country 2 weaker. In\nCountry 1, 258 employees were invited (67%), in Country 2, 113 were invited\n(30%). Interviews included 20 and 10 participants respectively. Overall CSC\nprofiles were similar but revealed distinct challenges. Both showed strong\nphishing awareness and prioritised CS, yet most viewed phishing as the main\nrisk and lacked clarity on handling other incidents. Line managers were default\ncontacts, but follow-up on reported concerns was unclear. Participants\nemphasized aligning CS expectations with job relevance and workflows. Key\ncontributors to differences emerged: Country 1 had external employees with\nlimited access to CS training and policies, highlighting monitoring gaps. In\nCountry 2, low survey response stemmed from a \"no-link in email\" policy. While\nthis policy may have boosted phishing performance, it also underscored\ninconsistencies in CS practices. Findings show that resilient CSC requires\nleadership involvement, targeted communication, tailored measures,\npolicy-practice alignment, and regular assessments. Embedding these into\nstrategy complements technical defences and strengthens sustainable CS in\nsafety-critical settings.",

    "abstract": "We describe an attempt to derive the binarity rate of samples of 166 A-, F-,\nG-, and K-type stars from LAMOST DR5 and 1000 randomly selected presumably\nsingle stars from Gaia DR3 catalogs. To this end, we compared continua of the\nobserved spectra with the continua of synthetic spectra in the 3700 to 9097\nAngstrom range. The latter spectra were reduced to the LAMOST set of\nwavelengths, while the former ones were smoothed. Next, we searched for every\nobserved star the nearest synthetic spectrum using a four-parameter\nrepresentation - effective temperature, gravity, [Fe/H], and a range of\ninterstellar absorption values. However, rms deviations of observed spectra\nfrom synthetic ones appeared to be not sufficient to claim that any of the\nstars is a binary. We conclude that comparison of the intensity of pairs of\nspectral lines remains the best way to detect binarity.",

    "abstract": "Traditional face masks used extensively, for example, during the COVID-19\npandemic, are relatively impermeable, forcing aerosol-containing breath to flow\ninto the surrounding atmosphere by ``leaking\" out from the lateral edges of the\nmask. This protects close-proximity persons but results in a high viral load\nbeing delivered into the air. An alternative face covering, the Virustatic\nShield, developed by Virustatic, involves a much more permeable material coated\nin an active agent, with the goal of increasing the transmission through the\nmask and thus reducing the viral load released. In this paper, we build and\nsolve a model that describes the air flow and aerosol transport through a\nporous face mask. Our model for air flow is based on a low-Reynolds-number\napproximation to the Navier--Stokes equations, and reduces to a two-dimensional\nscalar partial differential equation for the local flux through the mask. We\nuse the model to explore the interplay between leakage from the mask sides and\nflow directly through. We compare and contrast the leakage for traditional face\nmasks and for neck gaiters, and find that neck gaiters have a lower leakage. We\nutilise a simple model for aerosol transport that balances advection with\ncapture by the mask, and find that there is an ideal permeability, which\noptimises real-world protection offered by the mask.",

As the evolutionary roots of such biases\nremain unclear, we investigate here how reasoning abilities and cognitive\nbiases co-evolve using Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model, individuals in a\npopulation deploy a variety of unbiased and biased level-k reasoning strategies\nto anticipate others' behaviour in sequential interactions, represented by the\nIncremental Centipede Game. Positively biased reasoning strategies have a\nsystematic inference bias towards higher but uncertain rewards, while\nnegatively biased strategies reflect the opposite tendency. We find that\nselection consistently favours positively biased reasoning, with rational\nbehaviour even going extinct. This bias co-evolves with bounded rationality, as\nthe reasoning depth remains limited in the population. Interestingly,\npositively biased agents may co-exist with non-reasoning agents, thus pointing\nto a novel equilibrium. Longer games further promote positively biased\nreasoning, as they can lead to higher future rewards. The biased reasoning\nstrategies proposed in this model may reflect cognitive phenomena like wishful\nthinking and defensive pessimism. This work therefore supports the claim that\ncertain cognitive biases, despite deviating from rational judgment, constitute\nan adaptive feature to better cope with social dilemmas.",

Previous\nresearch on ULTR has studied a variety of biases in users' clicks, such as\nposition bias, presentation bias, and outlier bias. However, existing work\noften assumes that the behavior logs are collected from an ``average'' user,\nneglecting the differences between different users in their search and browsing\nbehaviors. In this paper, we introduce personalized factors into the ULTR\nframework, which we term the user-aware ULTR problem. Through a formal causal\nanalysis of this problem, we demonstrate that existing user-oblivious methods\nare biased when different users have different preferences over queries and\npersonalized propensities of examining documents. To address such a\npersonalized bias, we propose a novel user-aware inverse-propensity-score\nestimator for learning-to-rank objectives. Specifically, our approach models\nthe distribution of user browsing behaviors for each query and aggregates\nuser-weighted examination probabilities to determine propensities. We\ntheoretically prove that the user-aware estimator is unbiased under some mild\nassumptions and shows lower variance compared to the straightforward way of\ncalculating a user-dependent propensity for each impression. Finally, we\nempirically verify the effectiveness of our user-aware estimator by conducting\nextensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset.",

In the sparse regime, Perkins and Wang established tight\nbounds within the low-degree polynomial (LDP) framework, showing a\nfactor-$1/(1-\\gamma)$ statistical-computational gap via the Overlap Gap\nProperty (OGP) framework tailored for stable algorithms. However, these\ntechniques do not appear to extend to the dense setting. For the related large\nindependent set problem in dense random graph, the best known algorithm is an\nonline greedy procedure that is inherently unstable, and LDP algorithms are\nconjectured to fail even in the \"easy\" regime where greedy succeeds. We show\nthat the largest $\\gamma$-balanced independent set in dense random bipartite\ngraphs has size $\\alpha:=\\frac{\\log_b n}{\\gamma(1-\\gamma)}$ whp, where $n$ is\nthe size of each bipartition, $p$ is the edge probability, and $b=1/(1-p)$. We\ndesign an online algorithm that achieves $(1-\\epsilon)(1-\\gamma)\\alpha$ whp for\nany $\\epsilon>0$. We complement this with a sharp lower bound, showing that no\nonline algorithm can achieve $(1+\\epsilon)(1-\\gamma)\\alpha$ with nonnegligible\nprobability. Our results suggest that the same factor-$1/(1-\\gamma)$ gap is\nalso present in the dense setting, supporting its conjectured universality.\nWhile the classical greedy procedure on $G(n,p)$ is straightforward, our\nalgorithm is more intricate: it proceeds in two stages, incorporating a\nstopping time and suitable truncation to ensure that $\\gamma$-balancedness-a\nglobal constraint-is met despite operating with limited information. Our lower\nbound utilizes the OGP framework; we build on a recent refinement of this\nframework for online models and extend it to the bipartite setting.",

    "abstract": "Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic\nand passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations\ncharacterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and\nvarying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning\n(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and\nconvergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional\ntimetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key\ninnovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by\naugmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station\nID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,\nvelocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to\ncapture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs\ninto a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function\naligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway\ndeviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule\nadherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves\nmore stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,\n-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that\nsingle-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and\nschedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,\nreal-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to\nMARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.",

For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a\nVLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or\na blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails\nto capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained\nsignificant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot\nclassifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively\nwith CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the\ngenerative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation\nabilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --\nDiffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with\nattributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised\nzero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion\nClassifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models\nstruggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader\nchallenges VLMs face with relational reasoning.

In particular, we develop the weighted Bayesian\nCramer-Rao bound (WBCRB) for the mixed-resolution setting with a general weight\nfunction. We demonstrate the special cases of: (i) the classical BCRB; (ii) the\nWBCRB that is based on the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (BFIM)-Inverse\nweighting; and (iii) the Aharon-Tabrikian tightest WBCRB with an optimal weight\nfunction. Based on the developed WBCRB, we propose a new method to approximate\nthe mean-squared-error (MSE) by partitioning the estimation problem into two\nregions: (a) where the 1-bit quantized data is informative; and (b) where it is\nsaturated. We apply region-specific WBCRB approximations in these regions to\nachieve an accurate composite MSE estimate. We derive the bounds and MSE\napproximation for the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) model, which is\ncommonly used in practical signal processing applications. Our simulation\nresults demonstrate the use of the proposed bounds and approximation method in\nthe LGO model with a scalar unknown parameter.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix\nadaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we\nutilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update\ndirection at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure\nof a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator\nmethods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that\nAdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive\noptimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This\ndemonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive\noptimization in large models.",

Advances in Generative AI (GenAI),\nespecially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such\nartifacts.\n  Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs'\nability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a\nquasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements\ninto a developer-friendly form.\n  Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety\nregulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60\nspecifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five\ncriteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each\nspecification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments.\n  Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest.\nClarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second.\nSingularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No\nlowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences\nacross participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity,\nCompleteness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity.\nFeedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the\nspecifications.\n  Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal\ntexts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for\nimplementation, assurance, and test generation.",

Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer\na promising platform for such sources, but their development has been hindered\nby limited spectral range and poor single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we\ndemonstrate a reproducible and systematic approach for generating near-infrared\n(1090-1200 nm) quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe$_2$ using deterministic strain\nand defect engineering. These emitters exhibit strong linear polarization (DOLP\n$>70\\%$), sub-nanosecond lifetimes ($\\tau \\leqslant$ ~450 ps), high\nsingle-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0)<0.1$), and resolution-limited emission\n($\\sim$200 $\\mu$eV). Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\\sim$3\nmeV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative\nlifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to\ntransform-limited linewidths as low as $R\\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon\ninterference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of\n$V_\\text{HOM}\\sim $10$\\%$, and up to $V_\\text{HOM}\\sim$ 40$\\%$ with\npost-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported\nindistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such\ndemonstration in the near-infrared regime.

These include robust in-plane\npolarization without a critical thickness, the emergence of charged domain\nwalls and non-trivial polar textures, resilience to doping with magnetic ions\nand charge carriers, and possibility to epitaxially integrate them into\nstandard perovskite heterostructures. This review aims to unify current\nknowledge on the fabrication and characterization of layered ferroelectric thin\nfilms, and to present research findings across all four structural families,\nwith the goal of highlighting their common features despite differences in\ncrystal structure and polarization mechanisms.

By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable\ncode provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive\nevaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in\nsolving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis\nproblems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly\nimproves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of\nnon-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for\nautonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review\nmechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN\nsolutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework\nestablishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific\ncomputing paradigm.",

    "abstract": "Photon identification in calorimeters represents a crucial challenge in\nparticle physics experiments, especially in high-density environments where\nshower overlap probabilities become significant. We present an\nenergy-core-based photon identification method that exploits the distinct\ncompact energy core feature of electromagnetic showers through Hough transform\npattern recognition in imaging calorimeters. The method, validated through\nsimulations of the CEPC crystal electromagnetic calorimeter, demonstrates\noutstanding performance. It achieves a high identification efficiency of nearly\n100% for photons with energies exceeding 2 GeV and a separation efficiency\napproaching 100% for two 5 GeV photons when the distance between them reaches\nthe granularity limit of the calorimeter. This advanced energy-core-based\nphoton identification method integrated with an energy splitting technique\nenhances the performance of photon measurement and provides a promising tool\nfor imaging calorimeters, particularly those requiring high precision in photon\ndetection in complex event topologies with high multiplicity.",

    "abstract": "Muon spin relaxation is a powerful technique for probing static and dynamic\nlocal magnetic fields. The strong collision model, based on a\nGaussian-Markovian process, is commonly used to account for dynamical effects.\nYet, it remains limited in describing systems where the local field undergoes\ndiscrete state changes. To address this, I introduce a generalized two-state\nstrong collision model that explicitly incorporates transitions between\ndistinct local field environments during fluctuations. This extension allows\nfor a more accurate representation of dynamical effects, particularly in\nsystems where each collision alters the underlying static polarisation\nfunction. Analytical and numerical solutions are presented, and the model's\napplicability is demonstrated and discussed across relevant physical systems --\nincluding low-dimensional magnets, systems with dynamic disorder and ion and\nmuon diffusion. These results offer an enhanced framework for interpreting data\nin complex materials and extend the method's reach to a broader class of\ndynamical phenomena in condensed matter physics.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the effect of disorder on a ferromagnetic metal with\nrepulsive interactions. We assume that, in the clean limit, the ferromagnetic\nstate can be described by Stoner mean-field theory and study how disorder\naffects the the system by using a combined replica + Stoner mean-field\napproach. At zero temperature, we find that a replica-symmetric ferromagnetic\nmean-field solution exists in the presence of disorder with a modified Stoner\ncriteria where the ferromagnetism is enhanced by disorder. At finite\ntemperature, a Landau theory is employed to construct the phase diagram,\nrevealing that beyond a critical disorder strength, a spin-glass phase may\nexist between the high-temperature paramagnetic phase and the low-temperature\nferromagnetic phase. For weak (repulsive) interaction where the system is\nnon-ferromagnetic in the clean limit, the possibility of a disordered-induced\nferromagnetic ground state is observed both at zero temperature and finite\ntemperature. The potential applicability of this framework to realistic\nmaterials is briefly discussed.",

Here, we show that individual acceptance levels\ncan be learned by the operator (over $90\\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in\n$10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing\npolicy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively\nmeets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results\nsuggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual\ntravellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility)\nbut also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the\noperator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and\nprofitable combinations.",

Beyond current\nlong CoT, the model demonstrates advanced cognitive behaviors, such as thinking\ncarefully before using Python coding tools and reflecting on code execution\nfeedback to autonomously explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps in\ncomplex problem-solving. This capability is enabled through three key\ninnovations that makes agentic RL effective at scale: (i) an efficient RL\ninfrastructure with a reliable Python code environment that supports\nhigh-throughput execution and mitigates the high rollout costs, enabling\ntraining on limited GPU resources (64 MI300X GPUs); (ii) GRPO-RoC, an agentic\nRL algorithm with a Resample-on-Correct rollout strategy that addresses the\ninherent environment noises from coding tools, allowing the model to reason\nmore effectively in a code environment; (iii) An efficient agent training\nrecipe that starts with non-reasoning SFT and progresses through multi-RL\nstages, yielding advanced cognitive abilities with minimal compute cost. To\nthis end, rStar2-Agent boosts a pre-trained 14B model to state of the art in\nonly 510 RL steps within one week, achieving average pass@1 scores of 80.6% on\nAIME24 and 69.8% on AIME25, surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) with significantly\nshorter responses. Beyond mathematics, rStar2-Agent-14B also demonstrates\nstrong generalization to alignment, scientific reasoning, and agentic tool-use\ntasks.

    "abstract": "We present results from the search for an isotropic gravitational-wave\nbackground using Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data from O1 through O4a, the\nfirst part of the fourth observing run. This background is the accumulated\nsignal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes\ninformation about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the\nUniverse, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from\nthe early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically\nsignificant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical\nscenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3\npower-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\\Omega_{\\rm\nGW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.0\\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement\nover previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to\n$\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.8\\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x\nsensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting\nnon-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise\nsources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with\npopulation models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we\nfind our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are\napproaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits\nshown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary\nblack hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference\nresults and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background\narising from compact binary coalescences is $\\Omega_{\\rm CBC}(25{\\rm\nHz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest\ncontribution is due to binary black holes only, $\\Omega_{\\rm BBH}(25{\\rm\nHz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}$.",

    "abstract": "In 1908, Voronoi introduced an algorithm that solves the lattice packing\nproblem in any dimension in finite time. Voronoi showed that any lattice with\noptimal packing density must be a so-called perfect lattice, and his algorithm\nenumerates the finitely many perfect lattices up to similarity in a fixed\ndimension. However, due to the high complexity of the algorithm this\nenumeration had, until now, only been completed up to dimension 8.\n  In this work we compute all 2237251040 perfect lattices in dimension 9 via\nVoronoi's algorithm. As a corollary, this shows that the laminated lattice\n$\\Lambda_9$ gives the densest lattice packing in dimension 9. Equivalently, we\nshow that the Hermite constant $\\gamma_9$ in dimension 9 equals $2$.\nFurthermore, we extend a result by Watson (1971) and show that the set of\npossible kissing numbers in dimension 9 is precisely $2 \\cdot \\{ 1, \\ldots, 91,\n99, 120, \\ldots, 129, 136 \\}$.",

On the other hand, they have also underscored the\nimportance of watermarking as a safeguard against malicious misuse. In this\nstudy, we focus on tokenization inconsistency (TI) between Alice and Bob in\nsteganography and watermarking, where TI can undermine robustness. Our\ninvestigation reveals that the problematic tokens responsible for TI exhibit\ntwo key characteristics: infrequency and temporariness. Based on these\nfindings, we propose two tailored solutions for TI elimination: a stepwise\nverification method for steganography and a post-hoc rollback method for\nwatermarking. Experiments show that (1) compared to traditional disambiguation\nmethods in steganography, directly addressing TI leads to improvements in\nfluency, imperceptibility, and anti-steganalysis capacity; (2) for\nwatermarking, addressing TI enhances detectability and robustness against\nattacks.",

We present MARVEL (Multi-task Acoustic\nRepresentations for Voice-based Health Analysis), a privacy-conscious multitask\nlearning framework that simultaneously detects nine distinct neurological,\nrespiratory, and voice disorders using only derived acoustic features,\neliminating the need for raw audio transmission. Our dual-branch architecture\nemploys specialized encoders with task-specific heads sharing a common acoustic\nbackbone, enabling effective cross-condition knowledge transfer. Evaluated on\nthe large-scale Bridge2AI-Voice v2.0 dataset, MARVEL achieves an overall AUROC\nof 0.78, with exceptional performance on neurological disorders (AUROC = 0.89),\nparticularly for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive impairment (AUROC = 0.97).\nOur framework consistently outperforms single-modal baselines by 5-19% and\nsurpasses state-of-the-art self-supervised models on 7 of 9 tasks, while\ncorrelation analysis reveals that the learned representations exhibit\nmeaningful similarities with established acoustic features, indicating that the\nmodel's internal representations are consistent with clinically recognized\nacoustic patterns.

These disruptions not only pose significant challenges to\nmaintaining convergence and stability in distributed optimization algorithms,\nbut could also break the network topology into multiple clusters, each one\nassociated with its own set of objective functions. To address this, we propose\na novel Open Distributed Optimization Algorithm with Gradient Tracking\n(OPEN-GT), which employs: (a) a dynamic mechanism for detecting active\nout-neighbors through acknowledgement messages, and (b) a fully distributed\nmax-consensus procedure to spread information regarding agent departures, in\npossibly unbalanced directed networks. We show that when all active agents\nexecute OPEN-GT, the optimization process in each formed cluster remains\nconsistent, while the agents converge to their cluster-wide optimal solution if\nthere exists a time after which the network remains unchanged. Finally, we\nvalidate our approach in a simulated environment with dynamically changing\nagent populations, demonstrating its resilience to network variations and its\nability to support distributed optimization under OMAS dynamics.",

This catalog yields the first\nradially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild\noblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$\nbeyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in\nthis series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to\ninfer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy\ndue to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical\nsymmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of\ndark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain\nthe inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity\nmoments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree\nmodels from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on)\nconfigurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons\n($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark\nmatter density slope of $\\Gamma_{\\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the\nradial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\\Gamma_{\\rm\ndark} \\leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower\ninclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations.

    "abstract": "Financial markets can be highly sensitive to news, investor sentiment, and\neconomic indicators, leading to important asset price fluctuations. In this\nstudy we focus on crude oil, due to its crucial role in commodity markets and\nthe global economy. Specifically, we are interested in understanding the\ndirectional changes of oil price volatility, and for this purpose we\ninvestigate whether news alone -- without incorporating traditional market data\n-- can effectively predict the direction of oil price movements. Using a\ndecade-long dataset from Eikon (2014-2024), we develop an ensemble learning\nframework to extract predictive signals from financial news. Our approach\nleverages diverse sentiment analysis techniques and modern language models,\nincluding FastText, FinBERT, Gemini, and LLaMA, to capture market sentiment and\ntextual patterns. We benchmark our model against the Heterogeneous\nAutoregressive (HAR) model and assess statistical significance using the\nMcNemar test. While most sentiment-based indicators do not consistently\noutperform HAR, the raw news count emerges as a robust predictor. Among\nembedding techniques, FastText proves most effective for forecasting\ndirectional movements. Furthermore, SHAP-based interpretation at the word level\nreveals evolving predictive drivers across market regimes: pre-pandemic\nemphasis on supply-demand and economic terms; early pandemic focus on\nuncertainty and macroeconomic instability; post-shock attention to long-term\nrecovery indicators; and war-period sensitivity to geopolitical and regional\noil market disruptions.

Recently, within the framework of network\nrenormalization, multi-scale embeddings that remain consistent under an\narbitrary aggregation of nodes onto block-nodes, and consequently under an\narbitrary change of resolution of the input network data, have been proposed.\nHere we investigate such multi-scale graph embeddings in the modified context\nwhere the input network is not entirely observable, due to data limitations or\nprivacy constraints. This situation is typical for financial and economic\nnetworks, where connections between individual banks or firms are hidden due to\nconfidentiality, and one has to probabilistically reconstruct the underlying\nnetwork from aggregate information. We first consider state-of-the-art network\nreconstruction techniques based on the maximum-entropy principle, which is\ndesigned to operate optimally at a fixed resolution level. We then discuss the\nlimitations of these methods when they are used as graph embeddings to yield\npredictions across different resolution levels.

We calibrate\nthe intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic\nproperties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 35.9\n$\\mathrm{fW\\ cm^{-2}\\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.46 $\\mathrm{fW\\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a\nsingle mode of the frequency comb, all in a room-temperature operated setup.\nOur results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the\nquantum regime, enabling high-precision and high-sensitivity spectroscopy. This\nbreakthrough allows terahertz science to better leverage revolutionary\ntechniques developed for optical frequency combs.",

While most prior studies assume\nthat attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we\nsystematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries\nto more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task\nassistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging\nthreat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically\ntargeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation\non which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,\nRL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the\nmodel toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through\nentropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the\nescalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across\nmultiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates\nharmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.\nOur results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater\nsystemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general\ndefense.",

The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light\narchitectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge\ndistillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,\nscalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal\nreinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles\ntrained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN\ndataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption\ndatasets.

The microscopic model is a phase-field\nmodel within the Ginzburg-Landau framework for second-order phase transitions,\nwhere the phase-field is directly related to the magnetization vector. This\nmodel couples a nonlinear equation for the magnetization with the quasi-static\nMaxwell system and another nonlinear equation for the temperature. The primary\nmathematical challenge lies in homogenizing these equations, which exhibit a\ncomplex doubly non-linear structure. Additionally, the extension operators used\nwithin the homogenization framework precludes the application of standard\nAubin--Lions compactness arguments. Our analysis employs two-scale convergence\nin conjunction with a two-scale decomposition based on an appropriate dilation\noperator. The nonlinearities are primarily addressed by means of a variant of\ncompensated compactness and a Vitali compactness argument.

The {\\it TESS} photometry revealed\nrotational modulation with a period of 1.6279247 days. Upon inspecting the\nresiduals after removing the rotational period and its harmonics, we found\nadditional frequencies around 15.8054 d$^{-1}$ which we later confirmed with\nground-based observations as originating from a nearby star. Using\nhigh-resolution spectroscopy, we identified HD 100357 as an Ap Si/He-wk star\nexhibiting rotational modulation caused by surface abundance spots. The stellar\nparameters of HD 100357 were determined as $T_{\\rm eff}$ = 11,850 K, $\\log g$ =\n4.57, $\\upsilon\\sin i$ = 60 km\\,s$^{-1}$, and an inclination angle $i$ =\n72$^{\\circ}$. The detailed abundance analysis revealed strongly overabundant\nstratified silicon, an overabundance of iron-peak elements and rare earth\nelements combined with remarkably deficient helium. Mapping of Fe and Cr\nabundances revealed the existence of ring-shaped regions with a lower\nconcentration of the elements. Their geometry might reflect the orientation of\nthe hypothetical magnetic field of the star, oriented $\\sim$90$^{\\circ}$ to the\nrotational axis. HD 100357, with its strong chemical peculiarities and\nindications of possible magnetic fields, represents an interesting candidate\nfor follow-up spectropolarimetric observations aimed at investigating its\nmagnetic field topology and stellar activity.",

In this study, we aim to expand the\nknown space of such 2D ferromagnetic (FM) half-metals by investigating bilayer\nof Janus VSSe, an FM semiconductor. Its structural, electronic, and magnetic\nproperties are examined using density functional theory, employing the DFT+$U$\nmethod, coupled with the PBE functional. The stability of the bilayer is\nexamined using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperatures\nup to 400 K. To ensure the stability further, the elastic constants of the\nsystem have also been investigated and we found that VSSe bilayer manifests an\neasy plane of magnetization similar to its monolayer counterpart. At the\nDFT+$U$ level, the considered VSSe bilayer exhibits a tendency towards\nhalf-metallicity with a small band gap of 0.11 eV for the majority spin\ncarriers, and of 0.66 eV for the minority ones. To include a transition from a\nsemiconductor to a half-metal, the bilayer is subjected to an external electric\nfield of varying strengths normal to the plane. The lack of horizontal mirror\nsymmetry in the bilayer allows bidirectional tuning of the band gap, with\ndifferent values for the field in \"upward\" and \"downward\" directions. The band\ngaps for the two spin channels increase with the increasing upward electric\nfield, while the opposite happens for the downward fields, with the majority\ncarrier gap closing at 0.16 V/$\\unicode{x212B}$, making the material a spin\ngapless semiconductor. Further increase in the electric field renders the\nmaterial half metallic at 0.18 V/$\\unicode{x212B}$. Given the fact that these\nvalues of the external electric field are achievable in the lab suggests that\nthe FM Janus VSSe bilayer is a promising candidate for spintronic devices.",

    "abstract": "We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network,\nwhere transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The\nwalker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and must\nmaintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit\ncost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon\ndepletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target\nnodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed\n(IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or\ndisfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with\nstochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a\ndeterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the\nwalker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the\nfirst hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the\ntarget-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the\n\\textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target\nnodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the\ndynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary\nconfigurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the\nsurvival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the\nwalker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute\nthe expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the\nwalker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically\nvarious scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.",

However, we observe that using different attributes as\nthe initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This\nsuggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent\nand unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this\ninsight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework.\nAmadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note\nsequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To\nenhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement\nStrategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify\ndiscriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional\nInformation Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent\nvector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note\ndecoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and\ntext-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA\nmodels across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\\times$ speed-up.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control\nfeasibility using our model.

Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly\nfollow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic\nfootsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable\ncontact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in\nsimulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual\n(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template\nstep to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while\npreserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and\nconsistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,\nforward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a\nUnitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam.

The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph\nalgorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing\nof algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can\nbe used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any\nquestion that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning\nabout their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also\nintroduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as\nfinal responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide\nspectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more\nopen-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we\ndiscuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of the calculation of specific heat ($C$) of liquids\nand glasses by first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is\nreviewed. Liquid and glass states have common properties in that there is no\nperiodicity and the atom relaxation has an important role in their\nthermodynamic properties. These properties have, for a long time, hindered the\nconstruction of an appropriate theory of $C$ for these states. The total energy\napproach based on the density-functional theory (DFT) provides a universal\nmethod to calculate $C$, irrespective of the material states. However, aside\nfrom the convergence problem, even DFT-based MD simulations give different\nvalues for a thermodynamic property of liquids and glasses, depending on the\nsetup of MD simulations. The essential problem is atom relaxation, which\naffects the relationship between the energy and temperature $T$. The\ntemperature is determined by the equilibrium state, but there are many\nmetastable states for glasses. Metastable states are stable within their\nrelaxation times. We encounter the difficult problem of hysteresis, which is\nthe most profound consequence of irreversibility. Irreversibility occurs even\nfor quasistatic processes. This is the most difficult and confusing point in\nthe thermodynamics literature. Here, a consistent treatment of both equilibrium\nproperties and irreversibility in adiabatic MD simulations, which has no\nfrictional term, is given by taking multi-timescales into account. A leading\nprinciple to determine the equilibrium is provided by the second law of\nthermodynamics. The basic ideas and the usefulness of the total energy approach\nin real calculations are presented.",

However, existing\nmethods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly\nconstructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and\nreduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of\nreconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a\nnovel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and\nconsistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head\nregions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the\nSubject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy\n(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize\nidentity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal\ninputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric\nalignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the\nlater employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,\neffectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive\nexperiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,\nphotometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack\nsignificantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving\nfrontal fidelity.

The curriculum was aligned with\nthe official syllabus and enriched with visual content, quotations, and\nexplanatory texts related to iconic figures in philosophy. A total of 77\nfirst-year undergraduate students from full-time humanities and social sciences\nprograms participated in the study. Following their end-of-semester offline\nwritten examination, students voluntarily completed a paper-based, anonymous\nten-question test and provided feedback on the method's effectiveness. No\nsensitive personal data were collected, and the research was conducted with\nformal approval from the Faculty Dean. Descriptive statistics and inferential\ntests were applied to evaluate the impact of the virtual environment and AI\nmediation on learning outcomes. Results indicate that 80 percent of\nparticipants achieved good or excellent final exam grades, and the majority\nrated the virtual material as highly effective. Qualitative feedback emphasized\nincreased motivation and deeper engagement, attributed to the immersive 3D\npresentation and interactive AI support. This research contributes to the\nadvancement of digital pedagogy and suggests new directions for applying\nvirtual and AI-based methods in higher education, particularly in disciplines\nwhere abstract reasoning and conceptual understanding are central.",

Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as\nnon-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where\nlabeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We\npropose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic\nultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that\nenhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)\nclassification.

We aim at modeling such synchrotron\nemission, and in particular the degree of linear polarization, by using for the\nfirst time 3D relativistic MHD turbulence simulations. Thanks to a novel\naccelerated version of the ECHO code, a series of 3D relativistic MHD\nsimulations are performed assuming a relativistically hot plasma and various\ndegrees of magnetization, mimicking different conditions encountered in\nsynchrotron sources. Magnetic fluctuations at random directions with respect to\na background field are initialized at large scales. After the turbulent cascade\nis fully developed, the statistical properties of the plasma and of the\nsynthetic synchrotron emission maps are analyzed. Turbulence rapidly relaxes to\na sort of Alfv\\'enic equilibrium and a Kolmogorov cascade with slope -5/3 soon\ndevelops, with differences depending on the initial ratio $\\eta$ of magnetic\nfluctuations over the background field. Dissipation mostly occurs in thin\ncurrent sheets, where (numerical) reconnection takes place, intermittency and\ndeviation from isotropic Gaussian distributions are observed. Synthetic\nsynchrotron maps and their statistical properties depend on $\\eta$ too,\napproaching analytical estimates for large $\\eta$. The integrated degree of\nlinear polarization is found to cover the whole range of observed values in\nPWNe, and its dependence on the relative amplitude of turbulent fluctuations\nshows a good agreement with analytical estimates, even in the presence of\nanisotropy.",

Furthermore, we\nalso found that the typical strong mesh requirements can be lessened by\nselecting an adequate interface thickness.

The forward modelling of observations,\nin particular of large-scale structure, often relies on large cosmological\nsimulations. While the so-called separate universe approach allows one to\naccount for the effect of curvature on the expansion rate in small sub-volumes,\nthe non-Euclidean geometry is harder to accommodate. It becomes important when\nobservables are computed over large distances, e.g. when photons travel to us\nfrom high redshift. Here we present a fully relativistic framework to run\ncosmological simulations for curved spatial geometry. The issue of consistent\nboundary conditions is solved by embedding a spherical cap of the curved\nspacetime into a hole within a flat exterior, where it can undergo free\nexpansion. The geometric nature of gravity is made explicit in our framework,\nallowing for a consistent forward modelling of observables inside the curved\npatch. Our methodology would also work with any Newtonian code to a good\napproximation, requiring changes only to the initial conditions and\npost-processing.",

    "abstract": "Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks\ninvolving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field\nshould be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,\ngathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its\ncontent into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable\nto bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied\nremedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate\nover-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global\ntopology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph\nstructure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This\nstudy presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate\nthe effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global\nstructure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the\nnode centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,\nthe proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with\nlikely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across\nselected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without\nadding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve\nperformance on graph and node classification tasks.

Based on a Fourier continuation (FC)\nmethodology for the accurate trigonometric interpolation of a non-periodic\nfunction, the solver provides high-order convergence in space and time; mild\n(linear) Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) constraints for explicit time\nintegration; and results that are effectively free of numerical dispersion (or\n''pollution'') errors. Such properties enable the efficient and robust\nresolution of the different space-time scales involved modeling tsunamis\ngenerated by dynamic earthquake ground motion (including over long distances).\nNumerical experiments attesting to accuracy and computational performance are\npresented with direct comparisons to high-order finite difference\nmethodologies.

    "abstract": "We explore the feasibility of deploying Bitcoin as the shared monetary\nstandard between Earth and Mars, accounting for physical constraints of\ninterplanetary communication. We introduce a novel primitive, Proof-of-Transit\nTimestamping (PoTT), to provide cryptographic, tamper-evident audit trails for\nBitcoin data across high-latency, intermittently-connected links. Leveraging\nDelay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) and optical low-Earth-orbit (LEO)\nmesh constellations, we propose an architecture for header-first replication,\nlong-horizon Lightning channels with planetary watchtowers, and secure\nsettlement through federated sidechains or blind-merge-mined (BMM) commit\nchains. We formalize PoTT, analyze its security model, and show how it\nmeasurably improves reliability and accountability without altering Bitcoin\nconsensus or its monetary base. Near-term deployments favor strong federations\nfor local settlement; longer-term, blind-merge-mined commit chains (if adopted)\nprovide an alternative. The Earth L1 monetary base remains unchanged, while\nMars can operate a pegged commit chain or strong federation with 1:1 pegged\nassets for local block production. For transparency, if both time-beacon\nregimes are simultaneously compromised, PoTT-M2 (and PoTT generally) reduces to\nadministrative assertions rather than cryptographic time-anchoring.",

    "abstract": "TianQin is a proposed space-based gravitational wave detector mission that\nemploys inter-satellite laser interferometry. Suppressing measurement noise and\nachieving high sensitivity require accurate alignment of multiple onboard\ninterferometers after laser link acquisition. However, due to huge armlengths\nand varying point-ahead angles, the fine alignment of the transmitted beams can\nbe particularly challenging, which needs to take into account both received\nlaser power and far-field wavefront errors. To tackle this issue for TianQin\nwhich has small point-ahead angle variations, we propose an efficient alignment\nstrategy that relies on finding the maximum-intensity direction of the\ntransmitted beam as the alignment reference. The direction can be estimated\nthrough a quatrefoil scan of the local transmitted beam and the corresponding\nintensity measurement from the remote satellite. Under TianQin's fixed-value\ncompensation of the point-ahead angles, simulation results reveal that the\nproposed strategy is capable of aligning the transmitted beams within 20 nrad\nfrom the mean value of the point-ahead angles, while the tilt-to-length\ncoupling associated with far-field wavefront error can meet the requirement\ngiven a transmitted beam aberration of $\\lambda/40$ RMS.",

While various SR\nmodels in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they\noften fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions\nimpeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research\nhas explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance\nsession-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based\nmethods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to\nidentify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific\nfeedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning\nmethods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant\ncomputational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we\npresent multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:\n(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated\nrepresentations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and\n(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on\nframework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a\nSemi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with\nclass embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference\nfeature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.\nThis allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused\nacross all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and\nachieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods.

Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm\nto calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more\neffectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to\nprovide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.\nExtensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2\nmodels demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the\ntraining of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance\ndegradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.\nThis work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and\nfiner-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves\nthe training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling\nfaster development and iteration of large language models.

The helium\nline shows no significant evidence of planetary material at the orbital phases\nobserved in this work, though 3D modeling suggests such a structure could exist\nbelow observational detection limits.

It turns out that the first observable is linearly proportional\nto the gluon mass gap, a fact that allows us to assign a direct physical\nmeaning to this scale. Moreover, we identify three distinct momentum regimes in\nthe gluon propagator, ultraviolet, intermediate, and deep infrared, and assess\ntheir impact on the aforementioned observables. Both observables are sensitive\nto the first two regions of momenta, where functional approaches essentially\ncoincide, but are insensitive to the third, deep infrared, regime.

    "abstract": "Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital\nimages, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in\nthe computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments.",

Based on the multi-layer MDP, we propose a nested\nindex framework and design a nested index policy with provably asymptotic\noptimality. This establishes a theoretical framework adaptable to various\nscheduling mechanisms, achieving efficient optimization through state\nstratification and index design in both preemptive and non-preemptive modes.\nFinally, the closed-form of the nested index is derived, facilitating\nperformance trade-offs between computational complexity and accuracy while\nensuring the universal applicability of the nested index policy across both\nscheduling modes. The experimental results show that in non-preemptive\nscheduling, compared with the benchmark method, the optimality gap is reduced\nby 25.43%, while in preemptive scheduling, the gap has reduced by 61.84%. As\nthe system scale increases, it asymptotically converges in two scheduling modes\nand especially provides near-optimal performance in non-preemptive structure.",

In particular, standard\nparameterizations typically restrict propagation to the vertical and treat\nGW-turbulence interactions in only a rudimentary manner, potentially leading to\nsystematic biases in simulated dynamics and transport. Here, we use the\nMulti-Scale Gravity-Wave Model (MS-GWaM) implemented in the Community Climate\nIcosahedral Nonhydrostatic Model UA-ICON, together with a novel theoretical\nframework, to quantify the impact of (i) oblique GW propagation and (ii)\nexplicit bidirectional coupling between GWs and turbulence. Ensemble\nsimulations reveal that allowing for oblique propagation lowers and cools the\nsummer mesopause by shifting the deposition of momentum and heat to lower\naltitudes, reduces GW-induced vertical shear in the the middle and lower\natmosphere, and enhances turbulent kinetic energy in the upper mesosphere and\nlower thermosphere. In contrast, coupling GWs to turbulence produces a nearly\nopposite mesopause response, lifting and warming the mesopause, while\nmaintaining a reduction in wave-induced shear and further enhancing turbulence.\nTracer experiments additionally show that turbulent coupling significantly\nincreases mixing, particularly in regions of enhanced TKE, with implications\nfor chemical redistribution. These results demonstrate that both oblique GW\npropagation and GW-turbulence interactions exert leading-order controls on\nmesosphere-lower thermosphere circulation, temperature structure, and tracer\ntransport. Neglecting these processes in global models likely contributes to\nbiases in the Brewer-Dobson circulation, energy balance, and constituent\ndistributions, underscoring the need for next-generation GW parameterizations\nthat capture these effects.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate bound periodic orbits of timelike particles in\nthe spacetime of dyonic black holes arising from quasi-topological\nelectromagnetic theory. By varying the coupling parameter $\\alpha_1$, the\ncorresponding black hole solutions exhibit diverse horizon structures,\nincluding naked singularities and black holes with one to four horizons. We\nfind that for sufficiently small $\\alpha_1$, the metric function $f(r)$ becomes\nnon-monotonic outside the event horizon in spacetimes with one or two horizons,\nwhile in all other cases, $f(r)$ remains strictly monotonic. In the\nnon-monotonic regime, the radial effective potential develops a double-barrier\nstructure, allowing the emergence of multiple marginally bound orbits and\nmultiple branches of periodic orbits associated with the same rational number\n$l$. Although differing in radial structure, these orbit branches are\ntopologically equivalent. Remarkably, when the outer potential barrier exceeds\nunity, bound orbits with energy $E>1$ become possible, in addition to the\nstandard $E<1$ branches. When the peak reaches $E=1$, up to three distinct\nbound orbit branches may coexist. We also identify a novel eccentricity\nbehavior, the innermost branch becomes increasingly circular with increasing\nenergy or angular momentum, while outer branches exhibit greater eccentricity\nand a larger apastron-periastron separation. These features, absent in previous\nstudies, are unique signatures of non-monotonic metric functions. In contrast,\nmonotonic cases yield a single-well potential, a unique marginally bound orbit,\nand a single periodic orbit branch per $q$, consistent with earlier findings.\nOur results highlight the critical role of the metric function's shape in\ndetermining the orbital structure around dyonic black holes.",

The local data are highly different from each other and can\nnot capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address\nthe challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving\nfederated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However,\nprevious experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label\n(output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains\n(input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we\nintroduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a\nunified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be\nused to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To\nthis end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework\ndesigned to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and\nheterogeneous settings.

A special variant of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) has\nemerged as a promising approach for the safe management of these swarms by\ncombining the scalability of distributed computation with dynamic swarm motion\ncontrol. In this DMPC method, multiple agents solve local optimization problems\nwith coupled anti-collision constraints, periodically exchanging their\nsolutions. Despite its potential, existing methodologies using this DMPC\nvariant have yet to be deployed on distributed hardware that fully utilize true\ndistributed computation and wireless communication. This is primarily due to\nthe lack of a communication system tailored to meet the unique requirements of\nmobile swarms and an architecture that supports distributed computation while\nadhering to the payload constraints of UAVs. We present DMPC-SWARM, a new swarm\ncontrol methodology that integrates an efficient, stateless low-power wireless\ncommunication protocol with a novel DMPC algorithm that provably avoids UAV\ncollisions even under message loss. By utilizing event-triggered and\ndistributed off-board computing, DMPC-SWARM supports nano UAVs, allowing them\nto benefit from additional computational resources while retaining scalability\nand fault tolerance. In a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that\nDMPC-SWARM guarantees collision avoidance under realistic conditions, including\ncommunication delays and message loss. Finally, we present DMPC-SWARM's\nimplementation on a swarm of up to 16 nano-quadcopters, demonstrating the first\nrealization of these DMPC variants with computation distributed on multiple\nphysical devices interconnected by a real wireless mesh networks.

    "abstract": "The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically\nhampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on\nunseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising\nalternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this\ndata-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward\nLearning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a\nself-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a\nreward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,\nmulti-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT\nand RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data\nalready surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.\nCrucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and\ncross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based\nmethods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves\nperformance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more\nparameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in\nhigh-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data\ngeneration and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly\ngeneralizable medical AI.",

    "abstract": "While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text,\nexisting multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As\nmodalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail\nto fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits\nrelevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle\nhateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in\ncombination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model\nfor HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from\nspeech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features\nextracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an\nearly feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key\nconfigurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities\nin the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen\ntext is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key.\nExperiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video,\non-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the\nmodalities.

These phases provide constraints from different regions of\nthe Earth, such as the crust, mantle, and even the cores. The choice of phase\ndepends on the study target and scientific objective: surface waves are suited\nfor imaging shallow structures, whereas body waves yield higher-resolution\ninformation at depth. A key challenge in body-wave studies is that the\nlow-amplitude P and S arrivals are often masked by surface waves overlapping in\nboth time and frequency. Although body waves typically contain higher-frequency\ncontent, their spectral overlap with surface waves limits the effectiveness of\nconventional filtering approaches. Addressing this issue requires advanced\nsignal-processing techniques. One such method, Sparsity-Promoting\nTime-Frequency Filtering (SP-TFF, Mohammadigheymasi et al., 2022), exploits\nhigh-resolution polarization information in the time-frequency domain. SP-TFF\nintegrates amplitude, directivity, and rectilinearity to enhance phase\ndiscrimination. Here, we further develop SP-TFF by designing a filter set\ntailored to isolate body-wave arrivals otherwise masked by high-amplitude\nsurface waves. The directivity filters are constructed from predicted seismic\nray incidence angles, enabling focused extraction of body-wave energy and\nsuppression of interfering phases. We evaluate the method on both synthetic\ntests and waveform data from the Mw 7.0 Guerrero, Mexico, earthquake of\nSeptember 8, 2021, recorded by the United States National Seismic Network\n(USNSN).

The ability of the model to preserve\nrelevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on\nboth time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders\nwith different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and\nevaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our\nresults show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses\ninto account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that\nDeep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the\nrelevant signal properties. This work provides insight into how deep learning\nmodels process EEG data and examines whether frequency information is captured\nwhen time series signals are used as input.",

    "abstract": "Quantum entanglement exists in nature but is absent in classical physics,\nhence it fundamentally distinguishes quantum from classical theories. While\nentanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly\nmore challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we\ntheoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In\nparticular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate\ntwo experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite\ntemperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically\ncalculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below\nwhich the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is\naccessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the\nvicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with\nmutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by\nthe coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain\ngeneralized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization.\nMoreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale\nextensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement\nbetween coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is\nlargely overlooked compared to other partitions.

We separately establish the near-\nand hybrid-field channel models for IRS-reflected links to evaluate the\nperformance gain more precisely and practically.

To address this\nissue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB\nimages as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these\nmethods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB\nimages. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to\nthe quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms\nof LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a\nnovel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at\nan early stage.

To\nmitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and\nglobal filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth\nestimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove\nsegmentation-induced outliers.

Previous\nactive domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by\nselecting samples that are farthest from the source domain.

For an $f$-list assignment $L$ of a graph $G$, a proper\nconflict-free $L$-coloring of $G$ is a proper coloring $\\phi$ of $G$ such that\n$\\phi(v) \\in L(v)$ for every vertex $v\\in V(G)$ and $v$ has a color that\nappears precisely once at its neighborhood for every non-isolated vertex $v\\in\nV(G)$. We say that $G$ is proper conflict-free $f$-choosable if for any\n$f$-list assignment $L$ of $G$, there exists a proper conflict-free\n$L$-coloring of $G$. For a non-negative integer $k$, we say that $G$ is\n\\emph{proper conflict-free $({\\rm degree}+k)$-choosable} if $G$ is proper\nconflict-free $f$-choosable where $f$ is a mapping with $f(v)= d_G(v)+k$ for\nevery vertex $v\\in V(G)$.\n  Motivated by degree-choosability of graphs, we investigate the proper\nconflict-free $({\\rm degree}+k)$-choosability of graphs, especially for cases\n$k=1,2,3$. As the 5-cycle is not proper conflict-free $({\\rm\ndegree}+2)$-choosable and it is the only such graph we know, it is possible\nthat every connected graph other than the 5-cycle is proper conflict-free\n$({\\rm degree}+2)$-choosable and thus every graph is proper conflict-free\n$({\\rm degree}+3)$-choosable. To support these, we show that every connected\ngraph with maximum degree at most 3 distinct from the 5-cycle is proper\nconflict-free $(\\text{degree}+2)$-choosable, and that $S(G)$ is proper\nconflict-free $(\\text{degree}+2)$-choosable for every graph $G$, where $S(G)$\nis a graph obtained from $G$ by subdividing each edge once. Furthermore, by\nadapting the technique of DP-colorings, we prove that every graph with maximum\ndegree at most $4$ is proper conflict-free $({\\rm degree}+3)$-choosable.",

    "abstract": "We recently showed that macroscopic nuclear spin ensembles prepared in\ncoherent spin states can dramatically enhance the interaction rates of weakly\ninteracting cosmic relics-such as dark matter and the cosmic neutrino\nbackground-through collective quantum effects analogous to Dicke superradiance,\nwhere the de-excitation and excitation rates scale as the square of the number\nof spins, $N^2$. We thus coined these processes superradiant interactions. In\nthis paper, we propose a protocol to realize this enhancement and boost the\ndiscovery potential for such relics. We show how concepts from quantum optics\ncan be adapted to nuclear spins coupled to superconducting circuits, enabling\nhigh-sensitivity systems. The spins are first initialized into a coherent spin\nstate via a $\\pi/2$ Rabi pulse from the ground state. When the circuit is\nsufficiently detuned from resonance, the spin-circuit interaction implements a\nsqueezing Hamiltonian. Because squeezing must outpace spin relaxation and\ndephasing, the protocol favors macroscopic ensembles and high-quality\nsuperconducting circuits. During this squeezing phase, the standard quantum\nvariance is reduced by up to 4.8 orders of magnitude-equivalent to 48 dB of\nsqueezing-for circuits with quality factors $Q \\sim 10^8$-$10^9$. The signal\nimprinted on the spins during the squeezing protocol can be magnified by\nfurther utilizing the squeezing interactions, easing the requirement for\nshot-noise-limited readout. This protocol has the potential to significantly\naccelerate axion and dark photon dark matter searches and extend the reach of\nexisting axion experiments to probe QCD axion-nuclear spin couplings. More\nbroadly, it paves the way for detecting coherent inelastic interactions from\nother cosmic relics-most notably the cosmic neutrino background-and establishes\nnuclear-spin-based systems as a new class of quantum, ultra-low-threshold\ndetectors.",

To address\nthis gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are\nwell-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the\ncomplex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield,\na detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain\ncoordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph\nrepresentation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn\nfine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path\nattention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling\nprecise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51\nreal-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an\naverage F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an intelligent service optimization method based on a\nmulti-agent collaborative evolution mechanism to address governance challenges\nin large-scale microservice architectures. These challenges include complex\nservice dependencies, dynamic topology structures, and fluctuating workloads.\nThe method models each service as an agent and introduces graph representation\nlearning to construct a service dependency graph. This enables agents to\nperceive and embed structural changes within the system. Each agent learns its\npolicy based on a Markov Decision Process. A centralized training and\ndecentralized execution framework is used to integrate local autonomy with\nglobal coordination. To enhance overall system performance and adaptability, a\ngame-driven policy optimization mechanism is designed. Through a\nselection-mutation process, agent strategy distributions are dynamically\nadjusted. This supports adaptive collaboration and behavioral evolution among\nservices. Under this mechanism, the system can quickly respond and achieve\nstable policy convergence when facing scenarios such as sudden workload spikes,\ntopology reconfigurations, or resource conflicts. To evaluate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method, experiments are conducted on a representative\nmicroservice simulation platform. Comparative analyses are performed against\nseveral advanced approaches, focusing on coordination efficiency, adaptability,\nand policy convergence performance. Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod outperforms others in several key metrics. It significantly improves\ngovernance efficiency and operational stability in large-scale microservice\nsystems. The method demonstrates strong practical value and engineering\nfeasibility.",

The core\nidea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based\ntext-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained\nText-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.\nSpecifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a\nCross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference\nimage features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its\ntext-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction\ndataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other\nextensions, and is more scalable.

Then, we investigate how the $\\Xi NN$ 3BF affects\nthe correlation function of deuteron-$\\Xi^-$ pair created through heavy-ion\ncollisions.\n  Methods: To reduce the number of low-energy constants involved in the $\\Xi\nNN$ potentials, we employ the decuplet saturation approximation, by which only\ntwo of them remain unconstrained.\n  Results: We found that the effect of the $\\Xi NN$ 3BF on the deuteron-$\\Xi^-$\ncorrelation function is at most about 4%. This is because the deuteron and\n$\\Xi^-$ interact with each other mainly at low momentum, corresponding to\nperipheral scattering, where the influence of the $\\Xi NN$ 3BF is limited.\n  Conclusions: High-momentum scattering of the deuteron off $\\Xi^-$ is expected\nto be a promising probe of the $\\Xi NN$ 3BF, offering an alternative to\nfemtoscopic analyses of the correlation function.",

    "abstract": "Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in\nindustrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable\nsuccess, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its\nricher geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of\npowerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To\nbridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an\nensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.\nHowever, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:\nexisting strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus\ndegrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel\nImportance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution\nof each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise\ncritical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling\nit to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve\ntheir unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly\ndetection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet\nachieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,\nunderscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.",

To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have\nemerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.\nWhile prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low\nuncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual\nuncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class\npredictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To\nbridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA\nframework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.\nThrough a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure\nof the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling\nlabel-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty\nobjects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that\npreserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing\nuncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism\nforms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic\nclassification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial\nunderstanding.

Instead of merely predicting outcomes,\nRL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional\nmodels that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial,\nfeedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative\npossibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL\ntypically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes,\nimaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms.\nThese systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures\nto meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and\ndecision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more\nthan a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical\nenvironments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including\nmodel-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches,\nand emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration\nthrough the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL\napplications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health,\ndiagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and\ntranslational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze\nRL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons\nfor safe, human-aligned policy learning.

One-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)\nabundances of K and other elements, including Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni, were\nderived using spectral synthesis. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE)\ncorrections were applied to the K abundances by interpolating a precomputed\ngrid of corrections based on stellar parameters and the LTE K abundance. We\ndetected K I lines in seven stars with [Fe/H]$< -3.0$ and derived upper limits\nfor other stars in the same metallicity regime, making this sample well-suited\nfor investigating the nucleosynthesis origins of K in the early universe. We\nfound that the [K/Fe] and [K/Ca] ratios of the seven stars are enhanced\nrelative to the solar value, with a scatter of approximately 0.1 dex, as small\nas the typical measurement uncertainty. Under the assumption that each star\nformed from gas purely enriched by a single or a few massive stars' supernovae,\nthe small scatter in [K/Fe] and [K/Ca], contrasted with the $\\sim$0.7 dex\nscatter in [Na/Mg] ratios (after NLTE correction), suggests that the production\nof K in massive stars or their supernovae is independent of the processes that\ndrive Na/Mg variation.

    "abstract": "The boson peak (BP) stands as a key feature in understanding glasses and\namorphous materials. It directly underlies their anomalous material properties,\nincluding thermal behaviors such as excess specific heat and low thermal\nconductivity, as well as mechanical characteristics such as nonaffine\nelasticity and fragile plasticity. Despite its importance, understanding of the\nBP remains limited in covalent network glasses. The most promising concepts are\nisostaticity and marginal stability, which have been established in theories of\nrigidity percolation and the jamming transition. While these concepts,\nsupported by comprehensive data, account for the BP in packing-based glasses,\ncomparable explanations have not yet been demonstrated for covalent network\nglasses. Here we study silica glass, a prototypical covalent network glass,\nusing molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the BP in silica glass is\ngoverned by near-isostatic constraints and marginal stability, supporting their\nuniversality across diverse glassy systems. Furthermore, we reveal that these\nprinciples manifest as a wavenumber-independent band in the dynamical structure\nfactor, and we demonstrate consistency with inelastic X-ray scattering data on\nsilica glass. Our results provide a unified, experimentally testable framework\nfor deciphering the BP and for refining the interpretation of scattering data\nin amorphous materials.",

However, the long propagation delays\nbetween LP satellites, users, and GNSS satellites result in significantly\ndifferent link durations compared to those within the GNSS constellation.\nScheduling inter-satellite links (ISLs) is a core task of Contact Plan Design\n(CPD).

Existing methods often\nrely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face\nissues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of\nend-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced\nmulti-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment\nselection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning\npipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs\nreasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on\nthe evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current\nquestion. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually\naware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we\nintroduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level\nrewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing\nframe-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and\nquestion comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing\nend-to-end training.

However, the\nrarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of\ndeep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain\nrandomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a\nsynthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations\nfrom healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without\nrequiring pathological annotations.\n  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with\nCCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on\nCCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with\nother pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically\nrelevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show\ntheir utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed\naugmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in\nhealthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these\nquantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological\nconsistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable\nshape-based analyses.

    "abstract": "Incorporating boundary conditions into stochastic models of passive or active\nparticle motion is usually implemented at the level of the associated forward\nor backward Kolmogorov equation, whose solution determines the probability\ndistribution of sample paths. In order to write down the corresponding\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) that generates the individual sample\npaths, it is necessary to introduce a Brownian functional that keeps track of\nthe boundary-particle contact time. We previously constructed the SDE for a\n(non-diffusing) run-and-tumble particle (RTP) on the half-line with either a\nreflecting or sticky wall at $x=0$. In this paper we extend the theory to\ninclude the effects of diffusion. One of the non-trivial consequences of\ncombining drift-diffusion with tumbling is that the zero diffusion limit\n$D\\rightarrow 0$ is singular in the sense that the number of boundary\nconditions is doubled when $D>0$. We use stochastic calculus to derive the\nforward Kolmogorov equation for two distinct boundary conditions that reduce,\nrespectively, to non-sticky and sticky boundary conditions in the\nzero-diffusion limit. In the latter case, it is necessary to include a boundary\nlayer in a neighbourhood of the wall and use singular perturbation theory. We\nalso treat the wall as partially absorbing by assuming that the particle is\nabsorbed when the amount of boundary-particle contact time (discrete or\ncontinuous local time) exceeds a quenched random threshold. Finally, we analyse\nthe survival probability and corresponding FPT density for absorption at a\nnon-sticky wall by deriving the corresponding backward Kolmogorov equation",

    "abstract": "Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and\nneck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of\nmetastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.\nThis study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict\nmetastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)\nimages, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor\nand organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer\nextracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features\nwere obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random\nforest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,\nsmoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived\nfeatures. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to\npredict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold\ncross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity\n(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed\nsingle-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of\n0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive\nperformance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).\nStratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation\nstudies indicated complementary information from different modalities.\nEvaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation\nlearning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated\nhigh accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a\ncomprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has\npotential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment\nplanning.",

    "abstract": "In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional\nquantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules\noften fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to\nrigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement\nLearning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical\nindicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio\nmanagement. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23\nyears of S&P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks\nacross 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum\nindicators to capture holistic market dynamics.

Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9\nbaselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market\nregimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and\ndownside risk control.

However, the extreme\nsparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby\nlimiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we\npropose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our\nframework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry\nRe-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features\nat denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.\nThis module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while\nmaintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature\nPropagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to\nguide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information\nsharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and\nproviding enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By\nintegrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature\nrepresentation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the\ncoding process.

In this paper, we propose\nPostToPersonality (PtoP), a novel LLM based framework for MBTI prediction from\nsocial media posts of individuals. Specifically, PtoP leverages Retrieval\nAugmented Generation with in context learning to mitigate hallucination in\nLLMs. Furthermore, we fine tune a pretrained LLM to improve model specification\nin MBTI understanding with synthetic minority oversampling, which balances the\nclass imbalance by generating synthetic samples.

However, their effectiveness depends not\nonly on automation performance but also on their ability to communicate intent\nand coordinate safely with pedestrians in the absence of traditional driver\ncues. Understanding how pedestrians interpret and respond to ADS behavior is\ntherefore critical to the development of connected vehicle systems. This study\nextends the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by incorporating four external\nfactors (i.e. safety, trust, compatibility, and understanding) to model\npedestrian decision-making in road-crossing scenarios involving level-5 ADSs.\nUsing data from an online survey (n = 212), results show that perceived\nbehavioral control, attitude, and social information significantly predict\npedestrians' crossing intentions. External factors, particularly perceived\nsafety and understanding, strongly influence these constructs.

Additionally, the potential of textual information\nwithin structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce\nand assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing\ntechniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource\nutilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR\ndatasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with\nleading existing methods.

Instead of using a numerical quadrature\nto approximately compute the moments by solving a number of large shifted\ncomplex linear systems at each iteration, we make use of the Chebyshev--Jackson\n(CJ) series expansion to approximate the moments, which only involves\nmatrix-vector products and avoids expensive solutions of the linear systems. We\nprove that the CJ series expansions pointwise converge to the moments as the\nseries degree increases, but at different convergence rates depending on point\npositions and moment orders. These extend the available convergence results on\nthe zeroth moment of CJ series expansions to higher order ones. Based on the\nresults established, we develop a CJ--SS--RR algorithm. Numerical experiments\nillustrate that the new algorithm is more efficient than the contour\nintegral-based block SS--RR algorithm with the trapezoidal rule.",

    "abstract": "The growing integration of large language models (LLMs) into the peer review\nprocess presents potential risks to the fairness and reliability of scholarly\nevaluation. While LLMs offer valuable assistance for reviewers with language\nrefinement, there is growing concern over their use to generate substantive\nreview content. Existing general AI-generated text detectors are vulnerable to\nparaphrasing attacks and struggle to distinguish between surface language\nrefinement and substantial content generation, suggesting that they primarily\nrely on stylistic cues. When applied to peer review, this limitation can result\nin unfairly suspecting reviews with permissible AI-assisted language\nenhancement, while failing to catch deceptively humanized AI-generated reviews.\nTo address this, we propose a paradigm shift from style-based to content-based\ndetection. Specifically, we introduce CoCoNUTS, a content-oriented benchmark\nbuilt upon a fine-grained dataset of AI-generated peer reviews, covering six\ndistinct modes of human-AI collaboration. Furthermore, we develop CoCoDet, an\nAI review detector via a multi-task learning framework, designed to achieve\nmore accurate and robust detection of AI involvement in review content. Our\nwork offers a practical foundation for evaluating the use of LLMs in peer\nreview, and contributes to the development of more precise, equitable, and\nreliable detection methods for real-world scholarly applications.

In MVPD, end-to-end\ntrainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often\nstruggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views\nor with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not\nexploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect\npedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called\nMulti-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV\nfeatures by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual\nviews into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits\nthe properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.\nTherefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with\nconsistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information\nat different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV\nfeatures using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of\npedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV\nfeatures greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the\nprevious highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.",

Quantum nonlinear\nspectroscopy (QNS) can access exponentially more types of correlations than its\nclassical counterpart, since the responses to ``classical forces'' correspond\nto contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) that involve only commutators,\nwhile in QNS ``quantum forces'' from a quantum sensor induce responses\ncorresponding to CTOCs that involve both commutators and anti-commutators.\nSymmetries are important for constraining and analyzing nonlinear spectroscopy.\nQuantum and classical nonlinear spectroscopy have similar spatial symmetry\nproperties. QNS, however, is expected to have its characteristic non-spatial\nsymmetry properties since commutators and anti-commutators of physical\nquantities can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as\nexchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations\nextracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including\nparticle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), and their combination, i.e., chiral (S)\nsymmetry. We find that the generalized C-symmetry imposes special selection\nrules on QNS, and the generalized T- and S-symmetry relate CTOCs to\nout-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs).

Among them, a superoutburst is\nobserved in CRTS J110014.7+131552 which is associated with the precursor\noutburst, where prominent superhumps are observed during maximum of the\noutburst with a mean period of 0.06786(1) d. We have observed variations in the\nsuperhump period, along with changes in the shape of the light curve profile\nand the amplitude of the superhumps during different phases of the outburst,\nindicating disc-radius variation as well as periodically variable dissipation\nat the accretion stream's bright spot. The data on SDSS J093537.46+161950.8\nreveal previously unknown variations modulated with periods 0.06584(2) d and\n2.36(2) d, related to the positive superhump and the disc-precession periods,\nrespectively, which can reasonably be interpreted as a result of the prograde\nrotation of an eccentric accretion disc. Despite its short orbital period, the\nlack of outburst activity, along with its stable long-term brightness,\ndiscovery spectrum, and absolute magnitude suggests that the object might not\nbe an SU UMa type dwarf nova. Instead, it may belong to the group of high\nmass-transfer CVs below the period gap, either to a rare class of nova-like\nvariables or to the class of high-luminosity IPs, a subclass of magnetic CVs.\nFor [PK2008] HalphaJ130559, a new average orbital period of 0.15092(1) d has\nbeen identified. Additionally, this system displays previously undetected\naverage periods of 0.14517(3) d and 3.83(1) d, which can be provisionally\nidentified as negative superhump and disc-precession periods, respectively. If\nthe identified simultaneous signals do indeed reflect negative superhump and\ndisc-precession period variations then their origin may be associated with the\nretrograde precession of a tilted disc and its interaction with the secondary\nstream.",

We argue about the measures of consumption and\nutility acquisition in CRRA utility function under the condition of big data\ninteraction, we indicate its weakness, i.e., irrational consumption does not\nlead to the acquisition of utility. We consider that big data, which is\ndifferent from macro and micro economic signals, formed by general information\nentropy, affects agents' rational cognition, which makes a part of their\nconsumption ineffective. We preliminarily propose the theory that how dilution\nmechanism driven by big data will affect agents' cognitive resources. Based on\ntheoretical and empirical analysis, we construct the Consumption Adjustment\nWeight Function (CAWF) of agents interacting with big data and further apply it\nto a model of firm wealth distribution with financial frictions, we get\nanalytical solutions according to the Mean Field Game (MFG) and find: Lower\nfinancial friction increases the average wealth of firms but also leads to\ngreater wealth inequality. When agents convert effective consumption into\nutility, which is a weight of total consumption, the average wealth of firms\nincreases with the weight increasing. Meanwhile, wealth inequality follows a\nU-shaped trend, and it will be the lowest level when the weight approaches to\n0.5.

Deploying space-based content delivery\nnetworks within emerging mega-constellations provides an effective means to\nbridge the digital divide. However, space-based caching faces constraints from\nphysical-layer dynamics, including dynamic topologies, time-varying\ninter-satellite link conditions, and limited onboard energy. In addition,\nexisting mechanisms often lack fine-grained content categorization and global\noptimization. This paper proposes MegaCacheX, a cost-effective hierarchical\nframework for collaborative content distribution that achieves\n\"Earth-independence\" by providing cloud services directly from space.\nSpecifically, data centers in Sun-synchronous orbit act as primary content\nsources, while caching nodes in mega-constellations and ground stations\ncollaboratively form a distributed edge layer. MegaCacheX optimizes caching\nstrategies by integrating content popularity, regional user distribution, and\nsatellite trajectory predictions. Multi-tier caching nodes serve as service\nanchors, enabling seamless content delivery with low latency. A prototype\nimplemented on a microservices-based, containerized testbed demonstrates that\nMegaCacheX reduces global content access latency by about 36% compared to\nbaseline approaches, while maintaining cost efficiency.",

In this paper, we reconsider proposed system architectures that\nconsist of huge (many-terabyte to petabyte scale) memories shared among large\nnumbers of CPUs. We argue two practical engineering challenges, scaling and\nsignaling, limit such designs. We propose the opposite approach. Rather than\ncreate large, shared, homogenous memories, systems explicitly break memory up\ninto smaller slices more tightly coupled with compute elements. Leveraging\nadvances in 2.5D/3D integration, this compute-memory node provisions private\nlocal memory, enabling accesses of node-exclusive data through micrometer-scale\ndistances, and dramatically reduced access cost. In-package memory elements\nsupport shared state within a processor, providing far better bandwidth and\nenergy-efficiency than DRAM, which is used as main memory for large working\nsets and cold data. Hardware making memory capacities and distances explicit\nallows software to efficiently compose this hierarchy, managing data placement\nand movement.",

It avoids the operation of\nsubtracting a large magnetic energy from the total energy to obtain a very\nsmall thermal pressure in low-beta regions, thereby improving the numerical\nstability of MHD models. We implemented this method in COCONUT and validated\nthe model by performing a time-evolving coronal simulation during Carrington\nRotation (CR) 2296, a solar maximum CR. We also compare quasi-steady-state\nsimulation results during the solar minimum and the increasing phase,\ncalculated using both versions of COCONUT adopting the decomposed energy\nequation and the traditional full energy equation to further validate the\nreliability of the energy decomposition method. The simulation results show\nthat the energy decomposition method yields results nearly identical to those\nof the traditional full energy equation during solar minimum, while\nsignificantly enhancing COCONUT's ability to simulate coronal evolution under\nstrong magnetic fields, even those exceeding 100 Gauss.

The event horizon, photon\nsphere, and critical impact parameter of the former increase compared with the\nSchwarzschild black hole, but those of the latter decrease. The data from the\nEvent Horizon Telescope Collaboration are used to constrain the parameter\nranges of the two black holes. In the case of spherical accretion, the quantum\ncorrection of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole leads to the increase of black hole\nshadow size and the decrease of integrated intensity, while the shadow size of\nmagnetically charged Ghosh-Kumar black hole decreases and the integrated\nintensity increases. The shadow radius of the black hole is independent of the\nspherical accretion models. For an optically and geometrically thin accretion\ndisk, the integrated intensity is mainly contributed by direct emission, and\nthe contributions of photon rings and lensed rings are very small. In addition,\nthe photon rings and lensed rings of Kazakov-Solodukhin black hole are\nnarrower, while those of Ghosh-Kumar black hole are wider. Whereas the\nKazakov-Solodukhin black hole exhibits higher brightness, the Ghosh-Kumar black\nhole shows lower brightness.

Existing AI\nsafety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human\nintervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI\nwith extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee\nsecurity. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework\nthat shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced\nstructural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are\ncomputationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined\nthreat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework\nis composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,\nand general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a\ngovernable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection\nagainst compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules\nand the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable\ntechnical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line\ndefined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,\ntamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack\nvectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security\nproperties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a\nprototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.",

Traditionally,\nself-interference (SI) in IBFD systems is a major obstacle to recovering the\nsignal of interest (SOI). Under the JCAS paradigm, however, this high-power SI\nsignal presents an opportunity for efficient sensing. Since each transceiver\nnode has access to the original SI signal, its environmental reflections can be\nexploited to estimate channel conditions and detect changes, without requiring\ndedicated radar waveforms. We propose a blind source separation (BSS)-based\nframework to simultaneously perform self-interference cancellation (SIC) and\nextract sensing information in IBFD MIMO settings. The approach applies the\nFast Independent Component Analysis (FastICA) algorithm to separate the SI and\nSOI signals while enabling simultaneous signal recovery and channel estimation.\nSimulation results confirm the framework's effectiveness, showing improved\nsensing and communication performance as signal frame size increases.",

This degradation intensifies under a more\ndemanding condition: when the candidate pool per question is expanded from four\noptions to one thousand, the strongest retriever's top-1 accuracy falls from 33\n% to 26 %, revealing acute sensitivity to distractor volume. Statistical tests\nfurther show that, for every embedding model, cosine-similarity scores between\nqueries and correct completions are significantly higher than those for\nincorrect ones (p < 0.01), indicating decisions driven largely by surface-level\nsemantic proximity rather than factual reasoning.

To address\nthese limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play\nsafety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models.\nUsing data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects\nsafety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a\npatch-like manner.

However, feGRASS\nsuffers from two main issues: 1) difficulties in parallelizing the recovery\nstep for strict data dependencies, and 2) performance degradation on skewed\ninputs, often requiring multiple passes to recover sufficient edges. To address\nthese challenges, we propose parallel density-aware Graph Spectral\nSparsification (pdGRASS), a parallel algorithm that organizes edges into\ndisjoint subtasks without data dependencies between them, enabling efficient\nparallelization and sufficient edge recovery in a single pass. We empirically\nevaluate feGRASS and pdGRASS based on 1) off-tree edge-recovery runtime and 2)\nsparsifier quality, measured by the iteration count required for convergence in\na preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) application. The evaluation\ndemonstrates that, depending on the number of edges recovered, pdGRASS achieves\naverage speedups ranging from 3.9x to 8.8x.

We present the construction\nof the spacetime density matrix in general quantum systems and its\nrepresentation via the Schwinger Keldysh path integral. We further introduce a\nsuper-operator framework, within which the spacetime density matrix appears as\na special case, and discuss possible generalizations from this perspective. We\nalso show that the spacetime density matrix satisfies a Liouville von Neumann\ntype equation of motion. When considering subsystems, a reduced spacetime\ndensity matrix can be defined by tracing over complementary degrees of freedom.\nWe study the general properties of its moments and, in particular, derive\nuniversal short time behavior of the second moment. We find that coupling\nbetween subsystems plays a crucial role in obtaining nontrivial results.\nAssuming weak coupling, we develop a perturbative method to compute the moments\nsystematically.",

With the rise of\nrepresentation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has\nbecome easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text\ndocuments and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between\nlistings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.\n  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,\nvarious unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,\nmaking this approach challenging.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating\nintermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has\nexamined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness.\nDue to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more\ncontext does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could\npredict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could\nstop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final\ndecision.\n  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to\ngenerate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to\nquantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we\nmeasure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step\nusing conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the\nvocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear\npattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated\nwith correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong\nanswers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer\nthan correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield\nbetter outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on\ndesigning efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive\nreasoning early.",

    "abstract": "Radio emissions from RS CVn objects exhibit distinct characteristics at low\nand high frequencies, widely attributed to differing radiation mechanisms. The\ndisparate processes of high-frequency gyrosynchrotron and low-frequency\nelectron cyclotron maser emissions have traditionally suggested an absence of\ncorrelation in their radio luminosities. Our study presents a\nfrequency-independent linear correlation between radio luminosity ($L_R$) and\norbital/rotational periods ($P$) in RS CVn binaries. Analyzing the Sydney Radio\nStar Catalogue (SRSC) data, we derived orbital periods for 42 of 60 RS CVn\nsources using TESS light curves, revealing a strong positive correlation (PCC =\n0.698, $P$ = 3.95e-7) between $\\log_{10}L_R$ and $\\log_{10}P$. This correlation\nremains across frequencies from 144-3000 MHz, showing uniform luminosity\nbehavior. By combining light curve analysis with stellar mass-radius-luminosity\nrelationships, we calculated parameters like binary mass, primary/secondary\nmass, Rossby number, and binary separation for eight RS CVn systems. The\nresults show a notable correlation between radio luminosity and binary mass,\nprimary mass, and separation (PCC = 0.663, 0.663, 0.719), with separation\nshowing the strongest correlation. This suggests the radio emission may largely\noriginate from the binary components' interaction, challenging existing models\nof RS CVn radio emission mechanisms and offering insights into the individual\nversus collective origins of these emissions.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, fast solar wind is considered to originate in solar source\nregions that are continuously open to the heliosphere and slow wind originates\nin regions that are intermittently open to it. In fast wind, the gradient of\nthe solar wind helium abundance ($A_\\mathrm{He}$) with increasing solar wind\nspeed ($v_\\mathrm{sw}$) is $\\sim0$ and $A_\\mathrm{He}$ is fixed at $\\sim50\\%$\nof the photospheric value. In slow wind, this gradient is large,\n$A_\\mathrm{He}$ is highly variable, and it doesn't exceed this $\\sim50\\%$\nvalue. Although the normalized cross helicity in fast wind typically approaches\n1, this is not universally true and Alterman & D'Amicis (2025) show that\n$\\nabla_{v_\\mathrm{sw}} \\! A_\\mathrm{He}$ in fast wind unexpectedly increases\nwith decreasing $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$. We show that these large gradients are\ndue to the presence of compressive fluctuations. Accounting for the solar\nwind's compressibility ($\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$), there are two subsets of\nenhanced $A_\\mathrm{He}$ in excess of typical fast wind values. The subset with\na large compressibility is likely from neither continuously nor intermittently\nopen sources. The portion of the solar wind speed distribution over which these\nfluctuations are most significant corresponds to the range of Alfv\\'en\nwave-poor solar wind from continuously open source regions, which is likely\nanalogous to the Alfv\\'enic slow wind. Mapping the results of this work to\nAlterman & D'Amicis (2025) and vice versa shows that, in any given\n$\\left|\\delta n/n\\right|$ quantile, $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right| \\lesssim 0.65$, an\nupper bound on non-Alfv\\'enic cross helicity. Similarly, $\\left|\\delta\nn/n\\right| \\lesssim 0.15$ in any given $\\left|\\sigma_c\\right|$ quantile, is an\nupper bound on incompressible fluctuations.

    "abstract": "Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires\nassigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating\nlarge-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,\nmotivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme\ncase of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided\nwith only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.\nTraditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend\nto yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various\npseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a\nnovel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while\nmitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective\nDynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these\ncontributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling\n(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results.",

A common approach to\nimbue more realism to the spreading process is to constrain simulations to a\nnetwork structure, where connected nodes update their disease state based on\npairwise interactions along the edges of their local neighbourhood. Simplicial\ncontagion models (SCM) extend this to hypergraphs such that groups of three\nnodes are able to interact and propagate the disease along higher-order\nhyperedges (triangles). Though more flexible, it is not clear the extent to\nwhich the inclusion of these higher-order interactions result in dynamics that\nare characteristically different to those attained from simpler pairwise\ninteractions. Here, we propose an agent-based model that unifies the classical\nSIS/SIR compartmental model and SCM, and extends it to allow for interactions\nalong hyperedges of arbitrary order. Using this model, we demonstrate how the\nsteady-state dynamics of pairwise interactions can be made to replicate those\nof simulations that include higher-order topologies by linearly scaling disease\nparameters based on a proposed measure network activity.

However,\nensuring high-quality service for real-time edge systems is a significant\nchallenge due to the considerable computational demands and resource\nrequirements of these models. Existing strategies typically either offload\ntransformer computations to other devices or directly deploy compressed models\non individual edge devices. These strategies, however, result in either\nconsiderable communication overhead or suboptimal trade-offs between accuracy\nand efficiency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a collaborative\ninference system for general transformer models, termed CoFormer. The central\nidea behind CoFormer is to exploit the divisibility and integrability of\ntransformer. An off-the-shelf large transformer can be decomposed into multiple\nsmaller models for distributed inference, and their intermediate results are\naggregated to generate the final output. We formulate an optimization problem\nto minimize both inference latency and accuracy degradation under heterogeneous\nhardware constraints. DeBo algorithm is proposed to first solve the\noptimization problem to derive the decomposition policy, and then progressively\ncalibrate decomposed models to restore performance. We demonstrate the\ncapability to support a wide range of transformer models on heterogeneous edge\ndevices, achieving up to 3.1$\\times$ inference speedup with large transformer\nmodels.

Existing approaches often leverage large language models to\nautomatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data\ndiversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in\nreal-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world\napplications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from\ntask-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case.

Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance\nby an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and\nin some cases outperforming leading closed-source models.

Furthermore, the recent discussion of generalized anomalies\ntells us that even for finite $N$ there should be cusps if $N$ and $N_f$ are\nnot coprime, as one can show that the domain wall configuration of $\\eta'$\nshould support a Chern-Simons theory on it, i.e., domains are not smoothly\nconnected.

We argue that the analysis\nof the $N_f = N$ case should be subject to the above anomaly argument, and thus\nthere should be a cusp; while the $N_f = N \\pm 1$ cases are consistent, as\n$N_f$ and $N$ are coprime.

For $N_f< N$, we find that the number of branches of the $\\eta'$\npotential is $\\operatorname{gcd}(N,N_f)$, which is the minimum number allowed\nby the anomaly.

However, the practical\nissues of high hardware cost and power consumption pose great challenges\ntowards the cost-effective implementation of XL-MIMO. To address such\nchallenges, this paper proposes a novel concept called array configuration\ncodebook (ACC), which enables flexible XL-MIMO cost-effectively and improves\nthe system performance compared with conventional antenna selection (AS)\nschemes with limited number of RF chains. Specifically, ACC refers to a set of\npre-designed array configuration codewords, where each codeword specifies the\npositions of activated antenna pixels. Then, flexible XL-MIMO architecture can\nbe enabled via dynamical pixel activation based on the designed ACC, without\nhaving to exhaustively try all possible combinations of the antenna pixels\nactivations. As an illustration, we give a specific codebook design,\nencompassing the classic compact array (CA), uniform sparse array (USA),\nmodular array (MoA), nested array (NA), and co-prime array (CPA), and each\ncodeword is specified by one array configuration parameter. With the designed\nACC, array configuration training is considered for multi-UE communication to\nmaximize the sum rate. To reduce the training overhead of exhaustive scanning,\na two-stage scanning scheme is proposed, including the array- and pixel-level\nscanning. For comparison, the greedy AS scheme is proposed, where the resulting\nincremental SINR expression by activating antenna pixel sequentially is derived\nin closed-form. Subsequently, array configuration training is extended to the\nwireless localization scenario.

Thus, a\nmore effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM\ndedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose\n\\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to\nenhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.\nSpecifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the\nArchitecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for\nSearch Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to\nachieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents\nin both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization\ncapabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.",

Recently, methods that incorporate multimodal content\nfeatures through semantic IDs have achieved promising results. However,\nexisting methods suffer from two critical limitations: 1) intra-modal semantic\ndegradation, where residual-based quantization processes gradually decouple\ndiscrete IDs from original content semantics, leading to semantic drift; and 2)\ninter-modal modeling gaps, where traditional fusion strategies either overlook\nmodal-specific details or fail to capture cross-modal correlations, hindering\ncomprehensive user interest modeling.

In the second stage, to model multimodal interest of users, a\nMulti-Codebook Cross-Attention (MCCA) network is designed to enable the model\nto simultaneously capture modal-specific interests and perceive cross-modal\ncorrelations.

Unlike their odd\ncounterpart, the even isotopes of alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms possess\nsimpler structures and longer-lived transitions, which would relax the field\ncontrol requirements and enhance the frequency stability of the output light.\nHowever, due to the absence of hyper-fine interaction in even isotopes, the\ntransition from the state $^{3}\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ to $^{1}$S$_{0}$ is strictly\nforbidden, leading to a vanishing coupling strength between the cavity mode and\nthe atoms (the state $^{3}\\mathrm{P}_{0}$ as a dark state). In this work, we\nsuggest a superradiant laser scheme by dressing this dark state with a small\nbright component by virtue of a static magnetic field. In contrast to other\nproposals utilizing natural atomic transitions, our dressed-state protocol can\nwork from the crossover regime (coherence in both atoms and photons) to the\nsuperradiant lasing regime (coherence solely in atoms). Specially, by operating\ndeep into the superradiant lasing regime, our scheme witnesses a dramatic\nline-narrowing feature (mHz level) while maintaining its power. Furthermore,\ncompared to the crossover regime, the laser frequency in the superradiant\nlasing regime is more robust against the fluctuations of the cavity length and\nmagnetic field strength.

    "abstract": "Quantum interference (QI) can strongly enhance thermoelectric response, with\nhigher-order \"supernodes\" predicted to yield scalable gains in thermopower and\nefficiency. A central question, however, is whether such features are\nintrinsically more fragile to dephasing. Using $B\\\"uttiker$ voltage-temperature\nprobes, we establish an order-selection rule: the effective near-node order is\nset by the lowest among coherent and probe-assisted channels. Supernodes are\ntherefore fragile in an absolute sense because their transmission is\nparametrically suppressed with order. However, once an incoherent floor\ndominates, the fractional suppression of thermopower, efficiency, and figure of\nmerit becomes universal and order-independent. Illustrating these principles\nwith benzene- and biphenyl-based junction calculations, we show that the\ngeometry of environmental coupling -- through a single orbital or across many\n-- dictates whether coherence is lost by order reduction or by floor building.\nThese results yield general scaling rules for the thermoelectric response of\ninterference nodes under dephasing.",

Additionally, LLMs often suffer from a lack of\ntransparency and are prone to producing hallucinations. To address these\nchallenges, we propose \\textbf{JERR}, a novel framework designed to enhance\nlong-context comprehension via graph-based reasoning in LLMs. JERR integrates\nthree key components: synopsis extraction, graph construction, and relational\nreasoning. First, synopsis is extracted by chunking text strategically,\nallowing the model to summarize and understand information more efficiently.\nSecond, we build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to resolve redundancy, ensuring\nlogical consistency and clarity. Finally, we incorporate Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch (MCTS) to help the model navigate complex reasoning paths, ensuring more\naccurate and interpretable outputs. This framework provides a novel solution\nthat enables LLMs to handle extended contexts and complex reasoning tasks with\nimproved reliability and transparency.

The developed NEP-WH model reproduces\na wide range of lattice and defect properties in tungsten systems, as well as\nhydrogen solubility, with near first-principles accuracy, while retaining the\nefficiency of empirical potentials.

Such outcomes can characterize differences in meaningful patient\nhealth states that are directly relevant to clinical researchers and frequently\nrepresent composite outcomes that include absorbing states such as death. To\ncompare different intervention strategies in clinical trials, the direct use of\nordinal logistic regression models may not be ideal for analyzing ranked\noutcomes due to non-collapsibility, lack of estimation and clarity, or failure\nof the common underlying proportional odds assumption. In this article, we\nfocus on representing the average treatment effect for ordinal outcomes via\nintrinsic pairwise outcome comparisons captured through win estimates, such as\nthe win ratio and win difference. We first develop propensity score weighting\nestimators, including both inverse probability weighting (IPW) and overlap\nweighting (OW), tailored to estimating win parameters. Furthermore, we develop\naugmented weighting estimators that leverage an additional ordinal outcome\nregression to potentially improve efficiency over weighting alone. Leveraging\nthe theory of U-statistics, we establish the asymptotic theory for all\nestimators, and derive closed-form variance estimators to support statistical\ninference. Through extensive simulations we demonstrate the enhanced efficiency\nof the weighted estimators over the unadjusted estimator, with the augmented\nweighting estimators showing a further improvement in efficiency except for\nextreme cases.

    "abstract": "In 1994, Miguel Alcubierre proposed that the well-known special relativistic\nlimitation that particles cannot travel with velocities higher than light speed\ncan be bypassed when such trips are considered globally within specific general\nrelativistic frameworks, using a warped region of spacetime in the shape of a\nbubble that transports particles with mass traveling through spacetime with\nsuperluminal speed. Although initial results indicated this scenario as\nnonphysical, since it would seem to require negative mass-energy density,\nrecent theoretical analyses suggest that such a nonphysical situation may not\nalways be true. This thesis presents newfound solutions for the Einstein field\nequations, considering the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime metrics. The central\npremise is to study the fluid matter as the gravity source, rather than the\nmore common vacuum or negative energy sources, to explore the potential for\ngenerating superluminal velocities, or \\textit{warp speeds}, through a warped\nregion in the spacetime. Such solutions have various matter-energy sources:\ndust particles, perfect fluid, quasi-perfect fluid with anisotropic pressures,\ncharged dust, and a perfect fluid within a cosmological constant spacetime.\n  A connection between some of these solutions featuring shock waves described\nby a Burgers-type equation with a term on the right-hand side of the equation\npurely dependent on time is also shown. This could mean warp drives are closely\nrelated to vacuum energy and possibly have topological effects such as shock\nwaves.",

Two widely used\nmodels for incorporating decoherence in quantum transport are the voltage probe\n(VP), which imposes local charge current conservation, and the\nvoltage-temperature probe (VTP), which also conserves heat current. Although\nthese models are often treated as functionally equivalent, we demonstrate that\nthis equivalence actually exists only under highly symmetric conditions, which\nmay be challenging to achieve experimentally Under asymmetric coupling or\nthermal bias, the VTP respects thermodynamic constraints and enforces\ndecoherence in both charge and heat channels, while the VP instead acts as a\nsource or sink of heat. Strikingly, the VP can fail to model decoherence in the\nheat transport entirely, even with large probe coupling strengths. Using a\nbenzene-based molecular junction as a realistic example, we show that these\neffects significantly impact the predicted heat transport.

Particularly,\nChimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for\nSMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2)\nsynthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars.\nDuring fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing\nformulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators.\nThis design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity.\nNotably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment,\ndramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT\nsolvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43\nconfirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.",

A dataset of 3,264 MRI images,\nincluding glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and non-tumor cases, was\nutilized. The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing, with an\noversampling technique applied to address class imbalance.

Two\nmodels were developed: a binary classification model distinguishing tumor\npresence and a multiclass classification model categorizing tumor types. The\nbinary model achieved 88% accuracy, improving to 89% after data balancing,\nwhile the multiclass model achieved 52% accuracy, increasing to 62% after\noversampling. Despite strong binary classification performance, the multiclass\nmodel faced challenges due to dataset complexity and quantum circuit\nlimitations. These findings suggest that QCNNs hold promise for medical imaging\napplications, particularly in binary classification.

Further, as these\nLLM applications scale, the total size of KV caches becomes excessively large\nand requires both DRAM and SSD for full storage.\n  However, prior work that stores KV caches in DRAM and SSD suffers from high\nloading delays, as most KV cache hits come from SSD, which is slow to load.

In order to prepare EEG signals\nfor machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The\ncurrent naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited\nbiological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.\nWe investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine\nlearning EEG analysis.\n  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that\ncreates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG\ndata and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that\ntypically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable\nsynthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG\nmethod has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying\nit to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG\nwith fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG\nmachine learning pipeline for seizure detection.\n  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure\ndetection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using\na standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and\nrequires fewer segments.\n  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG\ncan be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to\nimprove performance.

    "abstract": "Control crosstalk due to imperfect optical addressing in trapped-ion\nentangling gates results in unwanted entanglement between the target ions and\ntheir neighbors. These errors are highly non-local, making them particularly\ndifficult to correct using error correcting codes. We introduce a method to\ndesign entangling gates that are insensitive to optical crosstalk by\ncontrolling the excitation of the ions' motional modes to engineer an effective\nqubit-qubit coupling matrix that entirely excludes crosstalk-affected ions from\nthe entangling operation. This method requires no knowledge of the crosstalk\nlevel and relies only on optimization of the laser pulse, avoiding the need to\nmodify the optical setup or use additional gate operations. We experimentally\ndemonstrate the method on a three-ion string by performing an entangling gate\nthat is completely insensitive to optical crosstalk.",

    "abstract": "Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational\ncontinuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,\noften overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of\na few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that\nmodels two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:\nWHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural\ncharacteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are\nrepresented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our\nproposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion\nstrategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on\nHit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high\ninterpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for\ndifferent job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)\ndata for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach\nfor 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and\ncomprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of\ncandidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution\nlies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between\ntask alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for\nemployees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical\nimplications.",

    "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHR) contain valuable longitudinal patient-level\ninformation, yet most statistical methods reduce the irregular timing of EHR\ncodes into simple counts, thereby discarding rich temporal structure. Existing\ntemporal models often impose restrictive parametric assumptions or are tailored\nto code level rather than patient-level tasks. We propose the latent factor\npoint process model, which represents code occurrences as a high-dimensional\npoint process whose conditional intensity is driven by a low dimensional latent\nPoisson process. This low-rank structure reflects the clinical reality that\nthousands of codes are governed by a small number of underlying disease\nprocesses, while enabling statistically efficient estimation in high\ndimensions. Building on this model, we introduce the Fourier-Eigen embedding, a\npatient representation constructed from the spectral density matrix of the\nobserved process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that these\nembeddings efficiently capture subgroup-specific temporal patterns for\ndownstream classification and clustering. Simulations and an application to an\nAlzheimer's disease EHR cohort demonstrate the practical advantages of our\napproach in uncovering clinically meaningful heterogeneity.",

Our results show that, while\nthe presence of a nuisance can alter the optimum and upset the optimization\ntrajectory, the classical stochastic gradient algorithm may still converge\nunder appropriate conditions, such as Neyman orthogonality. Moreover, even when\nNeyman orthogonality is not satisfied, we show that an algorithm variant with\napproximately orthogonalized updates (with an approximately orthogonalized\ngradient oracle) may achieve similar convergence rates.

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,\ntheir potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal\nand regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines\nto promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are\ntypically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in\ntranslating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.\n  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\\textbf{G}uideline\n\\textbf{U}pholding Test through \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{R}ole-play and\nJailbreak \\textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize\nguidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM\nadherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of\nguideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby\ntesting whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly\nviolate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses\nthat do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of\n``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that\nprovoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying\npotential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method\nfinally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence\nand highlighting any violations.\n  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,\nincluding Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued\nguidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can\ntransfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its\nusage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.",
