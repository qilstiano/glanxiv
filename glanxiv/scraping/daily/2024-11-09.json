    "abstract": "We analyze the correlation between randomly chosen edge weights on\nneighboring edges in a directed graph. This shared-endpoint correlation\ncontrols the expected organization of randomly drawn edge flows when the flow\non each edge is conditionally independent of the flows on other edges given its\nendpoints. To model different relationships between endpoints and flow, we draw\nedge weights in two stages. First, assign a random description to the vertices\nby sampling random attributes at each vertex. Then, sample a Gaussian process\n(GP) and evaluate it on the pair of endpoints connected by each edge. We model\ndifferent relationships between endpoint attributes and flow by varying the\nkernel associated with the GP. We then relate the expected flow structure to\nthe smoothness class containing functions generated by the GP. We compute the\nexact shared-endpoint correlation for the squared exponential kernel and\nprovide accurate approximations for Mat\\'ern kernels. In addition, we provide\nasymptotics in both smooth and rough limits and isolate three distinct domains\ndistinguished by the regularity of the ensemble of sampled functions. Taken\ntogether, these results demonstrate a consistent effect; smoother functions\nrelating attributes to flow produce more organized flows.",

    "abstract": "Medical brain imaging relies heavily on image registration to accurately\ncurate structural boundaries of brain features for various healthcare\napplications. Deep learning models have shown remarkable performance in image\nregistration in recent years. Still, they often struggle to handle the\ndiversity of 3D brain volumes, challenged by their structural and contrastive\nvariations and their imaging domains. In this work, we present NeuReg, a\nNeuro-inspired 3D image registration architecture with the feature of domain\ninvariance. NeuReg generates domain-agnostic representations of imaging\nfeatures and incorporates a shifting window-based Swin Transformer block as the\nencoder. This enables our model to capture the variations across brain imaging\nmodalities and species. We demonstrate a new benchmark in multi-domain publicly\navailable datasets comprising human and mouse 3D brain volumes. Extensive\nexperiments reveal that our model (NeuReg) outperforms the existing baseline\ndeep learning-based image registration models and provides a high-performance\nboost on cross-domain datasets, where models are trained on 'source-only'\ndomain and tested on completely 'unseen' target domains. Our work establishes a\nnew state-of-the-art for domain-agnostic 3D brain image registration,\nunderpinned by Neuro-inspired Transformer-based architecture.",

    "abstract": "Recent works demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion models as\nunsupervised solvers for inverse imaging problems. Sparse-view computed\ntomography (CT) has greatly benefited from these advancements, achieving\nimproved generalization without reliance on measurement parameters. However,\nthis comes at the cost of potential hallucinations, especially when handling\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data. To ensure reliability, it is essential to study\nOOD detection for CT reconstruction across both clinical and industrial\napplications. This need further extends to enabling the OOD detector to\nfunction effectively as an anomaly inspection tool. In this paper, we explore\nthe use of a diffusion model, trained to capture the target distribution for CT\nreconstruction, as an in-distribution prior. Building on recent research, we\nemploy the model to reconstruct partially diffused input images and assess\nOOD-ness through multiple reconstruction errors. Adapting this approach for\nsparse-view CT requires redefining the notions of ``input'' and\n``reconstruction error''. Here, we use filtered backprojection (FBP)\nreconstructions as input and investigate various definitions of reconstruction\nerror. Our proof-of-concept experiments on the MNIST dataset highlight both\nsuccesses and failures, demonstrating the potential and limitations of\nintegrating such an OOD detector into a CT reconstruction system. Our findings\nsuggest that effective OOD detection can be achieved by comparing measurements\nwith forward-projected reconstructions, provided that reconstructions from\nnoisy FBP inputs are conditioned on the measurements. However, conditioning can\nsometimes lead the OOD detector to inadvertently reconstruct OOD images well.\nTo counter this, we introduce a weighting approach that improves robustness\nagainst highly informative OOD measurements, albeit with a trade-off in\nperformance in certain cases.",

The\nfree-free fluxes from these maps allow extinction-free estimates of the Lyman\ncontinuum rates, masses, and luminosities of the emission regions. 39 of these\nregions meet the minimum Lyman continuum rate to contain at least once SSC, and\n29 of these regions could contain individual SSCs massive enough to test\nspecific theories on star formation and feedback inhibition in SSCs, requiring\nfollow-up observations at higher spatial resolution. The resulting catalog\nprovides sources for future molecular line and infrared studies into the\nproperties of super star cluster formation.",

The UQ framework includes the development of data-driven\nsurrogate models, propagation of parametric uncertainties to the fuel\nregression rate--the primary quantity of interest--and Bayesian calibration of\nthe latent heat of sublimation and a chemical reaction temperature exponent\nusing experimental data. Two surrogate models, a Gaussian Process (GP) and a\nHierarchical Multiscale Surrogate (HMS) were constructed using an ensemble of\n64 simulations generated via Latin Hypercube sampling. HMS is superior for\nprediction demonstrated by cross-validation and able to achieve an error < 15%\nwhen predicting multiscale boundary quantities just from a few far field\ninputs. Subsequent Bayesian calibration of chemical kinetics and fuel response\nparameters against experimental observations showed that the default values\nused in the DNS should be higher to better match measurements. This study\nhighlights the importance of surrogate model selection and parameter\ncalibration in quantifying uncertainty in predictions of fuel regression rates\nin complex combustion systems.",

For\nplanets with a magnetosphere, the embedded magnetic field in the CMEs is\nthought to be the most important parameter to affect planetary mass loss. In\nthis work, we investigate the effect of different magnetic field structures of\nstellar CMEs on the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter with a dipolar magnetosphere.\nWe use a time-dependent 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) atmospheric\nescape model that self-consistently models the outflow from hot Jupiters\nmagnetosphere and its interaction with stellar CMEs. For our study, we consider\nthree configurations of magnetic field embedded in stellar CMEs -- (a)\nnorthward $B_z$ component, (b) southward $B_z$ component, and (c) radial\ncomponent. {We find that both the CMEs with northward $B_z$ component and\nsouthward $B_z$ component increase the planetary mass-loss rate when the CME\narrives from the stellar side, with the mass-loss rate remaining higher for the\nCME with northward $B_z$ component until it arrives at the opposite side.} The\nlargest magnetopause is found for the CME with a southward $B_z$ component when\nthe dipole and the CME magnetic field have the same direction. We also find\nthat during the passage of a CME, the planetary magnetosphere goes through\nthree distinct changes - (1) compressed magnetosphere, (2) enlarged\nmagnetosphere, and (3) relaxed magnetosphere for all three considered CME\nconfigurations. We compute synthetic Ly-$\\alpha$ transits at different times\nduring the passage of the CMEs. The synthetic Ly-$\\alpha$ transit absorption\ngenerally increases when the CME is in interaction with the planet for all\nthree magnetic configurations. The maximum Ly-$\\alpha$ absorption is found for\nthe radial CME case when the magnetosphere is the most compressed.",

Cylinder oscillations in rotation, transverse translation, and streamwise\ntranslation are considered. We utilize phase-reduction analysis, which\nquantifies the phase-sensitivity function of periodic flows, to examine the\nsynchronization properties. Here, we present an ensemble-based framework for\nphase-reduction analysis to handle three-dimensional wakes that are not\nperfectly time-periodic. Based on the phase-sensitivity functions,\nsynchronizability to three types of cylinder oscillations is evaluated. In\nspite of similar trends, we find that phase-sensitivity functions involving\nthree-dimensional wakes are lower in magnitude compared to those of\ntwo-dimensional wakes, which leads to narrower conditions for synchronization\nto weak cylinder oscillations. We unveil that the difference between the\nphase-sensitivity functions of two- and three-dimensional flows is strongly\ncorrelated to the amplitude variation of the three-dimensional flow by the\ncylinder motions. This finding reveals that the cylinder motion modifies the\nthree-dimensionality of the wake as well as the phase of vortex shedding, which\nleads to reduced phase modulation. The synchronization conditions of\nthree-dimensional wakes, predicted by phase-reduction analysis, agree with the\nidentification by parametric studies using direct numerical simulations for\nforced oscillations with small amplitudes.

The explosion velocity field is assumed to be radial but not\nnecessarily spherical, making it possible to model various-shaped bubbles.\nAssuming an explosion center, the magnetic field at the present time is fully\ndetermined by the initial uniform magnetic field, the present-time geometry of\nthe bubble shell, and a radial vector field that encodes the explosion-induced\ndisplacement of matter, from its original location to its present-time\nlocation.

Our analysis, conducted within the extended\nphase-space formalism, reveals that the quasi-fractal correction to black hole\nentropy significantly modifies the equation of state, critical parameters, and\nphase-transition behavior of charged AdS black holes. An increase in the Barrow\nparameter leads to higher critical pressure and temperature, which diverge at\nmaximal deformation. Moreover, while the quasi-fractal structure has a\nnegligible effect on small black holes with low entropy, it clearly influences\nthe thermal evolution of medium and large event horizon black holes.\nAdditionally, we study the impact of quasi-fractal corrections on the\nJoule-Thomson expansion and the phase transition between cooling and heating\nregimes. We also examine the effects of spacetime structure on black hole\nmicrostate density, lifetimes, and temperature detection by different\nobservers, including local, asymptotic, and Unruh detectors. We find that\nspacetime foam increases microstate density and prolongs evaporation lifetimes,\nthus acting as a resistance to black hole evaporation, while local observers\nexperience that the expected Tolman blueshift and Unruh temperatures remain\nunmodified.",

Understanding\nthree-dimensional (3D) spatial rotations can involve verbal descriptions and\nvisual or interactive examples, illustrating how objects change orientation in\n3D space.

In this paper,\nwe have studied generative AI's spatial capabilities of understanding rotations\nof objects utilizing its image and language processing features. We examined\nthe spatial intelligence of the GPT-4 model with vision in understanding\nspatial rotation process with diagrams based on the Revised Purdue Spatial\nVisualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R). Next, we\nincorporated a layer of coordinate system axes on Revised PSVT:R to study the\nvariations in GPT-4's performance. We also examined GPT-4's understanding of 3D\nrotations in Augmented Reality (AR) scenes that visualize spatial rotations of\nan object in 3D space and observed increased accuracy of GPT-4's understanding\nof the rotations by adding supplementary textual information depicting the\nrotation process or mathematical representations of the rotation (e.g.,\nmatrices). The results indicate that while GPT-4 as a major current Generative\nAI model lacks the understanding of a spatial rotation process, it has the\npotential to understand the rotation process with additional information that\ncan be provided by methods such as AR. By combining the potentials in spatial\nintelligence of AI with AR's interactive visualization abilities, we expect to\noffer enhanced guidance for students' spatial learning activities.

Taking advantage of the flexibility of annotative indexing, we also\ndemonstrate a fully dynamic annotative index incorporating support for ACID\nproperties of transactions with hundreds of multiple concurrent readers and\nwriters.",

We subtracted the luminance image from the narrow-band images to leave\nmore or less only line emission in the difference images, and we masked regions\nof the resulting images around stars at an isophotal limit. The difference\nimages exhibit extensive extended structures of ionized gas in the direction of\nthe M81 Group, from known galaxies of the M81 Group, clouds of gas, filamentary\nstructures, and apparent or possible bubbles or shells.

However, applying LLMs to long\ndocument reranking remains computationally expensive and may be ineffective.\nMoreover, the internal behavior of LLMs during document relevance judgment is\nstill underexplored. In this paper, we begin with an in-depth analysis of\ndecoder-only LLM attention patterns and find that several attention heads\nconsistently align with relevance signals, yet this alignment deteriorates as\nirrelevant content increases. Motivated by this observation, we revisit and\nextend the block selection paradigm, introducing KeyB2, a scalable reranking\nframework that combines block pre-selection with powerful decoder-only LLMs.\nKeyB2 generalizes the selection stage to support BM25, cross-encoder, and\nbi-encoder, and adapts LLM to compute fine-grained relevance scores. We further\nintroduce a new bi-encoder strategy that performs strongly and efficiently.\nExtensive experiments on TREC DL 2019/2023 document task, Robust04, and MLDR-zh\ndemonstrate that KeyB2 outperforms baselines including RankLLaMA,\nRankLLaMA-MaxP/AvgP, and KeyB, achieving new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on\nTREC DL 2019 document reranking task.

KRRs can represent complex concepts and\nrelations, and they can query and manipulate information in sophisticated ways.\nUnfortunately, the KRR technology has been hindered by the fact that specifying\nthe requisite knowledge requires skills that most domain experts do not have,\nand professional knowledge engineers are hard to find. Some recent CNL-based\napproaches, such as the Knowledge Authoring Logic Machine (KALM), have shown to\nhave very high accuracy compared to others, and a natural question is to what\nextent the CNL restrictions can be lifted. Besides the CNL restrictions, KALM\nhas limitations in terms of the types of knowledge it can represent. To address\nthese issues, we propose an extension of KALM called KALM for Factual Language\n(KALMF). KALMF uses a neural parser for natural language, MS, to parse what we\ncall factual English sentences, which require little grammar training to use.\nBuilding upon KALMF, we propose KALM for Rules and Actions (KALMR), to\nrepresent and reason with rules and actions. Furthermore, we identify the\nreasons behind the slow speed of KALM and make optimizations to address this\nissue. Our evaluation using multiple benchmarks shows that our approaches\nachieve a high level of correctness on fact and query authoring (95%) and on\nrule authoring (100%). When used for authoring and reasoning with actions, our\napproach achieves more than 99.3% correctness, demonstrating its effectiveness\nin enabling more sophisticated knowledge representation and reasoning. We also\nillustrate the logical reasoning capabilities of our approach by drawing\nattention to the problems faced by the famous AI, ChatGPT.

The primary\nobjective of these guarantees is to ensure system reliability, ensuring that\nthe chosen approach consistently delivers the desired level of accuracy across\nall databases.

    "abstract": "Use of machine learning to perform database operations, such as indexing,\ncardinality estimation, and sorting, is shown to provide substantial\nperformance benefits. However, when datasets change and data distribution\nshifts, empirical results also show performance degradation for learned models,\npossibly to worse than non-learned alternatives. This, together with a lack of\ntheoretical understanding of learned methods undermines their practical\napplicability, since there are no guarantees on how well the models will\nperform after deployment. In this paper, we present the first known theoretical\ncharacterization of the performance of learned models in dynamic datasets, for\nthe aforementioned operations. Our results show novel theoretical\ncharacteristics achievable by learned models and provide bounds on the\nperformance of the models that characterize their advantages over non-learned\nmethods, showing why and when learned models can outperform the alternatives.\nOur analysis develops the distribution learnability framework and novel\ntheoretical tools which build the foundation for the analysis of learned\ndatabase operations in the future.",

Such principles\ntypically include maintaining some degree of anonymity regarding participants'\ndata and/or incident-specific data, adopting non-punitive processes and\nensuring the equitability and fairness of risk sharing.

To illustrate, we\ndemonstrate that the uniform RS rule, a simple mechanism in which risks are\nshared equally, is the only RS rule that satisfies both the reshuffling\nproperty and the source-anonymous contributions property. This straightforward\naxiomatic characterization of the uniform RS rule serves as a foundation for\nexploring similar principles in two broad classes of risk-sharing rules, which\nwe baptize the $q$-proportional RS rules and the $(q_1,q_2)$-based linear RS\nrules, respectively.

TITAN introduces a suite of innovations specifically designed to address\nthe complexities of the modern security landscape, including: (1) a dynamic\nthreat intelligence graph that maps the intricate relationships between\nmillions of entities, incidents, and organizations; (2) real-time update\nmechanisms that automatically decay and prune outdated intel; (3) integration\nof security domain knowledge to bootstrap initial reputation scores; and (4)\nreputation propagation algorithms that uncover hidden threat actor\ninfrastructure. Integrated into Microsoft Unified Security Operations Platform\n(USOP), which is deployed across hundreds of thousands of organizations\nworldwide, TITAN's threat intelligence powers key detection and disruption\ncapabilities. With an impressive average macro-F1 score of 0.89 and a\nprecision-recall AUC of 0.94, TITAN identifies millions of high-risk entities\neach week, enabling a 6x increase in non-file threat intelligence.

To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate\nthe performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular\narchitectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which\ndegrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance.\nBased on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the\nsuppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free\nproxy.

Due to the small and highly varying 2D\nhuman scales, depth ambiguity, and perspective distortion, no existing methods\ncan achieve globally consistent reconstruction with correct reprojection. To\naddress these challenges, we first propose a new concept, Human-scene Virtual\nInteraction Point (HVIP), to convert the complex 3D human localization into\n2D-pixel localization. We then extend it to RCR (Robust Crowd Reconstruction),\nwhich achieves globally consistent reconstruction and stable generalization on\ndifferent camera FoVs without test-time optimization. To perceive humans in\nvarying pixel sizes, we propose an Iterative Ground-aware Cropping to\nautomatically crop the image and then merge the results. To eliminate the\ninfluence of the camera and cropping process during the reconstruction, we\nintroduce a canonical Upright 3D Space and the corresponding Upright 2D Space.\nTo link the canonical space and the camera space, we propose the Upright\nNormalization, which transforms the local crop input into the Upright 2D Space,\nand transforms the output from the Upright 3D Space into the unified camera\nspace.

An example of the former is that,\ncontrary to the liquid-liquid case, the interfacial properties of solids depend\non the lattice orientation.

    "abstract": "While binary merger events have been an active area of study in both\nsimulations and observational work, the formation channels by which a high-mass\nstar extends from Roche lobe overflow (RLO) in a decaying orbit of a black-hole\n(BH) companion to a binary black-hole (BBH) system merits further\ninvestigation. Variable length-scales must be employed to accurately represent\nthe dynamical fluid transfer and morphological development of the primary star\nas it conforms to a diminishing Roche lobe under the runaway influence of the\nproximal BH. We have simulated and evolved binary mass flow under these\nconditions to better identify the key transitional processes from RLO to BBHs.\nWe demonstrate a new methodology to model RLO systems to unprecedented\nresolution simultaneously across the envelope, donor wind, tidal stream, and\naccretion disk regimes without reliance upon previously universal symmetry,\nmass flux, and angular momentum flux assumptions. We have applied this method\nto the semidetached high-mass X-ray binary M33 X-7 in order to provide a direct\ncomparison to recent observations of an RLO candidate system at two overflow\nstates of overfilling factors f = 1.01 and f = 1.1. We found extreme overflow\n(f = 1.1) to be entirely conservative in both mass and angular momentum\ntransport, forming a conical L1 tidal stream of density and deflected angle\ncomparable to existing predictions. This case lies within the unstable mass\ntransfer (MT) regime as recently proposed of M33 X-7. The f = 1.01 case\ndiffered in stream geometry, accretion disk size, and efficiency, demonstrating\nnonconservative stable MT through a ballistic uniform-width stream. The\nnonconservative and stable nature of the f = 1.01 case MT also suggests that\nexisting assumptions of semidetached binaries undergoing RLO may\nmischaracterize their role and distribution as progenitors of BBHs and common\nenvelopes.",

However,\nknowledge of their intrinsic (photo)physical properties and light-matter\ninteractions is often limited, especially with respect to the frequency\ndependent dielectric properties on the relevant timescales of exciton\nseparation and charge generation (fs-ps). By using terahertz-time-domain\nspectroscopy (THz-TDS), we show that the complex permittivity and THz\nconductivity of different polymer materials and graphitic carbon nitrides -\nmelon and poly(heptazine imides) (K-PHI) - can be measured directly and\naccurately in different environmental humidities. Its effects are most strongly\nobserved in the ionic and 2D carbon nitride, K-PHI, where both real\npermittivity and THz conductivity double from dry to humid conditions (~4-8 and\n75-150 S/m, respectively) surpassing the intrinsic dielectric response from\nwater or K-PHI through synergistic effects. Our findings are backed by fs-ps\ntransient absorption spectroscopy (TAS), confirming the impact of humidity on\nlight conversion behaviour on the ps-timescale in K-PHI. We highlight the\nimportance of dielectric property characterization at THz frequencies as\ncritical for understanding photophysical behaviour at exciton or charge\nseparation time scales, especially in the presence of water and hydrated ions,\nwhich may also be beneficial for computation, exploring next generation\nphotocatalysts, electronics or ionotronics.",

    "abstract": "To safely and efficiently solve motion planning problems in multi-agent\nsettings, most approaches attempt to solve a joint optimization that explicitly\naccounts for the responses triggered in other agents. This often results in\nsolutions with an exponential computational complexity, making these methods\nintractable for complex scenarios with many agents. While sequential\npredict-and-plan approaches are more scalable, they tend to perform poorly in\nhighly interactive environments. This paper proposes a method to improve the\ninteractive capabilities of sequential predict-and-plan methods in multi-agent\nnavigation problems by introducing predictability as an optimization objective.\nWe interpret predictability through the use of general prediction models, by\nallowing agents to predict themselves and estimate how they align with these\nexternal predictions. We formally introduce this behavior through the\nfree-energy of the system, which reduces under appropriate bounds to the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between plan and prediction, and use this as a\npenalty for unpredictable trajectories.The proposed interpretation of\npredictability allows agents to more robustly leverage prediction models, and\nfosters a soft social convention that accelerates agreement on coordination\nstrategies without the need of explicit high level control or communication. We\nshow how this predictability-aware planning leads to lower-cost trajectories\nand reduces planning effort in a set of multi-robot problems, including\nautonomous driving experiments with human driver data, where we show that the\nbenefits of considering predictability apply even when only the ego-agent uses\nthis strategy.",

To address these problems, we propose\nSmart-LLaMA, an advanced detection method based on the LLaMA language model.\nFirst, we construct a comprehensive dataset covering four vulnerability types\nwith labels, detailed explanations, and precise vulnerability locations.\nSecond, we introduce Smart Contract-Specific Continual Pre-Training, using raw\nsmart contract data to enable the LLM to learn smart contract syntax and\nsemantics, enhancing their domain adaptability.

Multiple connections introduce complexities in\ndiscovering patterns, where node weights may affect some features more than\nothers. In domains with diverse topics, graph representations illustrate\ninterrelations among features. Pattern discovery within graphs is recognized as\nNP-hard. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are a prominent deep learning\napproach for acquiring meaningful representations by leveraging node\nconnectivity and characteristics. Despite achievements, predicting and\nassigning 9 deterministic classes often involves errors.

By minimizing retrieval requests that yield\nneutral or harmful results, we can effectively reduce both time and\ncomputational costs, while also improving the overall performance of LLMs. This\ninsight motivates us to differentiate between types of questions using certain\nmetrics as indicators, to decrease the retrieval ratio without compromising\nperformance. In our work, we propose a method that is able to identify\ndifferent types of questions from this view by training a Knowledge Boundary\nModel (KBM). Experiments conducted on 11 English and Chinese datasets\nillustrate that the KBM effectively delineates the knowledge boundary,\nsignificantly decreasing the proportion of retrievals required for optimal\nend-to-end performance.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce\nText2CAD, a novel framework that employs stable diffusion models tailored to\nautomate the generation process and efficiently bridge the gap between user\nspecifications in text and functional CAD models. This approach directly\ntranslates the user's textural descriptions into detailed isometric images,\nwhich are then precisely converted into orthographic views, e.g., top, front,\nand side, providing sufficient information to reconstruct 3D CAD models. This\nprocess not only streamlines the creation of CAD models from textual\ndescriptions but also ensures that the resulting models uphold physical and\ndimensional consistency essential for practical engineering applications.

    "abstract": "In learning from aggregate labels, the training data consists of sets or\n\"bags\" of feature-vectors (instances) along with an aggregate label for each\nbag derived from the (usually {0,1}-valued) labels of its instances. In\nlearning from label proportions (LLP), the aggregate label is the average of\nthe bag's instance labels, whereas in multiple instance learning (MIL) it is\nthe OR. The goal is to train an instance-level predictor, typically achieved by\nfitting a model on the training data, in particular one that maximizes the\naccuracy which is the fraction of satisfied bags i.e., those on which the\npredicted labels are consistent with the aggregate label. A weak learner has at\na constant accuracy < 1 on the training bags, while a strong learner's accuracy\ncan be arbitrarily close to 1. We study the problem of using a weak learner on\nsuch training bags with aggregate labels to obtain a strong learner, analogous\nto supervised learning for which boosting algorithms are known. Our first\nresult shows the impossibility of boosting in LLP using weak classifiers of any\naccuracy < 1 by constructing a collection of bags for which such weak learners\n(for any weight assignment) exist, while not admitting any strong learner. A\nvariant of this construction also rules out boosting in MIL for a non-trivial\nrange of weak learner accuracy. In the LLP setting however, we show that a weak\nlearner (with small accuracy) on large enough bags can in fact be used to\nobtain a strong learner for small bags, in polynomial time. We also provide\nmore efficient, sampling based variant of our procedure with probabilistic\nguarantees which are empirically validated on three real and two synthetic\ndatasets. Our work is the first to theoretically study weak to strong learning\nfrom aggregate labels, with an algorithm to achieve the same for LLP, while\nproving the impossibility of boosting for both LLP and MIL.",

    "abstract": "Multi-object tracking (MOT) is dominated by two paradigms:\ntracking-by-detection (TBD) and tracking-by-query (TBQ). While TBD is decoupled\nand efficient, its fragmented association steps and heuristic matching\npipelines often compromise robustness in complex scenarios. TBQ provides\nstronger semantic modeling through end-to-end learning, but suffers from high\ntraining cost and slow inference due to tight coupling between detection and\nassociation. To address these challenges, we propose TBDQ-Net, a unified\ntracking-by-detection-and-query (TBDQ) framework that effectively combines the\nstrengths of both paradigms. Our method efficiently integrates pretrained,\nhigh-performance detectors with an MOT-tailored associator. The associator is\nlightweight and directly fetches information from the inference of detectors,\nenhancing the overall efficiency of the framework. The associator is also\nlearnable, making it essential for fully end-to-end optimization, ensuring\nrobust tracking capabilities. Specifically, the associator comprises two key\nmodules: basic information interaction (BII) for comprehensive semantic\ninteraction, and content-position alignment (CPA) for semantic and positional\nconsistency. TBDQ-Net's effectiveness is extensively demonstrated on\nDanceTrack, SportsMOT and MOT20 benchmarks. As a structurally efficient and\nsemantically robust tracking framework, it outperforms the leading TBD method\nby 6.0 IDF1 points on DanceTrack and achieves at least 37.5% faster inference\nthan prominent TBQ methods.",

    "abstract": "Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is a topic of significant interest in\nquantum gravity and in extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics.\nRecently, new classes of black hole solutions have been proposed, involving\nvector fields and rank-two antisymmetric tensor fields that acquire nontrivial\nvacuum expectation values, resulting in the Bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond (KR)\ngravity models, respectively. These models exhibit novel geometric structures\nand differ in notable ways from standard Einstein gravity. In this study, we\nexamine neutral anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes within the context of LIV\nbackgrounds, focusing on their thermodynamic properties through two distinct\napproaches. The first approach utilizes the free energy landscape framework,\nrevealing substantial modifications to the conventional Hawking-Page phase\ntransition. Specifically, LIV effects can alter the stability regimes of black\nholes and thermal AdS phases, potentially leading to overlapping thermodynamic\nregimes that would otherwise remain distinct. The second approach involves\nthermodynamic Ruppeiner geometry, which provides a window into the\nmicrostructure of black holes via a well-defined scalar curvature. In general,\nLIV effects are negligible for larger black holes, which behave like an ideal\ngas with no significant interactions among their constituents. However, at\nshorter length scales, the presence of LIV can induce multiple stable and\nunstable phase transitions, depending on the specific gravity model and the\nmagnitude of LIV effects considered. While Bumblebee and Kalb-Ramond gravity\nshare several similarities, we identify distinctive signatures arising from\ntheir underlying physical mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Biomimetic and compliant robotic hands offer the potential for human-like\ndexterity, but controlling them is challenging due to high dimensionality,\ncomplex contact interactions, and uncertainties in state estimation.\nSampling-based model predictive control (MPC), using a physics simulator as the\ndynamics model, is a promising approach for generating contact-rich behavior.\nHowever, sampling-based MPC has yet to be evaluated on physical (non-simulated)\nrobotic hands, particularly on compliant hands with state uncertainties. We\npresent the first successful demonstration of in-hand manipulation on a\nphysical biomimetic tendon-driven robot hand using sampling-based MPC. While\nsampling-based MPC does not require lengthy training cycles like reinforcement\nlearning approaches, it still necessitates adapting the task-specific objective\nfunction to ensure robust behavior execution on physical hardware. To adapt the\nobjective function, we integrate a visual language model (VLM) with a real-time\noptimizer (MuJoCo MPC). We provide the VLM with a high-level human language\ndescription of the task and a video of the hand's current behavior. The VLM\ngradually adapts the objective function, allowing for efficient behavior\ngeneration, with each iteration taking less than two minutes. We show the\nfeasibility of ball rolling, flipping, and catching using both simulated and\nphysical robot hands. Our results demonstrate that sampling-based MPC is a\npromising approach for generating dexterous manipulation skills on biomimetic\nhands without extensive training cycles.",

However, the pre-installed infrastructures suffer from\ninflexibilities and high maintenance costs. This poses an interesting problem\nof how to develop a drift-free localization system without using the\npre-installed infrastructures. In this paper, an infrastructure-free and\ndrift-free localization system is proposed using the ambient magnetic field\n(MF) information, namely IDF-MFL. IDF-MFL is infrastructure-free thanks to the\nhigh distinctiveness of the ambient MF information produced by inherent\nferromagnetic objects in the environment, such as steel and reinforced concrete\nstructures of buildings, and underground pipelines. The MF-based localization\nproblem is defined as a stochastic optimization problem with the consideration\nof the non-Gaussian heavy-tailed noise introduced by MF measurement outliers\n(caused by dynamic ferromagnetic objects), and an outlier-robust state\nestimation algorithm is derived to find the optimal distribution of robot state\nthat makes the expectation of MF matching cost achieves its lower bound. The\nproposed method is evaluated in multiple scenarios, including experiments on\nhigh-fidelity simulation, and real-world environments. The results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method can achieve high-accuracy, reliable, and real-time\nlocalization without any pre-installed infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "This study numerically investigates the influence of the taper on the\nflow-induced vibrations of an elastically mounted circular cylinder under\nVortex-induced vibrations. The dynamic response of three different taper ratios\ndefined as 12 (highly tapered cylinder), 20 (medium tapered cylinder), and 40\n(low tapered cylinder))is studied at a fixed Reynolds number, defined based on\nthe averaged cylinder diameter, of 150. The amplitude and frequency response of\nthe tapered cylinder is characterized by a low mass ratio (defined as the ratio\nof the total oscillating mass to the displaced fluid mass) = 2 over the wide\nrange of reduced velocity covering the full amplitude-response spectrum (based\non the oscillation amplitude) of the VIV. The results show the existence of\ndifference in the spanwise shedding of vortices owing to the poor spanwise\npressure correlation. The flow field analysis in the wake of the oscillating\ncylinder reveals the dominance of the three-dimensional structures in the wake\n(near the top end with the larger diameter) behind the cylinder with the\nincrease in the taper ratio (even at such low where the uniform cylinder\nexhibits the two-dimensional wake). Also, the tapered cylinder exhibits a wide\nrange of frequency synchronization (i.e. wide lock-in area) compared to the\nuniform cylinder. Tapering the cylinder results in the shift of the peak of the\nmax oscillation amplitude or, in turn, the shift in the transitioning of the\nresponse branches. Further, force decomposition, energy transfer, and phase\ndynamics are also discussed for the taper cylinders.",

The present study\ndiscusses the complete three-dimensional overview of the same columnar vortex.\nThe meridional swirl and the axial transport of vorticity deform the shape of\nthe core cross-sections in different lengths of the column.

Recently, we showed that this is a van der\nWaals-type fluid for Kerr and especially for Johannsen-Psaltis black holes.\nHere, we use the paradigm to study the properties of various black holes in\ndifferent dimensions to test the predictive capacity of effective theory.

For asymptotically safe quantum-corrected black holes, the\nparadigm detects the final state of evaporation, i.e., a remnant with a correct\nvalue for the mass that still has an event horizon.

Given that rotation is responsible for the breakup of the bosonic\ncloud, we investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics by abruptly changing the\nrotation frequency. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of trapped\nBose-Einstein condensates in both symmetric and asymmetric anharmonic\npotentials under different rotation quench scenarios. In the rotationally\nsymmetric trap, angular momentum is a good quantum number. This makes it\nchallenging to exchange angular momentum within the system; hence, a rotation\nquench does practically not impact the density distribution. In contrast, the\nabsence of angular momentum conservation in asymmetric traps results in more\ncomplex dynamics. This allows rotation quenches to either inject into or\nextract angular momentum from the system. We observe and analyze these\nintricate dynamics both for the mean-field condensed and the many-body\nfragmented systems. The dynamical evolution of the condensed system and the\nfragmented system exhibits similarities in several observables during small\nrotation quenches. However, these similarities diverge notably for larger\nquenches. Additionally, we investigate the formation and the impact of the\nvortices on the angular momentum dynamics of the evolving split density.

Therefore, data\ncompression is essential for meteorological research, but an efficient\ncompression scheme capable of keeping high accuracy with high compressibility\nis still lacking. As an emerging technique, Implicit Neural Representation\n(INR) has recently acquired impressive momentum and demonstrates high promise\nfor compressing diverse natural data. However, the INR-based compression\nencounters a bottleneck due to the sophisticated spatio-temporal properties and\nvariability. To address this issue, we propose Hierarchical Harmonic\ndecomposition implicit neural compression (HiHa) for atmospheric data. HiHa\nfirstly segments the data into multi-frequency signals through decomposition of\nmultiple complex harmonic, and then tackles each harmonic respectively with a\nfrequency-based hierarchical compression module consisting of sparse storage,\nmulti-scale INR and iterative decomposition sub-modules. We additionally design\na temporal residual compression module to accelerate compression by utilizing\ntemporal continuity. Experiments depict that HiHa outperforms both mainstream\ncompressors and other INR-based methods in both compression fidelity and\ncapabilities, and also demonstrate that using compressed data in existing\ndata-driven models can achieve the same accuracy as raw data.",

We design an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret with\nrespect to an optimal signaling scheme, and we also provide a collection of\nlower bounds showing that the guarantees of such an algorithm are tight. Our\nalgorithm works by searching a suitable space of signaling schemes in order to\nlearn receiver's best responses. To do this, we leverage a non-standard\nrepresentation of signaling schemes that allows to cleverly overcome the\nchallenge of not knowing anything about the prior over states of nature and\nreceiver's utilities. Finally, our results also allow to derive lower/upper\nbounds on the sample complexity of learning signaling schemes in a related\nBayesian persuasion PAC-learning problem.",

This is because, as\norganisations move more of their applications and data to the cloud, the old\nborders-based security model that many implemented are inadequate, therefore a\nmodel that has a trust no one, verify everything approach is required. This\npaper analyzes the core principles of ZTS, including micro-segmentation, least\nprivileged access, and continuous monitoring, while critically examining four\nmajor controversies: scalability issues, Economics, Integration issues with\nexisting systems, and Compliance to legal requirements. In this paper, having\nreviewed the existing literature in the field and various implementation cases,\nthe main barriers to implementing zero trust security were outlined, including\nthe dimensions of decreased performance in large-scale production and the need\nfor major upfront investments that can be difficult for small companies to meet\neffectively. This research shows that there is no clear correlation between\nsecurity effectiveness and operational efficiency: while organisations\nexperience up to 40% decrease of security incidents after implementation, they\nnote first negative impacts on performance. This study also shows that to\nsupport ZTS there is a need to address the context as the economics and\noperations of ZTS differ in strengths depending on the size of the\norganizations and the infrastructures. Some of these are: performance\nenhancement and optimizations, economic optimization, architectural blend, and\nprivacy-preserving technologies. This review enriches the existing literature\non cloud security by presenting both the theoretical framework of ZTS and the\nobserved issues, and provides suggestions useful for future research and\npractice in the construction of the cloud security architecture.",

Wave phenomena are widespread in many branches of\nphysics and chemistry, such as optics, gravitation, quantum mechanics, chemical\nwaves and often arise from instantaneous sources represented by Schwartz\ndistributions f. Hence, there is a need to study the Cauchy problem in the\nspace of generalised functions. Specifically, it has been proven that the\ninstantaneous source f can always be represented as an appropriate sum of\nsingle point like sources. Under this hypothesis, each wave equation with an\ninstantaneous source f remains associated with an equation with a point-like\nsource represented by a Dirac delta function. The solution to the associated\nequation is an elementary perturbation that propagates in spacetime, defined as\nthe fundamental solution. We proved that the solution to a wave equation with\nsource f is given by the convolution product between one of the fundamental\nsolutions and the generalised function f representing the instantaneous source.\nWe investigated the physical and mathematical properties of three dimensional,\ntwo dimensional, and one dimensional fundamental solutions. Notably, we proved\nthat the three-dimensional solution described diffraction phenomena, whereas\nthe other two described wave diffusion phenomena. Furthermore, we demonstrated\nthat the transition from a diffractive to a diffusive regime occurs through the\ncontinuation of an ansatz generalised function.

    "abstract": "Context. Cosmic dust is ubiquitous in astrophysical environments, where it\nsignificantly influences the chemistry and the spectra. Dust grains are likely\nto grow through the accretion of atoms and molecules from the gas-phase onto\nthem. Despite their importance, only a few studies compute sticking\ncoefficients for relevant temperatures and species, and their direct impact on\ngrain growth. Overall, the formation of dust and its growth are processes not\nwell understood. Aims. To calculate sticking coefficients, binding energies,\nand grain growth rates over a wide range of temperatures, for various gas\nspecies interacting with carbonaceous dust grains. Methods. We perform\nmolecular dynamics simulations with a reactive force field algorithm to compute\naccurate sticking coefficients and obtain binding energies. The results are\nincluded in an astrophysical model of nucleation regions to study dust growth.\nResults. We present, for the first time, sticking coefficients of H, H2, C, O,\nand CO on amorphous carbon structures for temperatures ranging from 50 K to\n2250 K. In addition, we estimate the binding energies of H, C, and O in\ncarbonaceous dust to calculate the thermal desorption rates. Combining\naccretion and desorption allows us to determine an effective accretion rate and\nsublimation temperature for carbonaceous dust. Conclusions. We find that\nsticking coefficients can differ substantially from what is commonly used in\nastrophysical models and this gives new insight on carbonaceous dust grain\ngrowth via accretion in dust-forming regions.",

    "abstract": "Although misinformation tends to spread online, it can have serious\nreal-world consequences. In order to develop automated tools to detect and\nmitigate the impact of misinformation, researchers must leverage algorithms\nthat can adapt to the modality (text, images and video), the source, and the\ncontent of the false information. However, these characteristics tend to change\ndynamically across time, making it challenging to develop robust algorithms to\nfight misinformation spread. Therefore, this paper uses natural language\nprocessing to find common characteristics of political misinformation over a\ntwelve year period. The results show that misinformation has increased\ndramatically in recent years and that it has increasingly started to be shared\nfrom sources with primary information modalities of text and images (e.g.,\nFacebook and Instagram), although video sharing sources containing\nmisinformation are starting to increase (e.g., TikTok). Moreover, it was\ndiscovered that statements expressing misinformation contain more negative\nsentiment than accurate information. However, the sentiment associated with\nboth accurate and inaccurate information has trended downward, indicating a\ngenerally more negative tone in political statements across time. Finally,\nrecurring misinformation categories were uncovered that occur over multiple\nyears, which may imply that people tend to share inaccurate statements around\ninformation they fear or don't understand (Science and Medicine, Crime,\nReligion), impacts them directly (Policy, Election Integrity, Economic) or\nPublic Figures who are salient in their daily lives. Together, it is hoped that\nthese insights will assist researchers in developing algorithms that are\ntemporally invariant and capable of detecting and mitigating misinformation\nacross time.",

The probability that different\ngenerative AI models produced disinformation when given adversarial prompts was\nevaluated, in addition to the associated harm.

Given that the RIS\naids with communication and sensing tasks, this paper introduces new\ninterfering paths that can overwhelm the PR with unnecessarily high power,\nnamely the path interference (PI), \\textit{which is itself a combination of two\ninterfering paths, the direct path interference (DPI) and the reflected path\ninterference (RPI)}. For this, we formulate an optimization framework that\nallows the system to carry on with its ISAC tasks, through analog space-time\nbeamforming at the sensing unit, in collaboration with RIS phase shift and\nstatistical transmit covariance matrix optimization, while minimizing the PI\npower. As the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we tailor a\nblock-cyclic coordinate descent (BCCD) method to decouple the non-convex\nsub-problem from the convex one.

Despite its established importance,\nseveral studies suggested that the mechanical mode of contraction, such as\nisovolumetric or ejecting contractions, may affect the ESPVr, challenging the\ntraditional notion of a single, consistent relationship. Furthermore, it\nremains unclear whether the observed effects of ejection on force generation\nare inherent to the ventricular chamber itself or are a fundamental property of\nthe myocardial tissue, with the underlying mechanisms remaining poorly\nunderstood. We investigated these aspects by using a multiscale in silico model\nthat allowed us to elucidate the links between subcellular mechanisms and\norgan-level function. Simulations of ejecting and isovolumetric beats with\ndifferent preload and afterload resistance were performed by modulating calcium\nand cross-bridge kinetics.

Isolated tissue\nsimulations suggest that these phenomena are intrinsic to the myocardial\ntissue, rather than properties of the ventricular chamber.

RecSAE does not alter original models during interpretation and\nalso enables targeted de-biasing to models based on interpreted results.\nSpecifically, RecSAE operates in three steps: First, it probes activations\nbefore the prediction layer to capture internal representations. Next, the\nRecSAE module is trained on these activations with a larger latent space and\nsparsity constraints, making the RecSAE latents more mono-semantic than the\noriginal model activations. Thirdly, RecSAE utilizes a language model to\nconstruct concept descriptions with confidence scores based on the\nrelationships between latent activations and recommendation outputs.\nExperiments on three types of models (general, graph-based, and sequential)\nwith three widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of RecSAE framework. The interpreted concepts are further\nvalidated by human experts, showing strong alignment with human perception.\nOverall, RecSAE serves as a novel step in both model-level interpretations to\nvarious types of recommenders without affecting their functions and offering\nthe potential for targeted tuning of models.",

However, as DG penetration\nrates rise, spatial energy imbalances become increasingly significant,\nnecessitating the integration of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading within the\nshared ESS framework. Two key challenges emerge in this context: the absence of\neffective mechanisms and the greater difficulty for privacy protection due to\nincreased data communication. This research proposes a capacity renting\nframework for shared ESS considering P2P energy trading of prosumers. In the\nproposed framework, prosumers can participate in P2P energy trading and rent\ncapacities from shared ESS. A generalized Nash game is formulated to model the\ntrading process and the competitive interactions among prosumers, and the\nvariational equilibrium of the game is proved to be equivalent to the optimal\nsolution of a quadratic programming (QP) problem. To address the privacy\nprotection concern, the problem is solved using the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) with the Paillier cryptosystem. Finally, numerical\nsimulations demonstrate the impact of P2P energy trading on the shared ESS\nframework and validate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving\nalgorithm.",

In\nparticular, understanding the altitude-dependent behavior of spectrum occupancy\nin cellular networks, which could be used in the future for enabling beyond\nvisual line of sight (BVLOS) UAV connectivity, is critical. While there are\nexisting models for characterizing altitude-dependent interference in the\nliterature, they are not validated with data and need to be compared with\nreal-world measurements. To address these gaps, in this paper, we conduct\ncellular spectrum occupancy measurements at various sub-6 GHz bands for\naltitudes up to 300 meters, in both urban and rural environments. To model the\nspectrum occupancy measurements, we introduce two different approaches: a\ntheoretical model utilizing stochastic geometry with altitude-dependent factors\n(SOSGAD), and a ray-tracing model tailored to site-specific line of sight (LOS)\nand non-LOS scenarios. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of the SOSGAD model\nas the UAV altitude increases. Through comparative analysis, we assess the\neffectiveness of the SOSGAD and ray-tracing models for characterizing actual\nspectrum occupancy as a function of altitude. Our results show that the\nproposed SOSGAD model can be tuned to closely characterize the real-world\nspectrum occupancy behavior as the UAV altitude increases.",

Consequently,\nautomation of SL in foundational verification relies heavily on ad-hoc\nheuristics that lack a systematic meta-theory and face scalability issues. To\nmitigate the gap, we propose a theory to specify SL predicates using abstract\nalgebras including functors, homomorphisms, and modules over rings. Based on\nthis theory, we develop a generic SL automation algorithm to reason about any\ndata structures that can be characterized by these algebras. In addition, we\nalso present algorithms for automatically instantiating the algebraic models to\nreal data structures. The instantiation reuses the algebraic models of\ncomponent structures and preserves their data abstractions. Case studies on\nformalized imperative semantics show our algorithm can instantiate the\nalgebraic models automatically for a variety of complex data structures.\nExperimental results indicate the automatically instantiated reasoners from our\ngeneric theory show similar results to the state-of-the-art systems made of\nspecifically crafted reasoning rules.

These are\nexceptional classes of 3d theories, which are expected to support rational and\n$C_2$-cofinite chiral algebras on their boundary. We compare and contrast our\nresults with Zagier's and comment on a possible generalization of Nahm's\nconjecture.",

    "abstract": "Portfolio diversification, traditionally measured through asset correlations\nand volatilitybased metrics, is fundamental to managing financial risk.\nHowever, existing diversification metrics often overlook non-numerical\nrelationships between assets that can impact portfolio stability, particularly\nduring market stresses. This paper introduces the lexical ratio (LR), a novel\nmetric that leverages textual data to capture diversification dimensions absent\nin standard approaches. By treating each asset as a unique document composed of\nsectorspecific and financial keywords, the LR evaluates portfolio\ndiversification by distributing these terms across assets, incorporating\nentropy-based insights from information theory. We thoroughly analyze LR's\nproperties, including scale invariance, concavity, and maximality,\ndemonstrating its theoretical robustness and ability to enhance risk-adjusted\nportfolio returns. Using empirical tests on S&P 500 portfolios, we compare LR's\nperformance to established metrics such as Markowitz's volatility-based\nmeasures and diversification ratios. Our tests reveal LR's superiority in\noptimizing portfolio returns, especially under varied market conditions. Our\nfindings show that LR aligns with conventional metrics and captures unique\ndiversification aspects, suggesting it is a viable tool for portfolio managers.",

Mobile apps have distinct\ncharacteristics with respect to CI/CD practices, such as testing on various\nemulators and deploying to app stores. However, little is known about the\nchallenges and added value of adopting CI/CD in mobile apps and how developers\nmaintain such a practice. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study on CI/CD\npractices in 2,557 Android apps adopting four popular CI/CD services, namely\nGitHub Actions, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD. We also compare our\nfindings with those reported in prior research on general CI/CD practices to\nsituate them within broader trends. We observe a lack of commonality and\nstandardization across CI/CD services and Android apps, leading to complex YML\nconfigurations and associated maintenance efforts. We also observe that CI/CD\nconfigurations focus primarily on the build setup, with around half of the\nprojects performing standard testing and only 9% incorporating deployment. In\naddition, we find that CI/CD configurations are changed bi-monthly on average,\nwith frequent maintenance correlating with active issue tracking, project\nsize/age, and community engagement.

    "abstract": "In standard RL, a learner attempts to learn an optimal policy for a Markov\nDecision Process whose structure (e.g. state space) is known. In online model\nselection, a learner attempts to learn an optimal policy for an MDP knowing\nonly that it belongs to one of $M >1$ model classes of varying complexity.\nRecent results have shown that this can be feasibly accomplished in episodic\nonline RL. In this work, we propose $\\mathsf{MRBEAR}$, an online model\nselection algorithm for the average reward RL setting. The regret of the\nalgorithm is in $\\tilde O(M C_{m^*}^2 \\mathsf{B}_{m^*}(T,\\delta))$ where\n$C_{m^*}$ represents the complexity of the simplest well-specified model class\nand $\\mathsf{B}_{m^*}(T,\\delta)$ is its corresponding regret bound. This result\nshows that in average reward RL, like the episodic online RL, the additional\ncost of model selection scales only linearly in $M$, the number of model\nclasses. We apply $\\mathsf{MRBEAR}$ to the interaction between a learner and an\nopponent in a two-player simultaneous general-sum repeated game, where the\nopponent follows a fixed unknown limited memory strategy. The learner's goal is\nto maximize its utility without knowing the opponent's utility function. The\ninteraction is over $T$ rounds with no episode or discounting which leads us to\nmeasure the learner's performance by average reward regret. In this\napplication, our algorithm enjoys an opponent-complexity-dependent regret in\n$\\tilde O(M(\\mathsf{sp}(h^*) B^{m^*} A^{m^*+1})^{\\frac{3}{2}} \\sqrt{T})$, where\n$m^*\\le M$ is the unknown memory limit of the opponent, $\\mathsf{sp}(h^*)$ is\nthe unknown span of optimal bias induced by the opponent, and $A$ and $B$ are\nthe number of actions for the learner and opponent respectively. We also show\nthat the exponential dependency on $m^*$ is inevitable by proving a lower bound\non the learner's regret.",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for online recruitment markets have the\npotential to significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of job\nplacements and even promote fairness or inclusive hiring practices. Neglecting\nDiversity and Inclusion (D&I) in these systems, however, can perpetuate biases,\nleading to unfair hiring practices and decreased workplace diversity, while\nexposing organisations to legal and reputational risks. Despite the\nacknowledged importance of D&I in AI, there is a gap in research on effectively\nimplementing D&I guidelines in real-world recruitment systems. Challenges\ninclude a lack of awareness and framework for operationalising D&I in a\ncost-effective, context-sensitive manner. This study aims to investigate the\npractical application of D&I guidelines in AI-driven online job-seeking\nsystems, specifically exploring how these principles can be operationalised to\ncreate more inclusive recruitment processes. We conducted a co-design workshop\nwith a large multinational recruitment company focusing on two AI-driven\nrecruitment use cases. User stories and personas were applied to evaluate the\nimpacts of AI on diverse stakeholders. Follow-up interviews were conducted to\nassess the workshop's long-term effects on participants' awareness and\napplication of D&I principles. The co-design workshop successfully increased\nparticipants' understanding of D&I in AI. However, translating awareness into\noperational practice posed challenges, particularly in balancing D&I with\nbusiness goals. The results suggest developing tailored D&I guidelines and\nongoing support to ensure the effective adoption of inclusive AI practices.",

    "abstract": "Stock price prediction is of significant importance in quantitative\ninvestment. Existing approaches encounter two primary issues: First, they often\noverlook the crucial role of capturing short-term stock fluctuations for\npredicting high-volatility returns. Second, mainstream methods, relying on\ngraphs or attention mechanisms, inadequately explore the temporal relationships\namong stocks, often blurring distinctions in their characteristics over time\nand the causal relationships before and after. However, the high volatility of\nstocks and the intricate market correlations are crucial to accurately\npredicting stock prices. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-branch\nFramework of Fluctuation and Trend (DFT), which decomposes stocks into trend\nand fluctuation components. By employing a carefully design decomposition\nmodule, DFT effectively extracts short-term fluctuations and trend information\nfrom stocks while explicitly modeling temporal variations and causal\ncorrelations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that DFT outperforms\nexisting methods across multiple metrics, including a 300% improvement in\nranking metrics and a 400% improvement in portfolio-based indicators. Through\ndetailed experiments, we provide valuable insights into different roles of\ntrends and fluctuations in stock price prediction.",

    "abstract": "Photonic crystals (PhCs) are periodic dielectric structures that exhibit\nunique electromagnetic properties, such as the creation of band gaps where\nelectromagnetic wave propagation is inhibited. Accurately predicting dispersion\nrelations, which describe the frequency and direction of wave propagation, is\nvital for designing innovative photonic devices. However, traditional numerical\nmethods, like the Finite Element Method (FEM), can encounter significant\ncomputational challenges due to the multiple scales present in photonic\ncrystals, especially when calculating band structures across the entire\nBrillouin zone. To address this, we propose a supervised learning approach\nutilizing U-Net, along with transfer learning and Super-Resolution techniques,\nto forecast dispersion relations for 2D PhCs. Our model reduces computational\nexpenses by producing high-resolution band structures from low-resolution data,\neliminating the necessity for fine meshes throughout the Brillouin zone. The\nU-Net architecture enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple band\nfunctions, enhancing efficiency and accuracy compared to existing methods that\nhandle each band function independently. Our findings demonstrate that the\nproposed model achieves high accuracy in predicting the initial band functions\nof 2D PhCs, while also significantly enhancing computational efficiency. This\namalgamation of data-driven and traditional numerical techniques provides a\nrobust framework for expediting the design and optimization of photonic\ncrystals.

AI NWP\nmodels outperform traditional physics-based systems, such as the Integrated\nForecast System (IFS), across several global metrics while requiring fewer\ncomputational resources. However, existing AI NWP models face limitations\nrelated to training datasets and timestep choices, often resulting in artifacts\nthat reduce model performance. To address these challenges, we introduce the\nCommunity Research Earth Digital Intelligence Twin (CREDIT) framework,\ndeveloped at NSF NCAR.

It offers an end-to-end pipeline for data\npreprocessing, model training, and evaluation, democratizing access to advanced\nAI NWP capabilities. We demonstrate CREDIT's potential through WXFormer, a\nnovel deterministic vision transformer designed to predict atmospheric states\nautoregressively, addressing common AI NWP issues like compounding error growth\nwith techniques such as spectral normalization, padding, and multi-step\ntraining. Additionally, to illustrate CREDIT's flexibility and state-of-the-art\nmodel comparisons, we train the FUXI architecture within this framework. Our\nfindings show that both FUXI and WXFormer, trained on six-hourly ERA5 hybrid\nsigma-pressure levels, generally outperform IFS HRES in 10-day forecasts,\noffering potential improvements in efficiency and forecast accuracy.

On the one hand,\nlarge-scale ML requires massive information exchange between clients and\nserver(s). On the other hand, these clients have limited battery and\ncomputation powers that are often dedicated to operational computations. Split\nfederated learning (SFL) is emerging as a potential solution to mitigate these\nchallenges, by splitting the ML model into client-side and server-side model\nblocks, where only the client-side block is trained on the client device.\nHowever, practical applications require personalized models that are suitable\nfor the client's personal task. Motivated by this, we propose a personalized\nhierarchical split federated learning (PHSFL) algorithm that is specially\ndesigned to achieve better personalization performance. More specially, owing\nto the fact that regardless of the severity of the statistical data\ndistributions across the clients, many of the features have similar attributes,\nwe only train the body part of the federated learning (FL) model while keeping\nthe (randomly initialized) classifier frozen during the training phase. We\nfirst perform extensive theoretical analysis to understand the impact of model\nsplitting and hierarchical model aggregations on the global model. Once the\nglobal model is trained, we fine-tune each client classifier to obtain the\npersonalized models.

    "abstract": "Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum\nHall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these\nemissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they\ninfluence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK)\nin a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\\rm cm^2$) of\ntwo-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show\nsaturation of the transition width $\\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave\nfrequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in\nmost experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is\nless than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or higher and for system sizes of\n$10^{-3}\\rm cm^2$ or smaller.

This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has\nalso been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying\nsizes. These unexpected results are caused by axion microwaves. The saturation\nfrequency $f_s=m_a/2\\pi$ of $\\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\\simeq\n10^{-5}$eV. By comparing the axion effect with thermal effect on the width\n$\\Delta B$, we have shown the dominance of the axion effect over thermal effect\nat low temperature less than $50$mK. The dominance of the axion effect is\nattributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to\nthe square of the number of electrons involved.",

By stratifying errors based on context sufficiency, we find that\nlarger models with higher baseline performance (Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT 4o, Claude\n3.5) excel at answering queries when the context is sufficient, but often\noutput incorrect answers instead of abstaining when the context is not. On the\nother hand, smaller models with lower baseline performance (Mistral 3, Gemma 2)\nhallucinate or abstain often, even with sufficient context. We further\ncategorize cases when the context is useful, and improves accuracy, even though\nit does not fully answer the query and the model errs without the context.\nBuilding on our findings, we explore ways to reduce hallucinations in RAG\nsystems, including a new selective generation method that leverages sufficient\ncontext information for guided abstention. Our method improves the fraction of\ncorrect answers among times where the model responds by 2--10\\% for Gemini,\nGPT, and Gemma.

    "abstract": "DNA minicircles are closed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragments that have\nbeen demonstrated to be an important experimental tool to understand\nsupercoiled, or stressed, DNA mechanics, such as nucleosome positioning and\nDNA-protein interactions. Specific minicircles can be simulated using Molecular\nDynamics (MD) simulation. However, the enormous sequence space makes it\nunfeasible to exhaustively explore the sequence-dependent mechanics of DNA\nminicircles using either experiment or MD. For linear fragments, the cgNA+\nmodel, a computationally efficient sequence-dependent coarse-grained model\nusing enhanced Curves+ internal coordinates (rigid base plus rigid phosphate)\nof double-stranded nucleic acids (dsNAs), predicts highly accurate nonlocal\nsequence-dependent equilibrium distributions for an arbitrary sequence when\ncompared with MD simulations. This article addresses the problem of modeling\nsequence-dependent topologically closed and, therefore, stressed fragments of\ndsDNA. We introduce cgNA+min, a computational approach within the cgNA+\nframework, which extends the cgNA+ model applicability to compute the\nsequence-dependent energy minimising configurations of covalently closed dsDNA\nminicircles of various lengths and linking numbers (Lk). The main idea is to\nderive the appropriate chain rule to express the cgNA+ energy in absolute\ncoordinates involving quaternions where the closure condition is simple to\nhandle. We also present a semi-analytic method for efficiently computing\nsequence-dependent initial minicircles having arbitrary Lk and length. For\ndifferent classes and lengths of sequences, we demonstrate that the dsDNA\nminicircle energies computed using cgNA+min agree well with the energies\napproximated from experimentally measured J-factor values. Finally, we present\nthe minicircle shape, energy, and multiplicity of Lk for more than 120K random\nDNA sequences of different lengths.",

To\ntackle this optimization challenge, this paper introduces a deployable\n\\textbf{CR}op Management system \\textbf{O}ver all \\textbf{P}ossible\n\\textbf{S}tate availabilities (CROPS). CROPS employs a language model (LM) as a\nreinforcement learning (RL) agent to explore optimal management strategies\nwithin the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop\nsimulations. A distinguishing feature of this system is that the states used\nfor decision-making are partially observed through random masking.\nConsequently, the RL agent is tasked with two primary objectives: optimizing\nmanagement policies and inferring masked states. This approach significantly\nenhances the RL agent's robustness and adaptability across various real-world\nagricultural scenarios. Extensive experiments on maize crops in Florida, USA,\nand Zaragoza, Spain, validate the effectiveness of CROPS. Not only did CROPS\nachieve State-of-the-Art (SOTA) results across various evaluation metrics such\nas production, profit, and sustainability, but the trained management policies\nare also immediately deployable in over of ten millions of real-world contexts.\nFurthermore, the pre-trained policies possess a noise resilience property,\nwhich enables them to minimize potential sensor biases, ensuring robustness and\ngeneralizability. Finally, unlike previous methods, the strength of CROPS lies\nin its unified and elegant structure, which eliminates the need for pre-defined\nstates or multi-stage training. These advancements highlight the potential of\nCROPS in revolutionizing agricultural practices.",

    "abstract": "We apply MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm for the location\nreconstruction of a set of {two-dimensional circle-like} small inhomogeneities\nin the limited-aperture inverse scattering problem. Compared with the full- or\nlimited-view inverse scattering problem, the collected multi-static response\n(MSR) matrix is no more symmetric (thus not Hermitian), and therefore, it is\ndifficult to define the projection operator onto the noise subspace through the\ntraditional approach. With the help of an asymptotic expansion formula in the\npresence of small inhomogeneities and the structure of the MSR-matrix singular\nvector associated with nonzero singular values, we define an alternative\nprojection operator onto the noise subspace and the corresponding MUSIC imaging\nfunction. To demonstrate the feasibility of the designed MUSIC, we show that\nthe imaging function can be expressed by an infinite series of integer-order\nBessel functions of the first kind and the range of incident and observation\ndirections. Furthermore, we identify that the main factors of the imaging\nfunction for the permittivity and permeability contrast cases are the Bessel\nfunction of order zero and one, respectively. This further implies that the\nimaging performance significantly depends on the range of incident and\nobservation directions; peaks of large magnitudes appear at the location of\ninhomogeneities for permittivity contrast case, and for the permeability\ncontrast case, peaks of large magnitudes appear at the location of\ninhomogeneities when the range of such directions are narrow, while two peaks\nof large magnitudes appear in the neighborhood of the location of\ninhomogeneities when the range is wide enough. The numerical simulation results\nvia noise-corrupted synthetic data also show that the designed MUSIC algorithm\ncan address both permittivity and permeability contrast cases.",

    "abstract": "Lifelong person re-identification attempts to recognize people across cameras\nand integrate new knowledge from continuous data streams. Key challenges\ninvolve addressing catastrophic forgetting caused by parameter updating and\ndomain shift, and maintaining performance in seen and unseen domains. Many\nprevious works rely on data memories to retain prior samples. However, the\namount of retained data increases linearly with the number of training domains,\nleading to continually increasing memory consumption. Additionally, these\nmethods may suffer significant performance degradation when data preservation\nis prohibited due to privacy concerns. To address these limitations, we propose\nusing textual descriptions as guidance to encourage the ReID model to learn\ncross-domain invariant features without retaining samples. The key insight is\nthat natural language can describe pedestrian instances with an invariant\nstyle, suggesting a shared textual space for any pedestrian images. By\nleveraging this shared textual space as an anchor, we can prompt the ReID model\nto embed images from various domains into a unified semantic space, thereby\nalleviating catastrophic forgetting caused by domain shifts. To achieve this,\nwe introduce a task-driven dynamic textual prompt framework in this paper. This\nmodel features a dynamic prompt fusion module, which adaptively constructs and\nfuses two different textual prompts as anchors. This effectively guides the\nReID model to embed images into a unified semantic space. Additionally, we\ndesign a text-visual feature alignment module to learn a more precise mapping\nbetween fine-grained visual and textual features. We also developed a learnable\nknowledge distillation module that allows our model to dynamically balance\nretaining existing knowledge with acquiring new knowledge. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTAs under various\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "Conversational systems have a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module.

In this work, we propose several approaches\nto investigate the role of contextual information for the intent classification\ntask. Each approach is used to carry out a concatenation between the dialogue\nhistory and the current utterance. Our intent classification method is based on\na convolutional neural network that obtains effective vector representations\nfrom BERT to perform accurate intent classification using an approach\nwindow-based. Our experiments were carried out on a real-world Brazilian\nPortuguese corpus with dialog flows provided by Wavy global company.

    "abstract": "Traditional Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFNN) and one-dimensional\nConvolutional Neural Networks (1D CNN) often encounter difficulties when\ndealing with long, columnar datasets that contain numerous features. The\nchallenge arises from two primary factors: the large volume of data and the\npotential absence of meaningful relationships between features. In conventional\ntraining, large datasets can overwhelm the model, causing significant portions\nof the input to remain underutilized. As a result, the model may fail to\ncapture the critical information necessary for effective learning, which leads\nto diminished performance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel architecture called\nParallel Multi-path Feed Forward Neural Networks (PMFFNN). Our approach\nleverages multiple parallel pathways to process distinct subsets of columns\nfrom the input dataset. By doing so, the architecture ensures that each subset\nof features receives focused attention, which is often neglected in traditional\nmodels. This approach maximizes the utilization of feature diversity, ensuring\nthat no critical data sections are overlooked during training.\n  Our architecture offers two key advantages. First, it allows for more\neffective handling of long, columnar data by distributing the learning task\nacross parallel paths. Second, it reduces the complexity of the model by\nnarrowing the feature scope in each path, which leads to faster training times\nand improved resource efficiency. The empirical results indicate that PMFFNN\noutperforms traditional FFNNs and 1D CNNs, providing an optimized solution for\nmanaging large-scale data.",

    "abstract": "Urban Air Mobility (UAM), powered by flying cars, is poised to revolutionize\nurban transportation by expanding vehicle travel from the ground to the air.\nThis advancement promises to alleviate congestion and enable faster commutes.\nHowever, the fast travel speeds mean vehicles will encounter vastly different\nenvironments during a single journey. As a result, onboard learning systems\nneed access to extensive environmental data, leading to high costs in data\ncollection and training. These demands conflict with the limited in-vehicle\ncomputing and battery resources. Fortunately, learning model sharing offers a\nsolution. Well-trained local Deep Learning (DL) models can be shared with other\nvehicles, reducing the need for redundant data collection and training.\nHowever, this sharing process relies heavily on efficient vehicular\ncommunications in UAM. To address these challenges, this paper leverages the\nmulti-hop Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology to improve DL\nmodel sharing between distant flying cars. We also employ knowledge\ndistillation to reduce the size of the shared DL models and enable efficient\nintegration of non-identical models at the receiver.
