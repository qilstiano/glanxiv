    "abstract": "In this work, we have developed CuXASNet, a dense neural network that\npredicts simulated Cu L-edge X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) from atomic\nstructures. Featurization of the Cu local environment is performed using a\ncomponent of M3GNet, a graph neural network developed for predicting the\npotential energy surface. CuXASNet is trained on simulated spectra from FEFF9\nat the multiple scattering level of theory, and can predict the L3 and L2 edges\nfor Cu sites to quantitative accuracy. To validate our approach, we compare 14\nexperimental spectra extracted from the literature with the predictions of\nCuXASNet. The agreement of CuXASNet with experiments is shown by an average MAE\nof 0.125 and an average Spearman's correlation coefficient of 0.891, which is\ncomparable to FEFF9's values of 0.131 and 0.898 for the same metrics. As such,\nCuXASNet can rapidly generate a large number of L-edge XAS spectra at the same\naccuracy as FEFF9 simulations. This can be used as a drop-in replacement for\nmultiple scattering codes for fast screening of candidate atomic structure\nmodels of a measured system. This model establishes a general framework for Cu\nXAS prediction, and can be extended to more computationally expensive levels of\ntheory and to other transition metal L-edges.",

    "abstract": "The Roman Space Telescope, equipped with a 2.4 meter primary mirror and\noptical--NIR wide-field camera, promises to revolutionize our understanding of\ndark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. One of the Roman Core\nCommunity Surveys is the High Latitude Time Domain Survey (HLTDS), which will\nmeasure more than 10,000 SN Ia light curves but obtain a fraction of this\nnumber with spectra. The remaining SNe will have to be photometrically\nclassified to achieve the full potential of the Roman HLTDS. To investigate\ntransient yields and classifications, Rose et al. (in prep.) updated the\nPhotometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC)\nframework (originally developed for the Vera Rubin Observatory) for the Roman\nHLTDS. This study leverages this Roman Hourglass dataset to train and evaluate\nthe ParSNIP (Parameterized Supernova Identification Pipeline) model. We employ\nthis model to classify various transient types from photometric data, paying\nparticular attention to the types most represented in the dataset: normal SNe\nIa, 91bg-like SNe Ia, SNe Iax, and CC SNe. The ParSNIP model performance is\nassessed through confusion matrices and ROC curves across different redshift\nranges. Our analysis reveals that while the model performs robustly at higher\nredshifts (with the AUC for classification varying between 0.9 and 0.95 in the\nrange 0.5 < z < 2), its accuracy dips at the lowest redshifts of the survey,\nlikely due to limited training data. These findings underscore the importance\nof ensuring adequate representation of classes in the training set. This work\nunderscores the value of machine learning models for next-generation surveys,\npaving the way for future studies with the Roman Space Telescope for survey\noptimization, cosmological forecasts, and synergies with other surveys.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the revolution in single-cell sequencing has enabled\nthe simultaneous molecular profiling of various modalities across thousands of\nindividual cells, allowing scientists to investigate the diverse functions of\ncomplex tissues and uncover underlying disease mechanisms. Among all the\nanalytical steps, assigning individual cells to specific types is fundamental\nfor understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, this process is usually\nlabor-intensive and requires extensive expert knowledge. Recent advances in\nlarge language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to efficiently\nprocess and synthesize vast corpora of text to automatically extract essential\nbiological knowledge, such as marker genes, potentially promoting more\nefficient and automated cell type annotations. To thoroughly evaluate the\ncapability of modern instruction-tuned LLMs in automating the cell type\nidentification process, we introduce SOAR, a comprehensive benchmarking study\nof LLMs for cell type annotation tasks in single-cell genomics. Specifically,\nwe assess the performance of 8 instruction-tuned LLMs across 11 datasets,\nspanning multiple cell types and species. Our study explores the potential of\nLLMs to accurately classify and annotate cell types in single-cell RNA\nsequencing (scRNA-seq) data, while extending their application to multiomics\ndata through cross-modality translation. Additionally, we evaluate the\neffectiveness of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques in generating\ndetailed biological insights during the annotation process.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in video generation have significantly impacted daily\nlife for both individuals and industries. However, the leading video generation\nmodels remain closed-source, resulting in a notable performance gap between\nindustry capabilities and those available to the public. In this report, we\nintroduce HunyuanVideo, an innovative open-source video foundation model that\ndemonstrates performance in video generation comparable to, or even surpassing,\nthat of leading closed-source models. HunyuanVideo encompasses a comprehensive\nframework that integrates several key elements, including data curation,\nadvanced architectural design, progressive model scaling and training, and an\nefficient infrastructure tailored for large-scale model training and inference.\nAs a result, we successfully trained a video generative model with over 13\nbillion parameters, making it the largest among all open-source models. We\nconducted extensive experiments and implemented a series of targeted designs to\nensure high visual quality, motion dynamics, text-video alignment, and advanced\nfilming techniques. According to evaluations by professionals, HunyuanVideo\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art models, including Runway Gen-3, Luma 1.6,\nand three top-performing Chinese video generative models. By releasing the code\nfor the foundation model and its applications, we aim to bridge the gap between\nclosed-source and open-source communities. This initiative will empower\nindividuals within the community to experiment with their ideas, fostering a\nmore dynamic and vibrant video generation ecosystem.

Given a set of positive and negative\nexamples, specified as traces, LTL learning is the problem of synthesizing a\nspecification, in linear temporal logic (LTL), that evaluates to true over the\npositive traces and false over the negative ones. In this paper, we propose a\nnew type of LTL learning problem called constrained LTL learning, where the\nuser, in addition to positive and negative examples, is given an option to\nspecify one or more constraints over the properties of the LTL formula to be\nlearned. We demonstrate that the ability to specify these additional\nconstraints significantly increases the range of applications for LTL learning,\nand also allows efficient generation of LTL formulas that satisfy certain\ndesirable properties (such as minimality). We propose an approach for solving\nthe constrained LTL learning problem through an encoding in first-order\nrelational logic and reduction to an instance of the maximal satisfiability\n(MaxSAT) problem. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that ATLAS, an\nimplementation of our proposed approach, is able to solve new types of learning\nproblems while performing better than or competitively with the\nstate-of-the-art tools in LTL learning.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural\nlanguage processing with their impressive reasoning and question-answering\ncapabilities. However, these models are sometimes prone to generating\ncredible-sounding but incorrect information, a phenomenon known as LLM\nhallucinations. Reliable uncertainty estimation in LLMs is essential for\nfostering trust in their generated responses and serves as a critical tool for\nthe detection and prevention of erroneous or hallucinated outputs. To achieve\nreliable and well-calibrated uncertainty quantification in open-ended and\nfree-form natural language generation, we propose an uncertainty-aware\nfine-tuning approach for LLMs. This approach enhances the model's ability to\nprovide reliable uncertainty estimates without compromising accuracy, thereby\nguiding them to produce more trustworthy responses. We introduce a novel\nuncertainty-aware causal language modeling loss function, grounded in the\nprinciples of decision theory. Through rigorous evaluation on multiple\nfree-form question-answering datasets and models, we demonstrate that our\nuncertainty-aware fine-tuning approach yields better calibrated uncertainty\nestimates in natural language generation tasks than fine-tuning with the\nstandard causal language modeling loss. Furthermore, the experimental results\nshow that the proposed method significantly improves the model's ability to\ndetect hallucinations and identify out-of-domain prompts.",

    "abstract": "Although deep learning techniques show promising results for many\nneuroimaging tasks in research settings, they have not yet found widespread use\nin clinical scenarios. One of the reasons for this problem is that many machine\nlearning models only identify correlations between the input images and the\noutputs of interest, which can lead to many practical problems, such as\nencoding of uninformative biases and reduced explainability. Thus, recent\nresearch is exploring if integrating a priori causal knowledge into deep\nlearning models is a potential avenue to identify these problems. This work\nintroduces a new causal generative architecture named Masked Causal Flow\n(MACAW) for neuroimaging applications. Within this context, three main\ncontributions are described. First, a novel approach that integrates complex\ncausal structures into normalizing flows is proposed. Second, counterfactual\nprediction is performed to identify the changes in effect variables associated\nwith a cause variable. Finally, an explicit Bayesian inference for\nclassification is derived and implemented, providing an inherent uncertainty\nestimation. The feasibility of the proposed method was first evaluated using\nsynthetic data and then using MRI brain data from more than 23000 participants\nof the UK biobank study. The evaluation results show that the proposed method\ncan (1) accurately encode causal reasoning and generate counterfactuals\nhighlighting the structural changes in the brain known to be associated with\naging, (2) accurately predict a subject's age from a single 2D MRI slice, and\n(3) generate new samples assuming other values for subject-specific indicators\nsuch as age, sex, and body mass index.

To address these challenges, this work\nintroduces an adaptive LiDAR odometry and mapping framework tailored for\nautonomous agricultural mobile robots operating in complex agricultural\nenvironments. The proposed framework consists of a robust LiDAR odometry\nalgorithm based on dense Generalized-ICP scan matching, and an adaptive mapping\nmodule that considers motion stability and point cloud consistency for\nselective map updates. The key design principle of this framework is to\nprioritize the incremental consistency of the map by rejecting motion-distorted\npoints and sparse dynamic objects, which in turn leads to high accuracy in\nodometry estimated from scan matching against the map. The effectiveness of the\nproposed method is validated via extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art\nmethods on field datasets collected in real-world agricultural environments\nfeaturing various planting types, terrain types, and robot motion profiles.\nResults demonstrate that our method can achieve accurate odometry estimation\nand mapping results consistently and robustly across diverse agricultural\nsettings, whereas other methods are sensitive to abrupt robot motion and\naccumulated drift in unstructured environments. Further, the computational\nefficiency of our method is competitive compared with other methods.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks consist of pretext task, and loss\nfunction aiming to learn useful general features from unlabeled data. The basic\nidea of most SSL baselines revolves around enforcing the invariance to a\nvariety of data augmentations via the loss function. However, one main issue is\nthat, inattentive or deterministic enforcement of the invariance to any kind of\ndata augmentation is generally not only inefficient, but also potentially\ndetrimental to performance on the downstream tasks. In this work, we\ninvestigate the issue from the viewpoint of uncertainty in invariance\nrepresentation. Uncertainty representation is fairly under-explored in the\ndesign of SSL architectures as well as loss functions. We incorporate\nuncertainty representation in both loss function as well as architecture design\naiming for more data-dependent invariance enforcement. The former is\nrepresented in the form of data-derived uncertainty in SSL loss function\nresulting in a generative-discriminative loss function. The latter is achieved\nby feeding slightly different distorted versions of samples to the ensemble\naiming for learning better and more robust representation. Specifically,\nbuilding upon the recent methods that use hard and soft whitening (a.k.a\nredundancy reduction), we introduce a new approach GUESS, a pseudo-whitening\nframework, composed of controlled uncertainty injection, a new architecture,\nand a new loss function.

However, the development of image analysis\nmethods for EBCs is challenging due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of\nthe data. This work addresses the problem of object detection for EBC cameras.\nThe current approaches to EBC object detection focus on constructing complex\ndata representations and rely on specialized architectures. We introduce\nI2EvDet (Image-to-Event Detection), a novel adaptation framework that bridges\nmainstream object detection with temporal event data processing. First, we\ndemonstrate that a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer, or RT-DETR, a\nstate-of-the-art natural image detector, trained on a simple image-like\nrepresentation of the EBC data achieves performance comparable to specialized\nEBC methods. Next, as part of our framework, we develop an efficient adaptation\ntechnique that transforms image-based detectors into event-based detection\nmodels by modifying their frozen latent representation space through minimal\narchitectural additions. The resulting EvRT-DETR model reaches state-of-the-art\nperformance on the standard benchmark datasets Gen1 (mAP $+2.3$) and 1Mpx/Gen4\n(mAP $+1.4$).

    "abstract": "The diffusion learning method, DiffDock, for docking small-molecule ligands\ninto protein binding sites was recently introduced. Results included\ncomparisons to more conventional docking approaches, with DiffDock showing\nsuperior performance. Here, we employ a fully automatic workflow using the\nSurflex-Dock methods to generate a fair baseline for conventional docking\napproaches. Results were generated for the common and expected situation where\na binding site location is known and also for the condition of an unknown\nbinding site. For the known binding site condition, Surflex-Dock success rates\nat 2.0 Angstroms RMSD far exceeded those for DiffDock (Top-1/Top-5 success\nrates, respectively, were 68/81% compared with 45/51%). Glide performed with\nsimilar success rates (67/73%) to Surflex-Dock for the known binding site\ncondition, and results for AutoDock Vina and Gnina followed this pattern. For\nthe unknown binding site condition, using an automated method to identify\nmultiple binding pockets, Surflex-Dock success rates again exceeded those of\nDiffDock, but by a somewhat lesser margin. DiffDock made use of roughly 17,000\nco-crystal structures for learning (98% of PDBBind version 2020, pre-2019\nstructures) for a training set in order to predict on 363 test cases (2% of\nPDBBind 2020) from 2019 forward. DiffDock's performance was inextricably linked\nwith the presence of near-neighbor cases of close to identical protein-ligand\ncomplexes in the training set for over half of the test set cases. DiffDock\nexhibited a 40 percentage point difference on near-neighbor cases (two-thirds\nof all test cases) compared with cases with no near-neighbor training case.\nDiffDock has apparently encoded a type of table-lookup during its learning\nprocess, rendering meaningful applications beyond its reach. Further, it does\nnot perform even close to competitively with a competently run modern docking\nworkflow.",

Focusing on optical parametric oscillators (OPOs), we\ndemonstrate that the quantum statistics of arbitrary initial states are\nimprinted in the early-stage dynamics and can persist in the steady-state\nprobabilities. We derive the \"quantum sensitivity\" of parametric oscillators,\nlinking the initial quantum state to the system's steady-state outcomes,\nhighlighting how losses and parametric gain govern the system's quantum\nsensitivity. Moreover, we show that these findings extend beyond OPOs to a\nbroader class of nonlinear systems, including Josephson junction based\nsuperconducting circuits.

The rise of Vision Language Models (VLMs) presents a way to\nefficiently and accurately extract the information out of these documents. The\ncurrent automated workflow often requires a two-step approach involving the\nextraction of information using optical character recognition software and\nsubsequent usage of large language models for processing this information.\nUnfortunately, these methods encounter significant challenges when dealing with\nnoisy scanned documents, often requiring computationally expensive language\nmodels to handle high information density effectively. In this study, we\npropose PatchFinder, an algorithm that builds upon VLMs to improve information\nextraction. First, we devise a confidence-based score, called Patch Confidence,\nbased on the Maximum Softmax Probability of the VLMs' output to measure the\nmodel's confidence in its predictions. Using this metric, PatchFinder\ndetermines a suitable patch size, partitions the input document into\noverlapping patches, and generates confidence-based predictions for the target\ninformation.

Quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes have recently\nemerged as a promising alternative, requiring fewer qubits. However, the lack\nof efficient decoders remains a major barrier to their practical\nimplementation. In this work, we introduce SymBreak, a novel decoder for qLDPC\ncodes that adaptively modifies the decoding graph to improve the performance of\nstate-of-the-art belief propagation (BP) decoders.

We propose a solution that\nmitigates this issue at the decoding graph level, achieving both fast and\naccurate decoding. Our results demonstrate that SymBreak outperforms BP and\nBP+OSD-a more complex variant of BP-with a $16.17\\times$ reduction in logical\nerror rate compared to BP and $3.23\\times$ compared to BP+OSD across various\nqLDPC code families.

For\ninstance, given an issue on a source code repository, tests can clarify the\ndesired behavior among stake-holders before anyone writes code for the\nagreed-upon fix. Although there has been a lot of work on automated test\ngeneration for the practice \"write code first, test later\", there has been\nlittle such automation for TDD. Ideally, tests for TDD should be fail-to-pass\n(i.e., fail before the issue is resolved and pass after) and have good adequacy\nwith respect to covering the code changed during issue resolution. This paper\nintroduces TDD-Bench Verified, a high-quality benchmark suite of 449 issues\nmined from real-world GitHub code repositories. The benchmark's evaluation\nharness runs only relevant tests in isolation for simple yet accurate coverage\nmeasurements, and the benchmark's dataset is filtered both by human judges and\nby execution in the harness. This paper also presents Auto-TDD, an LLM-based\nsolution that takes as input an issue description and a codebase (prior to\nissue resolution) and returns as output a test that can be used to validate the\nchanges made for resolving the issue. Our evaluation shows that Auto-TDD yields\na better fail-to-pass rate than the strongest prior work while also yielding\nhigh coverage adequacy. Overall, we hope that this work helps make developers\nmore productive at resolving issues while simultaneously leading to more robust\nfixes.",

Accurate\ncontrol of the thrust generated by each rotor during flight is one of the main\nchallenges for robust control of quadrotors. The most common approach is to\napproximate the mapping of rotor speed to thrust with a simple quadratic model.\nThis model is known to fail under non-hovering flight conditions, introducing\nerrors into the control pipeline. One of the approaches to modeling the\naerodynamics around the propellers is the Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT).\nHere, we propose a novel BEMT-based closed-loop thrust estimator and control to\neliminate the laborious calibration step of finding several aerodynamic\ncoefficients. We aim to reuse known values as a baseline and fit the thrust\nestimate to values closest to the real ones with a simple test bench\nexperiment, resulting in a single scaling value. A feedforward PID thrust\ncontrol was implemented for each rotor, and the methods were validated by\noutdoor experiments with two multirotor UAV platforms: 250mm and 500mm. A\nstatistical analysis of the results showed that the thrust estimation and\ncontrol provided better robustness under aerodynamically varying flight\nconditions compared to the quadratic model.",

While sweat offers a\npromising non-invasive alternative for glucose monitoring, its application\nremains limited due to the low to moderate correlation between sweat and blood\nglucose concentrations, which has been obtained until now by assuming a linear\nrelationship. This study proposes a novel model-based strategy to estimate\nblood glucose concentrations from sweat samples, setting the stage for\nnon-invasive glucose monitoring through sweat-sensing technology.\n  Methods: We first developed a pharmacokinetic glucose transport model that\ndescribes the glucose transport from blood to sweat. Secondly, we designed a\nnovel optimization strategy leveraging the proposed model to solve the inverse\nproblem and infer blood glucose levels from measured glucose concentrations in\nsweat. To this end, the pharmacokinetic model parameters with the highest\nsensitivity were also optimized so as to achieve a personalized estimation. Our\nstrategy was tested on a dataset composed of 108 samples from healthy\nvolunteers and diabetic patients.\n  Results: Our glucose transport model improves over the state-of-the-art in\nestimating sweat glucose concentrations from blood levels (higher accuracy,\np<0.001). Additionally, our optimization strategy effectively solved the\ninverse problem, yielding a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.98 across all\n108 data points, with an average root-mean-square-percent-error of 12%+/-8%.\nThis significantly outperforms the best sweat-blood glucose correlation\nreported in the existing literature (0.75).\n  Conclusion: Our innovative optimization strategy, also leveraging more\naccurate modeling, shows promising results, paving the way for non-invasive\nblood glucose monitoring and, possibly, improved diabetes management.",

In special, the study shows that the CXOUJ1714-3810 and\nSwiftJ1834-0846 magnetar regions can be observed by the full southern and\nnorthern CTAO arrays in just five hours of observation, with mean significances\nabove $10 \\,\\sigma$ and $30 \\,\\sigma$, respectively. This paper discusses the\nregions analyzed, presents key results, and concludes with insights drawn from\nthe study.",

Ferrofluid marble (FM) is a marble\nwith a ferrofluid core that can easily be manipulated by a magnetic field.\nAlthough FMs have great potential for accurate positioning and manipulation,\nthese marbles have not been precisely controlled in magnetic digital\nmicrofluidics, so far. In this study for the first time, a novel method of\nmagnetic actuation is proposed using a pair of Helmholtz coils and permanent\nmagnets. The governing equations for controlling the FM position are\ninvestigated, and it is shown that there are three different strategies for\nadjusting the applied magnetic force. Then, experiments are conducted to\ndemonstrate the capability of the proposed method. To this aim, different\nmagnetic setups are proposed for manipulating FMs. These setups are compared in\nterms of energy consumption and tracking ability across various frequencies.\nThe study showcases several applications of precise FM position control,\nincluding controllable reciprocal positioning, simultaneous position control of\ntwo FMs, the transport of non-magnetic liquid marbles using the FMs, and sample\nextraction method from the liquid core of the FM.",

While recent advancements have enabled the generation of\naudio or video from text, producing both modalities simultaneously still\ntypically relies on either a cascaded process or multi-modal contrastive\nencoders. These approaches, however, often lead to suboptimal results due to\ninherent information losses during inference and conditioning. In this paper,\nwe introduce SyncFlow, a system that is capable of simultaneously generating\ntemporally synchronized audio and video from text. The core of SyncFlow is the\nproposed dual-diffusion-transformer (d-DiT) architecture, which enables joint\nvideo and audio modelling with proper information fusion. To efficiently manage\nthe computational cost of joint audio and video modelling, SyncFlow utilizes a\nmulti-stage training strategy that separates video and audio learning before\njoint fine-tuning. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that SyncFlow produces\naudio and video outputs that are more correlated than baseline methods with\nsignificantly enhanced audio quality and audio-visual correspondence. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities of SyncFlow, including zero-shot\nvideo-to-audio generation and adaptation to novel video resolutions without\nfurther training.",

Recent methods combine robust features from web-scale pretrained\nbackbones with new features learned from source data, and this has dramatically\nimproved benchmark results. However, it remains unclear if DG finetuning\nmethods are becoming better over time, or if improved benchmark performance is\nsimply an artifact of stronger pre-training. Prior studies have shown that\nperceptual similarity to pre-training data correlates with zero-shot\nperformance, but we find the effect limited in the DG setting. Instead, we\nposit that having perceptually similar data in pretraining is not enough; and\nthat it is how well these data were learned that determines performance. This\nleads us to introduce the Alignment Hypothesis, which states that the final DG\nperformance will be high if and only if alignment of image and class label text\nembeddings is high. Our experiments confirm the Alignment Hypothesis is true,\nand we use it as an analysis tool of existing DG methods evaluated on DomainBed\ndatasets by splitting evaluation data into In-pretraining (IP) and\nOut-of-pretraining (OOP). We show that all evaluated DG methods struggle on\nDomainBed-OOP, while recent methods excel on DomainBed-IP.

    "abstract": "In active systems, whose constituents have non-equilibrium dynamics at local\nlevel, fluid-fluid phase separation is widely observed. Examples include the\nformation of membraneless organelles within cells; the clustering of\nself-propelled colloidal particles in the absence of attractive forces, and\nsome types of ecological segregation. A schematic understanding of such active\nphase separation was initially borrowed from what is known for the equilibrium\ncase, in which detailed balance holds at microscopic level. However it has\nrecently become clear that in active systems the absence of detailed balance,\nalthough it leave phase separation qualitatively unchanged in some regimes (for\nexample domain growth driven by interfacial tension via Ostwald ripening), can\nin other regimes radically alter its phenomenology at mechanistic level. For\nexample, microphase separation can be caused by reverse Ostwald ripening, a\nprocess that is hard to imagine from an equilibrium perspective. This and other\nnew phenomena arise because, instead of having a single, positive interfacial\ntension like their equilibrium counterparts, the fluid-fluid interfaces created\nby active phase separation can have several distinct interfacial tensions\ngoverning different properties, some of which can be negative. These phenomena\ncan be broadly understood by studying continuum field theories for a single\nconserved scalar order parameter (the fluid density), supplemented with a\nvelocity field in cases where momentum conservation is also present. More\ncomplex regimes arise in systems described by multiple scalar order parameters\n(especially with nonreciprocal interactions between these); or when an order\nparameter undergoes both conserved and non-conserved dynamics; or in systems\nthat support orientational long-range order in one or more of the coexisting\nphases.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved impressive advancements in various vision\ntasks. However, these gains often rely on increasing model size, which\nescalates computational complexity and memory demands, complicating deployment,\nraising inference costs, and causing environmental impact. While some studies\nhave explored pruning techniques to improve the memory efficiency of diffusion\nmodels, most existing methods require extensive retraining to retain the model\nperformance. Retraining a modern large diffusion model is extremely costly and\nresource-intensive, which limits the practicality of these methods. In this\nwork, we achieve low-cost diffusion pruning without retraining by proposing a\nmodel-agnostic structural pruning framework for diffusion models that learns a\ndifferentiable mask to sparsify the model. To ensure effective pruning that\npreserves the quality of the final denoised latent, we design a novel\nend-to-end pruning objective that spans the entire diffusion process. As\nend-to-end pruning is memory-intensive, we further propose time step gradient\ncheckpointing, a technique that significantly reduces memory usage during\noptimization, enabling end-to-end pruning within a limited memory budget.\nResults on state-of-the-art U-Net diffusion models SDXL and diffusion\ntransformers (FLUX) demonstrate that our method can effectively prune up to 20%\nparameters with minimal perceptible performance degradation, and notably,\nwithout the need for model retraining. We also showcase that our method can\nstill prune on top of time step distilled diffusion models.",

    "abstract": "The presence of dips in the gravity modes period spacing versus period\ndiagram of gamma Doradus stars is now well established by recent asteroseismic\nstudies. Such Lorentzian-shaped inertial dips arise from the interaction of\ngravito-inertial modes in the radiative envelope of intermediate-mass main\nsequence stars with pure inertial modes in their convective core. They allow to\nstudy stellar internal properties. This window on stellar internal dynamics is\nextremely valuable in the context of the understanding of angular momentum\ntransport inside stars, since it allows us to probe rotation in their core. We\ninvestigate the signature and the detectability of a differential rotation\nbetween the convective core and the near-core region inside gamma Doradus stars\nfrom the inertial dip properties. We study the coupling between\ngravito-inertial modes in the radiative zone and pure inertial modes in the\nconvective core in the sub-inertial regime, allowing for a two-zones\ndifferential rotation from the two sides of the boundary. Taking a bi-layer\nrotation profile, we derive the wave equations in the convective core and the\nradiative envelope. We solve the coupling equation numerically and match the\nresult to an analytical derivation of the Lorentzian dip. We then use typical\nvalues of measured near-core rotation and buoyancy travel time to infer ranges\nof parameters for which differential core to near-core rotation would be\ndetectable in current Kepler data. We show that increasing the convective core\nrotation with respect to the near-core rotation leads to a shift of the period\nof the observed dip to lower periods. In addition, the dip gets deeper and\nthinner as the convective core rotation increases. We demonstrate that such a\nsignature is detectable in Kepler data, given appropriate dip parameter ranges\nand near-core structural properties.",

    "abstract": "Exomoon discovery is on the horizon. Although several exomoon candidates\nexist around single stars, there are currently no candidates around\ncircumbinary planets (CBPs). Circumbinary planets are predicted to have\nmigrated to their current location from a farther region of the protoplanetary\ndisc where they formed. An exomoon of a CBP therefore represents a fascinating\nyet complex and evolving four-body system. Their existence (or absence) would\nshed light on the robustness of moon formation in more dynamically active\nplanetary systems. In this work, we simulate exomoons around migrating CBPs. We\nshow that for fully migrated CBPs a moon is capable of surviving the migration\nif it is formed within ~5-10% of the planet's Hill Radius. Roughly 30-40% of\nthe surviving moons are in the habitable zone, giving credence to circumbinary\nhabitability even if the known CBPs all gas giants. The majority of moons fall\noff of their host planet early in the migration and become long-period CBPs\n(i.e a multi-planet circumbinary system). A subset of exomoons are ejected from\nthe system entirely. This last class presents a new mechanism for producing\nfree-floating planetary mass objects, like those discovered recently and\nexpected in the Roman microlensing survey.",

However, disentangling\nstellar from AGN light in these sources is challenging. Here, we use an\nempirical approach to infer the average stellar mass of 6 faint broad line (BL)\nHalpha emitters at z = 4 - 5 with BH masses ~ 6 (4 - 15)x10^6 Msun, with a\nmethod independent of their spectral energy distribution (SED). We use the deep\nJWST/NIRcam grism survey ALT to measure the over-densities around BL-Halpha\nemitters and around a spectroscopic reference sample of ~300 galaxies. In our\nreference sample, we find that Mpc-scale over-density correlates with stellar\nmass, while pair counts are flat below ~50 kpc due to satellites. Their\nlarge-scale environments suggest that BL-Halpha emitters are hosted by galaxies\nwith stellar masses ~5x10^7 Msun, ~40 times lower than those inferred from\ngalaxy-only SED fits. Adding measurements around more luminous z~6 AGNs, we\nfind tentative correlations between line width, BH mass and the over-density,\nsuggestive of a steep BH to halo mass relation. The main implications are (1)\nwhen BH masses are taken at face value, we confirm extremely high BH to stellar\nmass ratios of ~10 %, (2) the low stellar mass galaxies hosting growing SMBHs\nare in tension with typical hydrodynamical simulations, except those without\nfeedback, (3) a 1 % duty cycle implied by the host mass hints at\nsuper-Eddington accretion, which may imply over-estimated SMBH masses, (4) the\nmasses are at odds with a high stellar density interpretation of the line\nbroadening, (5) our results imply a diversity of galaxy masses, environments\nand SEDs among AGN samples, depending on their luminosity.",

The biological system known as IoT has seen a\nrapid increase in high dimensionality and information traffic. Self-protective\nmechanisms like intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are essential for defending\nagainst a variety of attacks. On the other hand, the functional and physical\ndiversity of IoT IDS systems causes significant issues.

For peculiarity-based IDS, this study\nproposes and implements a novel component selection and extraction strategy\n(our strategy).

Recent\nadvances in nanostructured dielectrics offer an avenue for achieving strong\nlight confinement without metallic losses. However, previous studies primarily\nfocused on minimizing the optical mode volume without adequately addressing\nlight-matter interactions. Here, we develop a nanolaser that simultaneously\nlocalizes the electromagnetic field and excited carriers within the same region\nof a dielectric nanobridge. This extreme dielectric confinement of both light\nand matter achieves a mode volume below the diffraction limit and a\nsubwavelength carrier volume without the introduction of lateral quantum\nconfinement, enabling continuous-wave lasing at room-temperature. Moreover, we\nobserve a strong correlation between the mode field and carrier distribution,\nand unexpectedly, the enhanced mode field localization automatically leads to\nmore pronounced carrier localization, promoting self-alignment of light and\nmatter, which significantly reduces the laser threshold. We quantify the\nintensified light-matter interaction with a newly proposed interaction volume,\nwhich generalizes the concept of mode volume to a broad class of active media.\nOur work lays the ground for developing ultra-efficient optoelectronic devices\nby greatly enhancing light-matter interactions through advanced material\nnanostructuring.",

Simulation\nresults show that at the pulse peak, the combined intensity profile is the\nsame, whether in continuous-wave or pulsed mode, for both coherent and\nincoherent combinations. However, we observe spatial thinning of the combined\nbeams in the case of incoherent pulsed combination when the pulse widths are\nless than 100 fs. At the front of the pulse, we observe lateral lobes near the\nfocal point, which disappear as we approach the peak of the pulse. Similar to\nthe continuous-wave laser beam combination, our simulations show that in both\ncoherent and incoherent pulsed combinations, the filling factor has no impact\non the formation of secondary lobes or on the proportion of energy in the\ncentral lobe. Furthermore, with the new configuration, we are no longer\nconstrained by paraxial optics, as the number of lasers that can be combined is\narbitrary, and their positions can be chosen freely in space.",

Due to the large number of nodes for traffic data, the conventional\ncross-attention mechanism performing the node-wise alignment may be infeasible\nin computation-limited resources. Instead, we take the transpose operation for\nQuery, Key, and Value in the Cross-attention mechanism, which substantially\nreduces the computation cost while maintaining sufficient information.\nExperimental results for both traffic occurrence prediction and severity\nprediction (severity levels based on the interval of recorded crash counts) on\nlarge-scale city-wise datasets confirm the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethod.

    "abstract": "Observations of young star clusters in a variety of galaxies have been used\nto constrain basic properties related to star-formation, such as the fraction\nof stars found in clusters (Gam) and the shape of the cluster mass function.\nHowever, the results can depend heavily on the reliability of the cluster\nage-dating process and other assumptions. One of the biggest challenges for\nsuccessful age-dating lies in breaking the age-reddening degeneracy, where\nolder, dust-free clusters and young, reddened clusters can have similar\nbroad-band colors. While this degeneracy affects cluster populations in all\ngalaxies, it is particularly challenging in dusty, extreme star-forming\nenvironments systems. We study the cluster demographics in the luminous\ninfrared galaxy NGC1614 using Hubble imaging taken in 8 optical-NIR passbands.\nFor age-dating, we adopt a spectral energy distribution fitting process that\nlimits the maximum allowed reddening by region, and includes Ha photometry\ndirectly. We find that without these assumptions, essentially all clusters in\nthe dust-free UV-bright arm which should have ages 50-250Myr are incorrectly\nassigned ages younger than 10Myr. We find this method greatly reduces the\nnumber of clusters in the youngest (tau<10Myrs) age bin and shows a fairly\nuniform distribution of massive clusters, the most massive being few10^7M. A\nmaximum likelihood fit shows that the cluster mass function is well fitted by a\npower-law with an index -1.8, with no statistically significant high-mass\ncutoff. We calculate the fraction of stars born in clusters to be\nGam1-10=22.4+_5.7%. The fraction of stars in clusters decreases quickly over\ntime, with Gam10-100= 4.5+_1.1% and Gam100-400=1.7+_0.4%, suggesting that\nclusters dissolve rapidly over the first ~0.5Gyr. The decreasing fraction of\nstars in clusters is consistent with the declining shape observed for the\ncluster age distribution.",

    "abstract": "We present CAISSON, a novel hierarchical approach to Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) that transforms traditional single-vector search into a\nmulti-view clustering framework. At its core, CAISSON leverages dual\nSelf-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to create complementary organizational views of the\ndocument space, where each view captures different aspects of document\nrelationships through specialized embeddings. The first view processes combined\ntext and metadata embeddings, while the second operates on metadata enriched\nwith concept embeddings, enabling a comprehensive multi-view analysis that\ncaptures both fine-grained semantic relationships and high-level conceptual\npatterns. This dual-view approach enables more nuanced document discovery by\ncombining evidence from different organizational perspectives. To evaluate\nCAISSON, we develop SynFAQA, a framework for generating synthetic financial\nanalyst notes and question-answer pairs that systematically tests different\naspects of information retrieval capabilities. Drawing on HotPotQA's\nmethodology for constructing multi-step reasoning questions, SynFAQA generates\ncontrolled test cases where each question is paired with the set of notes\ncontaining its ground-truth answer, progressing from simple single-entity\nqueries to complex multi-hop retrieval tasks involving multiple entities and\nconcepts. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over\nboth basic and enhanced RAG implementations, particularly for complex\nmulti-entity queries, while maintaining practical response times suitable for\ninteractive applications.",

In\ntheir comment (arXiv:2206.10619), Hance and Hossenfelder argue that we have\nmisrepresented the purpose of superdeterministic models. We here dispute this\nclaim by recalling the different classes of superdeterministic models we\ndefined in our article and our conclusions regarding which of these are\ndisfavoured by our experimental results. Their confusion on this point seems to\nhave arisen in part from the fact that we characterized superdeterministic\nmodels within a causal modelling framework and from the fact that we referred\nto this framework as \"classical\" in order to contrast it with an intrinsically\nquantum alternative. In this reply, therefore, we take the opportunity to\nclarify these points. They also claim that if one is adjudicating between a\npair of models, where one model can account for strictly more operational\nstatistics than the other, the first model will tend to overfit the data\nrelative to the second. Because this model inclusion relation can arise for\npairs of models in a reductionist heirarchy, they conclude that overfitting\nshould not be taken as evidence against the first model. We point out here\nthat, contrary to this claim, one does not expect overfitting to arise\ngenerically in cases of model inclusion, so that it is indeed sometimes\nappropriate to consider overfitting as a criterion for adjudicating between\nsuch models.",

As the PAC model fails\nto explain the behavior of learning curves, recent research has explored an\nalternative universal learning model and has ultimately revealed a distinction\nbetween optimal universal and uniform learning rates (Bousquet et al., 2021).\nHowever, a basic understanding of such differences with a particular focus on\nthe ERM principle has yet to be developed.\n  In this paper, we consider the problem of universal learning by ERM in the\nrealizable case and study the possible universal rates. Our main result is a\nfundamental tetrachotomy: there are only four possible universal learning rates\nby ERM, namely, the learning curves of any concept class learnable by ERM decay\neither at $e^{-n}$, $1/n$, $\\log(n)/n$, or arbitrarily slow rates.

Yet, there is limited empirical evidence on the origins of\ncriticism, its effects on the papers and individuals involved, and its\nvisibility within the scientific literature. Here, we address these gaps\nthrough a data-driven analysis of papers that received substantiated and\nexplicit written criticisms. Our analysis draws on data representing over 3,000\n``critical letters'' -- papers explicitly published to critique another -- from\nfour high profile journals, with each letter linked to its target paper. We\nfind that the papers receiving critical letters are disproportionately among\nthe most highly-cited in their respective journal and, to a lesser extent,\namong the most interdisciplinary and novel. However, despite the theoretical\nimportance of criticism in scientific progress, we observe no evidence that\nreceiving a critical letter affects a paper's citation trajectory or the\nproductivity and citation impact of its authors. One explanation for the\nlimited consequence of critical letters is that they often go unnoticed.\nIndeed, we find that critical letters attract only a small fraction of the\ncitations received by their targets, even years after publication. An analysis\nof topical similarity between criticized papers and their citing papers\nindicates that critical letters are primarily cited by researchers actively\nengaged in a similar field of study, whereas they are overlooked by more\ndistant communities. Although criticism is celebrated as a cornerstone to\nscience, our findings reveal that it is concentrated on high-impact papers, has\nminimal measurable consequences, and suffers from limited visibility.

    "abstract": "Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for\nidentifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an\ninfinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability\nguarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under\nconditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within\nthe existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we\npropose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and\nLyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of\ndata sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively\nlow sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed\nhigh-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system\ntransitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov\nfunctions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified\nusing a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less\nconservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing\nmethods.",

Addressing this gap, we propose\nIntComplex as an innovative framework to characterize such high-order\ninteractions comprehensively. Our framework leverages homology theory to\nprovide a quantitative representation of the topological structure inherent in\nsuch interactions. IntComplex is defined as a collection of interactions, each\nof which can be equivalently represented by a binary tree.

Furthermore, we introduce persistent\nhomology through a filtration process and establish its stability to ensure\nrobust quantitative analysis of these complex interactions.

Our main results\nare: 1) Regardless of the metric used, we find that the peak AGN excess\n(compared with a matched control sample) occurs immediately after coalescence,\nat 0 < T_PM < 0.16 Gyr. 2) The excess of AGN is observed until long after\ncoalescence; both the mid-IR selected AGN and broad line AGN are more common\nthan in the control sample even in the longest time bin of our sample (0.96 <\nT_PM < 1.76 Gyr). 3) The AGN excess is larger for more luminous and\nbolometrically dominant AGN, and we find that AGN in post-mergers are generally\nmore luminous than secularly triggered events. 4) A deficit of broad line AGN\nin the pre-merger phase, that evolves into an excess in post-mergers is\nconsistent with evolution of the covering fraction of nuclear obscuring\nmaterial. Before coalescence, tidally triggered inflows increase the covering\nfraction of nuclear dust; in the post-merger regime feedback from the AGN\nclears (at least some of) this material. 5) The statistical peak in the\ntriggering of starbursts occurs contemporaneously with AGN, within 0.16 Gyr of\ncoalescence.",

    "abstract": "Ultraviolet absorption line spectroscopy is a sensitive diagnostic for the\nproperties of interstellar and circumgalactic gas. Down-the-barrel\nobservations, where the absorption is measured against the galaxy itself, are\ncommonly used to study feedback from galactic outflows and to make predictions\nabout the leakage of HI ionizing photons into the intergalactic medium.\nNonetheless, the interpretation of these observations is challenging and\nobservational compromises are often made in terms of signal-to-noise, spectral\nresolution, or the use of stacking analyses. In this paper, we present a novel\nquantitative assessment of UV absorption line measurement techniques by using\nmock observations of a hydrodynamical simulation. We use a simulated galaxy to\ncreate 22,500 spectra in the commonly used SiII lines while also modeling the\nsignal-to-noise and spectral resolution of recent rest-frame UV galaxy surveys\nat both high and low redshifts. We show that the residual flux of absorption\nfeatures is easily overestimated for single line measurements and for stacked\nspectra. Additionally, we explore the robustness of the partial covering model\nfor estimating column densities from spectra and find under-predictions on\naverage of 1.25 dex. We show that the under-prediction is likely caused by\nhigh-column-density sight-lines that are optically-thick to dust making them\ninvisible in UV spectra.",

    "abstract": "We study quasinormal mode expansions by adopting a Keldysh scheme for the\nspectral construction of asymptotic resonant expansions. Quasinormal modes are\nfirst cast in terms of a non-selfadjoint problem by adopting, in a black hole\nperturbation setting, a spacetime hyperboloidal approach. Then the Keldysh\nexpansion of the resolvent, built on bi-orthogonal systems, provides a spectral\nversion of Lax-Phillips expansions on scattering resonances. We clarify the\nrole of scalar product structures in the Keldysh setting, that prove\nnon-necessary to construct the resonant expansions (in particular the\nquasinormal mode time-series at null infinity), but are required to define the\n(constant) excitation coefficients in the bulk resonant expansion. We\ndemonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the Keldysh spectral approach to\n(non-selfadjoint) dynamics, even beyond its limits of validity, in particular\nrecovering Schwarzschild black hole late power-law tails. We also study early\ndynamics by exploring i) the existence of an earliest time of validity of the\nresonant expansion and ii) the interplay between overtones extracted with the\nKeldysh scheme and regularity. Specifically, we address convergence aspects of\nthe series and, on the other hand, we implement non-modal analysis tools,\nnamely assessing $H^p$-Sobolev dynamical transient growths and constructing\n$H^p$-pseudospectra. Finally, we apply the Keldysh scheme to calculate\n''second-order'' quasinormal modes and complement the qualitative study of\novertone distribution by presenting the Weyl law for the counting of\nquasinormal modes in black holes with different (flat, De Sitter, anti-De\nSitter) spacetime asymptotics.",

    "abstract": "The origins of Uranus and Neptune are not fully understood. Their inclined\nrotation axes -- obliquities -- suggest that they experienced giant impacts\nduring their formation histories. Simulations modeling their accretion from\ngiant impacts among ~5 Earth masses planetary embryos -- with roughly unity\nimpactors' mass ratios -- have been able to broadly match their current masses,\nfinal mass ratio, and obliquity. However, due to angular momentum conservation,\nplanets produced in these impacts tend to rotate too fast, compared to Uranus\nand Neptune. One potential solution for this problem consists of invoking\ninstead collisions of objects with large mass ratios (e.g. a proto-Uranus with\n13 Mearth and an embryo of 1 Mearth). Smooth-particle hydrodynamics simulations\nshow that in this scenario final planets tend to have rotation periods more\nconsistent with those of Uranus and Neptune. Here we performed a large suite of\nN-body numerical simulations modelling the formation of Uranus and Neptune to\ncompare these different dynamical views. Our simulations start with a\npopulation of protoplanets and account for the effects of type-I migration,\ninclination and eccentricity tidal damping. Our results show that although\nscenarios allowing for large impactors' mass ratio favour slower rotating\nplanets, the probability of occurring collisions in these specific simulations\nis significantly low. This is because gas tidal damping is relatively less\nefficient for low-mass embryos (<~1 Merath) and, consequently, such objects are\nmostly scattered by more massive objects (~13 Mearth) instead of colliding with\nthem. Altogether, our results show that the probability of broadly matching the\nmasses, mass ratio, and rotation periods of Uranus and Neptune in these two\ncompeting formation scenarios is broadly similar, within a factor of ~2, with\noverall probabilities of the order of ~0.1-1%.",

(2020b)\nproposed a more realistic generalized $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness assumption,\nthough it remains largely unexplored. Many existing algorithms designed for\nstandard smooth problems need to be revised. However, in the context of\nFederated Learning, only a few works address this problem but rely on\nadditional limiting assumptions. In this paper, we address this gap in the\nliterature: we propose and analyze new methods with local steps, partial\nparticipation of clients, and Random Reshuffling without extra restrictive\nassumptions beyond generalized smoothness. The proposed methods are based on\nthe proper interplay between clients' and server's stepsizes and gradient\nclipping. Furthermore, we perform the first analysis of these methods under the\nPolyak-{\\L} ojasiewicz condition. Our theory is consistent with the known\nresults for standard smooth problems, and our experimental results support the\ntheoretical insights.",

    "abstract": "High-quality machine learning (ML)-ready datasets play a foundational role in\ndeveloping new artificial intelligence (AI) models or fine-tuning existing\nmodels for scientific applications such as weather and climate analysis.\nUnfortunately, despite the growing development of new deep learning models for\nweather and climate, there is a scarcity of curated, pre-processed machine\nlearning (ML)-ready datasets. Curating such high-quality datasets for\ndeveloping new models is challenging particularly because the modality of the\ninput data varies significantly for different downstream tasks addressing\ndifferent atmospheric scales (spatial and temporal).

WxC-Bench is designed as a dataset of datasets\nfor developing ML-models for a complex weather and climate system, addressing\nselected downstream tasks as machine learning phenomenon. WxC-Bench encompasses\nseveral atmospheric processes from meso-$\\beta$ (20 - 200 km) scale to synoptic\nscales (2500 km), such as aviation turbulence, hurricane intensity and track\nmonitoring, weather analog search, gravity wave parameterization, and natural\nlanguage report generation.

    "abstract": "Analog computing using non-volatile memristors has emerged as a promising\nsolution for energy-efficient deep learning. New materials, like\nperovskites-based memristors are recently attractive due to their\ncost-effectiveness, energy efficiency and flexibility. Yet, challenges in\nmaterial diversity and immature fabrications require extensive experimentation\nfor device development. Moreover, significant non-idealities in these\nmemristors often impede them for computing. Here, we propose a synergistic\nmethodology to concurrently optimize perovskite memristor fabrication and\ndevelop robust analog DNNs that effectively address the inherent non-idealities\nof these memristors. Employing Bayesian optimization (BO) with a focus on\nusability, we efficiently identify optimal materials and fabrication conditions\nfor perovskite memristors. Meanwhile, we developed \"BayesMulti\", a DNN training\nstrategy utilizing BO-guided noise injection to improve the resistance of\nanalog DNNs to memristor imperfections. Our approach theoretically ensures that\nwithin a certain range of parameter perturbations due to memristor\nnon-idealities, the prediction outcomes remain consistent. Our integrated\napproach enables use of analog computing in much deeper and wider networks,\nwhich significantly outperforms existing methods in diverse tasks like image\nclassification, autonomous driving, species identification, and large\nvision-language models, achieving up to 100-fold improvements. We further\nvalidate our methodology on a 10$\\times$10 optimized perovskite memristor\ncrossbar, demonstrating high accuracy in a classification task and low energy\nconsumption. This study offers a versatile solution for efficient optimization\nof various analog computing systems, encompassing both devices and algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We present results from a Keck/DEIMOS survey to study satellite quenching in\ngroup environments at $z \\sim 0.8$ within the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). We\ntarget $11$ groups in the EGS with extended X-ray emission. We obtain\nhigh-quality spectroscopic redshifts for group member candidates, extending to\ndepths over an order of magnitude fainter than existing DEEP2/DEEP3\nspectroscopy. This depth enables the first spectroscopic measurement of the\nsatellite quiescent fraction down to stellar masses of $\\sim 10^{9.5}~{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$ at this redshift. By combining an infall-based environmental\nquenching model, constrained by the observed quiescent fractions, with infall\nhistories of simulated groups from the IllustrisTNG100-1-Dark simulation, we\nestimate environmental quenching timescales ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{quench}}$) for the\nobserved group population. At high stellar masses (${M}_{\\star}=10^{10.5}~{\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$) we find that $\\tau_{\\mathrm{quench}} = 2.4\\substack{+0.2 \\\\ -0.2}$\nGyr, which is consistent with previous estimates at this epoch. At lower\nstellar masses (${M}_{\\star}=10^{9.5}~{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$), we find that\n$\\tau_{\\mathrm{quench}}=3.1\\substack{+0.5 \\\\ -0.4}$ Gyr, which is shorter than\nprior estimates from photometry-based investigations. These timescales are\nconsistent with satellite quenching via starvation, provided the hot gas\nenvelope of infalling satellites is not stripped away. We find that the\nevolution in the quenching timescale between $0 \\lt z \\lt 1$ aligns with the\nevolution in the dynamical time of the host halo and the total cold gas\ndepletion time. This suggests that the doubling of the quenching timescale in\ngroups since $z\\sim1$ could be related to the dynamical evolution of groups or\na decrease in quenching efficiency via starvation with decreasing redshift.",

At $f_e$ below the current fiducial cosmic values of $\\rm \\sim\n10^{-4}$, the baryonic collapse is delayed due to the lack of molecular\nhydrogen cooling until the host halo masses are increased by one to two orders\nof magnitude compared to the standard case and reach the atomic cooling limit.\nThis results in an enhanced enclosed gas mass by more than an order of\nmagnitude and higher inflow rates of up to $0.1~M_{\\odot}/{yr}$.

To\naddress this \"lensing-is-low\" tension and to obtain new, precise measurements,\nwe exploit the large DESI Legacy Survey Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) dataset,\ncovering approximately 19,500 $\\deg^2$ of the sky and including about 10\nmillion LRGs at $z < 1.05$. Our $\\mathrm{\\Lambda}$CDM template was created\nusing the Buzzard mocks, which we specifically calibrated to match the\nclustering properties of the observed galaxy sample by exploiting more than one\nmillion DESI spectra. We identified our catalogs of 3D voids in the range $0.35\n< z < 0.95$, dividing the sample into bins according to the redshift and\n$\\lambda_\\mathrm{v}$ values of the voids.

    "abstract": "Most parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods rely on low-rank\nrepresentations to adapt models. However, these approaches often oversimplify\nrepresentations, particularly when the underlying data has high-rank or\nhigh-frequency components. This limitation hinders the model's ability to\ncapture complex data interactions effectively. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach that models network weights by leveraging a combination of\nphysical priors, enabling more accurate approximations. We use three\nfoundational equations -- heat diffusion, wave propagation, and Poisson's\nsteady-state equation -- each contributing distinctive modeling properties:\nheat diffusion enforces local smoothness, wave propagation facilitates\nlong-range interactions, and Poisson's equation captures global equilibrium. To\ncombine these priors effectively, we introduce the Mixture of Physical Priors\nAdapter (MoPPA), using an efficient Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)\nimplementation. To dynamically balance these priors, a route regularization\nmechanism is designed to adaptively tune their contributions. MoPPA serves as a\nlightweight, plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates into transformer\narchitectures, with adaptable complexity depending on the local context.\nSpecifically, using MAE pre-trained ViT-B, MoPPA improves PEFT accuracy by up\nto 2.1% on VTAB-1K image classification with a comparable number of trainable\nparameters, and advantages are further validated through experiments across\nvarious vision backbones, showcasing MoPPA's effectiveness and adaptability.\nThe code will be made public available.",

The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a\ntruncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given\npolicy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system\nand cost matrices. In particular, at each iteration, EXP-LQR refines the\nmaintained policy using a truncated LQR cost retrieved by performing\nfinite-time virtual or real experiments in which a perturbed version of the\ncurrent policy is employed. Such a perturbation is done according to an\nextremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm a time-varying\nnonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting averaging\ntheory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an arbitrarily small\nneighborhood of the optimal gain matrix.

Perturbations caused by dark\nsubhalos are, on average, orders of magnitude weaker than those caused by\nluminous satellite galaxies, but the ubiquity of dark halos predicted by cold\ndark matter makes them a more probable source of strong perturbation to the\ndynamics of the solar neighborhood.

Such\nevents could add a population of compact remnants in globular clusters, they\nare expected to produce yet unidentified electromagnetic transients including\ngamma-ray and radio bursts, and to act as sources of trans-iron elements,\nneutrinos, and gravitational waves. Here we present the first long-term (>5s\npost bounce) hydrodynamical simulations in axi-symmetry (2D), using energy- and\nvelocity-dependent three-flavor neutrino transport based on a two-moment\nscheme. Our set of six models includes initial WD configurations for different\nmasses, central densities, rotation rates, and angular momentum profiles. Our\nsimulations demonstrate that rotation plays a crucial role for the\nproto-neutron star (PNS) evolution and ejecta properties. We find early\nneutron-rich ejecta and an increasingly proton-rich neutrino-driven wind at\nlater times in a non-rotating model, in agreement with electron-capture\nsupernova models. In contrast to that and different from previous results, our\nrotating models eject proton-rich material initially and increasingly more\nneutron-rich matter as time advances, because an extended accretion torus forms\naround the PNS and feeds neutrino-driven bipolar outflows for many seconds. AIC\nand MIC events are thus potential sites of r-process element production, which\nmay imply constraints on their occurrence rates.

In this case,\nwe additionally analyze the transient regime leading to the steady states and\ncharacterize tradeoffs between equilibration times and measurement precision.\nOverall, our results provide a comprehensive picture of the potential of\nmany-body control in quantum sensing.",

The information\ncontained therein has profound effects on observable quantities such as\nsuperconducting weight, Drude weight, and optical responses. Motivated by the\nrecent advances in flat-band interacting systems, we investigate the role of\ninteraction effects on the quantum metric. By using the fermionic Creutz ladder\nas a representative system, we show that the repulsive Hubbard interaction\nmonotonically suppresses the quantum metric. While the eigenstates and their\noverlap quantifying the quantum metric can be obtained exactly in the presence\nof interactions through exact diagonalization, this method is limited to small\nsystem sizes. Alternatively, two theoretical proposals, the generalized quantum\nmetric and the dressed quantum metric, suggest using renormalized Green's\nfunctions to define the interacting quantum metric. By comparing these\nanalytical approaches with results from exact diagonalization, we show that the\ndressed quantum metric provides a better fit to the exact diagonalization\nresults.

    "abstract": "Distant quasars (QSOs) in galaxy overdensities are considered key actors in\nthe evolution of the early Universe. In this work, we studied the kinematic and\nphysical properties of the BR1202-0725 system at z=4.7, one of the most\noverdense fields known in the early Universe, consisting of a QSO, a\nsubmillimeter galaxy (SMG), and three Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters. We used data\nfrom the JWST/NIRSpec Integral Field Unit (IFU) to analyze the rest-frame\noptical emission of each source in the system. We estimated a bolometric\nluminosity of log($L_{\\rm bol}/$[erg/s]) = 47.2 $\\pm$ 0.4 and a black hole mass\nof log($M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot$) = 10.1 $\\pm$ 0.5 for the QSO, which are consistent\nwith previous measurements obtained with ground-based observations. The NIRSpec\nspectra of the SMG revealed instead unexpected [OIII] and H$\\alpha$+[NII]\nprofiles. The overall [OIII] line profile is blue-shifted by more than 700 km/s\nrelative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy. Additionally, both the [OIII]\nand H$\\alpha$+[NII] lines show prominent broad (1300 km/s), blueshifted wings\nassociated with outflowing ionized gas. The analysis of NIRSpec and X-ray\nobservations indicates that the SMG likely hosts an accreting supermassive\nblack hole as supported by the following results: (i) the excitation diagnostic\ndiagram is consistent with ionization from an active galactic nucleus (AGN);\n(ii) the X-ray luminosity is higher than $10^{44}$ erg/s; and (iii) it hosts a\nfast outflow ($v_{\\rm out}$ = 5000 km/s), comparable to those observed in\nluminous QSOs. Therefore, the QSO-SMG pair represents one of the\nhighest-redshift double AGN to date, with a projected separation of 24 kpc.\nFinally, we investigated the environment of this system and found four new\ngalaxies at the same redshift of the QSO and within a projected distance of 5\nkpc from it. This overdense system includes at least ten galaxies in only 980\nkpc$^2$.",

However, if the\nplanet forms with a hydrogen envelope as small as 0.1 Earth-masses, no water\nwill be lost during the star's pre-main sequence phase from thermal escape\nprocesses. We find that the planets are unlikely to be in a 3:1 mean motion\nresonance and that both planets tidally circularize within 0.5 Gyr when tidal\ndissipation is held constant. However, if tidal dissipation is a function of\nmantle temperature and rheology, then we find that planet c's orbit may require\nmore than 7 Gyr to circularize, during which time tidal heating may reach\nhundreds of terawatts.

At publication time, DR3 delivered the largest collection\nof variable sources with an associated classification across the entire sky.\nAll these sources have their $G$, $G_{BP}$, $G_{RP}$ epoch data published and\naccessible in the Gaia ESA archive. In summary, there are 10.5 million variable\nsources, including 9.5 million variable stars and 1 million QSOs. Additionally,\n2.5 million galaxies were identified thanks to spurious variability caused by\nthe non-axisymmetric nature of galaxies and the way Gaia collects data.\nMoreover, all the epoch data and time series of nearly 1.3 million sources in a\npencil beam around the Andromeda galaxy are published, regardless of their\nstatus (constant or variable); This dataset is known as the Gaia Andromeda\nPhotometric Survey.

    "abstract": "Dense neutrino gases can exhibit collective flavor instabilities, triggering\nlarge flavor conversions that are driven primarily by neutrino-neutrino\nrefraction. One broadly distinguishes between fast instabilities that exist in\nthe limit of vanishing neutrino masses, and slow ones, that require neutrino\nmass splittings. In a related series of papers, we have shown that fast\ninstabilities result from the resonant growth of flavor waves, in the same way\nas turbulent electric fields in an unstable plasma. Here we extend this\nframework to slow instabilities, focusing on the simplest case of an infinitely\nhomogeneous medium with axisymmetric neutrino distribution. The relevant length\nand time scales are defined by three parameters: the vacuum oscillation\nfrequency $\\omega_E=\\delta m^2/2E$, the scale of neutrino-neutrino refraction\nenergy $\\mu=\\sqrt{2}G_F(n_\\nu+n_{\\overline\\nu})$, and the ratio between lepton\nand particle number\n$\\epsilon=(n_\\nu-n_{\\overline\\nu})/(n_\\nu+n_{\\overline\\nu})$. We distinguish\nbetween two very different regimes: (i) For $\\omega_E\\ll \\mu \\epsilon^2$,\ninstabilities occur at small spatial scales of order $(\\mu\\epsilon)^{-1}$ with\na time scale of order $\\epsilon \\omega_E^{-1}$. This novel branch of slow\ninstability arises from resonant interactions with neutrinos moving along the\naxis of symmetry. (ii) For $\\mu \\epsilon^2\\ll \\omega_E\\ll \\mu$, the instability\nis strongly non-resonant, with typical time and length scales of order\n$1/\\sqrt{\\omega_E \\mu}$. Unstable modes interact with all neutrino directions\nat once, recovering the characteristic scaling of the traditional studies of\nslow instabilities. In the inner regions of supernovae and neutron-star\nmergers, the first regime may be more likely to appear, meaning that slow\ninstabilities in this region may have an entirely different character than\nusually envisaged.",

Our aim is to assess the viability and performance\nof deep learning searches for stellar wakes in the Galactic stellar halo caused\nby DM subhalos of varying mass.

The simulation data is used to train deep\nneural networks with the purpose of inferring both the presence and mass of the\nmoving perturber, and assess subhalo detectability in varying conditions of the\nGalactic stellar and DM halos. We find that our binary classifier is able to\ninfer the presence of subhalos, showing non-trivial performance down to a\nsubhalo mass of $5 \\times 10^7 \\rm \\, M_\\odot$.

Using the\nFLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we study the\nphysical origin and redshift distributions of the objects generating WL peaks\nselected from a WL convergence map mimicking a $\\textit{Euclid}$ signal. We\nmatch peaks to individual haloes and show that the high signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR$~>~5$) WL peaks measured by Stage IV WL surveys primarily trace\n$M_{\\mathrm{200c}} > 10^{14}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ haloes. We find that the WL peak\nsample can compete with the purity and completeness of state-of-the-art X-ray\nand Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster abundance inferences. By comparing the\ndistributions predicted by simulation variations that have been calibrated to\nthe observed gas fractions of local clusters and the present-day galaxy stellar\nmass function, or shifted versions of these, we illustrate that the shape of\nthe redshift distribution of SNR$~>~5$ peaks is insensitive to baryonic physics\nwhile it does change with cosmology. The difference highlights the potential of\nusing WL peaks to constrain cosmology. As the WL convergence and redshift\nnumber densities of WL peaks scale differently with cosmology and baryonic\nfeedback, WL peak statistics can simultaneously calibrate baryonic feedback and\nconstrain cosmology.",

IBQ enables scalable training of visual tokenizers and, for the first\ntime, achieves a large-scale codebook ($2^{18}$) with high dimension ($256$)\nand high utilization. Experiments on the standard ImageNet benchmark\ndemonstrate the scalability and superiority of IBQ, achieving competitive\nresults on reconstruction and the application of autoregressive visual\ngeneration.

However, existing methods are constrained by\nthe limited scale of real-world data, which hinders a comprehensive exploration\nof the scaling laws associated with end-to-end autonomous driving. To address\nthis issue, we collected substantial data from various driving scenarios and\nbehaviors and conducted an extensive study on the scaling laws of existing\nimitation learning-based end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms. Specifically,\napproximately 4 million demonstrations from 23 different scenario types were\ngathered, amounting to over 30,000 hours of driving demonstrations. We\nperformed open-loop evaluations and closed-loop simulation evaluations in 1,400\ndiverse driving demonstrations (1,300 for open-loop and 100 for closed-loop)\nunder stringent assessment conditions. Through experimental analysis, we\ndiscovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law\nrelationship with the amount of training data; (2) a small increase in the\nquantity of long-tailed data can significantly improve the performance for the\ncorresponding scenarios; (3) appropriate scaling of data enables the model to\nachieve combinatorial generalization in novel scenes and actions.

The state-of-the-art\nefficient distillation technique, i.e., SwiftBrushv2 (SBv2), even surpasses the\nteacher model's performance with limited resources. However, our study reveals\nits instability when handling different diffusion model backbones due to using\na fixed guidance scale within the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) loss.\nAnother weakness of the existing one-step diffusion models is the missing\nsupport for negative prompt guidance, which is crucial in practical image\ngeneration. This paper presents SNOOPI, a novel framework designed to address\nthese limitations by enhancing the guidance in one-step diffusion models during\nboth training and inference. First, we effectively enhance training stability\nthrough Proper Guidance-SwiftBrush (PG-SB), which employs a random-scale\nclassifier-free guidance approach. By varying the guidance scale of both\nteacher models, we broaden their output distributions, resulting in a more\nrobust VSD loss that enables SB to perform effectively across diverse backbones\nwhile maintaining competitive performance. Second, we propose a training-free\nmethod called Negative-Away Steer Attention (NASA), which integrates negative\nprompts into one-step diffusion models via cross-attention to suppress\nundesired elements in generated images. Our experimental results show that our\nproposed methods significantly improve baseline models across various metrics.\nRemarkably, we achieve an HPSv2 score of 31.08, setting a new state-of-the-art\nbenchmark for one-step diffusion models.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been crucial in\naligning large language models (LLMs) with human values. Traditionally, RLHF\ninvolves generating responses to a query and using a reward model to assign a\nreward to the entire response. However, this approach faces challenges due to\nits reliance on a single, sparse reward, which makes it challenging for the\nmodel to identify which parts of the sequence contribute most significantly to\nthe final reward. Recent methods have attempted to address this limitation by\nintroducing token-level rewards. However, these methods often rely on either a\ntrained credit assignment model or AI annotators, raising concerns about the\nquality and reliability of the rewards. In this paper, we propose token-level\nreward regularization (T-REG), a novel approach that leverages both\nsequence-level and token-level rewards for preference optimization. Harnessing\nthe self-refinement capabilities of LLMs, our method uses contrastive prompting\nto enable LLMs to self-generate token-level rewards. These self-generated\nrewards then act as reward regularization, guiding the model to more\neffectively distribute sequence-level rewards across tokens. This facilitates\nbetter token-level credit assignment and enhances alignment performance.\nExperiments on the instruction following benchmarks, including Alpaca Eval 2\nand Arena-Hard, show that our method consistently outperforms baseline methods\nby up to 3.8% and 4.4%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Contact-rich bimanual manipulation involves precise coordination of two arms\nto change object states through strategically selected contacts and motions.\nDue to the inherent complexity of these tasks, acquiring sufficient\ndemonstration data and training policies that generalize to unseen scenarios\nremain a largely unresolved challenge. Building on recent advances in planning\nthrough contacts, we introduce Generalizable Planning-Guided Diffusion Policy\nLearning (GLIDE), an approach that effectively learns to solve contact-rich\nbimanual manipulation tasks by leveraging model-based motion planners to\ngenerate demonstration data in high-fidelity physics simulation. Through\nefficient planning in randomized environments, our approach generates\nlarge-scale and high-quality synthetic motion trajectories for tasks involving\ndiverse objects and transformations. We then train a task-conditioned diffusion\npolicy via behavior cloning using these demonstrations. To tackle the\nsim-to-real gap, we propose a set of essential design options in feature\nextraction, task representation, action prediction, and data augmentation that\nenable learning robust prediction of smooth action sequences and generalization\nto unseen scenarios. Through experiments in both simulation and the real world,\nwe demonstrate that our approach can enable a bimanual robotic system to\neffectively manipulate objects of diverse geometries, dimensions, and physical\nproperties.

In situations where many microscopic states become \"lumped\"\nonto the same observable \"state\" or when introducing \"reaction coordinates\" to\nreduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal\nsymmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this\nperspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry,\nand quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the\nmicroscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a\ntechnical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are\ndrawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the\nfield and reflect upon key challenges.",

Integral-field-unit (IFU)\nspectroscopy can provide a spatially resolved view of SN host galaxies and\nserve as a powerful tool to study SN metallicities. While early transient\nsurveys targeted on high star formation rate and metallicity galaxies, recent\nuntargeted, wide-field surveys (e.g., ASAS-SN, ZTF) have discovered large\nnumbers of SNe without this bias. In this work, we construct a large sample of\nSNe discovered by wide-field untargted searches, consisting of 166 SNe of Types\nII(P), IIn, IIb, Ib and Ic at $z \\leq 0.02$ with VLT/MUSE observations. This is\ncurrently the largest CCSN sample with IFU observations. With the strong-line\nmethod, we reveal the spatially-resolved metallicity maps of the SN host\ngalaxies and acquire accurate metallicity measurements for the SN sites,\nfinding a range from $12 + \\log(\\text{O/H}) = 8.1$ to 8.7 dex. And the\nmetallicity distributions for different SN types are very close to each other,\nwith mean and median values of 8.4--8.5 dex. Our large sample size narrows the\n1$\\sigma$ uncertainty down to only 0.05 dex. The apparent metallicity\ndifferences among SN types are all within $\\sim$1$\\sigma$ uncertainties and the\nmetallicity distributions for different SN types are all consistent with being\nrandomly drawn from the same reference distribution. This suggests that\nmetallicity plays a minor role in the origin of different CCSN types and some\nother metallicity-insensitive processes, such as binary interaction, dominate\nthe distinction of CCSN types.",

In the most interesting regime where the\naverage degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices, this algorithm\ncorrectly matches all but a vanishing fraction of vertices with high\nprobability, whenever the edge correlation parameter $s$ satisfies $s^2 >\n\\alpha \\approx 0.338$, where $\\alpha$ is Otter's tree-counting constant.\nMoreover, we extend this to an efficient algorithm for exact graph matching\nwhenever this is information-theoretically possible, positively resolving an\nopen problem of R\\'acz and Sridhar (NeurIPS 2021). Our algorithm generalizes\nthe recent breakthrough work of Mao, Wu, Xu, and Yu (STOC 2023), which is based\non centered subgraph counts of a large family of trees termed chandeliers. A\nmajor technical challenge that we overcome is dealing with the additional\nestimation errors that are necessarily present due to the fact that, in\nrelevant parameter regimes, the latent community partition cannot be exactly\nrecovered from a single graph.

Although computationally\nintensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW\ndetectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds\nof thousands of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events every year with\nsubstantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant\ncomputational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the\ncomputational costs of CBC source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by\nmodeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine\nthe standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative\nbinning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a\none-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require at least billions\nof CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques\ncan reduce this demand to less than millions of core hours, which is as high as\nthe cost of analyzing GW events in the past 10 years.

By quaternary,\nwe mean that the spreading code symbols are drawn from $Z_4$ and are designed\nto be used in conjunction with QPSK modulation. Apart from low auto and\ncrosscorrelation properties, we also require in addition, to our knowledge for\nthe first time, that the spreading code family IZ4$_2$ obtained by taking the\nunion of the component in-phase and quadrature-phase binary spreading codes\nassociated to each quaternary spreading code in MFD$_2$, also have desirable\nlow-correlation properties. We also investigate the balance of the quaternary\nand binary spreading codes.\n  The second part is motivated by an application to the design of spreading\ncode, (in this application termed as ranging codes), having parameters suitable\nfor use in a lunar PNT system. Two lengths that are of particular current\ninterest for a planned lunar PNT satellite system are $2046$ and $10230$. We\nstudy the applicability of a subset IZ4$_{2S}$ of IZ4$_2$ containing balanced\nbinary spreading codes having length $2046$ to such a lunar PNT system. We show\nthat the spreading codes belonging to IZ4$_{2S}$ compare favorably with the\nspreading codes of length $2046$ appearing in a recent issue of Inside GNSS. We\nalso show that the IZ4$_{10}$ spreading code family in which the spreading\ncodes have length $10230$, compares well in comparison with spreading codes of\nlength $10230$ described in this article. In addition, the IZ4$_{10}$ and\nIZ4$_2$ spreading codes have been paired so as to be orthogonal at zero shift\ndespite their different lengths and chipping rates.",

The proposed method\nemploys a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) feature extractor accounting for\ntemporal dependencies in the feature extraction phase, and a bidirectional Long\nShort-term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to leverage bidirectional temporal\ndependencies in both the forward and backward paths of the drive-by vibration\nresponse in condition estimation phase.

The proposed\nLSTM-BiLSTM model offers a versatile tool for various bridge and railway\ninfrastructure conditions monitoring using direct drive-by vibration response\nmeasurements. The results demonstrate the potential of incorporating temporal\nanalysis in the feature extraction phase and emphasize the pivotal role of\nbidirectional temporal information in infrastructure health condition\nestimation.

In this way, it\nenables the cryptocurrency credentials and assets of a single end-user address\nto be freely rented, shared, or pooled. It accomplishes these things privately,\nwith no direct on-chain traces.\n  Liquefaction demonstrates the sweeping consequences of TEE-based key\nencumbrance for the cryptocurrency landscape. Liquefaction can undermine the\nsecurity and economic models of many applications and resources, such as locked\ntokens, DAO voting, airdrops, loyalty points, soulbound tokens, and quadratic\nvoting. It can do so with no on-chain and minimal off-chain visibility.\nConversely, we also discuss beneficial applications of Liquefaction, such as\nprivacy-preserving, cost-efficient DAOs and a countermeasure to dusting\nattacks. Importantly, we describe an existing TEE-based tool that applications\ncan use as a countermeasure to Liquefaction.\n  Our work prompts a wholesale rethinking of existing models and enforcement of\nkey and asset ownership in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have led to significant\nprogress in fast 3D content creation. One common approach is to generate a set\nof multi-view images of an object, and then reconstruct it into a 3D model.\nHowever, this approach bypasses the use of a native 3D representation of the\nobject and is hence prone to geometric artifacts and limited in controllability\nand manipulation capabilities. An alternative approach involves native 3D\ngenerative models that directly produce 3D representations. These models,\nhowever, are typically limited in their resolution, resulting in lower quality\n3D objects. In this work, we bridge the quality gap between methods that\ndirectly generate 3D representations and ones that reconstruct 3D objects from\nmulti-view images. We introduce a multi-view to multi-view diffusion model\ncalled Sharp-It, which takes a 3D consistent set of multi-view images rendered\nfrom a low-quality object and enriches its geometric details and texture. The\ndiffusion model operates on the multi-view set in parallel, in the sense that\nit shares features across the generated views. A high-quality 3D model can then\nbe reconstructed from the enriched multi-view set. By leveraging the advantages\nof both 2D and 3D approaches, our method offers an efficient and controllable\nmethod for high-quality 3D content creation. We demonstrate that Sharp-It\nenables various 3D applications, such as fast synthesis, editing, and\ncontrolled generation, while attaining high-quality assets.",

Due to spectral resolution and detection\nlimitations, velocity differences below 45~km~s$^{-1}$ in binaries and below\n90~km~s$^{-1}$ in the inner binaries of triple systems are challenging to\ndetect.

Fitting\nthe synthetic photometry with various star formation history models, we show\nthat recovered stellar masses are, encouragingly, generally robust to within a\nfactor of ~3 for galaxies in the range M*~10^7-10^9M_sol at z=5-10. These\nresults are in stark contrast to recent work claiming that stellar masses can\nbe underestimated by as much as an order of magnitude in these mass and\nredshift ranges. However, while >90% of masses are recovered to within 0.5dex,\nthere are notable systematic trends, with stellar masses typically\noverestimated for low-mass galaxies (M*<~10^8M_sol) and slightly underestimated\nfor high-mass galaxies (M*>~10^9M_sol). We demonstrate that these trends arise\ndue to the SED fitting code poorly modelling the impact of strong emission\nlines on broadband photometry. These systematic trends, which exist for all\nstar formation history parametrisations tested, have a tilting effect on the\ninferred stellar mass function, with number densities of massive galaxies\nunderestimated (particularly at the lowest redshifts studied) and number\ndensities of lower-mass galaxies typically overestimated. Overall, this work\nsuggests that we should be optimistic about our ability to infer the masses of\nhigh-z galaxies observed with JWST (notwithstanding contamination from AGN) but\ncareful when modelling the impact of strong emission lines on broadband\nphotometry.",

    "abstract": "Large text-to-video models hold immense potential for a wide range of\ndownstream applications. However, these models struggle to accurately depict\ndynamic object interactions, often resulting in unrealistic movements and\nfrequent violations of real-world physics. One solution inspired by large\nlanguage models is to align generated outputs with desired outcomes using\nexternal feedback. This enables the model to refine its responses autonomously,\neliminating extensive manual data collection. In this work, we investigate the\nuse of feedback to enhance the object dynamics in text-to-video models. We aim\nto answer a critical question: what types of feedback, paired with which\nspecific self-improvement algorithms, can most effectively improve text-video\nalignment and realistic object interactions? We begin by deriving a unified\nprobabilistic objective for offline RL finetuning of text-to-video models. This\nperspective highlights how design elements in existing algorithms like KL\nregularization and policy projection emerge as specific choices within a\nunified framework. We then use derived methods to optimize a set of text-video\nalignment metrics (e.g., CLIP scores, optical flow), but notice that they often\nfail to align with human perceptions of generation quality. To address this\nlimitation, we propose leveraging vision-language models to provide more\nnuanced feedback specifically tailored to object dynamics in videos. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that our method can effectively optimize a wide variety\nof rewards, with binary AI feedback driving the most significant improvements\nin video quality for dynamic interactions, as confirmed by both AI and human\nevaluations.

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for scalable, efficient resource management in hybrid\ncloud environments has led to the exploration of AI-driven approaches for\ndynamic resource allocation. This paper presents an AI-driven framework for\nresource allocation among microservices in hybrid cloud platforms. The\nframework employs reinforcement learning (RL)-based resource utilization\noptimization to reduce costs and improve performance. The framework integrates\nAI models with cloud management tools to respond to challenges of dynamic\nscaling and cost-efficient low-latency service delivery. The reinforcement\nlearning model continuously adjusts provisioned resources as required by the\nmicroservices and predicts the future consumption trends to minimize both\nunder- and over-provisioning of resources. Preliminary simulation results\nindicate that using AI in the provision of resources related to costs can\nreduce expenditure by up to 30-40% compared to manual provisioning and\nthreshold-based auto-scaling approaches. It is also estimated that the\nefficiency in resource utilization is expected to improve by 20%-30% with a\ncorresponding latency cut of 15%-20% during the peak demand periods. This study\ncompares the AI-driven approach with existing static and rule-based resource\nallocation methods, demonstrating the capability of this new model to\noutperform them in terms of flexibility and real-time interests. The results\nindicate that reinforcement learning can make optimization of hybrid cloud\nplatforms even better, offering a 25-35% improvement in cost efficiency and the\npower of scaling for microservice-based applications.

An important\nparameter in this model is the singlet-doublet mixing angle ($\\sin\\theta$). All\nthe previous studies have primarily focused on annihilation and co-annihilation\nprocesses for obtaining the correct dark matter relic density, assuming that\nthe singlet and doublet components decouple at the same epoch. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with a\ndependency on the mass of the dark matter.

Practitioners often rely on\nsector and industry classifications such as SIC and GICS codes to gauge\nsimilarity, the former being used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange\nCommission (SEC), and the latter widely used by the investment community. Since\nthese classifications lack granularity and need regular updating, using\nclusters of embeddings of company descriptions has been proposed as a potential\nalternative, but the lack of interpretability in token embeddings poses a\nsignificant barrier to adoption in high-stakes contexts. Sparse Autoencoders\n(SAEs) have shown promise in enhancing the interpretability of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) by decomposing Large Language Model (LLM) activations into\ninterpretable features. Moreover, SAEs capture an LLM's internal representation\nof a company description, as opposed to semantic similarity alone, as is the\ncase with embeddings. We apply SAEs to company descriptions, and obtain\nmeaningful clusters of equities. We benchmark SAE features against SIC-codes,\nIndustry codes, and Embeddings. Our results demonstrate that SAE features\nsurpass sector classifications and embeddings in capturing fundamental company\ncharacteristics. This is evidenced by their superior performance in correlating\nlogged monthly returns - a proxy for similarity - and generating higher Sharpe\nratios in co-integration trading strategies, which underscores deeper\nfundamental similarities among companies.

    "abstract": "Dense subgraph discovery (DSD) is a key graph mining primitive with myriad\napplications including finding densely connected communities which are diverse\nin their vertex composition. In such a context, it is desirable to extract a\ndense subgraph that provides fair representation of the diverse subgroups that\nconstitute the vertex set while incurring a small loss in terms of subgraph\ndensity. Existing methods for promoting fairness in DSD have important\nlimitations - the associated formulations are NP-hard in the worst case and\nthey do not provide flexible notions of fairness, making it non-trivial to\nanalyze the inherent trade-off between density and fairness. In this paper, we\nintroduce two tractable formulations for fair DSD, each offering a different\nnotion of fairness. Our methods provide a structured and flexible approach to\nincorporate fairness, accommodating varying fairness levels. We introduce the\nfairness-induced relative loss in subgraph density as a price of fairness\nmeasure to quantify the associated trade-off. We are the first to study such a\nnotion in the context of detecting fair dense subgraphs. Extensive experiments\non real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods not only match but\nfrequently outperform existing solutions, sometimes incurring even less than\nhalf the subgraph density loss compared to prior art, while achieving the\ntarget fairness levels. Importantly, they excel in scenarios that previous\nmethods fail to adequately handle, i.e., those with extreme subgroup\nimbalances, highlighting their effectiveness in extracting fair and dense\nsolutions.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by\nintegrating external knowledge to reduce hallucinations and incorporate\nup-to-date information without retraining. As an essential part of RAG,\nexternal knowledge bases are commonly built by extracting structured data from\nunstructured PDF documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,\ngiven the imperfect prediction of OCR and the inherent non-uniform\nrepresentation of structured data, knowledge bases inevitably contain various\nOCR noises. In this paper, we introduce OHRBench, the first benchmark for\nunderstanding the cascading impact of OCR on RAG systems. OHRBench includes\n8,561 carefully selected unstructured document images from seven real-world RAG\napplication domains, along with 8,498 Q&A pairs derived from multimodal\nelements in documents, challenging existing OCR solutions used for RAG. To\nbetter understand OCR's impact on RAG systems, we identify two primary types of\nOCR noise: Semantic Noise and Formatting Noise and apply perturbation to\ngenerate a set of structured data with varying degrees of each OCR noise. Using\nOHRBench, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of current OCR solutions\nand reveal that none is competent for constructing high-quality knowledge bases\nfor RAG systems. We then systematically evaluate the impact of these two noise\ntypes and demonstrate the trend relationship between the degree of OCR noise\nand RAG performance. Our OHRBench, including PDF documents, Q&As, and the\nground truth structured data are released at:\nhttps://github.com/opendatalab/OHR-Bench",

In this work we examine the\nclimatological link between Mediterranean cyclones and atmospheric conditions\nconducive to the formation of severe convection and convective hazards\n(convective precipitation, lightning and hail potential). Using ATDnet\nlightning detections we find that, from autumn to spring, 20 to 60% of\nlightning hours over the Mediterranean basin and adjacent land regions are\nassociated with the presence of a nearby cyclone. Based on reanalysis data,\nsevere convective environments, deep, moist convection (i.e., lightning\npotential) and related hazards are frequent in the warm sector of Mediterranean\ncyclones and to the north-east of their centres. In agreement with previous\nliterature, convective processes and hazards peak approximately six hours prior\nto the time of minimum pressure of the cyclone centre. Moreover, severe\nconvective environments are often detected in cyclone categories typical of\ntransition seasons (especially autumn) and summer, while they are rarer in deep\nbaroclinic cyclones with peak occurrence during winter. Finally, we show that\ndynamical cyclone features distinguish regions favourable to deep, moist\nconvection. Warm conveyor belts of Mediterranean cyclones, characterised by\nlarge-scale ascent and located in regions of high thermodynamic instability,\nhave the largest lightning potential. The potential is only half as intense\nalong the cyclones' cold fronts.",

In this paper,\nwe present ExpCTR, a novel framework that integrates large language model based\nexplanation generation directly into the CTR prediction process. Inspired by\nrecent advances in reinforcement learning, we employ two carefully designed\nreward mechanisms, LC alignment, which ensures explanations reflect user\nintentions, and IC alignment, which maintains consistency with traditional\nID-based CTR models. Our approach incorporates an efficient training paradigm\nwith LoRA and a three-stage iterative process.

Firstly, we\nconsider the face lattice, which is the inclusion order of all faces of a\npolytope, and we seek a Hamiltonian cycle in its cover graph, i.e., for any two\nconsecutive faces, one must be a subface of the other, and their dimensions\ndiffer by $1$. We construct such Hamiltonian cycles for hypercubes,\npermutahedra, $B$-permutahedra, associahedra, 3-dimensional polytopes, graph\nassociahedra of chordal graphs, and quotientopes. Secondly, we consider\nfacet-Hamiltonian cycles, which are cycles on the skeleton of a polytope that\nenter and leave every facet exactly once. This notion was recently introduced\nby Akitaya, Cardinal, Felsner, Kleist, and Lauff [SODA 2025], where the authors\nconjectured that $B$-permutahedra admit a facet-Hamiltonian cycle for all\ndimensions. We construct such facet-Hamiltonian cycles in this paper, thus\nestablishing their conjecture as a theorem. A key tool we use are so-called\nrhombic strips, which are certain planar spanning subgraphs of the cover graph\nof the face lattice. Specifically, we construct a rhombic strip in the face\nlattice of the hypercube of any dimension, and characterize the existence of\nrhombic strips in the face lattice of 3-dimensional polytopes. Our\nconstructions yield time- and space-efficient algorithms for computing the\naforementioned cycles and thus for listing the corresponding combinatorial\nobjects, including ordered set partitions and dissections of a convex polygon.",

An identification technique based on\nthresholding of correlation values from particle image correlations is employed\nto detect the cavity. The TBL does not separate at the leeward side of the\ncavity owing to a high boundary layer thickness to maximum cavity thickness\nratio ($\\delta/t_{max}=12$). As a consequence of the cavity geometry, the TBL\nis subjected to alternating streamwise pressure gradients: from an adverse\npressure gradient (APG) to a favourable pressure gradient and back to an APG.\nThe mean streamwise velocity and turbulence stresses over the cavity show that\nthe streamwise pressure gradients and air injection are the dominant\nperturbations to the flow, with streamline curvature concluded to be marginal.\nTwo-point correlations of the wall-normal velocity reveal an increased coherent\nextent over the cavity and a local anisotropy in regions under an APG, distinct\nfrom traditional APG TBLs, suggesting possible history effects.",

To\nmodel the beams, we utilize the Zernike polynomial (ZP), which effectively\ncaptures asymmetric features of the main beam and the different side lobes. Due\nto the symmetric location of the beams, the main features of the beams are\nclosely related to the distance from the center of the feed array, e.g., as the\ndistance increases, side lobes become more pronounced. This modeling pipeline\nleverages the stable drift-scan data to extract beam patterns while accounting\nfor and excluding the reflector's changing effects.

Determining the robustness of image\nwatermarking methods in the ``no-box'' setting, where the attacker is assumed\nto have no knowledge about the watermarking model, is an interesting problem.\nOur main finding is that evading the no-box setting is challenging: the success\nof optimization-based transfer attacks (involving training surrogate models)\nproposed in prior work~\\cite{hu2024transfer} depends on impractical\nassumptions, including (i) aligning the architecture and training\nconfigurations of both the victim and attacker's surrogate watermarking models,\nas well as (ii) a large number of surrogate models with potentially large\ncomputational requirements. Relaxing these assumptions i.e., moving to a more\npragmatic threat model results in a failed attack, with an evasion rate at most\n$21.1\\%$. We show that when the configuration is mostly aligned, a simple\nnon-optimization attack we propose, OFT, with one single surrogate model can\nalready exceed the success of optimization-based efforts. Under the same\n$\\ell_\\infty$ norm perturbation budget of $0.25$, prior\nwork~\\citet{hu2024transfer} is comparable to or worse than OFT in $11$ out of\n$12$ configurations and has a limited advantage on the remaining one.

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have demonstrated significant potential in\nrevolutionizing transportation, yet ensuring their safety and reliability\nremains a critical challenge, especially when exposed to dynamic and\nunpredictable environments. Real-world testing of an Autonomous Driving System\n(ADS) is both expensive and risky, making simulation-based testing a preferred\napproach. In this paper, we propose AVASTRA, a Reinforcement Learning\n(RL)-based approach to generate realistic critical scenarios for testing ADSs\nin simulation environments. To capture the complexity of driving scenarios,\nAVASTRA comprehensively represents the environment by both the internal states\nof an ADS under-test (e.g., the status of the ADS's core components, speed, or\nacceleration) and the external states of the surrounding factors in the\nsimulation environment (e.g., weather, traffic flow, or road condition).\nAVASTRA trains the RL agent to effectively configure the simulation environment\nthat places the AV in dangerous situations and potentially leads it to\ncollisions. We introduce a diverse set of actions that allows the RL agent to\nsystematically configure both environmental conditions and traffic\nparticipants. Additionally, based on established safety requirements, we\nenforce heuristic constraints to ensure the realism and relevance of the\ngenerated test scenarios. AVASTRA is evaluated on two popular simulation maps\nwith four different road configurations. Our results show AVASTRA's ability to\noutperform the state-of-the-art approach by generating 30% to 115% more\ncollision scenarios. Compared to the baseline based on Random Search, AVASTRA\nachieves up to 275% better performance. These results highlight the\neffectiveness of AVASTRA in enhancing the safety testing of AVs through\nrealistic comprehensive critical scenario generation.",

We performed numerical\nsimulations using a modified version of the N-body simulator SyMBA, which\nincludes pebble accretion, type I and II migration, and eccentricity and\ninclination damping. Two different prescriptions for the PA rate were analysed.\nWe find that Earth-like planets are consistently formed around 0.49, 0.70, and\n1.00 M$_\\odot$ stars, irrespective of the pebble accretion model that is used.\nHowever, Earth-like planets seldom remain in the habitable zone, for they\nrapidly migrate to the inner edge of the disc. Furthermore, we find that pebble\naccretion onto small planetesimals cannot produce Earth-mass planets around\n0.09 and 0.20 M$_\\odot$ stars, challenging the proposed narrative of the\nformation of the TRAPPIST-1 system. Although our models can explain the\nformation of Earth-mass planets around Sun-like stars, we find a low likelihood\nof Earth-like planets remaining in the habitable zone.

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents operating in adversarial scenarios face a fundamental\nchallenge: while they may know their adversaries' high-level objectives, such\nas reaching specific destinations within time constraints, the exact policies\nthese adversaries will employ remain unknown. Traditional approaches address\nthis challenge by treating the adversary's state as a partially observable\nelement, leading to a formulation as a Partially Observable Markov Decision\nProcess (POMDP). However, the induced belief-space dynamics in a POMDP require\nknowledge of the system's transition dynamics, which, in this case, depend on\nthe adversary's unknown policy. Our key observation is that while an\nadversary's exact policy is unknown, their behavior is necessarily constrained\nby their mission objectives and the physical environment, allowing us to\ncharacterize the space of possible behaviors without assuming specific\npolicies. In this paper, we develop Task-Aware Behavior Fields (TAB-Fields), a\nrepresentation that captures adversary state distributions over time by\ncomputing the most unbiased probability distribution consistent with known\nconstraints. We construct TAB-Fields by solving a constrained optimization\nproblem that minimizes additional assumptions about adversary behavior beyond\nmission and environmental requirements. We integrate TAB-Fields with standard\nplanning algorithms by introducing TAB-conditioned POMCP, an adaptation of\nPartially Observable Monte Carlo Planning. Through experiments in simulation\nwith underwater robots and hardware implementations with ground robots, we\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to\nbaselines that either assume specific adversary policies or neglect mission\nconstraints altogether.

These advancements are enabled by AstroPix, a\nsilicon monolithic active pixel sensor, in the tracker and custom dual-gain\nsilicon photomultipliers and front-end electronics in the calorimeter. This\neffort builds on design work for the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray\nObservatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X) concept that was submitted the 2021 MIDEX\nAnnouncement of Opportunity.

In this scenario, it is assumed that some users are able to\nharvest power from radio frequency (RF) signals to recharge batteries through\nwireless power transfer from the transmitter, while others are served\nsimultaneously with data transmission. The criterion driving the optimization\nand design of the system is based on the weighted sum rate for the users being\nserved with data. At the same time, constraints stating minimum per-user\nharvested powers are included in the optimization problem. This paper derives\nthe structure of the optimal transmit covariance matrices in the case where\nboth types of users are present simultaneously in the network, particularizing\nthe results to the cases where either only harvesting nodes or only information\nusers are to be served. The tradeoff between the achieved weighted sum rate and\nthe powers harvested by the user terminals is analyzed and evaluated using the\nrate-power (R-P) region. Finally, we propose a two-stage user grouping\nmechanism that decides which users should be scheduled to receive information\nand which users should be configured to harvest energy from the RF signals in\neach particular scheduling period, this being one of the main contributions of\nthis paper.",

In this\narticle, we derive a variant of the Unruh effect involving two distinct\naccelerating observers and aim to address the following questions: (i) Is it\npossible to selectively thermalize a subset of momentum modes for the case of\nmassless scalar fields, and (ii) Is it possible to excite only the left-handed\nmassless fermions while keeping right-handed fermions in a vacuum state or vice\nversa? To this end, we consider a Rindler wedge $R_1$ constructed from a class\nof accelerating observers and another Rindler wedge $R_2$ (with $R_2 \\subset\nR_1$) constructed from another class of accelerating observers such that the\nwedge $R_2$ is displaced along a null direction w.r.t $R_1$ by a parameter\n$\\Delta$. By first considering a massless scalar field in the $R_1$ vacuum, we\nshow that if we choose the displacement $\\Delta$ along one null direction, the\npositive momentum modes are thermalized, whereas negative momentum modes remain\nin vacuum (and vice versa if we choose the displacement along the other null\ndirection). We then consider a massless fermionic field in a vacuum state in\n$R_1$ and show that the reduced state in $R_2$ is such that the left-handed\nfermions are excited and are thermal for large frequencies. In contrast, the\nright-handed fermions have negligible particle density and vice versa. We argue\nthat the toy models involving shifted Rindler spacetime may provide insights\ninto the particle excitation aspects of evolving horizons and the possibility\nof Rindler spacetime having a quantum strand of hair. Additionally, based on\nour work, we hypothesize that massless fermions underwent selective chiral\nexcitations during the radiation-dominated era of cosmology.",

We\nstacked ALMA band 6 and 7 observations of 4464 galaxies covered by the A3COSMOS\ndatabase and used the measurements as constraints to perform UV-to-FIR SED\nmodelling. We obtain tentative signals for the brightest UV galaxies\n(MUV<-19mag) as well as for the most massive ones (log Mstar>9) at 6<z<7, and\nupper limits for fainter (MUV>-19mag), lower mass sources (log Mstar<9), and at\nhigher redshift (z>7). Fitting these 6<z<7 galaxies with ALMA constraints\nresults in lower star formation rates (-0.4dex) and FUV attenuation (-0.5mag)\nfor galaxies with log Mstar>8, compared to the fit without FIR. We extend the\nLIR vs MUV relation down to MUV=-19mag and show a tentative breakdown of the\nrelation at fainter UV magnitudes. The positions of the JADES z~6.5 sample on\nthe IRX versus beta and IRX versus Mstar diagrams are consistent with those of\nthe ALPINE (z~5.5) and REBELS (z~6.5) samples, suggesting that the dust\ncomposition and content of our mass-selected sample are similar to these\nUV-selected galaxies. Extending our analysis of the infrared properties to z>7\ngalaxies, we find a non-evolution of beta with redshift in the MUV range probed\nby our sample (-17.24+/-0.62) and highlight the fact that samples from the\nliterature are not representative of the bulk of galaxy populations at z>6.

One such effect is the leakage of polarised foregrounds into the\nmeasured intensity signal: polarised foreground emission undergoes Faraday\nrotation as it passes through the magnetic fields of the interstellar medium,\nimprinting a chromatic structure in the relevant frequency range which\ncomplicates the extraction of the cosmological HI absorption feature.

Notably, GPT-4 outperforms other tested\nLLMs, but further revisions are still necessary to reach the examination\nstandard. Furthermore, we demonstrate the inconsistency between automated and\nhuman evaluation results, suggesting that GPT-4-based automated evaluation has\nthe highest correlation with human judgment.

Nevertheless, good models\nmust simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work,\nwe showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of\ninflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid\n$\\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two\npotential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the\nscalar power spectrum, $\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first\nconstrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for\n$\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits\non $\\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating\nphase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale\nconstraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller\nscales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type\nand has amplitude $f_\\text{NL}\\sim \\mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that\nnon-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level\n$\\mathcal{P}_\\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of\ninduced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us\nto further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which\nover-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to\nsignificant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for\nLISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical\nforegrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at\ndifferent scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations\nand theoretical consistency requirements.",

However, a trained model remains largely\nblack-box; little do we know about the roles of its components in exhibiting a\nconcept such as objects or styles. Recent works employ causal tracing to\nlocalize knowledge-storing layers in generative models without showing how\nother layers contribute to the target concept. In this work, we approach\ndiffusion models' interpretability problem from a more general perspective and\npose a question: \\textit{``How do model components work jointly to demonstrate\nknowledge?''}. To answer this question, we decompose diffusion models using\ncomponent attribution, systematically unveiling the importance of each\ncomponent (specifically the model parameter) in generating a concept. The\nproposed framework, called \\textbf{C}omponent \\textbf{A}ttribution for\n\\textbf{D}iffusion Model (CAD), discovers the localization of concept-inducing\n(positive) components, while interestingly uncovers another type of components\nthat contribute negatively to generating a concept, which is missing in the\nprevious knowledge localization work. Based on this holistic understanding of\ndiffusion models, we introduce two fast, inference-time model editing\nalgorithms, CAD-Erase and CAD-Amplify; in particular, CAD-Erase enables erasure\nand CAD-Amplify allows amplification of a generated concept by ablating the\npositive and negative components, respectively, while retaining knowledge of\nother concepts. Extensive experimental results validate the significance of\nboth positive and negative components pinpointed by our framework,\ndemonstrating the potential of providing a complete view of interpreting\ngenerative models.

One consequence is the existence of a\nlarge shift of the transition with respect to the bare atomic frequency. In the\nlinear optics regime (low light intensity), one observes a spectroscopic shift\nof the Lorentzian atomic line often called the collective Lamb shift. For\nstronger driving, many excitations are present in the system rendering the\ncalculation of this shift theoretically challenging, but its understanding is\nimportant for instance when performing Ramsey spectroscopy in optical clocks.\nHere we report on the study of the collective optical response of a\none-dimensional array of 30 dysprosium atoms. We drive the atoms on the narrow\nintercombination transition isolating a 2-level system, and measure the atomic\nstate with single-shot state readout using a broad transition. In the linear\noptics regime, we measure the shift of the resonance in steady state due to\ndipole interactions, and measure how this shift depends on the interatomic\ndistance. We further resolve at the single atom level how the excitation is\ndistributed over the array. Then, on the same transition we perform Ramsey\nspectroscopy \\emph{i.\\,e.}~away from the linear regime.

The production of\nthese $U$-bosons occurs via Dalitz decays of pions, $\\eta$-mesons,\n$\\omega$-mesons, Delta resonances, as well as from the decays of vector mesons\nand $K^+$ mesons. This analysis provides an upper limit on $\\epsilon^2(M_U)$\nand offers insights into the accuracy required for future experimental searches\nfor dark photons through dilepton experiments.",

In this paper, we address the problem of robust federated\nlearning in the presence of such attacks by formulating the training task as a\nbi-level optimization problem. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the\nresilience of consensus-based bi-level optimization (CB$^2$O), an interacting\nmulti-particle metaheuristic optimization method, in adversarial settings.\nSpecifically, we provide a global convergence analysis of CB$^2$O in mean-field\nlaw in the presence of malicious agents, demonstrating the robustness of\nCB$^2$O against a diverse range of attacks. Thereby, we offer insights into how\nspecific hyperparameter choices enable to mitigate adversarial effects. On the\npractical side, we extend CB$^2$O to the clustered federated learning setting\nby proposing FedCB$^2$O, a novel interacting multi-particle system, and design\na practical algorithm that addresses the demands of real-world applications.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of the FedCB$^2$O algorithm\nagainst label-flipping attacks in decentralized clustered federated learning\nscenarios, showcasing its effectiveness in practical contexts.",

An intuitive plausibility\nscore selects the best hypothesis based on occupancy using a 2D height map.\nAfterwards, we integrate the registration results in a continuous-time\nspline-based pose graph optimizer with LiDAR odometry and further sensing\nmodalities to obtain globally consistent, georeferenced trajectories and maps.\nWe evaluate the viability of our approach on multiple flights captured at two\ndistinct testing sites.

While unimodal image-based\napproaches show promise, they often struggle with limitations such as high\nintra-class variance and inter-class similarity. Incorporating textual\ninformation can enhance classification by providing additional context and\nsemantic understanding, but manual text annotation is labor-intensive and\ncostly. In this work, we propose a novel RSSC framework that integrates text\ndescriptions generated by large vision-language models (VLMs) as an auxiliary\nmodality without incurring expensive manual annotation costs. To fully leverage\nthe latent complementarities between visual and textual data, we propose a dual\ncross-attention-based network to fuse these modalities into a unified\nrepresentation. Extensive experiments with both quantitative and qualitative\nevaluation across five RSSC datasets demonstrate that our framework\nconsistently outperforms baseline models. We also verify the effectiveness of\nVLM-generated text descriptions compared to human-annotated descriptions.\nAdditionally, we design a zero-shot classification scenario to show that the\nlearned multimodal representation can be effectively utilized for unseen class\nclassification.

In our work, we propose WEM-GAN, in\nshort for wavelet-based expression manipulation GAN, which puts more efforts on\npreserving the details of the original image in the editing process. Firstly,\nwe take advantage of the wavelet transform technique and combine it with our\ngenerator with a U-net autoencoder backbone, in order to improve the\ngenerator's ability to preserve more details of facial features. Secondly, we\nalso implement the high-frequency component discriminator, and use\nhigh-frequency domain adversarial loss to further constrain the optimization of\nour model, providing the generated face image with more abundant details.\nAdditionally, in order to narrow the gap between generated facial expressions\nand target expressions, we use residual connections between encoder and\ndecoder, while also using relative action units (AUs) several times.

    "abstract": "Space missions, particularly complex, large-scale exploration campaigns, can\noften involve many discrete decisions or events in their concepts of\noperations. Whilst a variety of methods exist for the optimisation of\ncontinuous variables in mission design, the inherent presence of discrete\nevents in mission ConOps disrupts the possibility of using methods that are\ndependent on having well-defined, continuous mathematical expressions to define\nthe systems. Typically, mission architects will circumvent this problem by\nsolving the system optimisation for every permutation of the categorical\ndecisions if practical, or use metaheuristic solvers if not. However, this can\nbe prohibitively expensive in terms of computation time. Alternatively,\ncategorical decisions in optimisation problems can be expressed using binary\nvariables. If implemented naively, commercially available MILP solvers are\nstill slow to solve such a problem. Problems of this class can be solved more\nefficiently using column generation methods. Here, restricted problems are\ncreated by removing significant numbers of variables. The restricted problem is\nsolved, and the unused variables are priced to test which, if any, could\nimprove the objective of the restricted problem if they were to be added.\nColumn generation methods are problem-specific, and so there is no guaranteed\nsolution to these categorical problems. As such, the following paper proposes\nguidelines for defining restricted problems representing space exploration\nmission concepts of operations. The column generation process is described and\nthen applied to two case studies: a ConOps for a crewed Mars mission, in which\nthe design, assembly, and staging of the trans-Martian spacecraft is modelled\nusing discrete decisions; and the payload delivery scheduling of translunar\nlogistics in the context of an extended Artemis surface exploration campaign.",

At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based\ncontroller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles\nnear bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired\ntime-headways are then used by adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to adjust\ntheir following distance.

We concentrate on the semi-classical regime, where the de Broglie\nwavelength is much smaller than the size of the system. We find that depending\non the strength and scale of the self-interactions, the system can form\nsolitons of the Thomas-Fermi type (dominated by self-interactions) or of the\nFuzzy Dark Matter type (dominated by the quantum pressure). The system can also\ndisplay transitions from a Thomas-Fermi soliton to a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton\nas the former becomes unstable. We show that these behaviours can be understood\nfrom a simple Gaussian ansatz. We find that even in cases where the\nself-interactions are always subdominant they can play a critical role, by\nproviding a small density boost that is enough to generate the seed for the\nformation of a Fuzzy Dark Matter soliton at much later times.

    "abstract": "Recent observations reveal a rapid dust build-up in high-redshift galaxies (z\n> 4), challenging current models of galaxy formation. While our understanding\nof dust production and destruction in the interstellar medium (ISM) is\nadvancing, probing baryonic processes in the early Universe remains a complex\ntask. We characterize the evolution of 98 z~5 star-forming galaxies observed as\npart of the ALPINE survey by constraining the physical processes underpinning\nthe gas and dust production, consumption, and destruction in their ISM. We make\nuse of chemical evolution models to simultaneously reproduce the observed dust\nand gas content. For each galaxy, we estimate initial gas mass, inflows and\noutflows, and efficiencies of dust growth and destruction. We test the models\nwith the canonical Chabrier and top-heavy initial mass functions (IMFs), with\nthe latter enabling rapid dust production on shorter timescales. Our models\nsuccessfully reproduce gas and dust content in older galaxies (> 600 Myr)\nregardless of the IMF, with Type II SNe as the primary dust source and no dust\ngrowth in ISM with moderate inflow of primordial gas. In case of\nintermediate-age galaxies (300 - 600 Myr), we reproduce the gas and dust\ncontent through Type II SNe and dust growth in ISM, though we observe an\nover-prediction of dust mass in older galaxies, potentially indicating an\nunaccounted dust destruction mechanism and/or an overestimation of the observed\ndust masses. The number of young galaxies (< 300 Myr) reproduced, increases for\nmodels assuming top-heavy IMF but with maximal prescriptions of dust\nproduction. Galactic outflows are necessary to reproduce observed gas and dust\nmasses. The Chabrier IMF models reproduce 65% of galaxies, while top-heavy IMF\nmodels improve this to 93%, easing tensions with observations. Upcoming JWST\ndata will refine these models by resolving degeneracies in intrinsic galaxy\nproperties.",

VAMoE\naddresses these challenges by leveraging a hybrid architecture of experts,\nwhere each expert specializes in capturing distinct subpatterns of atmospheric\nvariables (temperature, humidity, wind speed). Moreover, the proposed method\nemploys a variable adaptive gating mechanism to dynamically select and combine\nrelevant experts based on the input context, enabling efficient knowledge\ndistillation and parameter sharing. This design significantly reduces\ncomputational overhead while maintaining high forecast accuracy. Experiments on\nreal world ERA5 dataset demonstrate that VAMoE performs comparable against SoTA\nmodels in both short term (1 days) and long term (5 days) forecasting tasks,\nwith only about 25% of trainable parameters and 50% of the initial training\ndata.",

    "abstract": "HISs have recently shown the ability to support leaky waves, and to excite\nplasmonic and HIS resonance frequency modes for use as an antenna. In this\npaper, we analyzed, designed, and fabricated a TMA by directly feeding\nedge-located HIS cells through a microstrip feeding network. In contrast to\nother metasurface antennas that necessitate an external antenna to excite\nmetasurfaces, our approach is inspired by the TMA design methodology that\ndirectly feeds the HIS cells rather than using it as a reflector. We developed\na circuit model for the proposed structure and compared the results with those\nobtained from full-wave simulations. In addition, our further objective was to\nsimplify the structure based on the working principle of the proposed antenna.\nThis objective was achieved by converting square patches into parallel strip\nlines, leading to an aperture efficiency of 0.77. This simplification also\ncreates additional space to explore various resonant patterns on the top\nsurface and the feeding network on the bottom surface of the TMA. Full-wave\nsimulation results indicate that, despite the compact dimensions of the\nproposed array with 64 electrically small patch resonators\n(1.84{\\lambda}*1.84{\\lambda}*0.032{\\lambda}, where{\\lambda}is the free space\nwavelength at 6.0 GHz), it achieves a realized gain, HPBW of about 15.1 dBi and\n28{\\deg} respectively at 6 GHz. Finally, we constructed a prototype and\nconducted measurements to validate the design. Measured results demonstrate\ngood agreement with simulation ones with a gain of about 13.5 (+-0.5) dBi and a\nHPBW of 27{\\deg} at 6 GHz. The proposed TMA is scaled to fit within the\nrequired dimensions for smart handheld devices at higher frequencies, while\nmaintaining high gain capability. The design s scalability, single-feed, and\ncompact footprint make it optimal for diverse wireless communication systems,\nsuch as car to car communications.",

In the\nreciprocal TSAIM, we observe the emergence of a high-density parallel flocking\nstate, a feature not seen in previous flocking models.

Magnetoelectric\n(ME) wireless power transfer (WPT) has emerged as a promising approach for\npowering miniature bio-implants because of its remarkable efficiency, safety\nlimit, and misalignment tolerance. However, achieving low-power and\nhigh-quality uplink communication using ME remains a challenge. This paper\npresents a pulse-width modulated (PWM) ME backscatter uplink communication\nenabled by a switched-capacitor energy extraction (SCEE) technique. The SCEE\nrapidly extracts and dissipates the kinetic energy within the ME transducer\nduring its ringdown period, enabling time-domain PWM in ME backscatter. Various\ncircuit techniques are presented to realize SCEE with low power consumption.\nThis paper also describes the high-order modeling of ME transducers to\nfacilitate the design and analysis, which shows good matching with measurement.\nOur prototyping system includes a millimeter-scale ME implant with a fully\nintegrated system-on-chip (SoC) and a portable transceiver for power transfer\nand bidirectional communication. SCEE is proven to induce >50% amplitude\nreduction within 2 ME cycles, leading to a PWM ME backscatter uplink with 17.73\nkbps data rate and 0.9 pJ/bit efficiency.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic scenes with large-scale and complex motions remains a\nsignificant challenge. Recent techniques like Neural Radiance Fields and 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promise but still struggle with scenes\ninvolving substantial movement. This paper proposes RelayGS, a novel method\nbased on 3DGS, specifically designed to represent and reconstruct highly\ndynamic scenes. Our RelayGS learns a complete 4D representation with canonical\n3D Gaussians and a compact motion field, consisting of three stages. First, we\nlearn a fundamental 3DGS from all frames, ignoring temporal scene variations,\nand use a learnable mask to separate the highly dynamic foreground from the\nminimally moving background. Second, we replicate multiple copies of the\ndecoupled foreground Gaussians from the first stage, each corresponding to a\ntemporal segment, and optimize them using pseudo-views constructed from\nmultiple frames within each segment. These Gaussians, termed Relay Gaussians,\nact as explicit relay nodes, simplifying and breaking down large-scale motion\ntrajectories into smaller, manageable segments. Finally, we jointly learn the\nscene's temporal motion and refine the canonical Gaussians learned from the\nfirst two stages.

We show a tight information-theoretic bound of $\\tfrac{2}{3}$\nfor general monotone submodular functions, and an improved (also tight) bound\nof $\\tfrac{3}{4}$ for coverage functions.

In this study,\nwe demonstrate the direct generation of low-noise light from an optoelectronic\noscillator (OEO). By minimizing the delay in the optoelectronic link and\nemploying a high-quality optical resonator, an OEO can simultaneously generate\nboth a low-phase-noise optical oscillation that is resilient to phase\nfluctuations of its pump laser, and a radio frequency (RF) oscillation that\ncaptures these fluctuations. We leverage these RF-domain fluctuations to\nimplement a high-performance feedback loop, which stabilizes the pump laser and\nsignificantly enhances the performance of optical oscillation. This approach\nachieves an outstanding phase noise level of -100 dBc/Hz at a 1 kHz offset and\nan integrated linewidth as narrow as 0.23 Hz. The integration of optoelectronic\noscillation and feedback loop provides significant broadband noise suppression\ncompared to conventional schemes for generating narrow-linewidth light, paving\nthe way for developments in fields such as coherent optical communications,\natomic spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum optics.",

In numerical analysis points and weights\nresulting from maximal determinants turned out to be useful for quadrature and\ninterpolation.

We present a direct and\nconstructive approach resulting in a discrete measure with at most $N \\leq\nn^2+1$ atoms, which discretely and accurately subsamples the $L_2$-norm of\ncomplex-valued functions contained in a given $n$-dimensional subspace. This\napproach can as well be used for the reconstruction of functions from general\nRKHS in $L_2$ where one only has access to the most important eigenfunctions.\nWe verifiably and deterministically construct points and weights for a weighted\nleast squares recovery procedure and pay in the rate of convergence compared to\nearlier optimal, however probabilistic approaches.

In\nthis paper, we introduce OODFace, which explores the OOD challenges faced by\nfacial recognition models from two perspectives: common corruptions and\nappearance variations. We systematically design 30 OOD scenarios across 9 major\ncategories tailored for facial recognition. By simulating these challenges on\npublic datasets, we establish three robustness benchmarks: LFW-C/V, CFP-FP-C/V,\nand YTF-C/V. We then conduct extensive experiments on 19 facial recognition\nmodels and 3 commercial APIs, along with extended physical experiments on face\nmasks to assess their robustness. Next, we explore potential solutions from two\nperspectives: defense strategies and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Based on\nthe results, we draw several key insights, highlighting the vulnerability of\nfacial recognition systems to OOD data and suggesting possible solutions.\nAdditionally, we offer a unified toolkit that includes all corruption and\nvariation types, easily extendable to other datasets. We hope that our\nbenchmarks and findings can provide guidance for future improvements in facial\nrecognition model robustness.",

Understanding crystal plasticity\nat micro-scale opens the door to new engineering applications, such as\nmicroscale machining. In this work, a new approach is proposed to account for\nthe intermittence of plastic deformation while remaining within the framework\nof continuum mechanics. We introduce a material parameter, the plastic\ndeformation threshold, denoted as $\\Delta p_{min}$, corresponding to the\nplastic deformation carried by the minimal plastic deformation burst within the\nmaterial.

The model is presented within the framework of small\ndeformations for von Mises plasticity. To highlight the main features of the\napproach, the plastic strain increment is calculated using normality rule and\nconsistency conditions, and is accepted only if it exceeds $\\Delta p_{min}$. To\nachieve this, a time-discontinuous generalization of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker\n(KKT) conditions is proposed.

We use\na recently given framework which expresses the measurable quantities of a\nquantum theory as a weighted sum over paths in the theory's phase space. If\nthis framework is applied to a field theory on a spacetime foliated by a\nhypersurface $\\Sigma,$ the choice of a codimension-2 surface $B$ without\nboundary contained in $\\Sigma$ specifies a submanifold in the phase space. We\nshow here that this submanifold is naturally restricted to obey an entropy\nbound if the field theory is diffeomorphism-invariant. We prove this\nrestriction to arise by considering the quantum-mechanical sum of paths in\nphase space and exploiting the interplay of the commutativity of the sum with\ndiffeomorphism-invariance. The formulation of the entropy bound, which we state\nand derive in detail, involves a functional $K$ on the submanifold associated\nto $B.$ We give an explicit construction of $K$ in terms of the Lagrangian. The\ngravitational entropy bound then states: For any real $\\frac{\\lambda}{\\hbar},$\nconsider the set of states where $K$ takes a value not bigger than $\\lambda$\nand let $V$ denote the phase space volume of this set.

To bridge the age gap between the GYSOs ($\\le$5 Myr) and the\nDYSOs (10-20 Myr), we conducted a survey to search for new YSOs in this\ndirection. Based on infrared color excesses and Li I absorption lines, we\nidentified 145 new YSOs. Combining these with the previously identified GYSOs\nand DYSOs, we constructed a sample of 519 YSOs that encompasses the entire\nregion. Subsequently, we calculated the ages of the sample based on their\nproximity to the local bubble. The age versus Distance to the Local Bubble\n($D_{\\rm LB}$) relationship for the DYSOs shows a clear trend: the farther they\nare from the Local Bubble, the younger they are, which is consistent with the\nsupernovae-driven formation scenario of the Local Bubble. The GYSOs also\nexhibit a mild age versus $D_{\\rm LB}$ trend. However, they are significantly\nyounger and are mostly confined to distances of 120 to 220 pc.

The 1d model offers an easier and more efficient way to\nanalyze axisymmetric necking in a dielectric membrane in the linear, weakly\nnonlinear and fully nonlinear regimes.

Other methods\nincorporate visual, geometric, or semantic heuristics for the association but\noften lack robustness. In this work, we introduce BYE, a class-agnostic,\nper-scene point cloud encoder that removes the need for predefined categories,\nshape priors, or extensive association datasets. Trained on only a single\nsequence of exploration data, BYE can efficiently perform object association in\ndynamically changing scenes. We further propose an ensembling scheme combining\nthe semantic strengths of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the scene-specific\nexpertise of BYE, achieving a 7% improvement and a 95% success rate in object\nassociation tasks.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an efficient and scalable framework for Range Filtered\nApproximate Nearest Neighbors Search (RF-ANNS) over high-dimensional vectors\nassociated with attribute values. Given a query vector $q$ and a range $[l,\nh]$, RF-ANNS aims to find the approximate $k$ nearest neighbors of $q$ among\ndata whose attribute values fall within $[l, h]$. Existing methods including\npre-, post-, and hybrid filtering strategies that perform attribute range\nfiltering before, after, or during the ANNS process, all suffer from\nsignificant performance degradation when query ranges shift. Though building\ndedicated indexes for each strategy and selecting the best one based on the\nquery range can address this problem, it leads to index consistency and\nmaintenance issues.\n  Our framework, called UNIFY, constructs a unified Proximity Graph-based\n(PG-based) index that seamlessly supports all three strategies. In UNIFY, we\nintroduce SIG, a novel Segmented Inclusive Graph, which segments the dataset by\nattribute values. It ensures the PG of objects from any segment combinations is\na sub-graph of SIG, thereby enabling efficient hybrid filtering by\nreconstructing and searching a PG from relevant segments. Moreover, we present\nHierarchical Segmented Inclusive Graph (HSIG), a variant of SIG which\nincorporates a hierarchical structure inspired by HNSW to achieve logarithmic\nhybrid filtering complexity. We also implement pre- and post-filtering for HSIG\nby fusing skip list connections and compressed HNSW edges into the hierarchical\ngraph. Experimental results show that UNIFY delivers state-of-the-art RF-ANNS\nperformance across small, mid, and large query ranges.",

Its subject is to investigate ways to embed quantum\nHilbert spaces into a physical system such that this subspace is robust against\nsmall imperfections in the physical systems. This task is exceedingly complex:\nfor one, this is due to the vast diversity of possible physical systems with\ndifferent structure to use. For another, every physical setting also comes with\nits own imperfections that need to be protected against. Bred by the complexity\nof a technological ambition, research on quantum error correction has developed\ninto a large field of research that ranges from engineering of small systems\nwith a single photon to the creation of macroscopic topological phases of\nmatter and models of complex emergent physics. A quintessential tool in quantum\nerror correction is the stabilizer formalism, which tames quantum systems by\nenforcing symmetries. A Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code is a stabilizer\ncode that creates a logical subspace within an infinite dimensional Hilbert\nspace by endowing it with translational symmetries. While in practice the\ninfinitude of the Hilbert space, as well as the infinitude of the translational\nsymmetry group are considered as obstacles for implementation, in theory these\nare precisely the features that make the theory of GKP codes particularly rich,\nwell behaved and well-connected to fascinating topics in mathematics. The\npurpose of this thesis is to explore these connections: to understand the\ncoding theoretic and practical properties of GKP codes, utilizing its rich\nmathematical foundation, and to provide a foundation for future research.

With the advent of large-scale surveys and simulations, remarkable\nprogress has been made in the last few decades. Despite this, the physical\nprocesses behind the phenomena, and particularly their importance, remain far\nfrom known, as correlations have primarily been established rather than the\nunderlying causality. We address this challenge by applying the causal\ninference framework. Specifically, we tackle the fundamental open question of\nwhether galaxy formation and evolution depends more on nature (i.e., internal\nprocesses) or nurture (i.e., external processes), by estimating the causal\neffect of environment on star-formation rate in the IllustrisTNG simulations.\nTo do so, we develop a comprehensive causal model and employ cutting-edge\ntechniques from epidemiology to overcome the long-standing problem of\ndisentangling nature and nurture. We find that the causal effect is negative\nand substantial, with environment suppressing the SFR by a maximal factor of\n$\\sim100$. While the overall effect at $z=0$ is negative, in the early\nuniverse, environment is discovered to have a positive impact, boosting star\nformation by a factor of $\\sim10$ at $z\\sim1$ and by even greater amounts at\nhigher redshifts. Furthermore, we show that: (i) nature also plays an important\nrole, as ignoring it underestimates the causal effect in intermediate-density\nenvironments by a factor of $\\sim2$, (ii) controlling for the stellar mass at a\nsnapshot in time, as is common in the literature, is not only insufficient to\ndisentangle nature and nurture but actually has an adverse effect, though (iii)\nstellar mass is an adequate proxy of the effects of nature. Finally, this work\nmay prove a useful blueprint for extracting causal insights in other fields\nthat deal with dynamical systems with closed feedback loops, such as the\nEarth's climate.",

To this\nend, a sliding manifold is introduced to achieve the sum of local gradients\napproaching zero, based on which a distributed protocol is derived to reach a\nconsensus minimizing the global cost. A novel approach for convergence analysis\nis derived in a unified settling time framework, resulting in an algorithm that\ncan precisely converge to the optimal solution at the prescribed time. The\nmethod is interesting as it simply requires the primal states to be shared over\nthe network, which implies less communication requirements. The result is\nextended to scenarios with time-varying objective function, by introducing\nlocal gradients prediction and non-smooth consensus terms.

    "abstract": "Cliques, groups of fully connected nodes in a network, are often used to\nstudy group dynamics of complex systems. In real-world settings, group dynamics\noften have a temporal component. For example, conference attendees moving from\none group conversation to another. Recently, maximal clique enumeration methods\nhave been introduced that add temporal (and frequency) constraints, to account\nfor such phenomena. These methods enumerate so called (delta,gamma)-maximal\ncliques. In this work, we introduce an efficient (delta,gamma)-maximal clique\nenumeration algorithm, that extends gamma from a frequency constraint to a more\nversatile weighting constraint. Additionally, we introduce a definition of\n(delta,gamma)-cliques, that resolves a problem of existing definitions in the\ntemporal domain. Our approach, which was inspired by a state-of-the-art\ntwo-phase approach, introduces a more efficient initial (stretching) phase.\nSpecifically, we reduce the time complexity of this phase to be linear with\nrespect to the number of temporal edges. Furthermore, we introduce a new\napproach to the second (bulking) phase, which allows us to efficiently prune\nsearch tree branches. Consequently, in experiments we observe speed-ups, often\nby several order of magnitude, on various (large) real-world datasets. Our\nalgorithm vastly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods for temporal\nnetworks, while also extending applicability to weighted networks.",

Given $Q/M$ and\n$r_0$, we choose $q/m$ so that the gravitational attraction between body and\nparticle is balanced by the electrostatic repulsion; the system can then be\nmaintained in a static state. The multipole moments are defined in a setting in\nwhich the body's self-gravity is allowed to be strong, but the mutual gravity\nbetween body and companion is required to be weak. In this setting, the body is\ndescribed in full general relativity, in terms of a perturbed metric and\nelectromagnetic potential characterized by tidal constants, and the mutual\ngravity is described within the post-Newtonian approximation to general\nrelativity, in terms of objects with a multipole structure. Matching the\ndifferent descriptions of the same field delivers a relation between the tidal\nconstants and the multipole moments. In our implementation of this program, the\ncalculation is performed in full Einstein-Maxwell theory (as a linearized\nperturbation of the unperturbed field), without appeal to a post-Newtonian\napproximation. After the fact we take $M/r_0$ to be small and carry out an\nexpansion of the metric in powers of $M/r$ to obtain the multipole moments and\nassociated Love numbers. The calculations are performed for a body made up of a\nperfect fluid with a uniform ratio of charge to mass densities, governed by a\npolytropic equation of state. We show that the Love numbers of a charged body\nin a situation of balanced gravitational and electrostatic forces are negative.\nThe statement remains true even when $Q/M$ is very small, and we conclude that\nthe tidal deformability of a charged body is radically different from that of\nan uncharged object, for which the Love numbers are positive.",

Currently, diagnostic methods mainly rely\non questionnaire surveys and behavioral observations, which are prone to\nmisdiagnosis due to their subjective nature. With advancements in medical\nimaging, MR imaging-based diagnostics have emerged as a more objective\nalternative. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Neural Network model for\nASD identification, termed ASD-HNet, which hierarchically extracts features\nfrom functional brain networks based on resting-state functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. This hierarchical approach enhances the\nextraction of brain representations, improving diagnostic accuracy and aiding\nin the identification of brain regions associated with ASD. Specifically,\nfeatures are extracted at three levels: (1) the local region of interest (ROI)\nscale, (2) the community scale, and (3) the global representation scale. At the\nROI scale, graph convolution is employed to transfer features between ROIs. At\nthe community scale, functional gradients are introduced, and a K-Means\nclustering algorithm is applied to group ROIs with similar functional gradients\ninto communities. Features from ROIs within the same community are then\nextracted to characterize the communities. At the global representation scale,\nwe extract global features from the whole community-scale brain networks to\nrepresent the entire brain.

It\ndynamically adjusts the number and blend weights of neural head bases,\naccording to both shared and specific traits of the target person over ages.\n(2) Dynamic 2D Gaussian Splatting (DNA-2DGS), an extension of Gaussian\nsplatting representation, to model head motion deformations like facial\nexpressions without losing the realism of rendering and reconstruction.\nDNA-2DGS includes a set of controllable 2D oriented planar Gaussian disks that\nutilize the priors from parametric model, and move/rotate with the change of\nexpression. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we show TimeWalker's\nability to reconstruct and animate avatars across decoupled dimensions with\nrealistic rendering effects, demonstrating a way to achieve personalized 'time\ntraveling' in a breeze.",

    "abstract": "In conversational recommender systems (CRSs), conversations usually involve a\nset of items and item-related entities or attributes, e.g., director is a\nrelated entity of a movie. These items and item-related entities are often\nmentioned along the development of a dialog, leading to potential sequential\ndependencies among them. However, most of existing CRSs neglect these potential\nsequential dependencies. In this article, we first propose a Transformer-based\nsequential conversational recommendation method, named TSCR, to model the\nsequential dependencies in the conversations to improve CRS. In TSCR, we\nrepresent conversations by items and the item-related entities, and construct\nuser sequences to discover user preferences by considering both the mentioned\nitems and item-related entities. Based on the constructed sequences, we deploy\na Cloze task to predict the recommended items along a sequence. Meanwhile, in\ncertain domains, knowledge graphs formed by the items and their related\nentities are readily available, which provide various different kinds of\nassociations among them. Given that TSCR does not benefit from such knowledge\ngraphs, we then propose a knowledge graph enhanced version of TSCR, called\nTSCRKG. In specific, we leverage the knowledge graph to offline initialize our\nmodel TSCRKG, and augment the user sequence of conversations (i.e., sequence of\nthe mentioned items and item-related entities in the conversation) with\nmulti-hop paths in the knowledge graph. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour TSCR model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and the\nenhanced version TSCRKG further improves recommendation performance on top of\nTSCR.",

    "abstract": "While passive acoustic mapping (PAM) has been advanced for monitoring\nacoustic cavitation activity in focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy, achieving\nboth real-time and high-quality imaging capabilities is still challenging. The\nangular spectrum (AS) method presents the most efficient algorithm for PAM, but\nit suffers from artifacts and low resolution due to the diffraction pattern of\nthe imaging array. Data-adaptive beamformers suppress artifacts well, but their\noverwhelming computational complexity, more than two orders of magnitude higher\nthan the classical time exposure acoustic (TEA) method, hinders their\napplication in real-time. In this work, we introduce the cross-correlated AS\nmethod to address the challenge. This method is based on cross-correlating the\nAS back-propagated wave fields, in the frequency domain, measured by different\napodized sub-apertures of the transducer array to provide the normalized\ncorrelation coefficient (NCC) matrix for artifacts suppression. We observed\nthat the spatial pattern of NCC matrix is variable which can be utilized by the\ntriple apodization with cross-correlation (TAX) with AS scheme, namely the\nAS-TAX method, for optimal artifacts suppression outcomes. Both the phantom and\nmouse tumor experiments showed that: 1) the AS-TAX method has comparable image\nquality as the data-adaptive beamformers, reducing the energy spread area by\n34.8-66.6% and improving image signal-to-noise ratio by 10.7-14.5 dB compared\nto TEA; 2) it reduces the computational complexity by two orders of magnitude\ncompared to TEA allowing millisecond-level image reconstruction speed with a\nparallel implementation; 3) it can well map microbubble cavitation activity of\ndifferent status (stable or inertial). The AS-TAX method represents a real-time\napproach to monitor cavitation-based FUS therapy with high image quality.",

Here, we propose\nand demonstrate what we refer to as the bulk-hole correspondence - a relation\nbetween the inner robust boundary modes (RBMs) and the existence of multiple\n\"holes\" in singular flatband lattices, mediated by the immovable discontinuity\nof the bulk Bloch wavefunctions.

    "abstract": "A reliable and scalable transfer of 2D-TMDCs (two-dimensional transition\nmetal dichalcogenides) from the growth substrate to a target substrate with\nhigh reproducibility and yield is a crucial step for device integration. In\nthis work, we have introduced a scalable dry-transfer approach for 2D-TMDCs\ngrown by MOCVD (metal-organic chemical vapor deposition) on sapphire. Transfer\nto a silicon/silicon dioxide (Si/SiO$_2$) substrate is performed using PMMA\n(poly(methyl methacrylate)) and TRT (thermal release tape) as sacrificial layer\nand carrier, respectively. Our proposed method ensures a reproducible peel-off\nfrom the growth substrate and better preservation of the 2D-TMDC during PMMA\nremoval in solvent, without compromising its adhesion to the target substrate.\nA comprehensive comparison between the dry method introduced in this work and a\nstandard wet transfer based on potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution shows\nimprovement in terms of cleanliness and structural integrity for\ndry-transferred layer, as evidenced by X-ray photoemission and Raman\nspectroscopy, respectively. Moreover, fabricated field-effect transistors\n(FETs) demonstrate improvements in subthreshold slope, maximum drain current\nand device-to-device variability. The dry-transfer method developed in this\nwork enables large-area integration of 2D-TMDC layers into (opto)electronic\ncomponents with high reproducibility, while better preserving the as-grown\nproperties of the layers.",

Pinpointing performance bottlenecks and\nunderstanding the underlying causes of program performance issues are critical\ntasks to fully exploit the performance offered by hardware resources.\n  Current performance debugging approaches rely either on measuring resource\nutilization, in order to estimate which parts of a CPU induce performance\nlimitations, or on code-based analysis deriving bottleneck information from\ncapacity/throughput models. These approaches are limited by instrumental and\nmethodological precision, present portability constraints across different\nmicroarchitectures, and often offer factual information about resource\nconstraints, but not causal hints about how to solve them.\n  This paper presents a novel performance debugging and analysis tool that\nimplements a resource-centric CPU model driven by dynamic binary\ninstrumentation that is capable of detecting complex bottlenecks caused by an\ninterplay of hardware and software factors. Bottlenecks are detected through\nsensitivity-based analysis, a sort of model parameterization that uses\ndifferential analysis to reveal constrained resources. It also implements a new\ntechnique we developed that we call causality analysis, that propagates\nconstraints to pinpoint how each instruction contribute to the overall\nexecution time.\n  To evaluate our analysis tool, we considered the set of high-performance\ncomputing kernels obtained by applying a wide range of transformations from the\nPolybench benchmark suite and measured the precision on a few Intel CPU and Arm\nmicro-architectures. We also took one of the benchmarks (correlation) as an\nillustrative example to illustrate how our tool's bottleneck analysis can be\nused to optimize a code.",

However, it is by no\nmeans trivial how soon after the first contact of two high-energy nuclei the\nfluid picture can be applied. It is demonstrated that one-dimensional expanding\nviscous fluids violate the necessary and the sufficient conditions of nonlinear\ncausality at large departures from local equilibrium.

This work is motivated by monitoring patients in sleep\nlaboratories. Due to their unique characteristics, sensors from the radar\ndomain have advantages compared to optical sensors, namely penetration of\nelectrically non-conductive materials and independence of light. These\nadvantages of radar signals unlock new applications and require adaptation of\n3D reconstruction frameworks. We propose a novel model-based method for 3D\nreconstruction from radar images. We generate a dataset of synthetic radar\nimages with a physics-based but non-differentiable radar renderer. This dataset\nis used to train a CNN-based encoder to estimate the parameters of a 3D\nmorphable face model. Whilst the encoder alone already leads to strong\nreconstructions of synthetic data, we extend our reconstruction in an\nAnalysis-by-Synthesis fashion to a model-based autoencoder. This is enabled by\nlearning the rendering process in the decoder, which acts as an object-specific\ndifferentiable radar renderer. Subsequently, the combination of both network\nparts is trained to minimize both, the loss of the parameters and the loss of\nthe resulting reconstructed radar image. This leads to the additional benefit,\nthat at test time the parameters can be further optimized by finetuning the\nautoencoder unsupervised on the image loss. We evaluated our framework on\ngenerated synthetic face images as well as on real radar images with 3D ground\ntruth of four individuals.",

    "abstract": "Modern PET scanners based on scintillating crystals use solid state photo\ndetectors for light readout. The small area of these devices is beneficial for\nspatial resolution, but also leads to a large number of electronic channels to\nbe read out, mostly by application specific integrated circuits (ASICs)\ncontaining amplification, noise reduction, hit finding, time stamping and\namplitude measurement. Although each ASIC provides up to $\\approx 64$ channels,\na large number of chips is required with the need for auxiliary electronic\ncomponents like voltage regulators or FPGAs for control and data readout. The\nFPGAs in turn often require multiple supply voltages and configuration\ninfrastructure, so that PCBs get complicated, cumbersome and power-hungry, in\naddition to the significant power requirement of the front-end ASICs. We\naddress this issue in the latest generation of our PETA readout ASIC for SiPMs\nby a simplified control scheme and, in particular, by a hierarchical serial\ndata readout which does not require any additional FPGA. In addition, it\nprovides a time-sorted stream of hit data, allowing early on-detector data\nreduction and hit pre-processing like the removal of hits with no coincident\npartner. The simplicity of this readout facilitates a supply scheme where\npower/ground of multiple ASICs are connected in series instead of the standard\nparallel connection. This 'serial-powering' approach can reduce supply current\n(while increasing overall supply voltage) so that voltage drop issues in the\nsupply are alleviated.",

The photometric redshifts, along with their uncertainties, are\nestimated through galaxy images in three optical bands ($g$, $r$ and $z$) from\nDESI and two near-infrared bands ($W1$ and $W2$) from WISE using a Bayesian\nNeural Network (BNN). The training of BNN is performed by above images and\ntheir corresponding spectroscopic redshifts given in DESI Early Data Release\n(EDR). Our results show that categorizing galaxies into individual groups based\non their inherent characteristics and estimating their photo-$z$s within their\ngroup separately can effectively improve the performance. Specifically, the\ngalaxies are categorized into four distinct groups based on DESI's target\nselection criteria: Bright Galaxy Sample (BGS), Luminous Red Galaxies (LRG),\nEmission Line Galaxies (ELG) and a group comprising the remaining sources,\nreferred to as NON. As measured by outliers of $|\\Delta z| > 0.15 (1 + z_{\\rm\ntrue})$, accuracy $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}$ and mean uncertainty $\\overline{E}$ for\nBNN, we achieve low outlier percentage, high accuracy and low uncertainty:\n0.14%, 0.018 and 0.0212 for BGS and 0.45%, 0.026 and 0.0293 for LRG\nrespectively, surpassing results without categorization.

Whereas the forelimbs evolved into wings primarily for flight,\nthe hindlimbs serve diverse functions such as walking, hopping, and leaping,\nand jumping take-off for transitions into flight. These capabilities have\ninspired engineers to aim for similar multi-modality in aerial robots,\nexpanding their range of applications across diverse environments. However,\nchallenges remain in reproducing multi-modal locomotion, across gaits with\ndistinct kinematics and propulsive characteristics, such as walking and\njumping, while preserving lightweight mass for flight. This tradeoff between\nmechanical complexity and versatility limits most existing aerial robots to\nonly one additional locomotor mode. Here, we overcome the\ncomplexity-versatility tradeoff with RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for\nmultiple ENvironments), which uses its bird-inspired multi-functional legs to\njump rapidly into flight, walk on ground and hop over obstacles and gaps\nsimilar to the multi-modal locomotion of birds. We show that jumping for\ntake-off contributes substantially to initial flight take-off speed and,\nremarkably, that it is more energy-efficient than solely propeller-based\ntake-off. Our analysis suggests an important tradeoff in mass distribution\nbetween legs and body among birds adapted for different locomotor strategies,\nwith greater investment in leg mass among terrestrial birds with multi-modal\ngait demands. Multi-functional robot legs expand opportunities to deploy\ntraditional fixed-wing aircraft in complex terrains through autonomous\ntake-offs and multi-modal gaits.",

State-of-the-art HPO methods follow a bandit-based\napproach and build on top of successive halving, where the final performance of\na combination is estimated based on a lower than fully trained fidelity\nperformance metric and more promising combinations are assigned more resources\nover time. Frequently, the number of epochs is treated as a resource, letting\nmore promising combinations train longer. Another option is to use the number\nof workers as a resource and directly allocate more workers to more promising\nconfigurations via data-parallel training. This article proposes a novel\nResource-Adaptive Successive Doubling Algorithm (RASDA), which combines a\nresource-adaptive successive doubling scheme with the plain Asynchronous\nSuccessive Halving Algorithm (ASHA). Scalability of this approach is shown on\nup to 1,024 Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) on modern HPC systems. It is\napplied to different types of Neural Networks (NNs) and trained on large\ndatasets from the Computer Vision (CV), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and\nAdditive Manufacturing (AM) domains, where performing more than one full\ntraining run is usually infeasible. Empirical results show that RASDA\noutperforms ASHA by a factor of up to 1.9 with respect to the runtime. At the\nsame time, the solution quality of final ASHA models is maintained or even\nsurpassed by the implicit batch size scheduling of RASDA. With RASDA,\nsystematic HPO is applied to a terabyte-scale scientific dataset for the first\ntime in the literature, enabling efficient optimization of complex models on\nmassive scientific data.

The proposed methodology involves four phases: conceptualization,\noperationalization, testing, and application. In previous work, we performed\nthe conceptualization of a theory that investigates the structure of IT\ndepartments and teams when software-intensive organizations adopt a culture\ncalled DevOps. Objective: This paper presents a set of procedures to\nsystematize the operationalization phase in theory building and their\napplication in the context of DevOps team structures. Method: We operationalize\nthe concepts and propositions that make up our theory to generate constructs\nand empirically testable hypotheses. Instead of using causal relations to\noperationalize the propositions, we adopt logical implication, which avoids the\nproblems associated with causal reasoning. Strategies are proposed to ensure\nthat the resulting theory aligns with the criterion of parsimony. Results: The\noperationalization phase is described from three perspectives: specification,\nimplementation, and practical application. First, the operationalization\nprocess is formally defined. Second, a set of procedures for operating both\nconcepts and propositions is described. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed\nprocedures is demonstrated in a case study.

    "abstract": "Foraging is a widespread behavior, and being part of a group may bring\nseveral benefits compared to solitary foraging, such as collective pooling of\ninformation and reducing environmental uncertainty. Often theoretical models of\ncollective behavior use coarse-grained representations, or are too complex for\nanalytical treatment, and generally do not take into account the noisy decision\nmaking process implemented by individual agents. This calls for the development\nof a mechanistic, analytically tractable, and stochastic framework to study the\nunderlying processes of social foraging, tying the microscopic to the\nmacroscopic levels. Based on an evidence accumulation framework, we developed a\nmodel of patch-leaving decisions in a large egalitarian group. Across a variety\nof environmental statistics and information sharing mechanisms, we were able to\nanalytically derive optimal agent strategies. The environmental statistics\nconsidered are either two non-depleting or several successive depleting\npatches. The social information sharing mechanisms are either through\nobservation of others' food rewards or through belief sharing, with continuous\nsharing, pulsatile observation of others' departures or arrivals, or through\ncounting the number of individuals in a patch. Throughout all these conditions,\nwe quantified how cohesive a group is over time, how much time agents spend on\naverage in a patch and what are their group equilibrium dynamics.

    "abstract": "Objectives: Surrogate endpoints, used to substitute for and predict final\nclinical outcomes, are increasingly being used to support submissions to health\ntechnology assessment agencies. The increase in use of surrogate endpoints has\nbeen accompanied by literature describing frameworks and statistical methods to\nensure their robust validation. The aim of this review was to assess how\nsurrogate endpoints have recently been used in oncology technology appraisals\nby the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and\nWales.\n  Methods: This paper identified technology appraisals in oncology published by\nNICE between February 2022 and May 2023. Data are extracted on methods for the\nuse and validation of surrogate endpoints.\n  Results: Of the 47 technology appraisals in oncology available for review, 18\n(38 percent) utilised surrogate endpoints, with 37 separate surrogate endpoints\nbeing discussed. However, the evidence supporting the validity of the surrogate\nrelationship varied significantly across putative surrogate relationships with\n11 providing RCT evidence, 7 providing evidence from observational studies, 12\nbased on clinical opinion and 7 providing no evidence for the use of surrogate\nendpoints.\n  Conclusions: This review supports the assertion that surrogate endpoints are\nfrequently used in oncology technology appraisals in England and Wales. Despite\nincreasing availability of statistical methods and guidance on appropriate\nvalidation of surrogate endpoints, this review highlights that use and\nvalidation of surrogate endpoints can vary between technology appraisals which\ncan lead to uncertainty in decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Flexible-antenna systems have recently received significant research interest\ndue to their capability to reconfigure wireless channels intelligently. This\npaper focuses on a new type of flexible-antenna technology, termed pinching\nantennas, which can be realized by applying small dielectric particles on a\nwaveguide. Analytical results are first developed for the simple case with a\nsingle pinching antenna and a single waveguide, where the unique feature of the\npinching-antenna system to create strong line-of-sight links and mitigate\nlarge-scale path loss is demonstrated. An advantageous feature of\npinching-antenna systems is that multiple pinching antennas can be activated on\na single waveguide at no extra cost; however, they must be fed with the same\nsignal. This feature motivates the application of non-orthogonal multiple\naccess (NOMA), and analytical results are provided to demonstrate the superior\nperformance of NOMA-assisted pinching-antenna systems. Finally, the case with\nmultiple pinching antennas and multiple waveguides is studied, which resembles\na classical multiple-input single-input (MISO) interference channel. By\nexploiting the capability of pinching antennas to reconfigure the wireless\nchannel, it is revealed that a performance upper bound on the interference\nchannel becomes achievable, where the achievability conditions are also\nidentified. Computer simulation results are presented to verify the developed\nanalytical results and demonstrate the superior performance of pinching-antenna\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "After a merger of two massive black holes (MBHs), the remnant receives a\ngravitational wave (GW) recoil kick that can have a strong effect on its future\nevolution. The magnitude of the kick ($v_\\mathrm{recoil}$) depends on the mass\nratio and the alignment of the spins and orbital angular momenta, therefore on\nthe previous evolution of the MBHs. We investigate the cosmic effect of GW\nrecoil by running for the first time a high-resolution cosmological simulation\nincluding GW recoil that depends on the MBH spins (evolved through accretion\nand mergers), masses and dynamics computed self-consistently. We also run a\ntwin simulation without GW recoil. The simulations are run down to $z=4.4$. We\nfind that GW recoil reduces the growth of merger remnants, and can have a\nsignificant effect on the MBH-galaxy correlations and the merger rate. We find\nlarge recoil kicks across all galaxy masses in the simulation, up to a few\n$10^{11}\\,\\rm M_\\odot$. The effect of recoil can be significant even if the\nMBHs are embedded in a rotationally supported gaseous structure. We investigate\nthe dynamics of recoiling MBHs and find that MBHs remain in the centre of the\nhost galaxy for low $v_\\mathrm{recoil}/v_\\mathrm{esc}$ and escape rapidly for\nhigh $v_\\mathrm{recoil}/v_\\mathrm{esc}$. Only if $v_\\mathrm{recoil}$ is\ncomparable to $v_\\mathrm{esc}$ the MBHs escape the central region of the galaxy\nbut might remain as wandering MBHs until the end of the simulation. Recoiling\nMBHs are a significant fraction of the wandering MBH population. Although the\ndynamics of recoiling MBHs may be complex, some retain their initial radial\norbits but are difficult to discern from other wandering MBHs on radial orbits.\nOthers scatter with the halo substructure or circularise in the asymmetric\npotential. Our work highlights the importance of including GW recoil in\ncosmological simulation models.",

To address this issue, noise-robust loss functions offer an effective\nsolution for enhancing learning in the presence of label noise. In this work,\nwe systematically investigate the limitation of the recently proposed Active\nPassive Loss (APL), which employs Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as its passive loss\nfunction. Despite the robustness brought by MAE, one of its key drawbacks is\nthat it pays equal attention to clean and noisy samples; this feature slows\ndown convergence and potentially makes training difficult, particularly in\nlarge-scale datasets. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel loss\nfunction class, termed Normalized Negative Loss Functions (NNLFs), which serve\nas passive loss functions within the APL framework. NNLFs effectively address\nthe limitations of MAE by concentrating more on memorized clean samples. By\nreplacing MAE in APL with our proposed NNLFs, we enhance APL and present a new\nframework called Active Negative Loss (ANL). Moreover, in non-symmetric noise\nscenarios, we propose an entropy-based regularization technique to mitigate the\nvulnerability to the label imbalance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nthe new loss functions adopted by our ANL framework can achieve better or\ncomparable performance to state-of-the-art methods across various label noise\ntypes and in image segmentation tasks.

In experiments on standard benchmarks, our model\ndemonstrates optimization capability close to the best achievable with\ncoarse-grained hints.

By blending portions of the input\nimage with its edited generative counterpart and incorporating fractal\npatterns, our approach mitigates unrealistic images and label ambiguity,\nimproving the performance and adversarial robustness of the resulting models.\nEfficacy of our method is established with extensive experiments on eight\npublic datasets for general and fine-grained classification, in both in-domain\nand cross-domain settings. Additionally, we demonstrate performance\nimprovements for self-supervised learning, learning with data scarcity, and\nadversarial robustness. As compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods,\nour technique achieves stronger performance across the board.",

Recent efforts\nhave successfully integrated physically grounded dynamics within 3D Gaussians\nto perform high-fidelity simulations in well-reconstructed simulation\nenvironments from static scenes. However, they struggle with the geometric\ninconsistency in reconstructing simulation environments and unrealistic\nphysical deformations in simulations of soft tissues when it comes to dynamic\nand complex surgical processes. In this paper, we propose SurgiSim, a novel\nautomatic simulation system to overcome these limitations. To build a surgical\nsimulation environment, we maintain a canonical 3D scene composed of 3D\nGaussians coupled with a deformation field to represent a dynamic surgical\nscene. This process involves a multi-stage optimization with trajectory and\nanisotropic regularization, enhancing the geometry consistency of the canonical\nscene, which serves as the simulation environment. To achieve realistic\nphysical simulations in this environment, we implement a Visco-Elastic\ndeformation model based on the Maxwell model, effectively restoring the complex\ndeformations of tissues. Additionally, we infer the physical parameters of\ntissues by minimizing the discrepancies between the input video and simulation\nresults guided by estimated tissue motion, ensuring realistic simulation\noutcomes. Experiments on various surgical scenarios and interactions\ndemonstrate SurgiSim's ability to perform realistic simulation of soft tissues\namong surgical procedures, showing its enormous potential for enhancing\nsurgical training, planning, and robotic surgery systems.

Radio galaxies with visible two-sided jet structures, such as NGC\n1052, are sources of particular interest to study the collimation and shock\nstructure of active galactic nuclei jets. High-resolution very-long-baseline\ninterferometry observations of such sources can resolve and study the jet\ncollimation profile and probe different physical mechanisms. Aims. In this\npaper, we study the physics of double-sided radio sources at parsec scales, and\nin particular investigate whether propagating shocks can give rise to the\nobserved asymmetry between jet and counterjet. Methods. We carry out special\nrelativistic hydrodynamic simulations and perform radiative transfer\ncalculations of an over-pressured perturbed jet. During the radiative transfer\ncalculations we incorporate both thermal and nonthermal emission while taking\nthe finite speed of light into account. To further compare our results to\nobservations, we create more realistic synthetic data including the properties\nof the observing array as well as the image reconstruction via multifrequency\nregularized maximum likelihood methods. We finally introduce a semi-automatized\nmethod for tracking jet components and extracting jet kinematics. Results. We\nshow that propagating shocks in an inherently symmetric double-sided jet can\nlead to partially asymmetric jet collimation profiles due to time delay effects\nand relativistic beaming. These asymmetries may appear on specific epochs, with\none jet evolving near conically and the other one parabolically (width profile\nevolving with a slope of 1 and 0.5, respectively). However, these spurious\nasymmetries are not significant when observing the source evolve for an\nextended amount of time. Conclusions. Purely observational effects are not\nenough to explain a persisting asymmetry in the jet collimation profile of\ndouble-sided jet sources and hint at evidence for asymmetrically launched jets.",

Prompt middleware aims to\naddress this barrier by assisting in prompt construction, but barriers remain\nfor users in expressing adequate control so that they can receive AI-responses\nthat match their preferences.\n  We conduct a formative survey (n=38) investigating user needs for control\nover AI-generated explanations in comprehension tasks, which uncovers a\ntrade-off between standardized but predictable support for prompting, and\nadaptive but unpredictable support tailored to the user and task. To explore\nthis trade-off, we implement two prompt middleware approaches: Dynamic Prompt\nRefinement Control (Dynamic PRC) and Static Prompt Refinement Control (Static\nPRC). The Dynamic PRC approach generates context-specific UI elements that\nprovide prompt refinements based on the user's prompt and user needs from the\nAI, while the Static PRC approach offers a preset list of generally applicable\nrefinements.\n  We evaluate these two approaches with a controlled user study (n=16) to\nassess the impact of these approaches on user control of AI responses for\ncrafting better explanations. Results show a preference for the Dynamic PRC\napproach as it afforded more control, lowered barriers to providing context,\nand encouraged exploration and reflection of the tasks, but that reasoning\nabout the effects of different generated controls on the final output remains\nchallenging. Drawing on participant feedback, we discuss design implications\nfor future Dynamic PRC systems that enhance user control of AI responses.

Multi-epoch spectroscopy reveals an orbital period of 109.20279\nminutes, consistent with TESS and ZTF photometric data, marking it as the sixth\ndetached system known to harbor a WD companion with a period less than two\nhours.

    "abstract": "FIDO2 is the standard technology for single-factor and second-factor\nauthentication. It is specified in an open standard, including the WebAuthn and\nCTAP application layer protocols. We focus on CTAP, which allows FIDO2 clients\nand hardware authenticators to communicate. No prior work has explored the CTAP\nAuthenticator API, a critical protocol-level attack surface. We address this\ngap by presenting the first security and privacy evaluation of the CTAP\nAuthenticator API.\n  We uncover two classes of protocol-level attacks on CTAP that we call CTRAPS.\nThe client impersonation (CI) attacks exploit the lack of client authentication\nto tamper with FIDO2 authenticators. They include zero-click attacks capable of\ndeleting FIDO2 credentials, including passkeys, without user interaction. The\nAPI confusion (AC) attacks abuse the lack of protocol API enforcements and\nconfound FIDO2 authenticators, clients, and unaware users into calling unwanted\nCTAP APIs while thinking they are calling legitimate ones. The presented eleven\nattacks are conducted either in proximity or remotely and are effective\nregardless of the underlying CTAP transport. We detail the eight\nvulnerabilities in the CTAP specification, enabling the CTRAPS attacks. Six are\nnovel and include unauthenticated CTAP clients and trackable FIDO2 credentials.\nWe release CTRAPS, an original toolkit, to analyze CTAP and conduct the CTRAPS\nattacks. We confirm the attacks practicality on a large scale by exploiting six\npopular authenticators, including a FIPS-certified one from Yubico, Feitian,\nSoloKeys, and Google, and ten widely used relying parties, such as Microsoft,\nApple, GitHub, and Facebook. We present eight practical and backward-compliant\ncountermeasures to fix the attacks and their root causes. We responsibly\ndisclosed our findings to the FIDO alliance and the affected vendors.",

Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and downstream tasks show\nthat the proposed UniForm models leveraging Reuse Attention achieve\nstate-of-the-art imagenet classification accuracy while outperforming existing\nattention mechanisms, such as Linear Attention and Flash Attention, in\ninference speed and memory scalability. Notably, UniForm-l achieves a 76.7%\nTop-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 21.8ms inference time on edge devices like\nthe Jetson AGX Orin, representing up to a 5x speedup over competing benchmark\nmethods.

For instance, in a text classification task, the\nattacker elaborately introduces perturbations to the original texts that hardly\nalter the original semantics in order to trick the model into making different\npredictions. By studying textual adversarial attack methods, the robustness of\nlanguage models can be evaluated and then improved. Currently, most of the\nresearch in this field focuses on English, and there is also a certain amount\nof research on Chinese. However, there is little research targeting Chinese\nminority languages. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence\ntechnology and the emergence of Chinese minority language models, textual\nadversarial attacks become a new challenge for the information processing of\nChinese minority languages. In response to this situation, we propose a\nmulti-granularity Tibetan textual adversarial attack method based on masked\nlanguage models called TSTricker. We utilize the masked language models to\ngenerate candidate substitution syllables or words, adopt the scoring mechanism\nto determine the substitution order, and then conduct the attack method on\nseveral fine-tuned victim models. The experimental results show that TSTricker\nreduces the accuracy of the classification models by more than 28.70% and makes\nthe classification models change the predictions of more than 90.60% of the\nsamples, which has an evidently higher attack effect than the baseline method.",

Forrest, this class generalizes the famous trio of Thompson groups $F$, $T$\nand $V$ and includes some of their relatives and generalizations. After an\nintroduction to this topic, this dissertation branches into different aspects\nof rearrangement groups.\n  We first focus on a class of rearrangement groups of tree-like fractals known\nas Wa\\.zewski dendrites. We find finite generating sets for them and their\ncommutator subgroups, we prove that the commutator subgroups are simple (with\none possible exception) and we show that these groups are countable dense\nsubgroups of the groups of all homeomorphisms of dendrites.\n  We then provide a sufficient condition to solve the conjugacy problem in\nrearrangement groups using strand diagram. This condition is not necessary, but\nunderstanding how to extend it is related to open problems in computer science.\nThis method solves the conjugacy problem in essentially all known rearrangement\ngroups.\n  Next we study a group property known as invariable generation. With a\ndynamical approach we prove that transitive enough rearrangement groups are not\ninvariably generated, which applies to most rearrangement group that has been\nconsidered so far.\n  Then we study the gluing relation that defines the fractal topological spaces\non which rearrangement groups act. We show that it is rational, i.e., there\nexists a finite-state automaton which reads a pair of elements if and only if\nthey are related.\n  We then show that finite and finitely generated abelian groups are\nrearrangement groups and that the stabilizers of finite sets of rational points\nof rearrangement groups are themselves rearrangement groups. Lastly, we prove\nthat every rearrangement group embeds into Thompson's group $V$.",

This task addresses the question of whether models\ncan effectively perceive the geometry of occluded regions based on visible\ncues. Prior methods primarily rely on synthetic datasets and focus on metric\ndepth estimation, limiting their generalization to real-world settings due to\ndomain shifts and scalability challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel\nformulation of amodal depth estimation in the wild, focusing on relative depth\nprediction to improve model generalization across diverse natural images. We\nintroduce a new large-scale dataset, Amodal Depth In the Wild (ADIW), created\nusing a scalable pipeline that leverages segmentation datasets and compositing\ntechniques. Depth maps are generated using large pre-trained depth models, and\na scale-and-shift alignment strategy is employed to refine and blend depth\npredictions, ensuring consistency in ground-truth annotations. To tackle the\namodal depth task, we present two complementary frameworks: Amodal-DAV2, a\ndeterministic model based on Depth Anything V2, and Amodal-DepthFM, a\ngenerative model that integrates conditional flow matching principles. Our\nproposed frameworks effectively leverage the capabilities of large pre-trained\nmodels with minimal modifications to achieve high-quality amodal depth\npredictions.

Although existing methods have\nconducted in-depth research on slip detection and grasping force planning, they\noften overlook the issue of adaptive tracking of the actual force to the target\nforce when handling objects with different material properties. The optimal\nparameters of a force tracking controller are significantly influenced by the\nobject's stiffness, and many adaptive force tracking algorithms rely on\nstiffness estimation. However, real-world objects often exhibit viscous,\nplastic, or other more complex nonlinear time-varying behaviors, and existing\nstudies provide insufficient support for these materials in terms of stiffness\ndefinition and estimation. To address this, this paper introduces the concept\nof generalized stiffness, extending the definition of stiffness to nonlinear\ntime-varying grasp system models, and proposes an online generalized stiffness\nestimator based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Based on generalized\nstiffness, this paper proposes an adaptive parameter adjustment strategy using\na PI controller as an example, enabling dynamic force tracking for objects with\nvarying characteristics. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod achieves high precision and short probing time, while showing better\nadaptability to non-ideal objects compared to existing methods.

    "abstract": "In molecular beam scattering experiments, an important technique for\nmeasuring product energy and angular distributions is velocity map imaging\nfollowing photoionization. For studies with cold molecular beams, the\nresolution is often limited by the product detection process. When\nstate-selective ionization detection is used, excess photon energy can transfer\nto kinetic energy in the molecular ion-electron pair, resulting in measurable\ncation recoil. With advanced molecular beam technology, velocity spreads as\nsmall as a few m/s are possible. Thus, a suitable product detection scheme must\nbe not only sensitive, state-selective, and background-free, it must also\nproduce less cation recoil than the velocity spread of the molecular beams. To\ndate this has only been possible with the NO molecule. Our goal here is to\nextend this low-recoil capability to fully deuterated ammonia, ND$_3$. We\npresent a resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization (REMPI) detection scheme\nfor ND$_3$, that imparts sufficiently low ion recoil, allowing, for the first\ntime, high-resolution imaging of ND$_3$ products in a cold ND$_3$-HD scattering\nexperiment. The first step of the 1+1$'$ REMPI scheme requires vacuum\nultra-violet (VUV) photons of ~160 nm, which are generated through\nfour-wave-mixing in Xe. We varied the wavelength of the second, ionization step\nbetween 434 and 458 nm, exciting ND$_3$ to a wide range of autoionizing neutral\nstates. By velocity mapping the resulting photoelectrons, it was possible to\nfully chart the ion recoil across this range with vibrational resolution for\nthe final ionic states. Additionally, rotational resolution in the\nphotoionization dynamics was achieved for selected excitation energies near one\nof the vibrational thresholds. Many of the peaks in the spectrum of\nautoionizing Rydberg states are assigned to specific Rydberg series using a\nsimple Rydberg formula model.",

Specifically, the Multitask Reflective Preference Extraction Module\nfirst utilizes LLMs to distill each user's fine-grained (i.e., categorical,\ntemporal, and spatial) preferences into a knowledge base (KB). The Neighbor\nPreference Retrieval Module retrieves and summarizes the preferences of similar\nusers from the KB to obtain collaborative signals. Subsequently, aggregating\nthe user's preferences with those of similar users, the Multitask Next POI\nRecommendation Module generates the next POI recommendations via multitask\nprompting.

    "abstract": "In many domains, the most successful AI models tend to be the largest, indeed\noften too large to be handled by AI players with limited computational\nresources. To mitigate this, a number of compression methods have been\ndeveloped, including methods that prune the network down to high sparsity\nwhilst retaining performance. The best-performing pruning techniques are often\nthose that use second-order curvature information (such as an estimate of the\nFisher information matrix) to score the importance of each weight and to\npredict the optimal compensation for weight deletion. However, these methods\nare difficult to scale to high-dimensional parameter spaces without making\nheavy approximations. Here, we propose the FishLeg surgeon (FLS), a new\nsecond-order pruning method based on the Fisher-Legendre (FishLeg) optimizer.\nAt the heart of FishLeg is a meta-learning approach to amortising the action of\nthe inverse FIM, which brings a number of advantages. Firstly, the\nparameterisation enables the use of flexible tensor factorisation techniques to\nimprove computational and memory efficiency without sacrificing much accuracy,\nalleviating challenges associated with scalability of most second-order pruning\nmethods. Secondly, directly estimating the inverse FIM leads to less\nsensitivity to the amplification of stochasticity during inversion, thereby\nresulting in more precise estimates. Thirdly, our approach also allows for\nprogressive assimilation of the curvature into the parameterisation. In the\ngradual pruning regime, this results in a more efficient estimate refinement as\nopposed to re-estimation. We find that FishLeg achieves higher or comparable\nperformance against two common baselines in the area, most notably in the high\nsparsity regime when considering a ResNet18 model on CIFAR-10 (84% accuracy at\n95% sparsity vs 60% for OBS) and TinyIM (53% accuracy at 80% sparsity vs 48%\nfor OBS).",

These models often generate diverse, realistic details without\nadequate focus on fidelity, failing to meet the crucial requirements of shadow\nremoval, which necessitates precise preservation of image content. In contrast\nto prior approaches that aimed to regenerate shadow-free images from scratch,\nthis paper utilizes diffusion models to generate and refine image residuals.\nThis strategy fully uses the inherent detailed information within shadowed\nimages, resulting in a more efficient and faithful reconstruction of\nshadow-free content. Additionally, to revent the accumulation of errors during\nthe generation process, a crosstimestep self-enhancement training strategy is\nproposed.

This innovative approach effectively harnesses the vast amounts\nof unlabeled data available for endoscopic image segmentation, improving both\naccuracy and robustness in the segmentation process.

The dataset is created to addressing a real-world\nchallenge: creating a clean fine-grained taxonomy dataset. The Noisy Ostracods\ndataset has diverse noises from multiple sources. Firstly, the noise is\nopen-set, including new classes discovered during curation that were not part\nof the original annotation. The dataset has pseudo-classes, where annotators\nmisclassified samples that should belong to an existing class into a new\npseudo-class. The Noisy Ostracods dataset is highly imbalanced with a imbalance\nfactor $\\rho$ = 22429. This presents a unique challenge for robust machine\nlearning methods, as existing approaches have not been extensively evaluated on\nfine-grained classification tasks with such diverse real-world noise. Initial\nexperiments using current robust learning techniques have not yielded\nsignificant performance improvements on the Noisy Ostracods dataset compared to\ncross-entropy training on the raw, noisy data. On the other hand, noise\ndetection methods have underperformed in error hit rate compared to naive\ncross-validation ensembling for identifying problematic labels.

A Gaussian distribution is commonly assumed\nfor the uncertainties with a covariance matrix estimated from a set of\nsimulations. The noise in such covariance estimates causes two problems: it\ndistorts the width of the parameter contours, and it adds scatter to the\nlocation of those contours which is not captured by the widths themselves. For\nnon-Gaussian likelihoods, an approximation may be derived via Simulation-Based\nInference (SBI). It is often implicitly assumed that parameter constraints from\nSBI analyses, which do not use covariance matrices, are not affected by the\nsame problems as parameter estimation with a covariance matrix estimated from\nsimulations. We investigate whether SBI suffers from effects similar to those\nof covariance estimation in Gaussian likelihoods. We use Neural Posterior and\nLikelihood Estimation with continuous and masked autoregressive normalizing\nflows for density estimation. We fit our approximate posterior models to\nsimulations drawn from a Gaussian linear model, so that the SBI result can be\ncompared to the true posterior. We test linear and neural network based\ncompression, demonstrating that neither methods circumvent the issues of\ncovariance estimation. SBI suffers an inflation of posterior variance that is\nequal or greater than the analytical result in covariance estimation for\nGaussian likelihoods for the same number of simulations. The assumption that\nSBI requires a smaller number of simulations than covariance estimation for a\nGaussian likelihood analysis is inaccurate. The limitations of traditional\nlikelihood analysis with simulation-based covariance remain for SBI with a\nfinite simulation budget.

We also perform a fit of observed\nlightcurves with the model, using the third Fermi-LAT gamma-ray pulsar catalog.\nReconnection in the wind current sheet powers synchrotron and inverse Compton\nemission. The modeled pulse profiles reproduce some of the salient features of\nobserved gamma-ray pulsars, including the mysterious Vela-like lightcurves,\nsuch as: the generic double-peaked structure, the presence of a bridge or third\npeak in between the main pulses, the pulse narrowing with increasing energy.\nThe bolometric synchrotron radiative efficiency is strictly limited by the\nreconnection rate. Our global kinetic simulations are able to match observed\npulse profiles. Such direct comparisons will help drive and focus future\nsimulation developments.",

The core of\nour method involves accurately identifying those nodes affected by the presence\nof discontinuities using smoothness indicators, a concept derived from the\ndata-dependent WENO method. Our formulation results in a data-dependent\nweighted least squares problem where the weights depend on two factors: the\ndistances between nodes and the point of approximation, and the smoothness of\nthe data in a region of predetermined radius around the nodes. We explore the\ndesign of the new data-dependent approximant, analyze its properties including\npolynomial reproduction, accuracy, and smoothness, and study its impact on\ndiffusion and the Gibbs phenomenon.

Our strategy, which is inspired by work of W. Zhang in weight\n$2$, is based on a variant for modular forms of the congruence method\noriginally introduced by Bertolini-Darmon to prove one divisibility in the\nanticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for rational elliptic curves. We adapt\nto higher (even) weight modular forms this approach via congruences, building\ncrucially on results of Wang on the indivisibility of Heegner cycles over\nShimura curves. Then we offer an application of our results on Kolyvagin's\nconjecture to the Tamagawa number conjecture for the motive of $f$ and describe\nother (standard) consequences on structure theorems for Bloch-Kato-Selmer\ngroups, $p$-parity results and converse theorems for $f$. Since in the present\npaper we need $p>k+1$, our main theorem and its applications can be viewed as\ncomplementary to results obtained by the first and third authors in their\narticle on the Tamagawa number conjecture for modular motives, where\nKolyvagin's conjecture was proved (in a completely different way exploiting the\narithmetic of Hida families) under the assumption that $k$ is congruent to $2$\nmodulo $2(p-1)$, which forces $p<k$. In forthcoming work, we will use results\ncontained in this paper to prove (under analogous assumptions) the counterpart\nfor an even weight newform $f$ of Perrin-Riou's Heegner point main conjecture\nfor elliptic curves (\"Heegner cycle main conjecture\" for $f$).",

By utilizing relativistic kinetic energy, RAD\nincorporates principles from special relativity and limits parameter updates\nbelow a finite speed, effectively mitigating abnormal gradient influences.\nAdditionally, RAD models NN optimization as the evolution of a multi-particle\nsystem where each trainable parameter acts as an independent particle with an\nindividual adaptive learning rate. We prove RAD's sublinear convergence under\ngeneral nonconvex settings, where smaller gradient variance and larger batch\nsizes contribute to tighter convergence. Notably, RAD degrades to the\nwell-known adaptive moment estimation (ADAM) algorithm when its speed\ncoefficient is chosen as one and symplectic factor as a small positive value.\nExperimental results show RAD outperforming nine baseline optimizers with five\nRL algorithms across twelve environments, including standard benchmarks and\nchallenging scenarios. Notably, RAD achieves up to a 155.1% performance\nimprovement over ADAM in Atari games, showcasing its efficacy in stabilizing\nand accelerating RL training.",

AoC follows\nthe advent calendar, therefore it is an annual challenge that lasts for 25\ndays. AoC participants usually post their solutions on social networks and\ndiscuss them online. These challenges are interesting to study since they could\nhighlight the adoption of new tools, the evolution of the developer community,\nor the technological requirements of well-known companies. For these reasons,\nwe first create a dataset of the 2019-2021 AoC editions containing the\ndiscussion threads made on the subreddit {\\tt /r/adventofcode}. Then, we\npropose a model based on stream graphs to best study this context, where we\nrepresent its most important actors through time: participants, comments, and\nprogramming languages. Thanks to our model, we investigate user participation,\nadoption of new programming languages during a challenge and between two of\nthem, and resiliency of programming languages based on a Stack Overflow survey.\nWe find that the top-used programming languages are almost the same in the\nthree years, pointing out their importance. Moreover, participants tend to keep\nthe same programming language for the whole challenge, while the ones attending\ntwo AoCs usually change it in the next one. Finally, we observe interesting\nresults about the programming languages that are ``Popular'' or ``Loved''\naccording to the Stack Overflow survey. Firstly, these are the ones adopted for\nthe longest time in an AoC edition, thanks to which users have a high chance of\nreaching the end of the challenge. Secondly, they are the most chosen when a\nparticipant decides to change programming language during the same challenge.",

In this paper, we introduce the\nGraph Quantum Walk Transformer (GQWformer), a groundbreaking GNN framework that\nutilizes quantum walks on attributed graphs to generate node quantum states.\nThese quantum states encapsulate rich structural attributes and serve as\ninductive biases for the transformer, thereby enabling the generation of more\nmeaningful attention scores.

Thus, we propose a unified framework,\ntermed Diffusion Implicit Policy (DIP), for scene-aware motion synthesis, where\npaired motion-scene data are no longer necessary. In this framework, we\ndisentangle human-scene interaction from motion synthesis during training and\nthen introduce an interaction-based implicit policy into motion diffusion\nduring inference. Synthesized motion can be derived through iterative diffusion\ndenoising and implicit policy optimization, thus motion naturalness and\ninteraction plausibility can be maintained simultaneously. The proposed\nimplicit policy optimizes the intermediate noised motion in a GAN Inversion\nmanner to maintain motion continuity and control keyframe poses though the\nControlNet branch and motion inpainting. For long-term motion synthesis, we\nintroduce motion blending for stable transitions between multiple sub-tasks,\nwhere motions are fused in rotation power space and translation linear space.\nThe proposed method is evaluated on synthesized scenes with ShapeNet furniture,\nand real scenes from PROX and Replica. Results show that our framework presents\nbetter motion naturalness and interaction plausibility than cutting-edge\nmethods. This also indicates the feasibility of utilizing the DIP for motion\nsynthesis in more general tasks and versatile scenes.\nhttps://jingyugong.github.io/DiffusionImplicitPolicy/",

This paper presents BiCSI, which\nmerges binary encoding with fingerprint-based techniques to improve position\nmatching for detecting semi-stationary targets. Inspired by gene sequencing\nprocesses, BiCSI initially converts CSI matrices into binary sequences and\nemploys Hamming distances to evaluate signal similarity. The results show that\nBiCSI achieves an average accuracy above 98% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of\nless than three centimeters, outperforming algorithms directly dependent on\nphysical measurements by at least two-fold. Moreover, the proposed method for\nextracting feature vectors from CSI matrices as fingerprints significantly\nreduces data storage requirements to the kilobyte range, far below the\nmegabytes typically required by conventional machine learning models.\nAdditionally, the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm adapts well\nto multiple physical similarity metrics, and remains robust over different time\nperiods, enhancing its utility and versatility in various scenarios.",

(2) Visual Inconsistency:\nExisting approaches struggle with maintaining visual consistency across shots.\nOur identity-aware cross-shot propagation generates identity-preserving\nportrait (IPP) tokens that maintain character fidelity while allowing trait\nvariations (expressions, aging) dictated by the storyline. (3) Transition\nArtifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent\ntransition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process\nadjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow\nwhile preserving narrative continuity. VGoT generates multi-shot videos that\noutperform state-of-the-art baselines by 20.4% in within-shot face consistency\nand 17.4% in style consistency, while achieving over 100% better cross-shot\nconsistency and 10x fewer manual adjustments than alternatives.",

We use ellipse fitting to measure the properties and evolution\nof bars in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. By using the K-S\ntwo-sample test and tracing their evolutionary changes, we analyze the\nparameter differences between barred and unbarred galaxies. The properties of\ngalaxies with short bars are also studied. When tracing all disk galaxies at\n$z=0$ back to $z=1$, all of them show similar bar features at $z=1$. The\nfraction of bars increases in barred and short-bar galaxies but decreases in\nunbarred galaxies during $z=1-0$. In the case of disk galaxies with stellar\nmass log$(M_*/M_\\odot)> 10.8$, nurture (mainly mergers) plays the most\nimportant role in suppressing or destroying bars. Bars are more likely to\nendure in galaxies that experience fewer mergers, which can be quantified by\nsmaller stellar halos and ex-situ mass fractions. Approximately 60\\% of the\nunbarred galaxies in the local Universe once had a bar. In contrast, the lack\nof responsiveness to bar instabilities (a larger Toomre-Q parameter) due to a\nless compact nature plays an important role in generating unbarred disk\ngalaxies with stellar mass log$(M_*/M_\\odot)<10.8$. Moreover, short bars\ngenerally form at a similar time to normal bars, during which they either grow\nmildly or contract significantly. The fact that IllustrisTNG simulations\nproduce too many galaxies with short bars indicates that the dynamical\nproperties of the central regions in IllustrisTNG galaxies are less affected by\nexternal factors, such as mergers and gas inflows.",

However, this progress comes at the cost of a substantial increase\nin memory usage during inference, primarily due to the linear growth of the\nkey-value~(KV) cache. Existing KV cache compression methods often discard less\nrelevant tokens, which can lead to significant performance degradation when\ncritical information is lost. In this paper, we propose \\textsc{PoD}~(Proximal\ntokens over Distant tokens), a novel KV cache compression framework that\nallocates memory according to token importance, retaining less important tokens\nin a more compact, shared form rather than discarding them entirely. Our\napproach is motivated by two key observations: (1) proximal tokens -- those at\nthe beginning and end of the context -- are significantly more important for\nnext-token prediction, and (2) attention scores for distant tokens are highly\nredundant across consecutive layers. Leveraging these insights, \\textsc{PoD}\npreserves the full KV cache for proximal tokens, while for distant tokens, it\nshares key states across layers. Since attention scores are determined by both\nqueries and keys, sharing key states enables multiple layers to reuse a single\nset of keys for distant tokens, substantially reducing KV cache memory without\ndiscarding essential context. We further introduce a lightweight post-training\nadaptation to enable the model to adjust to this new attention-sharing\nstructure. Extensive experiments on both synthetic~(Needle in a Haystack) and\nreal-world long-context benchmarks demonstrate that \\textsc{PoD} reduces KV\ncache memory usage by up to 35\\% without compromising performance. Our method\nis orthogonal to existing token-selection-based techniques and can be combined\nwith them for further KV cache compression.",

    "abstract": "Recently, several studies have combined Gaussian Splatting to obtain scene\nrepresentations with language embeddings for open-vocabulary 3D scene\nunderstanding. While these methods perform well, they essentially require very\ndense multi-view inputs, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios.\nIn this work, we propose SparseLGS to address the challenge of 3D scene\nunderstanding with pose-free and sparse view input images. Our method leverages\na learning-based dense stereo model to handle pose-free and sparse inputs, and\na three-step region matching approach to address the multi-view semantic\ninconsistency problem, which is especially important for sparse inputs.\nDifferent from directly learning high-dimensional CLIP features, we extract\nlow-dimensional information and build bijections to avoid excessive learning\nand storage costs. We introduce a reconstruction loss during semantic training\nto improve Gaussian positions and shapes. To the best of our knowledge, we are\nthe first to address the 3D semantic field problem with sparse pose-free\ninputs. Experimental results show that SparseLGS achieves comparable quality\nwhen reconstructing semantic fields with fewer inputs (3-4 views) compared to\nprevious SOTA methods with dense input. Besides, when using the same sparse\ninput, SparseLGS leads significantly in quality and heavily improves the\ncomputation speed (5$\\times$speedup).

These algorithms, though\neffective, are not well-suited for resource-constrained devices. In this paper,\nwe propose a fast, memory-efficient, and cost-predictable k-means called\nDask-means. We first accelerate k-means by designing a memory-efficient\naccelerator, which utilizes an optimized nearest neighbor search over a\nmemory-tunable index to assign spatial vectors to clusters in batches. We then\ndesign a lightweight cost estimator to predict the memory cost and runtime of\nthe k-means task, allowing it to request appropriate memory from devices or\nadjust the accelerator's required space to meet memory constraints, and ensure\nsufficient CPU time for running k-means. Experiments show that when simplifying\ndatasets with scale such as $10^6$, Dask-means uses less than $30$MB of memory,\nachieves over $168$ times speedup compared to the widely-used Lloyd's\nalgorithm. We also validate Dask-means on mobile devices, where it demonstrates\nsignificant speedup and low memory cost compared to other state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) k-means algorithms.

    "abstract": "Ultra-light axion-like particles (ALPs) can be a viable solution to the dark\nmatter problem. The scalar field associated with ALPs, coupled to the\nelectromagnetic field, acts as an active birefringent medium, altering the\npolarisation properties of light through which it propagates. In particular,\noscillations of the axionic field induce monochromatic variations of the plane\nof linearly polarised radiation of astrophysical signals. The radio emission of\nmillisecond pulsars provides an excellent tool to search for such\nmanifestations, given their high fractional linear polarisation and negligible\nfluctuations of their polarisation properties. We have searched for the\nevidence of ALPs in the polarimetry measurements of pulsars collected and\npreprocessed for the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) campaign. Focusing on\nthe twelve brightest sources in linear polarisation, we searched for an\nastrophysical signal from axions using both frequentist and Bayesian\nstatistical frameworks. For the frequentist analysis, which uses Lomb-Scargle\nperiodograms at its core, no statistically significant signal has been found.\nThe model used for the Bayesian analysis has been adjusted to accommodate\nmultiple deterministic systematics that may be present in the data. A\nstatistically significant signal has been found in the dataset of multiple\npulsars with common frequency between $10^{-8}$ Hz and $2\\times10^{-8}$ Hz,\nwhich can most likely be explained by the residual Faraday rotation in the\nterrestrial ionosphere. Strong bounds on the coupling constant $g_{a\\gamma}$,\nin the same ballpark as other searches, have been obtained in the mass range\nbetween $6\\times10^{-24}$ eV and $5\\times10^{-21}$ eV. We conclude by\ndiscussing problems that can limit the sensitivity of our search for\nultra-light axions in the polarimetry data of pulsars, and possible ways to\nresolve them.",

Traditional quantum divergence\nmeasures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary\noriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily\nconnected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by\nisolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence\nrelations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and\ncharacterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between\nthis quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce\ndivergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer\nto as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures\ninherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases,\ncorrespond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue\ndistributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation\nin open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.",

In this\npaper, an unbiased estimator can be established from concealed data under mild\nassumptions, and the learned multi-class classifier can not only classify the\ninstance from insensitive labels accurately but also recognize the instance\nfrom the sensitive labels.

While the linearly\npolarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position\nangle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons\ncoupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for\ndetecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the\narrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian\nanalysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series,\nmodel noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We\nfind that for an ALDM density of $\\rho_0=0.4\\,\\textrm{GeV}/\\textrm{cm}^3$, the\nParkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling,\nnamely $\\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of\n$10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\\rm eV}$.

The dependence vanishes in Al/SiO$_2$/Si at room temperature, since the\nSiO$_2$ interlayer facilitates phonon scattering and destroys thermal\nnon-equilibrium.

Existing works mainly rely on introducing\nexternal semantic or depth priors to supervise the optimization of 3D\nrepresentations. However, the diffusion model, as an external prior that can\ndirectly provide visual supervision, has always underperformed in sparse-view\n3D reconstruction using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) due to the low\ninformation entropy of sparse views compared to text, leading to optimization\nchallenges caused by mode deviation. To this end, we present a thorough\nanalysis of SDS from the mode-seeking perspective and propose Inline Prior\nGuided Score Matching (IPSM), which leverages visual inline priors provided by\npose relationships between viewpoints to rectify the rendered image\ndistribution and decomposes the original optimization objective of SDS, thereby\noffering effective diffusion visual guidance without any fine-tuning or\npre-training. Furthermore, we propose the IPSM-Gaussian pipeline, which adopts\n3D Gaussian Splatting as the backbone and supplements depth and geometry\nconsistency regularization based on IPSM to further improve inline priors and\nrectified distribution.

    "abstract": "Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) is a popular design style of\nin-memory computing (IMC) architectures, which enables memory arrays to perform\nlogic operations to achieve low energy consumption and high parallelism. To\nimplement a target function on the data stored in memory, the function is first\ntransformed into a netlist of the supported logic operations through logic\nsynthesis. Then, the scheduler transforms the netlist into the instruction\nsequence given to the architecture. An instruction is either computing a logic\noperation in the netlist or copying the data from one array to another. Most\nexisting schedulers focus on optimizing the execution sequence of the\noperations to minimize the number of memory rows needed, neglecting the\nenergy-consuming copy instructions, which cannot be avoided when working with\narrays with limited sizes. In this work, our goal is to reduce the number of\ncopy instructions to decrease overall energy consumption. We propose MASIM, a\nmulti-array scheduler for in-memory SIMD computation. It consists of a\npriority-driven scheduling algorithm and an iterative improvement process.\nCompared to the best state-of-the-art scheduler, MASIM reduces the number of\ncopy instructions by 63.2% on average, which leads to a 28.0% reduction in\nenergy.",

Most existing models are developed for neutral atmospheric conditions\nand correspondingly neglect the effects of buoyancy and Coriolis forces that\nlead to veer, i.e. changes in the wind direction with height. Both veer and\nchanges in thermal stratification lead to lateral shearing of the wake behind a\nwind turbine, which affects the power output of downstream turbines.

The model combines\nthe new analytical representation of ABL vertical structure based on coupling\nEkman and surface layer descriptions (Narasimhan, Gayme, and Meneveau, 2024a)\nwith the vortex sheet-based wake model for yawed turbines (Bastankhah et al.,\n2022), as well as a new method to predict the wake expansion rate based on the\nTownsend-Perry logarithmic scaling of streamwise velocity variance.

    "abstract": "Recovering a physics-driven model, i.e. a governing set of equations of the\nunderlying dynamical systems, from the real-world data has been of recent\ninterest. Most existing methods either operate on simulation data with\nunrealistically high sampling rates or require explicit measurements of all\nsystem variables, which is not amenable in real-world deployments. Moreover,\nthey assume the timestamps of external perturbations to the physical system are\nknown a priori, without uncertainty, implicitly discounting any sensor\ntime-synchronization or human reporting errors. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel liquid time constant neural network (LTC-NN) based architecture to\nrecover underlying model of physical dynamics from real-world data. The\nautomatic differentiation property of LTC-NN nodes overcomes problems\nassociated with low sampling rates, the input dependent time constant in the\nforward pass of the hidden layer of LTC-NN nodes creates a massive search space\nof implicit physical dynamics, the physics model solver based data\nreconstruction loss guides the search for the correct set of implicit dynamics,\nand the use of the dropout regularization in the dense layer ensures extraction\nof the sparsest model. Further, to account for the perturbation timing error,\nwe utilize dense layer nodes to search through input shifts that results in the\nlowest reconstruction loss. Experiments on four benchmark dynamical systems,\nthree with simulation data and one with the real-world data show that the\nLTC-NN architecture is more accurate in recovering implicit physics model\ncoefficients than the state-of-the-art sparse model recovery approaches. We\nalso introduce four additional case studies (total eight) on real-life medical\nexamples in simulation and with real-world clinical data to show effectiveness\nof our approach in recovering underlying model in practice.",

Although many studies aim to minimize the average AoI of\nthe system through optimized resource scheduling schemes, they often fail to\nadequately consider the queue characteristics. Moreover, the vehicle mobility\nleads to rapid changes in network topology and channel conditions, making it\ndifficult to accurately reflect the unique characteristics of vehicles with the\ncalculated AoI under ideal channel conditions. This paper examines the impact\nof Doppler shifts caused by vehicle speeds on data transmission in error-prone\nchannels. Based on the M/M/1 and D/M/1 queuing theory models, we derive\nexpressions for the Age of Information and optimize the system's average AoI by\nadjusting the data extraction rates of vehicles (which affect system\nutilization). We propose an online optimization algorithm that dynamically\nadjusts the vehicles' data extraction rates based on environmental changes to\nensure optimal AoI. Simulation results have demonstrated that adjusting the\ndata extraction rates of vehicles can significantly reduce the system's AoI.\nAdditionally, in the network scenario of this work, the AoI of the D/M/1 system\nis lower than that of the M/M/1 system.",

In this paper, we introduce DataLab, a unified BI platform that\nintegrates a one-stop LLM-based agent framework with an augmented computational\nnotebook interface. DataLab supports various BI tasks for different data roles\nin data preparation, analysis, and visualization by seamlessly combining LLM\nassistance with user customization within a single environment. To achieve this\nunification, we design a domain knowledge incorporation module tailored for\nenterprise-specific BI tasks, an inter-agent communication mechanism to\nfacilitate information sharing across the BI workflow, and a cell-based context\nmanagement strategy to enhance context utilization efficiency in BI notebooks.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DataLab achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on various BI tasks across popular research benchmarks. Moreover,\nDataLab maintains high effectiveness and efficiency on real-world datasets from\nTencent, achieving up to a 58.58% increase in accuracy and a 61.65% reduction\nin token cost on enterprise-specific BI tasks.",

    "abstract": "Current reverberation mapping (RM) studies primarily focus on single emission\nlines, particularly the \\hb\\ line, which may not fully reveal the geometry and\nkinematic properties of the broad-line region (BLR). To overcome this\nlimitation, we conducted multiline RM observations on two highly variable\nactive galactic nuclei (AGNs), KUG 1141+371 and UGC 3374, using the Lijiang 2.4\nm telescope. Our goal was to investigate the detailed structure of different\nregions within the BLR. We measured the time lags of multiple broad emission\nlines (\\ha, \\hb, \\hg, \\hei, and \\heii) and found clear evidence of radial\nionization stratification in the BLRs of both AGNs. Velocity-resolved RM\nanalysis revealed distinct geometry and kinematics between the inner and outer\nregions of the BLRs. Assuming that velocity-resolved lags reflect the\nkinematics of BLR, our observations indicate that: (1) in KUG 1141+371, the\ninner BLR exhibits outflow signatures, while the outer region is consistent\nwith virialized motion; (2) in UGC 3374, the inner region displays virial\nmotion, while the outer region shows inflow. Furthermore, we detected\n``breathing\" behavior in the outer BLR regions of both AGN, while the inner BLR\nregions show ``anti-breathing\", which may be linked to intrinsic BLR\nproperties. We discuss these findings in the context of various BLR formation\nmodels, highlighting importance of long-term, multiline RM campaigns in\nunderstanding of BLR structure and evolution. Additionally, our results suggest\nthat the observed stratification in BLR geometry and kinematics may contribute\nto the scatter in black hole mass estimates and the rapid changes in\nvelocity-resolved RM signatures reported in recent studies.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive transformers have revolutionized high-fidelity image\ngeneration. One crucial ingredient lies in the tokenizer, which compresses\nhigh-resolution image patches into manageable discrete tokens with a scanning\nor hierarchical order suitable for large language models. Extending these\ntokenizers to 3D generation, however, presents a significant challenge: unlike\nimage patches that naturally exhibit spatial sequence and multi-scale\nrelationships, 3D data lacks an inherent order, making it difficult to compress\ninto fewer tokens while preserving structural details. To address this, we\nintroduce the Variational Tokenizer (VAT), which transforms unordered 3D data\ninto compact latent tokens with an implicit hierarchy, suited for efficient and\nhigh-fidelity coarse-to-fine autoregressive modeling. VAT begins with an\nin-context transformer, which compress numerous unordered 3D features into a\nreduced token set with minimal information loss. This latent space is then\nmapped to a Gaussian distribution for residual quantization, with token counts\nprogressively increasing across scales. In this way, tokens at different scales\nnaturally establish the interconnections by allocating themselves into\ndifferent subspaces within the same Gaussian distribution, facilitating\ndiscrete modeling of token relationships across scales. During the decoding\nphase, a high-resolution triplane is utilized to convert these compact latent\ntokens into detailed 3D shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VAT\nenables scalable and efficient 3D generation, outperforming existing methods in\nquality, efficiency, and generalization. Remarkably, VAT achieves up to a 250x\ncompression, reducing a 1MB mesh to just 3.9KB with a 96% F-score, and can\nfurther compress to 256 int8 tokens, achieving a 2000x reduction while\nmaintaining a 92% F-score.",

    "abstract": "Aging presents a significant challenge in face recognition, as changes in\nskin texture and tone can alter facial features over time, making it\nparticularly difficult to compare images of the same individual taken years\napart, such as in long-term identification scenarios. Transformer networks have\nthe strength to preserve sequential spatial relationships caused by aging\neffect. This paper presents a technique for loss evaluation that uses a\ntransformer network as an additive loss in the face recognition domain. The\nstandard metric loss function typically takes the final embedding of the main\nCNN backbone as its input. Here, we employ a transformer-metric loss, a\ncombined approach that integrates both transformer-loss and metric-loss. This\nresearch intends to analyze the transformer behavior on the convolution output\nwhen the CNN outcome is arranged in a sequential vector. These sequential\nvectors have the potential to overcome the texture or regional structure\nreferred to as wrinkles or sagging skin affected by aging. The transformer\nencoder takes input from the contextual vectors obtained from the final\nconvolution layer of the network. The learned features can be more\nage-invariant, complementing the discriminative power of the standard metric\nloss embedding. With this technique, we use transformer loss with various base\nmetric-loss functions to evaluate the effect of the combined loss functions. We\nobserve that such a configuration allows the network to achieve SoTA results in\nLFW and age-variant datasets (CA-LFW and AgeDB).

    "abstract": "Aluminum oxide (alumina, Al$_2$O$_3$) exists in various structures and has\nbroad industrial applications. While the crystal structure of\n$\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is well-established, those of transitional aluminas remain\nhighly debated. In this study, we propose a universal machine learning\ninteratomic potential (MLIP) for aluminas, trained using the neuroevolution\npotential (NEP) approach. The dataset is constructed through iterative training\nand farthest point sampling, ensuring the generation of the most representative\nconfigurations for an exhaustive sampling of the potential energy surface. The\naccuracy and generality of the potential are validated through simulations\nunder a wide range of conditions, including high temperatures and pressures. A\nphase diagram is presented that includes both transitional aluminas and\n$\\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ based on the NEP. We also successfully extrapolate the\nphase diagram of aluminas under extreme conditions ([0, 4000] K and [0, 200]\nGPa ranges of temperature and pressure, respectively), while maintaining high\naccuracy in describing their properties under more moderate conditions.\nFurthermore, combined with our developed structure search workflow, the NEP\nprovides an evaluation of existing $\\gamma$-Al$_2$O$_3$ structure models. The\nNEP developed in this work enables highly accurate dynamic simulations of\nvarious aluminas on larger scales and longer timescales, while also offering\nnew insights into the study of transitional aluminas structures.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in video large multimodal models (LMMs) have\nsignificantly improved their video understanding and reasoning capabilities.\nHowever, their performance drops on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks that are\nunderrepresented in training data. Traditional methods like fine-tuning on OOD\ndatasets are impractical due to high computational costs. While In-context\nlearning (ICL) with demonstration examples has shown promising generalization\nperformance in language tasks and image-language tasks without fine-tuning,\napplying ICL to video-language tasks faces challenges due to the limited\ncontext length in Video LMMs, as videos require longer token lengths. To\naddress these issues, we propose VideoICL, a novel video in-context learning\nframework for OOD tasks that introduces a similarity-based relevant example\nselection strategy and a confidence-based iterative inference approach. This\nallows to select the most relevant examples and rank them based on similarity,\nto be used for inference. If the generated response has low confidence, our\nframework selects new examples and performs inference again, iteratively\nrefining the results until a high-confidence response is obtained. This\napproach improves OOD video understanding performance by extending effective\ncontext length without incurring high costs. The experimental results on\nmultiple benchmarks demonstrate significant performance gains, especially in\ndomain-specific scenarios, laying the groundwork for broader video\ncomprehension applications.

First, I define parameters within a post-treatment network\nframework, distinguishing direct effects of treatment from indirect effects\nmediated through changes in network structure. I provide a causal\ninterpretation of the coefficients in a linear outcome model. For estimation\nand inference, I focus on a specific form of peer effects, represented by the\nfraction of treated friends. Second, in the absence of endogeneity, I establish\nthe consistency and asymptotic normality of ordinary least squares estimators.\nThird, if endogeneity is present, I propose addressing it through shift-share\ninstrumental variables, demonstrating the consistency and asymptotic normality\nof instrumental variable estimators in relatively sparse networks.

Frequency dependent squeezing obtained via a filter cavity is\ncurrently used to reduce quantum noise in the whole detector bandwidth. Such\nfilter cavities are required to have high finesse in order to produce the\noptimal squeezing angle rotation and the presence of losses is particularly\ndetrimental for the squeezed beam, as it does multiple round trip within the\ncavity. Characterising such losses is crucial to assess the quantum noise\nreduction achievable. In this paper we present an in-situ measurement of the\noptical losses, done for different positions of the beam on the mirrors of the\nVirgo filter cavity. We implemented an automatic system to map the losses with\nrespect to the beam position on the mirrors finding that optical losses depend\nclearly on the beam hitting position on input mirror, varying from 42 ppm to 87\nppm, while they are much more uniform when we scan the end mirror (53 ppm to 61\nppm). We repeated the measurements on several days, finding a statistical error\nsmaller than 4 ppm. The lowest measured losses are not much different with\nrespect to those estimated from individual mirror characterisation performed\nbefore the installation (30.3 - 39.3 ppm). This means that no major loss\nmechanism has been neglected in the estimation presented here. The larger\ndiscrepancy found for some beam positions is likely to be due to contamination.\nIn addition to a thorough characterisation of the losses, the methodology\ndescribed in this paper allowed to find an optimal cavity axis position for\nwhich the cavity round trip losses are among the lowest ever measured. This\nwork can contribute to achieve the very challenging losses goals for the\noptical cavities of the future gravitational-wave detectors.",

Specifically, we analyze the\ntypes of errors made by automated reporting methods and derive a new synthetic\ndataset of images paired with real and fake descriptions of findings and their\nlocations from a ground truth dataset. A new multi-label cross-modal\ncontrastive regression network is then trained on this datsaset. We evaluate\nthe resulting fact-checking model and its utility in correcting reports\ngenerated by several SOTA automated reporting tools on a variety of benchmark\ndatasets with results pointing to over 40\\% improvement in report quality\nthrough such error detection and correction.",

A\ncritical barrier to using LLMs for extracting insights from unstructured\nclinical notes lies in the prompt engineering process. Despite its pivotal role\nin determining task performance, a clear framework for prompt optimization\nremains absent. Current methods to address this gap take either a manual prompt\nrefinement approach, where domain experts collaborate with prompt engineers to\ncreate an optimal prompt, which is time-intensive and difficult to scale, or\nthrough employing automatic prompt optimizing approaches, where the value of\nthe input of domain experts is not fully realized. To address this, we propose\nStructEase, a novel framework that bridges the gap between automation and the\ninput of human expertise in prompt engineering. A core innovation of the\nframework is SamplEase, an iterative sampling algorithm that identifies\nhigh-value cases where expert feedback drives significant performance\nimprovements. This approach minimizes expert intervention, to effectively\nenhance classification outcomes. This targeted approach reduces labeling\nredundancy, mitigates human error, and enhances classification outcomes. We\nevaluated the performance of StructEase using a dataset of de-identified\nclinical narratives from the US National Electronic Injury Surveillance System\n(NEISS), demonstrating significant gains in classification performance compared\nto current methods. Our findings underscore the value of expert integration in\nLLM workflows, achieving notable improvements in F1 score while maintaining\nminimal expert effort.

By targeting the real-time processing capability, a new\nclass of latency attacks are reported recently. They exploit new attack\nsurfaces in object detectors by creating a computational bottleneck in the\npost-processing module, that leads to cascading failure and puts the real-time\ndownstream tasks at risks.

We first draw system-level\nconnections between latency attack and hardware capacity across heterogeneous\nGPU devices. Based on the particular adversarial behaviors, we utilize\nobjectness loss as a proxy and build background attention into the adversarial\ntraining pipeline, and achieve a reasonable balance between clean and robust\naccuracy.

Over the past 60\nyears, empirical analyses involving different types of instruments, including\nfixed-target experiments and $e^+e^-$ colliders, have indicated that the phase\nshifts in nonleptonic hyperon decays are relatively small, below order ten\ndegrees in size.

In various experimental and theoretical studies on hyperon,\ncharmed-baryon, and bottomed-baryon decays, different conventions have been\nadopted for defining the strong phases. It is important to be aware of this\nsituation when obtaining global averages from different measurements and\napplying the results to future investigations on $CP$ violation among baryons.\nThis paper gives an overview of the conventions employed in the literature for\nthe strong phases and suggests a unified parameterization form applicable to\nthe different alternatives.

By introducing\nthe efficacy energy metric to measure system robustness under various client\nconfigurations, we systematically explore key factors influencing FL\nperformance, including client numbers, aggregation strategies, graph\npartitioning, missing infectious reports. Numerical results manifest that STGAT\nexcels in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies in dynamic processes whereas\nLSTM performs well in simpler pattern. Moreover, our findings highlight the\nimportance of balancing feature consistency and volume uniformity among\nclients, as well as the prediction dilemma between information richness and\nintrinsic stochasticity of dynamic processes. This study offers practical\ninsights into the efficacy of FL scenario in epidemic management, demonstrates\nthe potential of FL to address broader collective dynamics.",

Generally, the synthesis of MXene materials involves etching\nthe weak M-A metallic bonds in the ternary layered transition metal carbides\nand nitrides (MAX phase) using HF acid or Lewis acid molten salts, while the\nstrong M-X covalent bonds preserve the two-dimensional framework structure of\nMXenes. On the other hand, the MAX phase material family also includes a\nsignificant class of members where the A site is occupied by non-metal main\ngroup elements (such as sulfur and phosphorus), in which both M-A and M-X are\ncovalent bond-type sublayers. The aforementioned etching methods cannot be used\nto synthesize MXene materials from these parent phases. In this work, we\ndiscovered that the covalent bond-type M-A and M-X sublayers exhibit different\nreactivity with some inorganic materials in a high-temperature molten state. By\nutilizing this difference in reactivity, we can structurally modify these\ncovalent sublayers, allowing for the substitution of elements at the X site\n(from B to Se, S, P, C) and converting non-metal A site atoms in non-van der\nWaals (non-vdW) MAX phases into surface atoms in vdW layered materials. This\nresults in a family of early transition metal Xide chalcogenides (TMXCs) that\nexhibit lattice characteristics of both MXenes and transition metal\nchalcogenides. Using electron-donor chemical scissors, these TMXC layered\nmaterials can be further exfoliated into monolayer nanosheets. The atomic\nconfigurations of each atom in these monolayer TMXCs are the same as those of\nconventional MXenes, but the oxidation states of the M-site atoms can be\nregulated by both X-site atoms and intercalated cations.",

Similarly, RowPress has emerged as another effective strategy for\nflipping targeted bits in DRAM.

Based on our\nanalytical and numerical discussions on the probability expressions, the\ndifference of the neutrino flavour oscillation arising from the shift in the\nwormhole factor $\\Lambda$ is detectable. It is crucial that the $\\Lambda$ as\ndeviation from the black holes can change the shapes of the curves greatly, in\nthe case of three-flavoured neutrinos in particular. The detailed comparisons\ncan be made among our estimations depicted in the figures for neutrino\noscillations and the measurements from the detector, which open a new window\nfor judging whether the remote star as lens is black-hole-like wormhole or just\na spherically symmetric black hole and further the wormhole factor $\\Lambda$\ncan be estimated.",

Both algorithms are prototypical sample-based quantum\nalgorithms and can be used for various quantum information processing tasks,\nincluding quantum principal component analysis, Hamiltonian simulation, and\nLindbladian simulation. In this work, we present detailed sample complexity\nanalyses for DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, as well as for WML\nand sample-based Lindbladian simulation. In particular, we prove that the\nsample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\\varepsilon$ for evolution\ntime $t$ and imprecision level $\\varepsilon$ quantified by the normalized\ndiamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample\ncomplexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample\ncomplexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor. Additionally, we prove\nthat the sample complexity of WML is no larger than $3t^2d^2/\\varepsilon$,\nwhere $d$ is the dimension of the space on which the Lindblad operator acts\nnontrivially, and we prove a lower bound of $10^{-4} t^2/\\varepsilon$ on the\nsample complexity of sample-based Lindbladian simulation.

However, existing distributed evidence fusion\nmethods lead to participants' preference leakage and fusion failures as they\ndirectly exchange raw evidence and do not assess evidence credibility like\ncentralized credible evidence fusion (CCEF) does. To do so, a\nprivacy-preserving distributed credible evidence fusion method with three-level\nconsensus (PCEF) is proposed in this paper. In evidence difference measure\n(EDM) neighbor consensus, an evidence-free equivalent expression of EDM among\nneighbored agents is derived with the shared dot product protocol for pignistic\nprobability and the identical judgment of two events with maximal subjective\nprobabilities, so that evidence privacy is guaranteed due to such irreversible\nevidence transformation. In EDM network consensus, the non-neighbored EDMs are\ninferred and neighbored EDMs reach uniformity via interaction between linear\naverage consensus (LAC) and low-rank matrix completion with rank adaptation to\nguarantee EDM consensus convergence and no solution of inferring raw evidence\nin numerical iteration style. In fusion network consensus, a privacy-preserving\nLAC with a self-cancelling differential privacy term is proposed, where each\nagent adds its randomness to the sharing content and step-by-step cancels such\nrandomness in consensus iterations. Besides, the sufficient condition of the\nconvergence to the CCEF is explored, and it is proven that raw evidence is\nimpossibly inferred in such an iterative consensus. The simulations show that\nPCEF is close to CCEF both in credibility and fusion results and obtains higher\ndecision accuracy with less time-comsuming than existing methods.",

Besides, to encourage future research, we present a simple yet\neffective generic 3D tracker, named PROT3D, that localizes the target object\nvia a progressive spatial-temporal network and outperforms all current\nsolutions by a large margin. By releasing GSOT3D, we expect to advance further\n3D tracking in future research and applications. Our benchmark and model as\nwell as the evaluation results will be publicly released at our webpage\nhttps://github.com/ailovejinx/GSOT3D.",

In this work, we\nevaluate eight different parameter optimization methods, applied during\nevolutionary search, over ten known benchmark problems, in two different\nscenarios.

We then show that different constant optimization\nmethods perform better in certain scenarios and that there is no overall best\nchoice for every problem.

    "abstract": "A glowing body of work has emerged focusing on instruction-following policies\nfor open-world agents, aiming to better align the agent's behavior with human\nintentions. However, the performance of these policies is highly susceptible to\nthe initial prompt, which leads to extra efforts in selecting the best\ninstructions. We propose a framework named Preference Goal Tuning (PGT). PGT\nallows an instruction following policy to interact with the environment to\ncollect several trajectories, which will be categorized into positive and\nnegative samples based on preference. Then we use preference learning to\nfine-tune the initial goal latent representation with the categorized\ntrajectories while keeping the policy backbone frozen. The experiment result\nshows that with minimal data and training, PGT achieves an average relative\nimprovement of 72.0% and 81.6% over 17 tasks in 2 different foundation policies\nrespectively, and outperforms the best human-selected instructions. Moreover,\nPGT surpasses full fine-tuning in the out-of-distribution (OOD) task-execution\nenvironments by 13.4%, indicating that our approach retains strong\ngeneralization capabilities. Since our approach stores a single latent\nrepresentation for each task independently, it can be viewed as an efficient\nmethod for continual learning, without the risk of catastrophic forgetting or\ntask interference. In short, PGT enhances the performance of agents across\nnearly all tasks in the Minecraft Skillforge benchmark and demonstrates\nrobustness to the execution environment.",

    "abstract": "Accurate $N$-body simulations of multiple systems such as binaries and\ntriples are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of\ninteracting binaries and binary mergers, including gravitational wave sources,\nblue stragglers and X-ray binaries. The logarithmic time-transformed explicit\nsymplectic integrator (LogH), also known as algorithmic regularization, is a\nstate-of-the-art method for this purpose.However, we show that this method is\naccurate for isolated Kepler orbits because of its ability to trace Keplerian\ntrajectories, but much less accurate for hierarichal triple systems. The method\ncan lead to an unphysical secular evolution of inner eccentricity in\nKozal-Lidov triples, despite a small energy error. We demonstrate that hybrid\nmethods, which apply LogH to the inner binary and alternative methods to the\nouter bodies, are significantly more effective, though not symplectic.\nAdditionally, we introduce a more efficient hybrid method, BlogH, which\neliminates the need for time synchronization and is time symmetric.

The challenges are twofold. First,\ncombining online and in-store user behavior data into a single data schema and\nsupporting multiple stages in the model life cycle (pre-training, training,\ninference, etc.) organically needs a new data pipeline design. Second, online\nrecommender systems, which solely rely on online user behavior sequences, must\nbe redesigned to support online and in-store user data as input under the\nsequential modeling setting. To overcome the first challenge, we propose a\nhybrid, omnichannel data pipeline to compile online and in-store user behavior\ndata by caching information from diverse data sources.

Others suggest decreasing mutual information between them,\nwhile increasing task-relevant information. We ponder upon this debate and\npropose to revisit the core idea of SSL within the framework of partial\ninformation decomposition (PID).

Our investigation on instantiation of SSL\nwithin the PID framework leads to upgrading the existing pipelines by\nconsidering the components of the PID in the SSL models for improved\nrepresentation learning.

Our pipeline focuses on extracting the\nunique information component under the PID to build upon lower level\nsupervision for generic feature learning and on developing higher-level\nsupervisory signals for task-related feature learning. In essence, this could\nbe interpreted as a joint utilization of local and global clustering.\nExperiments on four baselines and four datasets show the effectiveness and\ngenerality of our approach in improving existing SSL frameworks.",

To enable systematic evaluation, we\nintroduce OmniBench-99, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 99 videos across\nhumans/animals, environments, and objects, comprising 4 editing types and 8\nscenarios. Extensive experiments show UES enables models without inherent\nediting capability to perform powerful and universal editing while preserving\nor even enhancing their original generation performance.",

This study aims to\naddress these challenges by exploring the application of machine learning\nalgorithms to the automated classification of ISO tracklets in simulated LSST\ndata. We employed various machine learning algorithms, including random forests\n(RFs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), gradient boosting machines (GBMs),\nand neural networks (NNs), to classify ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We\ndemonstrate that GBM and RF algorithms outperform SGD and NN algorithms in\naccurately distinguishing ISOs from other Solar System objects.

This paper\nsystematically compares data augmentation techniques and their impact on\nprediction performance in a typical LA task: prediction of academic outcomes.\nAugmentation is demonstrated on four SML models, which we successfully\nreplicated from a previous LAK study based on AUC values. Among 21 augmentation\ntechniques, SMOTE-ENN sampling performed the best, improving the average AUC by\n0.01 and approximately halving the training time compared to the baseline\nmodels.

We apply the proposed framework to\nanalyze bifurcations of quasi-periodic orbits in several mechanical systems\nexhibiting 1:2 internal resonance, including a finite element model of a\nshallow-curved shell. We uncover local bifurcations such as period-doubling and\nsaddle-node, as well as global bifurcations such as homoclinic connections,\nisolas, and simple bifurcations of quasi-periodic orbits. We also observe\ncascades of period-doubling bifurcations of quasi-periodic orbits that\neventually result in chaotic motions, as well as the coexistence of chaotic and\nquasi-periodic attractors. These findings elucidate the complex bifurcation\nmechanism of quasi-periodic orbits in 1:2 internally resonant systems.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models suffer severe object repetition and local distortion when\nthe inference resolution differs from its pre-trained resolution. We propose\nAccDiffusion v2, an accurate method for patch-wise higher-resolution diffusion\nextrapolation without training. Our in-depth analysis in this paper shows that\nusing an identical text prompt for different patches leads to repetitive\ngeneration, while the absence of a prompt undermines image details. In\nresponse, our AccDiffusion v2 novelly decouples the vanilla image-content-aware\nprompt into a set of patch-content-aware prompts, each of which serves as a\nmore precise description of a patch. Further analysis reveals that local\ndistortion arises from inaccurate descriptions in prompts about the local\nstructure of higher-resolution images. To address this issue, AccDiffusion v2,\nfor the first time, introduces an auxiliary local structural information\nthrough ControlNet during higher-resolution diffusion extrapolation aiming to\nmitigate the local distortions. Finally, our analysis indicates that global\nsemantic information is conducive to suppressing both repetitive generation and\nlocal distortion. Hence, our AccDiffusion v2 further proposes dilated sampling\nwith window interaction for better global semantic information during\nhigher-resolution diffusion extrapolation. We conduct extensive experiments,\nincluding both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, to demonstrate the\nefficacy of our AccDiffusion v2. The quantitative comparison shows that\nAccDiffusion v2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in image generation\nextrapolation without training. The qualitative comparison intuitively\nillustrates that AccDiffusion v2 effectively suppresses the issues of\nrepetitive generation and local distortion in image generation extrapolation.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/lzhxmu/AccDiffusion_v2.",

However,\nfinancial datasets in the industry often encounter some challenges, such as\ndata heterogeneity, the predominance of numerical features and the large scale\nof the data, which can range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of\nrecords. These challenges can lead to significant memory and computational\nissues when using tree-based models. Consequently, there is a growing need for\nneural network-based solutions that can outperform these models. In this paper,\nwe introduce TKGMLP, an hybrid network for tabular data that combines shallow\nKolmogorov Arnold Networks with Gated Multilayer Perceptron. This model\nleverages the strengths of both architectures to improve performance and\nscalability. We validate TKGMLP on a real-world credit scoring dataset, where\nit achieves state-of-the-art results and outperforms current benchmarks.\nFurthermore, our findings demonstrate that the model continues to improve as\nthe dataset size increases, making it highly scalable. Additionally, we propose\na novel feature encoding method for numerical data, specifically designed to\naddress the predominance of numerical features in financial datasets. The\nintegration of this feature encoding method within TKGMLP significantly\nimproves prediction accuracy.

We utilized\ncrash data involving large vehicles in South Carolina work zones from 2014 to\n2018, which included four times more LS crashes than HS crashes. The objective\nof this study is to evaluate the crash severity prediction performance of\nvarious statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models under different\nfeature selection and data balancing techniques. Findings highlight a disparity\nin LS and HS predictions, with lower accuracy for HS crashes due to class\nimbalance and feature overlap. Discriminative Mutual Information (DMI) yields\nthe most effective feature set for predicting HS crashes without requiring data\nbalancing, particularly when paired with gradient boosting models and deep\nneural networks such as CatBoost, NeuralNetTorch, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Data\nbalancing techniques such as NearMiss-1 maximize HS recall when combined with\nDMI-selected features and certain models such as LightGBM, making them\nwell-suited for HS crash prediction. Conversely, RandomUnderSampler, HS Class\nWeighting, and RandomOverSampler achieve more balanced performance, which is\ndefined as an equitable trade-off between LS and HS metrics, especially when\napplied to NeuralNetTorch, NeuralNetFastAI, CatBoost, LightGBM, and Bayesian\nMixed Logit (BML) using merged feature sets or models without feature\nselection.

The survival rate is particularly uncertain for massive\nstars with low-mass companions, which are thought to be the progenitors of most\nblack hole X-ray binaries. We present a search for close black hole companions\n(separations less than 20 solar radii) to AFGK-type stars in TESS, i.e. the\nnon-accreting counterparts to and progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries. Such\nblack holes can be detected by the tidally induced ellipsoidal deformation of\nthe visible star, and the ensuing photometric light-curve variations.

ECoG signals are multi-channel temporal signals which is\ncollected using a high-density electrode array at a high sampling frequency.\nThe data between channels has a high similarity or redundancy in the temporal\ndomain. The redundancy of data not only reduces the computational efficiency of\nthe model, but also overwhelms the extraction of effective features, resulting\nin a decrease in performance. How to efficiently utilize ECoG multi-channel\nsignals is one of the research topics. Effective channel screening or\ncompression can greatly reduce the model size, thereby improving computational\nefficiency, this would be a good direction to solve the problem. Based on\nprevious work [1], this paper proposes a very simple channel compression\nmethod, which uses a learnable matrix to perform matrix multiplication on the\noriginal channels, that is, assigning weights to the channels and then linearly\nadd them up. This effectively reduces the number of final channels. In the\nexperiment, we used the vision-based ECoG multi-classification dataset owned by\nour laboratory to test the proposed channel selection (compression) method. We\nfound that the new method can compress the original 128-channel ECoG signal to\n32 channels (of which subject MonJ is compressed to 8 channels), greatly\nreducing the size of the model.

    "abstract": "The integration of algorithms from quantum information with neural networks\nhas enabled unprecedented advancements in various domains. Nonetheless, the\napplication of quantum machine learning algorithms for image classification\npredominantly relies on traditional architectures such as variational quantum\ncircuits. The performance of these models is closely tied to the scale of their\nparameters, with the substantial demand for parameters potentially leading to\nlimitations in computational resources and a significant increase in\ncomputation time. In this paper, we introduce a Lean Classical-Quantum Hybrid\nNeural Network (LCQHNN), which achieves efficient classification performance\nwith only four layers of variational circuits, thereby substantially reducing\ncomputational costs. Our experiments demonstrate that LCQHNN achieves 100\\%,\n99.02\\%, and 85.55\\% classification accuracy on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and\nCIFAR-10 datasets. Under the same parameter conditions, the convergence speed\nof this method is also faster than that of traditional models. Furthermore,\nthrough visualization studies, it is found that the model effectively captures\nkey data features during training and establishes a clear association between\nthese features and their corresponding categories. This study confirms that the\nemployment of quantum algorithms enhances the model's ability to handle complex\nclassification problems.",

This paper focuses on author profiling in the Bangla language,\naiming to extract valuable insights about anonymous authors based on their\nwriting style on social media. The primary objective is to introduce and\nbenchmark the performance of machine learning approaches on a newly created\nBangla Author Profiling dataset, BN-AuthProf. The dataset comprises 30,131\nsocial media posts from 300 authors, labeled by their age and gender. Authors'\nidentities and sensitive information were anonymized to ensure privacy. Various\nclassical machine learning and deep learning techniques were employed to\nevaluate the dataset. For gender classification, the best accuracy achieved was\n80% using Support Vector Machine (SVM), while a Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)\nclassifier achieved the best F1 score of 0.756. For age classification, MNB\nattained a maximum accuracy score of 91% with an F1 score of 0.905.

    "abstract": "In India, the majority of farmers are classified as small or marginal, making\ntheir livelihoods particularly vulnerable to economic losses due to market\nsaturation and climate risks. Effective crop planning can significantly impact\ntheir expected income, yet existing decision support systems (DSS) often\nprovide generic recommendations that fail to account for real-time market\ndynamics and the interactions among multiple farmers. In this paper, we\nevaluate the viability of three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\napproaches for optimizing total farmer income and promoting fairness in crop\nplanning: Independent Q-Learning (IQL), where each farmer acts independently\nwithout coordination, Agent-by-Agent (ABA), which sequentially optimizes each\nfarmer's policy in relation to the others, and the Multi-agent Rollout Policy,\nwhich jointly optimizes all farmers' actions for global reward maximization.\nOur results demonstrate that while IQL offers computational efficiency with\nlinear runtime, it struggles with coordination among agents, leading to lower\ntotal rewards and an unequal distribution of income. Conversely, the\nMulti-agent Rollout policy achieves the highest total rewards and promotes\nequitable income distribution among farmers but requires significantly more\ncomputational resources, making it less practical for large numbers of agents.\nABA strikes a balance between runtime efficiency and reward optimization,\noffering reasonable total rewards with acceptable fairness and scalability.\nThese findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate MARL\napproaches in DSS to provide personalized and equitable crop planning\nrecommendations, advancing the development of more adaptive and farmer-centric\nagricultural decision-making systems.",

    "abstract": "Query-based models are extensively used in 3D object detection tasks, with a\nwide range of pre-trained checkpoints readily available online. However,\ndespite their popularity, these models often require an excessive number of\nobject queries, far surpassing the actual number of objects to detect. The\nredundant queries result in unnecessary computational and memory costs. In this\npaper, we find that not all queries contribute equally -- a significant portion\nof queries have a much smaller impact compared to others. Based on this\nobservation, we propose an embarrassingly simple approach called \\bd{G}radually\n\\bd{P}runing \\bd{Q}ueries (GPQ), which prunes queries incrementally based on\ntheir classification scores. It is straightforward to implement in any\nquery-based method, as it can be seamlessly integrated as a fine-tuning step\nusing an existing checkpoint after training. With GPQ, users can easily\ngenerate multiple models with fewer queries, starting from a checkpoint with an\nexcessive number of queries. Experiments on various advanced 3D detectors show\nthat GPQ effectively reduces redundant queries while maintaining performance.\nUsing our method, model inference on desktop GPUs can be accelerated by up to\n1.31x. Moreover, after deployment on edge devices, it achieves up to a 67.86\\%\nreduction in FLOPs and a 76.38\\% decrease in inference time.

An edge-weighted GNN\n(EW-GNN) decoder is proposed, which operates on the Tanner graph with an\niterative message-passing structure. Once trained on a single linear block\ncode, the EW-GNN decoder can be directly used to decode other linear block\ncodes of different code lengths and code rates. An iterative joint training of\nthe DRL-based code designer and the EW-GNN decoder is performed to optimize the\nend-end encoding and decoding process. Simulation results show the proposed\nauto-encoder significantly surpasses several traditional coding schemes at\nshort block lengths, including low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with the\nbelief propagation (BP) decoding and the maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD), and\nBCH with BP decoding, offering superior error-correction capabilities while\nmaintaining low decoding complexity.",

Direct time-of-flight LiDAR has the\npotential to fulfill these demands, thanks to its ability to provide\nhigh-precision depth measurements at long standoff distances. While\nconventional LiDAR relies on avalanche photodiodes (APDs), single-photon\navalanche diodes (SPADs) are an emerging image-sensing technology that offer\nmany advantages such as extreme sensitivity and time resolution. In this paper,\nwe remove the key challenges to widespread adoption of SPAD-based LiDARs: their\nsusceptibility to ambient light and the large amount of raw photon data that\nmust be processed to obtain in-pixel depth estimates. We propose new algorithms\nand sensing policies that improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and increase\ncomputing and memory efficiency for SPAD-based LiDARs. During capture, we use\nexternal signals to \\emph{foveate}, i.e., guide how the SPAD system estimates\nscene depths. This foveated approach allows our method to ``zoom into'' the\nsignal of interest, reducing the amount of raw photon data that needs to be\nstored and transferred from the SPAD sensor, while also improving resilience to\nambient light. We show results both in simulation and also with real hardware\nemulation, with specific implementations achieving a 1548-fold reduction in\nmemory usage, and our algorithms can be applied to newly available and future\nSPAD arrays.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images have proven to be a valuable cue for\nmultimodal Land Cover Classification (LCC) when combined with RGB images. Most\nexisting studies on cross-modal fusion assume that consistent feature\ninformation is necessary between the two modalities, and as a result, they\nconstruct networks without adequately addressing the unique characteristics of\neach modality. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture, named the\nAsymmetric Semantic Aligning Network (ASANet), which introduces asymmetry at\nthe feature level to address the issue that multi-modal architectures\nfrequently fail to fully utilize complementary features. The core of this\nnetwork is the Semantic Focusing Module (SFM), which explicitly calculates\ndifferential weights for each modality to account for the modality-specific\nfeatures. Furthermore, ASANet incorporates a Cascade Fusion Module (CFM), which\ndelves deeper into channel and spatial representations to efficiently select\nfeatures from the two modalities for fusion. Through the collaborative effort\nof these two modules, the proposed ASANet effectively learns feature\ncorrelations between the two modalities and eliminates noise caused by feature\ndifferences. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ASANet achieves\nexcellent performance on three multimodal datasets. Additionally, we have\nestablished a new RGB-SAR multimodal dataset, on which our ASANet outperforms\nother mainstream methods with improvements ranging from 1.21% to 17.69%. The\nASANet runs at 48.7 frames per second (FPS) when the input image is 256x256\npixels. The source code are available at https://github.com/whu-pzhang/ASANet",

    "abstract": "In the fast-evolving field of information retrieval (IR), the integration of\ngenerative AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs) is transforming\nhow users search for and interact with information. Recognizing this paradigm\nshift at the intersection of IR and generative AI (IR-GenAI), a visioning\nworkshop supported by the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) was held in July\n2024 to discuss the future of IR in the age of generative AI. This workshop\nconvened 44 experts in information retrieval, natural language processing,\nhuman-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence from academia,\nindustry, and government to explore how generative AI can enhance IR and vice\nversa, and to identify the major challenges and opportunities in this rapidly\nadvancing field.\n  This report contains a summary of discussions as potentially important\nresearch topics and contains a list of recommendations for academics, industry\npractitioners, institutions, evaluation campaigns, and funding agencies.",
