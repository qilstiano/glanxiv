    "abstract": "Effective debugging is a crucial aspect of software development, demanding\nproblem-solving skills, expertise, and appropriate tools. Although previous\nresearch has studied expert developers' debugging strategies, the specific\nfactors influencing strategy choice in complex scenarios remain underexplored.\nTo investigate these contextual factors, we conducted two studies. First, we\nsurveyed 35 developers to identify experiences with challenging debugging\nproblems and contextual complexities. Second, we held semi-structured\ninterviews with 16 experienced developers to gain deeper insight into strategic\nreasoning for complex debugging tasks. Insights from both groups enriched our\nunderstanding of debugging strategies at different expertise levels. We found\nthat contextual factors interact in complex ways, and combinations of factors\ninfluence strategy choice, evolving throughout the debugging process.\nHypothesis making is the baseline for debugging, with experience and code\nfamiliarity crucial for strategy selection. Our results show a gap between\nlearning and effectively practicing strategies in challenging contexts,\nhighlighting the need for carefully designed debugging tools and educational\nframeworks that align with problem contexts.",

    "abstract": "Envelope methods perform dimension reduction of predictors or responses in\nmultivariate regression, exploiting the relationship between them to improve\nestimation efficiency. While most research on envelopes has focused on their\nestimation properties, certain envelope estimators have been shown to excel at\nprediction in both low and high dimensions. In this paper, we propose to\nfurther improve prediction through envelope-guided regularization (EgReg), a\nnovel method which uses envelope-derived information to guide shrinkage along\nthe principal components (PCs) of the predictor matrix. We situate EgReg among\nother PC-based regression methods and envelope methods to motivate its\ndevelopment. We show that EgReg delivers lower prediction risk than a closely\nrelated non-shrinkage envelope estimator when the number of predictors $p$ and\nobservations $n$ are fixed and in any alignment. In an asymptotic regime where\nthe true intrinsic dimension of the predictors and $n$ diverge proportionally,\nwe find that the limiting prediction risk of the non-shrinkage envelope\nestimator exhibits a double descent phenomenon and is consistently larger than\nthe limiting risk for EgReg. We compare the prediction performance of EgReg\nwith envelope methods and other PC-based prediction methods in simulations and\na real data example, observing improved prediction performance over these\nalternative approaches in general.",

As systems evolve, changes made to one microservice can\ntrigger ripple effects, jeopardizing system consistency and requiring updates\nto dependent services, which increases maintenance and operational complexity.\nEffectively tracking different types of dependencies across microservices is\nessential for anticipating the impact of such changes.

    "abstract": "Would not it be much more convenient for everybody to try on clothes by only\nlooking into a mirror ? The answer to that problem is virtual try-on, enabling\nusers to digitally experiment with outfits. The core challenge lies in\nrealistic image-to-image translation, where clothing must fit diverse human\nforms, poses, and figures. Early methods, which used 2D transformations,\noffered speed, but image quality was often disappointing and lacked the nuance\nof deep learning. Though GAN-based techniques enhanced realism, their\ndependence on paired data proved limiting. More adaptable methods offered great\nvisuals but demanded significant computing power and time. Recent advances in\ndiffusion models have shown promise for high-fidelity translation, yet the\ncurrent crop of virtual try-on tools still struggle with detail loss and\nwarping issues. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes EfficientVITON,\na new virtual try-on system leveraging the impressive pre-trained Stable\nDiffusion model for better images and deployment feasibility. The system\nincludes a spatial encoder to maintain clothings finer details and zero\ncross-attention blocks to capture the subtleties of how clothes fit a human\nbody. Input images are carefully prepared, and the diffusion process has been\ntweaked to significantly cut generation time without image quality loss. The\ntraining process involves two distinct stages of fine-tuning, carefully\nincorporating a balance of loss functions to ensure both accurate try-on\nresults and high-quality visuals. Rigorous testing on the VITON-HD dataset,\nsupplemented with real-world examples, has demonstrated that EfficientVITON\nachieves state-of-the-art results.",

The recent\nintroduction of GPU TEEs by NVIDIA enables machine learning (ML) models to be\ntrained without leaking model weights or data to the cloud provider. However,\nthe potential performance implications of using GPU TEEs for ML training are\nnot well characterized. In this work, we present an in-depth characterization\nstudy on performance overhead associated with running distributed data parallel\n(DDP) ML training with GPU Trusted Execution Environments (TEE).\n  Our study reveals the performance challenges in DDP training within GPU TEEs.\nDDP uses ring-all-reduce, a well-known approach, to aggregate gradients from\nmultiple devices. Ring all-reduce consists of multiple scatter-reduce and\nall-gather operations. In GPU TEEs only the GPU package (GPU and HBM memory) is\ntrusted. Hence, any data communicated outside the GPU packages must be\nencrypted and authenticated for confidentiality and integrity verification.\nHence, each phase of the ring-all-reduce requires encryption and message\nauthentication code (MAC) generation from the sender, and decryption and MAC\nauthentication on the receiver. As the number of GPUs participating in DDP\nincreases, the overhead of secure inter-GPU communication during\nring-all-reduce grows proportionally. Additionally, larger models lead to more\nasynchronous all-reduce operations, exacerbating the communication cost. Our\nresults show that with four GPU TEEs, depending on the model that is being\ntrained, the runtime per training iteration increases by an average of 8x and\nup to a maximum of 41.6x compared to DDP training without TEE.",

    "abstract": "Curvature-driven instabilities are ubiquitous in magnetised fusion plasmas.\nBy analysing the conservation laws of the gyrokinetic system of equations, we\ndemonstrate that the well-known spatial localisation of these instabilities to\nregions of `bad magnetic curvature' can be explained using the conservation law\nfor a sign-indefinite quadratic quantity that we call the `gyrokinetic field\ninvariant'. Its evolution equation allows us to define the local effective\nmagnetic curvature whose sign demarcates the regions of `good' and `bad'\ncurvature, which, under some additional simplifying assumptions, can be shown\nto correspond to the inboard (high-field) and outboard (low-field) sides of a\ntokamak plasma, respectively. We find that, given some reasonable assumptions,\nelectrostatic curvature-driven modes are always localised to the regions of bad\nmagnetic curvature, regardless of the specific character of the instability.\nMore importantly, we also deduce that any mode that is unstable in the region\nof good magnetic curvature must be electromagnetic in nature. As a concrete\nexample, we present the magnetic-drift mode, a novel good-curvature\nelectromagnetic instability, and compare its properties with the well-known\nelectron-temperature-gradient instability. Finally, we discuss the relevance of\nthe magnetic-drift mode for high-$\\beta$ fusion plasmas, and in particular its\nrelationship with microtearing modes.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through\nnetwork projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the\nabundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However,\nthis approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information,\ninefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a\nfully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to\nzero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing\nscRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which\nthe hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq\ndata, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each\nhyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed\nand records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph\nconceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the\npairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We\npropose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference\nHypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated\nDual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform\nestablished methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The\nimprovement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data\nmodularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression\nnetwork, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph\nfrom the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding\ncomputation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from\nsingle-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the\npairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.",

    "abstract": "We study an information-theoretic privacy mechanism design, where an agent\nobserves useful data $Y$ and wants to reveal the information to a user. Since\nthe useful data is correlated with the private data $X$, the agent uses a\nprivacy mechanism to produce disclosed data $U$ that can be released. We assume\nthat the agent observes $Y$ and has no direct access to $X$, i.e., the private\ndata is hidden. We study the privacy mechanism design that maximizes the\nrevealed information about $Y$ while satisfying a bounded Local Information\nPrivacy (LIP) criterion. When the leakage is sufficiently small, concepts from\ninformation geometry allow us to locally approximate the mutual information. By\nutilizing this approximation the main privacy-utility trade-off problem can be\nrewritten as a quadratic optimization problem that has closed-form solution\nunder some constraints. For the cases where the closed-form solution is not\nobtained we provide lower bounds on it. In contrast to the previous works that\nhave complexity issues, here, we provide simple privacy designs with low\ncomplexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular\nvector of a matrix. To do so, we follow two approaches where in the first one\nwe find a lower bound on the main problem and then approximate it, however, in\nthe second approach we approximate the main problem directly. In this work, we\npresent geometrical interpretations of the proposed methods and in a numerical\nexample we compare our results considering both approaches with the optimal\nsolution and the previous methods. Furthermore, we discuss how our method can\nbe generalized considering larger amounts for the privacy leakage.

This is likely to happen because there is a\nsignificant underrepresentation of darker skin tones in training datasets for\nmachine learning models. While efforts to address bias in dermatology have\nfocused on improving dataset diversity and mitigating disparities in\ndiscriminative models, the impact of racial bias on generative models remains\nunderexplored. Generative models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), are\nincreasingly used in healthcare applications, yet their fairness across diverse\nskin tones is currently not well understood. In this study, we evaluate the\nfairness of generative models in clinical dermatology with respect to racial\nbias. For this purpose, we first train a VAE with a perceptual loss to generate\nand reconstruct high-quality skin images across different skin tones. We\nutilize the Fitzpatrick17k dataset to examine how racial bias influences the\nrepresentation and performance of these models. Our findings indicate that VAE\nperformance is, as expected, influenced by representation, i.e. increased skin\ntone representation comes with increased performance on the given skin tone.\nHowever, we also observe, even independently of representation, that the VAE\nperforms better for lighter skin tones. Additionally, the uncertainty estimates\nproduced by the VAE are ineffective in assessing the model's fairness. These\nresults highlight the need for more representative dermatological datasets, but\nalso a need for better understanding the sources of bias in such model, as well\nas improved uncertainty quantification mechanisms to detect and address racial\nbias in generative models for trustworthy healthcare technologies.",

    "abstract": "The integration of AI in education offers significant potential to enhance\nlearning efficiency. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and\nLlama, allow students to query a wide range of topics, providing unprecedented\nflexibility. However, LLMs face challenges, such as handling varying content\nrelevance and lack of personalization. To address these challenges, we propose\nTutorLLM, a personalized learning recommender LLM system based on Knowledge\nTracing (KT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The novelty of TutorLLM\nlies in its unique combination of KT and RAG techniques with LLMs, which\nenables dynamic retrieval of context-specific knowledge and provides\npersonalized learning recommendations based on the student's personal learning\nstate. Specifically, this integration allows TutorLLM to tailor responses based\non individual learning states predicted by the Multi-Features with Latent\nRelations BERT-based KT (MLFBK) model and to enhance response accuracy with a\nScraper model. The evaluation includes user assessment questionnaires and\nperformance metrics, demonstrating a 10% improvement in user satisfaction and a\n5\\% increase in quiz scores compared to using general LLMs alone.",

While our current understanding of chromospheric activity is largely\nderived from specific lines sensitive to chromospheric heating, such as the Ca\nII HK doublet, previous observational studies have shown that other spectral\nlines are also affected. To investigate the influence of activity on line\nformation in greater detail, we constructed a set of stellar models for\nhypothetical G2 dwarf stars with varying levels of activity and calculated\ntheir synthetic spectra. A comparison of these spectra revealed two spectral\nregions most significantly impacted by activity: approximately 3300-4400 A and\n5250-5500 A. By calculating the total contribution function of the lines, we\ndetermined that the emergence of a secondary chromospheric contribution to line\nformation is the primary mechanism driving these changes. Based on our\ncalculations and analysis, we compiled a list of transition lines and their\ncorresponding changes due to chromospheric activity. This list could serve as a\nvaluable tool for selecting spectral lines applicable to a wide range of\nastrophysical studies.",

The utilized DP-FL algorithm guarantees a probably approximately correct\n(PAC) bound on the conditional average cache hit. Further, to reduce the cost\nof communicating gradients, one-bit quantization of the stochastic gradient\ndescent (OBSGD) is proposed, and a convergence guarantee of\n$\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ is obtained for the proposed algorithm, where $T$ is\nthe number of iterations.

Many of them rely on\nciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their\nlarval forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable\ndiversity, producing intricate and dynamic 3D flows that are notoriously\ndifficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic\nimaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae\nbetween a glass slide and cover slip to study their flows in quasi-2D. However,\na comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds\nnumber (<1) flows in quasi-2D confinement, particularly in light of their\ncomplex forms, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around\nlarvae proliferate with increasing confinement and illuminate the underlying\nphysical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in\nlarvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal\npatterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas\nunder strong confinement, the number of generated vortices significantly\nincreased. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds\nnumber theoretical model based on the superposition of confined Stokeslets.\nBuilding on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for\nconfinement-induced flows, which suggests that vorticity dynamics are primarily\ndetermined by local morphological features, rather than solely the body plan.\nOur work provides fundamental insights into form-functional relationships\nbetween larval morphology and flow generation.

Recent advances in\nmachine learning (ML)-based data assimilation methods have demonstrated\nencouraging results. In this work, we develop an ensemble score filter (EnSF)\nthat integrates image inpainting to solve the data assimilation problems with\npartial observations. The EnSF method exploits an exclusively designed\ntraining-free diffusion models to solve high-dimensional nonlinear data\nassimilation problems. Its performance has been successfully demonstrated in\nthe context of having full observations, i.e., all the state variables are\ndirectly or indirectly observed. However, because the EnSF does not use a\ncovariance matrix to capture the dependence between the observed and unobserved\nstate variables, it is nontrivial to extend the original EnSF method to the\npartial observation scenario. In this work, we incorporate various image\ninpainting techniques into the EnSF to predict the unobserved states during\ndata assimilation. At each filtering step, we first use the diffusion model to\nestimate the observed states by integrating the likelihood information into the\nscore function. Then, we use image inpainting methods to predict the unobserved\nstate variables. We demonstrate the performance of the EnSF with inpainting by\ntracking the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic (SQG) model dynamics under a variety of\nscenarios. The successful proof of concept paves the way to more in-depth\ninvestigations on exploiting modern image inpainting techniques to advance data\nassimilation methodology for practical geoscience and weather forecasting\nproblems.",

The present study\nfocuses on the low-energy phenomenology associated with quantum chromodynamics\n(QCD), where mesons and their interactions serve as the pertinent degrees of\nfreedom, rather than the fundamental constituents of quarks and gluons. Given\nthat SU(4) configurations are completely based on SU(3) configurations, the\npossible relationships between meson states in SU(3) and those in SU(4) are\nexplored at finite temperature. Meson states, which are defined by distinct\nchiral properties, are grouped according to their orbital angular momentum $J$,\nparity $P$, and charge conjugation $C$. Consequently, this organization yields\nscalar mesons with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, pseudoscalar mesons with\n$J^{PC}=0^{-+}$, vector mesons with $J^{PC}=1^{--}$, and axialvector mesons\nwith $J^{PC}=1^{++}$.

In this paper, a novel asymmetrical\nautoencoder with a lifting wavelet transform (LWT) layer is developed to\ncompress bearing sensor data. The encoder part of the network consists of a\nconvolutional layer followed by a wavelet filterbank layer. Specifically, a\ndual-channel convolutional block with diverse convolutional kernel sizes and\nvarying processing depths is integrated into the wavelet filterbank layer to\nenable comprehensive feature extraction from the wavelet domain. Additionally,\nthe adaptive hard-thresholding nonlinearity is applied to remove redundant\ncomponents while denoising the primary wavelet coefficients.

Recent advancements in large\nmultimodal model (LMM)-based mobile agents have demonstrated the ability to\nperceive and act in mobile environments. However, current approaches face\nsignificant limitations: they fall short in addressing real-world human needs,\nstruggle with reasoning-intensive and long-horizon tasks, and lack mechanisms\nto learn and improve from prior experiences. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce Mobile-Agent-E, a hierarchical multi-agent framework capable of\nself-evolution through past experience. By hierarchical, we mean an explicit\nseparation of high-level planning and low-level action execution. The framework\ncomprises a Manager, responsible for devising overall plans by breaking down\ncomplex tasks into subgoals, and four subordinate agents--Perceptor, Operator,\nAction Reflector, and Notetaker--which handle fine-grained visual perception,\nimmediate action execution, error verification, and information aggregation,\nrespectively. Mobile-Agent-E also features a novel self-evolution module which\nmaintains a persistent long-term memory comprising Tips and Shortcuts. Tips are\ngeneral guidance and lessons learned from prior tasks on how to effectively\ninteract with the environment. Shortcuts are reusable, executable sequences of\natomic operations tailored for specific subroutines. The inclusion of Tips and\nShortcuts facilitates continuous refinement in performance and efficiency.\nAlongside this framework, we introduce Mobile-Eval-E, a new benchmark featuring\ncomplex mobile tasks requiring long-horizon, multi-app interactions.

The SSM variant Mamba\nhas demonstrated performance comparable to Transformers without any form of\nattention, thanks to the use of a selective mechanism for the state parameters.\nSelectivity, however, is only evaluated empirically and the reasons of its\neffectiveness remain unclear. In this work, we show how selectivity is related\nto the sequence processing. Our analysis shows that selective time intervals in\nMamba act as linear approximators of information.

It has, however, proven challenging to incorporate\nboth these mechanisms into a single all-ceramic material. In this work, we\npropose a computational methodology for the design of a material that combines\nthese two toughening strategies, using a multiscale modeling approach that\ncaptures both their individual contributions and the overall fracture\nperformance. This is achieved by developing an all-ceramic composite with a\nbrick-and-mortar microstructure, in which the nanocrystalline mortar is\ntransformation-toughened. Key factors influencing phase transformation, such as\ngrain boundary properties, grain orientations, and kinetic coefficients, are\nanalyzed, and the resulting transformation stress-strain behavior is\nincorporated into the microscale mortar constitutive model. We demonstrate that\nthe synergistic effect of the two toughening mechanisms is achievable, and that\nit is an extremely effective strategy to boost fracture performance. The\ninfluence of brick size, mortar thickness, and properties of the constituent\nmaterials is then systematically investigated.

This paper\nreviews the evolution of China's industrial structure, argues the necessity for\na new round of deep industrial transformation, and explores the impact of\nindustrial structure transformation and upgrading on the level of new quality\nproductive forces using various methods. The research findings are as\nfollows:(1)The deep transformation and upgrading of the industrial structure\ncan significantly promote the development of new quality productive forces, but\nthere are obvious regional differences.(2)The core indicator of the improvement\nin the level of new quality productive forces is the enhancement of total\nfactor productivity. Furthermore, this paper summarizes past industrial\ndevelopment processes and the challenges faced, and analyzes and discusses the\npotential challenges that may arise in promoting the development of new quality\nproductive forces through deep industrial structure transformation, based on\nempirical research results.",

However, the\nextent to which these models truly comprehend the concepts they articulate\nremains unclear. To assess the level of comprehension of a model relative to\nthe content it generates, we implemented a self-evaluation pipeline where\nmodels: (i) given a topic generate an excerpt with information about the topic,\n(ii) given an excerpt generate question-answer pairs, and finally (iii) given a\nquestion generate an answer. We refer to this self-evaluation approach as\nExplain-Query-Test (EQT). Interestingly, the accuracy on generated questions\nresulting from running the EQT pipeline correlates strongly with the model\nperformance as verified by typical benchmarks such as MMLU-Pro. In other words,\nEQT's performance is predictive of MMLU-Pro's, and EQT can be used to rank\nmodels without the need for any external source of evaluation data other than\nlists of topics of interest. Moreover, our results reveal a disparity between\nthe models' ability to produce detailed explanations and their performance on\nquestions related to those explanations. This gap highlights fundamental\nlimitations in the internal knowledge representation and reasoning abilities of\ncurrent LLMs. We release the code at https://github.com/asgsaeid/EQT.",

Despite the growing availability of\nclinical and demographic data, predictive models for lung metastasis in HCC\nremain limited in scope and clinical applicability. In this study, we develop\nand validate an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using data from the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. We evaluated three\nmachine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression)\nalongside a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network.

However, the low\nprecision across models highlights the challenges of accurately predicting\npositive cases. To address these limitations, we developed a custom loss\nfunction incorporating recall optimization, enabling the MLP model to achieve\nthe highest sensitivity. An ensemble approach further improved overall recall\nby leveraging the strengths of individual models. Feature importance analysis\nrevealed key predictors such as surgery status, tumor staging, and follow up\nduration, emphasizing the relevance of clinical interventions and disease\nprogression in metastasis prediction. While this study demonstrates the\npotential of machine learning for identifying high-risk patients, limitations\ninclude reliance on imbalanced datasets, incomplete feature annotations, and\nthe low precision of predictions.

The most popular ALP\nproduction mechanism studied in the literature is the misalignment mechanism,\nwhere an ALP field with a quadratic or cosine potential has negligible kinetic\nenergy initially, and it starts oscillating when its mass becomes comparable to\nthe Hubble scale. Recently, there has been an interest in models that go beyond\nthe standard assumptions. These models not only extend the ALP dark matter\nparameter space, but also provide a rich phenomenology which is absent in the\nstandard scenario. In particular, the ALP fluctuations grow exponentially via\nparametric resonance and tachyonic instabilities. In this proceeding, we will\nfirst demonstrate why the standard paradigm cannot explain dark matter in\nexperimentally interesting parts of the parameter space, and then we will give\nan overview of the alternative production mechanism with which this issue can\nbe resolved. We will then discuss the exponential growth of the fluctuations in\nthese models. Finally, we will comment on the observational consequences of the\nexponential growth and show that a sizable region of the ALP parameter space\nbecomes testable even if ALPs have only gravitational interactions.",

We characterized TWA's location, kinematics, and\nage, investigating its origin within the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) OB\nassociation. Using Gaia DR3 astrometric data and precise ground-based radial\nvelocities, we identified substructures within TWA, tentatively dividing them\ninto TWA-a and TWA-b. Sco-Cen's massive cluster $\\sigma$ Cen (15 Myr, 1,805\nmembers) may have influenced TWA's formation. The alignment of $\\sigma$ Cen,\nTWA-a, and TWA-b in 3D positions, velocities, and ages resembles patterns in\nregions such as Corona Australis, suggesting that TWA is part of a cluster\nchain from sequential star formation induced by massive stars in Sco-Cen. TWA's\nelongation in the opposite direction to that produced by Galactic differential\nrotation indicates its shape is still influenced by its formation processes and\nwill dissipate in less than 50 Myr due to Galactic forces. These findings\nunveil the nature of YLAs and low-mass clusters in a new light. We propose that\nclusters such as $\\epsilon$ Chamaeleontis, $\\eta$ Chamaeleontis, and TWA were\nforged by stellar feedback from massive stars in Sco-Cen, while others--such as\n$\\beta$ Pictoris, Carina, Columba, and Tucana-Horologium--are older and formed\ndifferently. Remarkably, all these YLAs and Sco-Cen are part of the $\\alpha$\nPersei cluster family, a vast kiloparsec-scale star formation event active over\nthe past 60 Myr. This suggests that YLAs are the smallest stellar structures\nemerging from major star formation episodes and should be common in the Milky\nWay.

Given that mental health\nchallenges frequently emerge during early adolescence -- the critical years of\nhigh school and college -- investigating AI/ML-driven mental health solutions\nwithin the education domain is of paramount importance. Nevertheless,\nconventional AI/ML techniques follow a centralized model training architecture,\nwhich poses privacy risks due to the need for transferring students' sensitive\ndata from institutions, universities, and clinics to central servers. Federated\nlearning (FL) has emerged as a solution to address these risks by enabling\ndistributed model training while maintaining data privacy. Despite its\npotential, research on applying FL to analyze students' mental health remains\nlimited. In this paper, we aim to address this limitation by proposing a\nroadmap for integrating FL into mental health data analysis within educational\nsettings. We begin by providing an overview of mental health issues among\nstudents and reviewing existing studies where ML has been applied to address\nthese challenges. Next, we examine broader applications of FL in the mental\nhealth domain to emphasize the lack of focus on educational contexts. Finally,\nwe propose promising research directions focused on using FL to address mental\nhealth issues in the education sector, which entails discussing the synergies\nbetween the proposed directions with broader human-centered domains.

We aim to further the understanding of AGN\nfeeding and feedback by examining an active galaxy using spatially-resolved\nspectroscopy. We analyze integral field spectroscopy of the active galaxy NGC\n5806, obtained using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Multi-Unit Spectroscopic\nExplorer (MUSE). We map the dynamics of gas and stars, as well as gas optical\nemission line fluxes throughout the central 8 x 8 kpc$^2$ of the galaxy. We use\nemission line ratios to map gas metallicity and identify regions of gas\nexcitation dominated by AGN/shocks or star formation. We also determine the\naverage stellar population age and metallicity, and model the rotation and\ndynamics of the galaxy. We find that NGC 5806 has a star-forming circumnuclear\nring, with a projected radius of about 400 pc. The dynamics of this galaxy are\ndriven by a large-scale bar, which transports gas from the spiral arm to the\ncentral ring and potentially fuels the AGN. We also observe AGN-dominated gas\nexcitation up to 3.3 kpc away from the center of the galaxy, showing the\nextended AGN effect on the gas in the central regions of the galaxy.",

    "abstract": "Fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) continue to spark immense global interest,\nyet predictions on when they will operate safely and broadly remain heavily\ndebated. This paper synthesizes two distinct research traditions: computational\ncomplexity and algorithmic constraints versus reliability growth modeling and\nreal-world testing to form an integrated, quantitative timeline for future AV\ndeployment. We propose a mathematical framework that unifies NP-hard\nmulti-agent path planning analyses, high-performance computing (HPC)\nprojections, and extensive Crow-AMSAA reliability growth calculations,\nfactoring in operational design domain (ODD) variations, severity, and partial\nvs. full domain restrictions. Through category-specific case studies (e.g.,\nconsumer automotive, robo-taxis, highway trucking, industrial and defense\napplications), we show how combining HPC limitations, safety demonstration\nrequirements, production/regulatory hurdles, and parallel/serial test\nstrategies can push out the horizon for universal Level 5 deployment by up to\nseveral decades. Conversely, more constrained ODDs; like fenced industrial\nsites or specialized defense operations; may see autonomy reach commercial\nviability in the near-to-medium term. Our findings illustrate that while\ntargeted domains can achieve automated service sooner, widespread driverless\nvehicles handling every environment remain far from realized. This paper thus\noffers a unique and rigorous perspective on why AV timelines extend well beyond\nshort-term optimism, underscoring how each dimension of complexity and\nreliability imposes its own multi-year delays. By quantifying these constraints\nand exploring potential accelerators (e.g., advanced AI hardware,\ninfrastructure up-grades), we provide a structured baseline for researchers,\npolicymakers, and industry stakeholders to more accurately map their\nexpectations and investments in AV technology.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become essential in software development,\nespecially for issue resolution. However, despite their widespread use,\nsignificant challenges persist in the quality of LLM responses to issue\nresolution queries. LLM interactions often yield incorrect, incomplete, or\nambiguous information, largely due to knowledge gaps in prompt design, which\ncan lead to unproductive exchanges and reduced developer productivity. In this\npaper, we analyze 433 developer-ChatGPT conversations within GitHub issue\nthreads to examine the impact of prompt knowledge gaps and conversation styles\non issue resolution. We identify four main knowledge gaps in developer prompts:\nMissing Context, Missing Specifications, Multiple Context, and Unclear\nInstructions. Assuming that conversations within closed issues contributed to\nsuccessful resolutions while those in open issues did not, we find that\nineffective conversations contain knowledge gaps in 44.6% of prompts, compared\nto only 12.6% in effective ones. Additionally, we observe seven distinct\nconversational styles, with Directive Prompting, Chain of Thought, and\nResponsive Feedback being the most prevalent. We find that knowledge gaps are\npresent in all styles of conversations, with Missing Context being the most\nrepeated challenge developers face in issue-resolution conversations. Based on\nour analysis, we identify key textual and code-related heuristics (Specificity,\nContextual Richness, and Clarity) that are associated with successful issue\nclosure and help assess prompt quality. These heuristics lay the foundation for\nan automated tool that can dynamically flag unclear prompts and suggest\nstructured improvements. To test feasibility, we developed a lightweight\nbrowser extension prototype for detecting prompt gaps, that can be easily\nadapted to other tools within developer workflows.",

Models such as BERT and GPT-3 exemplify their success and\nhave driven the rise of large language models (LLMs). However, a critical\nchallenge persists: safeguarding the privacy of data used in LLM training.\nPrivacy-preserving techniques like Federated Learning (FL) offer potential\nsolutions, but practical limitations hinder their effectiveness for Transformer\ntraining. Two primary issues are (I) the risk of sensitive information leakage\ndue to aggregation methods like FedAvg or FedSGD, and (II) the high\ncommunication overhead caused by the large size of Transformer models.\n  This paper introduces a novel FL method that reduces communication overhead\nwhile maintaining competitive utility. Our approach avoids sharing full model\nweights by simulating a global model locally. We apply k-means clustering to\neach Transformer layer, compute centroids locally, and transmit only these\ncentroids to the server instead of full weights or gradients. To enhance\nsecurity, we leverage Intel SGX for secure transmission of centroids.

We employ EVT\nto estimate the statistics of rare and extreme interference values, and kernel\ndensity estimation (KDE) to model the distribution of non-extreme events.

We analyse these\nspectra using damping wing sightlines from inhomogeneous reionizing IGM\nsimulations, mapping between the distance of a source from neutral IGM and the\nmean IGM neutral fraction. We marginalise over absorption by local HI around\ngalaxies, and Lyman-alpha emission.

    "abstract": "We present the first comprehensive analysis of temporal settings for directed\ntemporal graphs, fully resolving their hierarchy with respect to support,\nreachability, and induced-reachability equivalence. These notions, introduced\nby Casteigts, Corsini, and Sarkar, capture different levels of equivalence\nbetween temporal graph classes. Their analysis focused on undirected graphs\nunder three dimensions: strict vs. non-strict (whether times along paths\nstrictly increase), proper vs. arbitrary (whether adjacent edges can appear\nsimultaneously), and simple vs. multi-labeled (whether an edge can appear\nmultiple times). In this work, we extend their framework by adding the\nfundamental distinction of directed vs. undirected.\n  Our results reveal a single-strand hierarchy for directed graphs, with strict\n& simple being the most expressive class and proper & simple the least\nexpressive. In contrast, undirected graphs form a two-strand hierarchy, with\nstrict & multi-labeled being the most expressive and proper & simple the least\nexpressive. The two strands are formed by the non-strict & simple and the\nstrict & simple class, which we show to be incomparable. In addition to\nexamining the internal hierarchies of directed and of undirected graph classes,\nwe compare the two. We show that each undirected class can be transformed into\nits directed counterpart under reachability equivalence, while no directed\nclass can be transformed into any undirected one.\n  Our findings have significant implications for the study of computational\nproblems on temporal graphs. Positive results in more expressive graph classes\nextend to weaker classes as long as the problem is independent under\nreachability equivalence. Conversely, hardness results for a less expressive\nclass propagate to stronger classes. We hope these findings will inspire a\nunified approach for analyzing temporal graphs under the different settings.",

Instead, the study of\nthe (sub-)centimeter emission has made more limited progress, to the point that\nonly a few exceptional disk-bearing objects have been characterized in the\ncentimeter regime. This work takes a broad view of the centimeter emission from\na large sample with VLA observations that is selected from previous ALMA\nsurveys of more representative disks in brightness and extent. We report on the\ndetection and characterization of flux at centimeter wavelengths from 21\nsources in the Taurus star-forming region. Complemented by literature and\narchival data, the entire photometry from 0.85 mm to 6 cm is fitted by a\ntwo-component model that determines the ubiquitous presence of free-free\nemission entangled with the dust emission. The flux density of the free-free\nemission is found to scale with the accretion rate but is independent of the\nouter disk morphology depicted by ALMA. The dust emission at 2 cm is still\nappreciable, and offers the possibility to extract an unprecedented large set\nof dust spectral indices in the centimeter regime. A pronounced change between\nthe median millimeter indices (2.3) and centimeter indices (2.8) suggests that\na large portion of the disk emission is optically thick up to 3 mm. The\ncomparison of both indices and fluxes with the ALMA disk extent indicates that\nthis portion can be as large as 40 au, and suggests that the grain population\nwithin this disk region that emits the observed centimeter emission is similar\nin disks with different size and morphology. All these results await\nconfirmation and dedicated dust modeling once facilities like ngVLA or SKA-mid\nare able to resolve the centimeter emission from planet-forming disks and\ndisentangle the various components.",

Due\nthe similarity of other card games, the strategy of the game have scenarios\nthat can turn an NP-problem.

Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrate its equivalence to a 0-1\nKnapsack problem, establishing the FAB problem as NP-hard.

In this work, we investigate\nthe critical fingerprints appearing in these key thermodynamical quantities for\na mean-field critical system undergoing a finite-time cycle, starting from a\nthermal state at a generic inverse temperature. In contrast to non-zero\ndimensional many-body systems, the presence of a mean-field critical point in a\nfinite-time cycle leads to constant irreversible work even in the limit of\ninfinitely slow driving. This links with the fact that a slow finite-time cycle\nresults in a constant amount of squeezing, which enables us to derive\nanalytical expressions for the work statistics and irreversible entropy,\ndepending solely on the mean-field critical exponents and the functional form\nof the control parameter near the critical point. We find that the probability\nof observing negative work values, corresponding to negative irreversible\nentropy, is inversely proportional to the time the system remains near to the\ncritical point, and this trend becomes less pronounced the lower the\ntemperature of the initial thermal state.

Here we present a novel NIRCam-based selection method for PopIII galaxies,\nand carefully validate it through completeness and contamination simulations.\nWe systematically search ~500 arcmin$^{2}$ across JWST legacy fields for PopIII\ncandidates, including GLIMPSE which, assisted by gravitational lensing, has\nproduced JWST's deepest NIRCam imaging thus far. We discover one promising\nPopIII galaxy candidate (GLIMPSE-16043) at $z=6.50^{+0.03}_{-0.24}$, a\nmoderately lensed galaxy (mu=2.9) with an intrinsic UV magnitude of\n$M_{UV}$=-15.89. It exhibits key PopIII features: strong H$\\alpha$ emission\n(rest-frame EW $2810\\pm550$\\AA); a Balmer jump; no dust (UV slope\n$\\beta=-2.34\\pm0.36$); and undetectable metal lines (e.g., [OIII];\n[OIII]/H$\\beta$<0.44) implying a gas-phase metallicity of Zgas/Zsun<0.5%. These\nproperties indicate the presence of a nascent, metal-deficient young stellar\npopulation (<5Myr) with a stellar mass of $\\simeq10^{5}M_{\\odot}$.\nIntriguingly, this source deviates significantly from the extrapolated\nUV-metallicity relation derived from recent JWST observations at $z=4-10$,\nconsistent with UV enhancement by a top-heavy PopIII initial mass function or\nthe presence of an extremely metal-poor AGN. We also derive the first\nobservational constraints on the PopIII UV luminosity function at z~6-7. The\nvolume density of GLIMPSE-16043 ($\\approx10^{-4}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is in excellent\nagreement with theoretical predictions, independently reinforcing its\nplausibility. This study demonstrates the power of our novel NIRCam method to\nfinally reveal distant galaxies even more pristine than the Milky Way's most\nmetal-poor satellites, thereby promising to bring us closer to the first\ngeneration of stars than we have ever been before.",

    "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proven as a promising way to\nalleviate the cold-start issue, in which the most critical problem is how to\ndraw an informative user representation in the target domain via the transfer\nof user preference existing in the source domain. Prior efforts mostly follow\nthe embedding-and-mapping paradigm, which first integrate the preference into\nuser representation in the source domain, and then perform a mapping function\non this representation to the target domain. However, they focus on mapping\nfeatures across domains, neglecting to explicitly model the preference\nintegration process, which may lead to learning coarse user representation.\nDiffusion models (DMs), which contribute to more accurate user/item\nrepresentations due to their explicit information injection capability, have\nachieved promising performance in recommendation systems. Nevertheless, these\nDMs-based methods cannot directly account for valuable user preference in other\ndomains, leading to challenges in adapting to the transfer of preference for\ncold-start users. Consequently, the feasibility of DMs for CDR remains\nunderexplored. To this end, we explore to utilize the explicit information\ninjection capability of DMs for user preference integration and propose a\nPreference-Guided Diffusion Model for CDR to cold-start users, termed as DMCDR.\nSpecifically, we leverage a preference encoder to establish the preference\nguidance signal with the user's interaction history in the source domain. Then,\nwe explicitly inject the preference guidance signal into the user\nrepresentation step by step to guide the reverse process, and ultimately\ngenerate the personalized user representation in the target domain, thus\nachieving the transfer of user preference across domains. Furthermore, we\ncomprehensively explore the impact of six DMs-based variants on CDR.",

    "abstract": "Eccentric planets may spend a significant portion of their orbits at large\ndistances from their host stars, where low temperatures can cause atmospheric\nCO2 to condense out onto the surface, similar to the polar ice caps on Mars.\nThe radiative effects on the climates of these planets throughout their orbits\nwould depend on the wavelength-dependent albedo of surface CO2 ice that may\naccumulate at or near apoastron and vary according to the spectral energy\ndistribution of the host star. To explore these possible effects, we\nincorporated a CO2 ice-albedo parameterization into a one-dimensional energy\nbalance climate model. With the inclusion of this parameterization, our\nsimulations demonstrated that F-dwarf planets require 29% more orbit-averaged\nflux to thaw out of global water ice cover compared with simulations that\nsolely use a traditional pure water ice-albedo parameterization. When no\neccentricity is assumed, and host stars are varied, F-dwarf planets with higher\nbond albedos relative to their M-dwarf planet counterparts require 30% more\norbit-averaged flux to exit a water snowball state. Additionally, the intense\nheat experienced at periastron aids eccentric planets in exiting a snowball\nstate with a smaller increase in instellation compared with planets on circular\norbits; this enables eccentric planets to exhibit warmer conditions along a\nbroad range of instellation. This study emphasizes the significance of\nincorporating an albedo parameterization for the formation of CO2 ice into\nclimate models to accurately assess the habitability of eccentric planets, as\nwe show that, even at moderate eccentricities, planets with Earth-like\natmospheres can reach surface temperatures cold enough for the condensation of\nCO2 onto their surfaces, as can planets receiving low amounts of instellation\non circular orbits.",

FL aims to secure local client data while also collaboratively\ntraining a global model. Under standard FL, clients within the federation send\nmodel updates, derived from local data, to a central server for aggregation\ninto a global model. However, extensive research has demonstrated that private\ndata can be reliably reconstructed from these model updates using gradient\ninversion attacks (GIAs). To protect client data from server-side GIAs,\nprevious FL schemes have employed fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) to secure\nmodel updates while still enabling popular aggregation methods. However,\ncurrent FHE-based FL schemes either incur substantial computational overhead or\ntrade security and/or model accuracy for efficiency. We introduce BlindFL, a\nframework for global model aggregation in which clients encrypt and send a\nsubset of their local model update. With choice over the subset size, BlindFL\noffers flexible efficiency gains while preserving full encryption of aggregated\nupdates. Moreover, we demonstrate that implementing BlindFL can substantially\nlower space and time transmission costs per client, compared with plain FL with\nFHE, while maintaining global model accuracy. BlindFL also offers additional\ndepth of security. While current single-key, FHE-based FL schemes explicitly\ndefend against server-side adversaries, they do not address the realistic\nthreat of malicious clients within the federation.

In this work, we address VLM post-training from\na data-centric perspective, showing the key role of data strategy in developing\nfrontier VLMs. By studying and building our post-training data strategy from\nscratch, we share detailed insights into the development processes, aiming to\nbenefit the development of competitive models for the open-source community.\nOur introduced data strategy, together with training recipes and model design,\nleads to a family of performant VLMs named Eagle2.

In practice, linearly\nstable discs of surface density slightly below the threshold needed for this\ninstability often form spiral structures, and can subsequently fragment or\nexhibit a state of self-sustained turbulence, depending on how rapidly the disc\ncools. This has raised the question of how such turbulence is possible in the\nlinearly stable regime. We suggest a nonlinear mechanism for this phenomenon.\nWe find analytically weakly nonlinear axisymmetric subcritical solitary\nequilibria which exist in linearly stable 3D discs that are close to the\ninstability threshold. The energy of these 'soliton' solutions is only slightly\nhigher than that of a uniform disc, and the structures themselves are expected\nto be unstable to non-axisymmetric perturbations. In this way, these\nsubcritical solitary equilibria highlight a nonlinear instability and provide a\npossible pathway to a turbulent state in linearly stable discs.",

The observer's state is then mapped back to the original\nsystem coordinates via the inverse map to obtain the state estimate.

There are generally two recommended ways to\nmonitor autocorrelated data: fitting a time series model and then monitoring\nthe residuals or directly monitoring the original observations. Although\nresidual charts are popular in the literature because they offer advantages\nsuch as ease of implementation, questions have been raised about their\nefficiency due to the loss of information.

In this work, we introduce a distinct computational\nhigh-throughput screening approach designed to identify underexplored yet\npromising material subspaces, and apply it to half-Heusler thermoelectrics. We\nanalyze 1,126 half-Heuslers satisfying the $``$18 valence electron rule $''$,\nincluding 332 predicted to be semiconductors, using electronic structure\ncalculations, semi-empirical transport models, and thermoelectric quality\nfactor $\\beta$. Unlike conventional filtering workflows, our approach employs\nstatistical analysis of candidate material groups to uncover trends in their\ncollective behavior, providing robust insights and minimizing reliance on\nuncertain predictions for individual compounds. Our findings link $n$-type\nperformance to ultra-high mobility at conduction band edges and $p$-type\nperformance to high band degeneracy. Statistical correlations reveal elemental\nsubspaces associated with high $\\beta$. We identify two primary (Y- and\nZr-containing) and two secondary (Au- and Ir-containing) subspaces that\nreinforce key physical design principles, making them promising candidates for\nfurther exploration. These recommendations align with previous experimental\nresults on yttrium pnictides. Inspired by these insights, we synthesize and\ncharacterize rare-earth gold stannides (REAuSn), finding\nSc$_{0.5}$Lu$_{0.5}$AuSn to exhibit low thermal conductivity (0.9-2.3\nWm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 650 K). This work demonstrates alternative strategies for\nhigh throughput screening when using approximate but unbiased models, and\noffers predictive tools and design strategies for optimizing half-Heusler\nchemistries for TE performance.",

The methodology minimizes the total energy functional,\naccounting for diffusive and viscous dissipations. A new perspective is\npresented by analyzing the interplay between kinetic energy, mixing energy, and\nviscous dissipation using the temporal evolution of the total energy\nfunctional. The classical surface energy is approximated with mixing energy\nunder specific conditions, and the accuracy of this substitution is rigorously\nevaluated. The energy-based surface tension formulation derived from the\nKorteweg stress tensor demonstrates exceptional accuracy in capturing\nvariations in the mixing energy. These concepts are demonstrated by considering\ntwo benchmark problems: droplet oscillation and capillary thread breakup. Key\nfindings include validating mixing-energy theory for highly deformed\ninterfaces, as well as the discovery of distinct energy dissipation patterns\nduring thread breakup and droplet oscillations. The results highlight the\nrobustness of the free energy-based PFM in accurately capturing complex\ninterfacial dynamics, while maintaining energy conservation.",

However, this has been\nstudied primarily for English prompts and with a focus on task performance\nonly. This can be an issue since grassroots workers, especially in developing\ncountries like India, prefer to work in local languages, some of which are\nlow-resource. Further, given the nature of the problem, biases along population\ngroups unintended by the user are also undesirable. In this work, we study the\neffects on both task performance and fairness when the DLM algorithm, a recent\nwork on using LLMs to design reward functions for RMABs, is prompted with\nnon-English language commands. Specifically, we run the model on a synthetic\nenvironment for various prompts translated into multiple languages. The prompts\nthemselves vary in complexity. Our results show that the LLM-proposed reward\nfunctions are significantly better when prompted in English compared to other\nlanguages. We also find that the exact phrasing of the prompt impacts task\nperformance. Further, as prompt complexity increases, performance worsens for\nall languages; however, it is more robust with English prompts than with\nlower-resource languages. On the fairness side, we find that low-resource\nlanguages and more complex prompts are both highly likely to create unfairness\nalong unintended dimensions.",

    "abstract": "We introduce and study UCPDL+, a family of expressive logics rooted in\nPropositional Dynamic Logic (PDL) with converse (CPDL) and universal modality\n(UCPDL). In terms of expressive power, UCPDL+ strictly contains PDL extended\nwith intersection and converse (a.k.a. ICPDL), as well as Conjunctive Queries\n(CQ), Conjunctive Regular Path Queries (CRPQ), or some known extensions thereof\n(Regular Queries and CQPDL). Further, it is equivalent to the extension of the\nunary-negation fragment of first-order logic (UNFO) with unary transitive\nclosure, which we denote by UNFO*, which in turn strictly contains a previously\nstudied extension of UNFO with regular expressions known as UNFO^reg.\n  We investigate the expressive power, indistinguishability via bisimulations,\nsatisfiability, and model checking for UCPDL+ and CPDL+. We argue that natural\nsubclasses of CPDL+ can be defined in terms of the tree-width of the underlying\ngraphs of the formulas. We show that the class of CPDL+ formulas of tree-width\n2 is equivalent to ICPDL, and that it also coincides with CPDL+ formulas of\ntree-width 1. However, beyond tree-width 2, incrementing the tree-width\nstrictly increases the expressive power. We characterize the expressive power\nfor every class of fixed tree-width formulas in terms of a bisimulation game\nwith pebbles. Based on this characterization, we show that CPDL+ has a\ntree-like model property. We prove that the satisfiability problem for UCPDL+\nis decidable in 2ExpTime, coinciding with the complexity of ICPDL. As a\nconsequence, the satisfiability problem for UNFO* is shown to be\n2ExpTime-complete as well. We also exhibit classes for which satisfiability is\nreduced to ExpTime. Finally, we establish that the model checking problem for\nfixed tree-width formulas is in PTime, contrary to the full class CPDL+.",

The problem is that\nwe do not know any rigid KS set in $\\mathbb{C}^3$, the smallest quantum system\nthat allows for KS sets. Moreover, none of the existing methods for\nconstructing KS sets leads to rigid KS sets in $\\mathbb{C}^3$. Here, we show\nthat two fundamental structures of quantum theory define two rigid KS sets. One\nof these structures is the super-symmetric informationally complete\npositive-operator-valued measure. The other is the minimal state-independent\ncontextuality set. The second construction provides a clue to solve the minimal\nKS problem, the most important open problem in this field. We prove that there\nis no KS set of 30 elements that can be obtained from the minimal\nstate-independent contextuality set by completing bases and adding elements\nthat are orthogonal to two previous elements.

Although empirical remedies exist, it\nis often unclear which ones work best and when, due to the lack of an\noverarching theory.

It is based on an exact solution of the teacher-student\nperceptron model, through replica theory. Within this framework, one can\ndistinguish several sources of CI: either intrinsic, train or test imbalance.\nOur analysis reveals that the optimal train imbalance is generally different\nfrom 50%, with a non trivial dependence on the intrinsic imbalance, the\nabundance of data and on the noise in the learning. Moreover, there is a\ncrossover between a small noise training regime where results are independent\nof the noise level to a high noise regime where performances quickly degrade\nwith noise.

This paper introduces a\nrisk-adjusted surgical learning curve assessment (SLCA) method that focuses on\nestimation rather than hypothesis testing, as seen in CUSUM methods. The method\nis designed to accommodate right-skewed outcomes, such as surgery durations,\ncharacterized by the Weibull distribution. To evaluate the learning process,\nthe SLCA approach estimates comparative probability metrics that assess the\nlikelihood of a clinically important difference between the trainee's\nperformance and a standard. Expecting improvement over time, we use weighted\nestimating equations to give greater weight to recent outcomes. Compared to\nCUSUM methods, SLCA offers enhanced interpretability, avoids reliance on\nexternally defined performance levels, and emphasizes assessing clinical\nequivalence or noninferiority. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness\nthrough a colorectal surgery dataset case study and a numerical study.",

    "abstract": "Polarization of starlight and thermal dust emission due to aligned\nnon-spherical grains helps us to trace magnetic field (B-field) morphology in\nmolecular clouds and to study grain alignment mechanisms. In this work, we\nstudy grain alignment and disruption mechanisms in a filamentary infrared dark\ncloud G34.43+0.24 using thermal dust polarization observations from JCMT/POL-2\nat 850 $\\mu\\text{m}$. We study in three sub-regions as North harboring MM3\ncore, Center harboring MM1 and MM2 cores and South having no core. We find the\ndecrease in polarization fraction P with increasing total intensity and gas\ncolumn density, known as polarization hole. To disentangle the effect of\nmagnetic field tangling on the polarization hole, we estimate the polarization\nangle dispersion function. We find depolarizations in North and Center regions\nare due to decrease in net alignment efficiency of grains but in South region,\neffect of magnetic field tangling is significant to cause depolarization. To\ntest whether RAdiative Torque (RAT) mechanism can reproduce the observational\ndata, we calculate minimum alignment and disruption sizes of grains using RAT\ntheory and our study finds that RAT alignment mechanism can explain the\ndepolarizations in North and Center regions where B-field tangling effect is\nless important, except for core regions. We find hints of RAdiative Torque\nDisruption (RAT-D) in the core regions of MM3 in North, MM1 and MM2 in Center.\nWe also find that the high P value of around 8-20% in the outer regions of the\nfilament can be explained potentially by magnetically enhanced RAT alignment\nmechanism.",

    "abstract": "The Grid-Forming Inverter (GFMI) is an emerging topic that is attracting\nsignificant attention from both academic and industrial communities,\nparticularly in the area of control design. The Decoupled Average Model-based\nSliding Mode Current Controller (DAM-SMC) has been used to address the need\nsuch as fast response, fixed switching frequency, and no overshoot to avoid\nexceeding current limits. Typically, the control parameters for DAM-SMC are\nchosen based on expert knowledge and certain assumptions. However, these\nparameters may not achieve optimized performance due to system dynamics and\nuncertainties. To address this, this paper proposes a Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO)-based DAM-SMC controller, which inherits the control laws\nfrom DAM-SMC but optimizes the control parameters offline using PSO. The main\ngoal is to reduce chattering and achieve smaller tracking errors. The proposed\nmethod is compared with other metaheuristic optimization algorithms, such as\nGenetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Simulations are performed\nin MATLAB/Simulink across various scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed controller. The proposed approach achieves a substantial reduction\nin convergence time, decreasing it by 86.36% compared to the GA and by 88.89%\ncompared to SA. Furthermore, the tracking error is reduced by 11.61% compared\nto the conventional DAM-SMC algorithm. The robustness of the proposed method is\nvalidated under critical conditions, where plant and control model parameters\nvaried by up to 40%.",

Yet, current reviews of BKGs often limit their scope to specific domains\nor methods, overlooking the broader landscape and the rapid technological\nprogress reshaping it. In this survey, we address this gap by offering a\nsystematic review of BKGs from three core perspectives: domains, tasks, and\napplications. We begin by examining how BKGs are constructed from diverse data\nsources, including molecular interactions, pharmacological datasets, and\nclinical records. Next, we discuss the essential tasks enabled by BKGs,\nfocusing on knowledge management, retrieval, reasoning, and interpretation.\nFinally, we highlight real-world applications in precision medicine, drug\ndiscovery, and scientific research, illustrating the translational impact of\nBKGs across multiple sectors. By synthesizing these perspectives into a unified\nframework, this survey not only clarifies the current state of BKG research but\nalso establishes a foundation for future exploration, enabling both innovative\nmethodological advances and practical implementations.",

Although keyword spotting is a crucial task in various applications\nand can be extended to call-for-help detection in emergencies, however, the\nprevious method often suffers from scalability limitations due to retraining\nrequired to introduce new keywords or adapt to changing contexts. We explore a\nsimple yet effective approach that leverages off-the-shelf pretrained ASR\nmodels to address these challenges, especially in call-for-help detection\nscenarios. Furthermore, we observed a substantial increase in false alarms when\ndeploying call-for-help detection system in real-world scenarios due to noise\nintroduced by microphones or different environments. To address this, we\npropose a novel noise-agnostic multitask learning approach that integrates a\nnoise classification head into the ASR encoder. Our method enhances the model's\nrobustness to noisy environments, leading to a significant reduction in false\nalarms and improved overall call-for-help performance. Despite the added\ncomplexity of multitask learning, our approach is computationally efficient and\nprovides a promising solution for call-for-help detection in real-world\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Quantum thermal transistors have been widely studied in the context of\nthree-qubit systems, where each qubit interacts separately with a Markovian\nharmonic bath. Markovianity is an assumption that is imposed on a system if the\nenvironment loses its memory within short while, while non-Markovianity is a\ngeneral feature, inherently present in a large fraction of realistic scenarios.\nInstead of Markovian environments, here we propose a transistor in which the\ninteraction between the working substance and an environment comprising of an\ninfinite chain of qutrits is based on periodic collisions. We refer to the\ndevice as a working-substance thermal transistor, since the model focuses on\nheat currents flowing in and out of each individual qubit of the working\nsubstance to and from different parts of the system and environment. We find\nthat the transistor effect prevails in this apparatus and we depict how the\namplification of heat currents depends on the temperature of the modulating\nenvironment, the system-environment coupling strength and the interaction time.\nWe further show that there exists a non-zero amplification even if one of the\nenvironments, that is not the modulating one, is detached from the system.\nAdditionally, the environment, being comprised of three-level systems, allows\nus to consider the effects of frail perturbations in the energy-spacings of the\nqutrit, leading to a non-linearity in the environment. We consider\nnon-linearities that are either of transmon- or of Kerr-type. We find parameter\nranges where there is a significant amplification for both transmon- and\nKerr-type non-linearities in the environment. Finally, we detect the\nnon-Markovianity induced in the system from a non-monotonic behavior of the\namplification observed with respect to time, and quantify it using the\ndistinguishability-based measure of non-Markovianity.",

We report here on three steps taken to address\nthese questions in an InAs nanowire weak link. First, we designed a microwave\nreadout circuit tuned to be directly sensitive to the spin-dependent inductance\nof the weak link so that higher orbital states are not necessary for readout --\nthis resulted in larger windows in parameter space in which the spin state\nproperties can be probed. Second, we implemented a successful gap-engineering\nstrategy to mitigate quasiparticle poisoning. Third, the weak link was\nfabricated by \\textit{in situ} shadow evaporation, which has been shown to\nimprove atomic-scale disorder. We show how our design allows characterization\nof the spin stability and coherence over the full range of magnetic flux and\ngate voltage of an odd parity bias point. The spin relaxation and dephasing\nrates are comparable with the best devices previously reported, suggestive that\nsurface atomic-scale disorder and QP poisoning are not linked to spin\nrelaxation in InAs nanowires.

Accordingly, a key challenge in these networks\nis managing channel access amidst jammers and under dynamic channel conditions.\nIn this context, we propose a robust learning-based mechanism for channel\naccess in multi-cell quasi-static networks under jamming. The network comprises\nmultiple legitimate UEs, including predefined UEs (pUEs) with stochastic\npredefined schedules and an intelligent UE (iUE) with an undefined transmission\nschedule, all transmitting over a shared, time-varying uplink channel. Jammers\ntransmit unwanted packets to disturb the pUEs' and the iUE's communication. The\niUE's learning process is based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nframework, utilizing a residual network (ResNet)-based deep Q-Network (DQN). To\ncoexist in the network and maximize the network's sum cross-layer achievable\nrate (SCLAR), the iUE must learn the unknown network dynamics while\nconcurrently adapting to dynamic channel conditions. Our simulation results\nreveal that, with properly defined state space, action space, and rewards in\nDRL, the iUE can effectively coexist in the network, maximizing channel\nutilization and the network's SCLAR by judiciously selecting transmission time\nslots and thus avoiding collisions and jamming.",

This modeling framework\ncaptures a common situation in various real-world applications, where the\nobserved network is influenced by a (typically unobservable) background\nprocess.

The\nobjective is to estimate the on- and off-time distributions of the edges in\neach of the two dynamic Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graphs, as well as the\ndistribution of time spent in each of the two modes.

    "abstract": "This study introduces Conversation Routines (CR), a structured prompt\nengineering framework for developing task-oriented dialog systems using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language\nunderstanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex\nbusiness workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the\ndevelopment of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language\nspecifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach\nprovides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex\nconversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We\ndemonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof-of-concept\nimplementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive\nTroubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode\nsophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural\nconversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to\ndesign conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom\nfunctions (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient\ndivision of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation\nand domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows\npromise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including\ncomputational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic\noptimization. Future research directions include CR evaluation methods based on\nprompt engineering frameworks driven by goal-oriented grading criteria,\nimproving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, and enhancing\nsystem robustness to address the identified limitations across diverse business\napplications.",

    "abstract": "This article concludes a three-part series developing a self-consistent\ntheoretical framework of the electromechanics of lipid membranes at the\ncontinuum scale. Owing to their small thickness, lipid membranes are commonly\nmodeled as two-dimensional surfaces. However, this approach breaks down when\nconsidering their electromechanical behavior as it requires accounting for\ntheir thickness. To address this, we developed a dimension reduction procedure\nin part 1 to derive effective surface theories explicitly capturing the\nthickness of lipid membranes. We applied this method to dimensionally reduce\nGauss' law and the electromechanical balance laws and referred to the resulting\ntheory as $(2+\\delta)$-dimensional, where $\\delta$ indicates the membrane\nthickness. However, the $(2+\\delta)$-dimensional balance laws derived in part 2\nare general, and specific material models are required to specialize them to\nlipid membranes. In this work, we devise appropriate three-dimensional\nconstitutive models that capture the in-plane fluid and out-of-plane elastic\nbehavior of lipid membranes. The viscous behavior is recovered by a\nthree-dimensional Newtonian fluid model, leading to the same viscous stresses\nas strictly two-dimensional models. The elastic resistance to bending is\nrecovered by imposing a free energy penalty on local volume changes. While this\ngives rise to the characteristic bending resistance of lipid membranes, it\ndiffers in its higher-order curvature terms from the Canham-Helfrich-Evans\ntheory. Furthermore, motivated by the small mid-surface stretch of lipid\nmembranes, we introduce reactive stresses that enforce mid-surface\nincompressibility, resulting in an effective surface tension. Finally, we use\nthe constitutive and reactive stresses to derive the equations of motion\ndescribing the electromechanics of lipid membranes.",

We compute the Hawking radiation of tachyons from black\nholes, finding it to be significantly enhanced in the presence of heavy\ntachyons. For a black hole of mass $M$ and tachyons of mass $m$ with $g$\ndegrees of freedom, the black hole lifetime is found to be $t_{bh} \\approx 192\n\\pi \\hbar M/(g c^2 m^2)$ (or doubled for fermions). This implies that the\nobservation of black holes of a few solar masses, with lifetime of several\nbillion years, rules out tachyons of mass $m > 3 \\times 10^9$ GeV.

    "abstract": "Data-driven software is increasingly being used as a critical component of\nautomated decision-support systems. Since this class of software learns its\nlogic from historical data, it can encode or amplify discriminatory practices.\nPrevious research on algorithmic fairness has focused on improving average-case\nfairness. On the other hand, fairness at the extreme ends of the spectrum,\nwhich often signifies lasting and impactful shifts in societal attitudes, has\nreceived significantly less emphasis.\n  Leveraging the statistics of extreme value theory (EVT), we propose a novel\nfairness criterion called extreme counterfactual discrimination (ECD). This\ncriterion estimates the worst-case amounts of disadvantage in outcomes for\nindividuals solely based on their memberships in a protected group. Utilizing\ntools from search-based software engineering and generative AI, we present a\nrandomized algorithm that samples a statistically significant set of points\nfrom the tail of ML outcome distributions even if the input dataset lacks a\nsufficient number of relevant samples.\n  We conducted several experiments on four ML models (deep neural networks,\nlogistic regression, and random forests) over 10 socially relevant tasks from\nthe literature on algorithmic fairness. First, we evaluate the generative AI\nmethods and find that they generate sufficient samples to infer valid EVT\ndistribution in 95% of cases. Remarkably, we found that the prevalent bias\nmitigators reduce the average-case discrimination but increase the worst-case\ndiscrimination significantly in 5% of cases. We also observed that even the\ntail-aware mitigation algorithm -- MiniMax-Fairness -- increased the worst-case\ndiscrimination in 30% of cases. We propose a novel ECD-based mitigator that\nimproves fairness in the tail in 90% of cases with no degradation of the\naverage-case discrimination.",

A hierarchy of treatments is a useful output of an NMA. Treatment\nhierarchies are produced using ranking metrics. Common ranking metrics include\nthe Surface Under the Cumulative RAnking curve (SUCRA) and P-scores, which are\nthe frequentist analogue to SUCRAs. Both metrics consider the size and\nuncertainty of the estimated treatment effects, with larger values indicating a\nmore preferred treatment. Although SUCRAs and P-scores themselves consider\nuncertainty, treatment hierarchies produced by these ranking metrics are\ntypically reported without a measure of certainty, which might be misleading to\npractitioners. We propose a new metric, Precision of Treatment Hierarchy\n(POTH), which quantifies the certainty in producing a treatment hierarchy from\nSUCRAs or P-scores. The metric connects three statistical quantities: The\nvariance of the SUCRA values, the variance of the mean rank of each treatment,\nand the average variance of the distribution of individual ranks for each\ntreatment. POTH provides a single, interpretable value which quantifies the\ndegree of certainty in producing a treatment hierarchy. We show how the metric\ncan be adapted to apply to subsets of treatments in a network, for example, to\nquantify the certainty in the hierarchy of the top three treatments. We\ncalculate POTH for a database of NMAs to investigate its empirical properties,\nand we demonstrate its use on three published networks.",

Beyond DMR, Zep's capabilities are further\nvalidated through the more challenging LongMemEval benchmark, which better\nreflects enterprise use cases through complex temporal reasoning tasks. In this\nevaluation, Zep achieves substantial results with accuracy improvements of up\nto 18.5% while simultaneously reducing response latency by 90% compared to\nbaseline implementations.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained large models attract widespread attention in recent years, but\nthey face challenges in applications that require high interpretability or have\nlimited resources, such as physical sensing, medical imaging, and\nbioinformatics. Compressed Sensing (CS) is a well-proved theory that drives\nmany recent breakthroughs in these applications. However, as a typical\nunder-determined linear system, CS suffers from excessively long sparse\nreconstruction times when using traditional iterative methods, particularly\nwith large-scale data. Current AI methods like deep unfolding fail to\nsubstitute them because pre-trained models exhibit poor generality beyond their\ntraining conditions and dataset distributions, or lack interpretability.\nInstead of following the big model fervor, this paper proposes ultra-small\nartificial neural models called coefficients learning (CL), enabling\ntraining-free and rapid sparse reconstruction while perfectly inheriting the\ngenerality and interpretability of traditional iterative methods, bringing new\nfeature of incorporating prior knowledges. In CL, a signal of length $n$ only\nneeds a minimal of $n$ trainable parameters. A case study model called CLOMP is\nimplemented for evaluation. Experiments are conducted on both synthetic and\nreal one-dimensional and two-dimensional signals, demonstrating significant\nimprovements in efficiency and accuracy. Compared to representative iterative\nmethods, CLOMP improves efficiency by 100 to 1000 folds for large-scale data.\nTest results on eight diverse image datasets indicate that CLOMP improves\nstructural similarity index by 292%, 98%, 45% for sampling rates of 0.1, 0.3,\n0.5, respectively. We believe this method can truly usher CS reconstruction\ninto the AI era, benefiting countless under-determined linear systems that rely\non sparse solution.",

Thin films growth, lithography, masking, and etching\nprocesses are imperfect processes that introduce significant sidewall and\ntop-surface roughness and cause dominating optical losses in waveguides and\nphotonic structures. These roughness as perturbations couple light from guided\nto far-field radiation modes, leading to scattering losses that can be\nestimated from theoretical models.

Recent studies have\nhighlighted the importance of sharpness-based measures in promoting\ngeneralization by encouraging convergence to flatter minima. Among these\napproaches, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has emerged as an effective\noptimization technique for reducing the sharpness of the loss landscape,\nthereby improving generalization. However, SAM's computational overhead and\nsensitivity to noisy gradients limit its scalability and efficiency. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Gradient-Centralized Sharpness-Aware Minimization\n(GCSAM), which incorporates Gradient Centralization (GC) to stabilize gradients\nand accelerate convergence. GCSAM normalizes gradients before the ascent step,\nreducing noise and variance, and improving stability during training. Our\nevaluations indicate that GCSAM consistently outperforms SAM and the Adam\noptimizer in terms of generalization and computational efficiency. These\nfindings demonstrate GCSAM's effectiveness across diverse domains, including\ngeneral and medical imaging tasks.",

Motivated by these findings, a theoretical\nframework is developed to examine factors influencing a profit-maximizing\nfirm's open-sourcing decision. The analysis frames this decision as a trade-off\nbetween accelerating technology growth and securing immediate financial\nreturns. A key prediction from the theoretical analysis is an inverted-U-shaped\nrelationship between the owner's size, measured by its share of LLM-compatible\napplications, and its propensity to open source the LLM.

In this paper, a unified framework has been proposed for\nallocating in-band resource blocks (RBs), i.e., within a multi-cell network, to\n5G-NR users in co-existence with NB-IoT and LTE-M devices. First, a benchmark\n(upper-bound) scheduler has been designed for joint sub-carrier (SC) and\nmodulation and coding scheme (MCS) allocation that maximizes instantaneous\nthroughput and fairness among users/devices, while considering synchronous RB\nallocation in the neighboring cells. A series of numerical simulations with\nrealistic ICI in an urban scenario have been used to compute benchmark\nupper-bound solutions for characterizing performance in terms of throughput,\nfairness, and delay. Next, an edge learning based multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) framework has been developed for different DRL\nalgorithms, specifically, a policy-based gradient network (PGN), a deep\nQ-learning based network (DQN), and an actor-critic based deep deterministic\npolicy gradient network (DDPGN). The proposed DRL framework depends on\ninterference allocation, where the actions are based on inter-cell-interference\n(ICI) instead of power, which can bypass the need for raw data sharing and/or\ninter-agent communication.

    "abstract": "It has long been pointed out that there are seven different two-zero texture\nneutrino mass matrices compatible with neutrino oscillation data. We perform an\nupdated analysis with the recently published Nu-Fit 6.0 results. We also\nsubject the seven two-zero textures to constraints on neutrino mass from\ncosmology, end point of beta decay spectrum, and neutrinoless double beta decay\nexperiments. We find that all seven textures are compatible with the new\noscillation parameters. However, we find five textures, whose 1-1 entry is\nnonvanishing, are in severe tension with the constraints from cosmology and\nneutrinoless double beta decay. With the next generation experiments, these\nfive textures could be decisively ruled out. For the remaining two textures,\none of them could be ruled out, or severely constrained, if the octant of\n$\\theta_{23}$ is determined.",

    "abstract": "The parameter $\\sigma_8$ is the rms mass fluctuations on a scale of\n$R_8=8h^{-1}$ Mpc and is used to quantify the amplitude of matter fluctuations\nat linear scales. However, the dependence of $R_8$ on $h$ complicates direct\ncomparisons of $\\sigma_8$ values obtained under different assumptions about\n$H_0$, since $\\sigma_8$ in such cases characterizes the amount of structure at\ndifferent physical scales. This issue arises both when comparing $\\sigma_8$\nvalues from fitting analyses of cosmological models with differing $H_0$\nposteriors, and when contrasting constraints from galaxy clustering experiments\nwith different priors on $H_0$. As first noted by Ariel G. S\\'anchez in PRD\n102, 123511 (2020), quantifying the growth tension using $\\sigma_8$ can\nintroduce substantial biases and couple the growth and Hubble tensions in an\nintricate way. To address these challenges, S\\'anchez proposed an alternative\nparameter, $\\sigma_{12}$, defined as the rms mass fluctuations at $12$ Mpc,\nwhich is independent of $h$. Although S\\'anchez's work was published five years\nago and other authors have since highlighted the limitations of $\\sigma_8$,\nmuch of the cosmological community -- including large collaborations --\ncontinues to rely on this parameter rather than adopting $\\sigma_{12}$,\nseemingly due only to historical considerations. In this work, we illustrate\nthe biases introduced by $\\sigma_8$ through some clear examples, aiming to\nmotivate the community to transition from $\\sigma_8$ to $\\sigma_{12}$. We show\nthat the bias found in models with large values of $H_0$ is more prominent,\nartificially complicating the search for a model that can efficiently resolve\nthe Hubble tension without exacerbating the growth tension inferred from galaxy\nclustering measurements. We argue that the worsening of the growth tension in\nthese models is much less pronounced than previously thought or may even be\nnonexistent.",

However, in such a scenario the upper\nlimits on the cross-section obtained hitherto are typically large. Hence in the\nminimal extension of standard model where new mediators act as a portal between\nthe dark and visible sectors, the direct detection limits for sub-GeV dark\nmatter might lie within the exclusion region of other ground based searches of\nthe mediator. To evade this deadlock, we allude to blazar boosted dark matter\nelectron scattering in multi-ton neutrino detector Super kamiokande. We\nconsider minimal models such as axion like particle (ALP) and vector portal\ndark matter being upscattered by high energy blazar jet and analyse the\ninteresting parameter reaches from Super kamiokande in the parameter space of\nthe mediator, surpassing the existing constraints.

Existing graph purification methods attempt\nto address this issue by filtering attacked graphs; however, they struggle to\neffectively defend against multiple types of adversarial attacks simultaneously\ndue to their limited flexibility, and they lack comprehensive modeling of graph\ndata due to their heavy reliance on heuristic prior knowledge. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose a more versatile approach for defending against\nadversarial attacks on graphs. In this work, we introduce the Graph Defense\nDiffusion Model (GDDM), a flexible purification method that leverages the\ndenoising and modeling capabilities of diffusion models. The iterative nature\nof diffusion models aligns well with the stepwise process of adversarial\nattacks, making them particularly suitable for defense. By iteratively adding\nand removing noise, GDDM effectively purifies attacked graphs, restoring their\noriginal structure and features. Our GDDM consists of two key components: (1)\nGraph Structure-Driven Refiner, which preserves the basic fidelity of the graph\nduring the denoising process, and ensures that the generated graph remains\nconsistent with the original scope; and (2) Node Feature-Constrained\nRegularizer, which removes residual impurities from the denoised graph, further\nenhances the purification effect. Additionally, we design tailored denoising\nstrategies to handle different types of adversarial attacks, improving the\nmodel's adaptability to various attack scenarios. Extensive experiments\nconducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GDDM outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in defending against a wide range of adversarial\nattacks, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness.",

Like in most domains, the surge in Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) has led to the increased use of Machine Learning (ML) methods\nfor MEG data classification. More recently, an emerging trend in this field is\nusing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to address many MEG-related tasks. This\nreview provides a comprehensive overview of how ANNs are being used with MEG\ndata from three vantage points: First, we review work that employs ANNs for MEG\nsignal classification, i.e., for brain decoding. Second, we report on work that\nhas used ANNs as putative models of information processing in the human brain.\nFinally, we examine studies that use ANNs as techniques to tackle\nmethodological questions in MEG, including artifact correction and source\nestimation. Furthermore, we assess the current strengths and limitations of\nusing ANNs with MEG and discuss future challenges and opportunities in this\nfield. Finally, by establishing a detailed portrait of the field and providing\npractical recommendations for the future, this review seeks to provide a\nhelpful reference for both seasoned MEG researchers and newcomers to the field\nwho are interested in using ANNs to enhance the exploration of the complex\ndynamics of the human brain with MEG.",

However, current methods still\nfall short in accurately scoring image quality. In this work, we aim to\nleverage MLLMs to regress accurate quality scores. A key challenge is that the\nquality score is inherently continuous, typically modeled as a Gaussian\ndistribution, whereas MLLMs generate discrete token outputs. This mismatch\nnecessitates score discretization. Previous approaches discretize the mean\nscore into a one-hot label, resulting in information loss and failing to\ncapture inter-image relationships. We propose a distribution-based approach\nthat discretizes the score distribution into a soft label. This method\npreserves the characteristics of the score distribution, achieving high\naccuracy and maintaining inter-image relationships. Moreover, to address\ndataset variation, where different IQA datasets exhibit various distributions,\nwe introduce a fidelity loss based on Thurstone's model. This loss captures\nintra-dataset relationships, facilitating co-training across multiple IQA\ndatasets. With these designs, we develop the distribution-based Depicted image\nQuality Assessment model for Score regression (DeQA-Score). Experiments across\nmultiple benchmarks show that DeQA-Score stably outperforms baselines in score\nregression. Also, DeQA-Score can predict the score distribution that closely\naligns with human annotations. Codes and model weights have been released in\nhttps://depictqa.github.io/deqa-score/.",

However, FL\nintroduces the need for additional security measures as FL alone is still\nsubject to vulnerabilities such as model and data poisoning and inference\nattacks. Confidential Computing (CC) is a paradigm that, by leveraging\nhardware-based trusted execution environments (TEEs), protects the\nconfidentiality and integrity of ML models and data, thus resulting in a\npowerful ally of FL applications. Typical TEEs offer an application-isolation\nlevel but suffer many drawbacks, such as limited available memory and debugging\nand coding difficulties. The new generation of TEEs offers a virtual machine\n(VM)-based isolation level, thus reducing the porting effort for existing\napplications. In this work, we compare the performance of VM-based and\napplication-isolation level TEEs for confidential FL (CFL) applications. In\nparticular, we evaluate the impact of TEEs and additional security mechanisms\nsuch as TLS (for securing the communication channel). The results, obtained\nacross three datasets and two deep learning models, demonstrate that the new\nVM-based TEEs introduce a limited overhead (at most 1.5x), thus paving the way\nto leverage public and untrusted computing environments, such as HPC facilities\nor public cloud, without detriment to performance.",

However, traditional methods relying on inertial sensors are highly\nsensitive to external conditions, and suffer from drifts leading to large\ninaccuracies over long distances. Vision-based methods, particularly those\nutilising event-based vision sensors, provide an efficient alternative by\ncapturing data only when changes are perceived in the scene. This approach\nminimises power consumption while delivering high-speed, low-latency feedback.\nIn this work, we propose a fully event-based pipeline for egomotion estimation\nthat processes the event stream directly within the event-based domain. This\nmethod eliminates the need for frame-based intermediaries, allowing for\nlow-latency and energy-efficient motion estimation. We construct a shallow\nspiking neural network using a synaptic gating mechanism to convert precise\nevent timing into bursts of spikes. These spikes encode local optical flow\nvelocities, and the network provides an event-based readout of egomotion. We\nevaluate the network's performance on a dedicated chip, demonstrating strong\npotential for low-latency, low-power motion estimation. Additionally,\nsimulations of larger networks show that the system achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy in egomotion estimation tasks with event-based cameras, making it a\npromising solution for real-time, power-constrained robotics applications.",

Although security features are usually available in\nlibraries, integrating security features requires writing and maintaining\nadditional security-critical code. While there have been studies on the use of\nsuch libraries, surprisingly little is known about how developers engineer\nsecurity features, how they select what security features to implement and\nwhich ones may require custom implementation, and the implications for\nmaintenance. As a result, we currently rely on assumptions that are largely\nbased on common sense or individual examples. However, to provide them with\neffective solutions, researchers need hard empirical data to understand what\npractitioners need and how they view security -- data that we currently lack.\nTo fill this gap, we contribute an exploratory study with 26 knowledgeable\nindustrial participants. We study how security features of software systems are\nselected and engineered in practice, what their code-level characteristics are,\nand what challenges practitioners face.

Building on the approach\nof Dotan, Linial, and Peled, we analyze a randomized algorithm for generating\nrandom proper $(\\Delta+1)$-edge-colorings, which in particular provides an\nalgorithmic interpretation of Vizing's theorem. The idea is to start from an\narbitrary non-proper edge-coloring with the desired number of colors and at\neach step, recolor one edge uniformly at random provided it does not increase\nthe number of conflicting edges (a potential function will count the number of\npairs of adjacent edges of the same color).

We evaluated the performance and\nuser experience (UX) of our Gaze+Blink method with two user studies and\ncompared it with Gaze+Pinch in a realistic user interface setup featuring\ncommon menu interaction tasks.

    "abstract": "One of the open challenges in Reinforcement Learning is the hard exploration\nproblem in sparse reward environments. Various types of intrinsic rewards have\nbeen proposed to address this challenge by pushing towards diversity. This\ndiversity might be imposed at different levels, favouring the agent to explore\ndifferent states, policies or behaviours (State, Policy and Skill level\ndiversity, respectively). However, the impact of diversity on the agent's\nbehaviour remains unclear. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by studying\nthe effect of different levels of diversity imposed by intrinsic rewards on the\nexploration patterns of RL agents. We select four intrinsic rewards (State\nCount, Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), Maximum Entropy, and Diversity is all\nyou need (DIAYN)), each pushing for a different diversity level. We conduct an\nempirical study on MiniGrid environment to compare their impact on exploration\nconsidering various metrics related to the agent's exploration, namely:\nepisodic return, observation coverage, agent's position coverage, policy\nentropy, and timeframes to reach the sparse reward. The main outcome of the\nstudy is that State Count leads to the best exploration performance in the case\nof low-dimensional observations. However, in the case of RGB observations, the\nperformance of State Count is highly degraded mostly due to representation\nlearning challenges. Conversely, Maximum Entropy is less impacted, resulting in\na more robust exploration, despite being not always optimal. Lastly, our\nempirical study revealed that learning diverse skills with DIAYN, often linked\nto improved robustness and generalisation, does not promote exploration in\nMiniGrid environments. This is because: i) learning the skill space itself can\nbe challenging, and ii) exploration within the skill space prioritises\ndifferentiating between behaviours rather than achieving uniform state\nvisitation.",

    "abstract": "Manual tuning of performance-critical controller parameters can be tedious\nand sub-optimal. Bayesian Optimization (BO) is an increasingly popular\npractical alternative to automatically optimize controller parameters from few\nexperiments. Standard BO practice is to evaluate the closed-loop performance of\nparameters proposed during optimization on an episode with a fixed length.\nHowever, fixed-length episodes can be wasteful. For example, continuing an\nepisode where already the start shows undesirable behavior such as strong\noscillations seems pointless. Therefore, we propose a BO method that stops an\nepisode early if suboptimality becomes apparent before an episode is completed.\nSuch early stopping results in partial observations of the controller's\nperformance, which cannot directly be included in standard BO. We propose three\nheuristics to facilitate partially observed episodes in BO. Through five\nnumerical and one hardware experiment, we demonstrate that early stopping BO\ncan substantially reduce the time needed for optimization.",

The results of these tests show that there is a\nclear deformation of the structure related to the temperature changes and\nmagnetic forces, but the magnitude of this deformation is well within the\ntolerances required for the functionality of the undulator since they are\ncompatible or lower with respect to the one calculated with the finite elements\nmethods.

This is especially relevant for laser\ninterferometric ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Increasing their\nsensitivity, particularly at frequencies below 10 Hz, is threatened by the\ninfluence of parasitic photons. These can up-convert low-frequency disturbances\ninto phase and amplitude noise inside the relevant measurement band. By\nartificially tuning the coherence of the lasers, using pseudo-random-noise\n(PRN) phase modulations, this influence of parasitic fields can be suppressed.\nAs it relies on these fields traveling different paths, it does not sacrifice\nthe coherence for the intentional interference. We demonstrate the feasibility\nof this technique experimentally, achieving noise suppression levels of 40 dB\nin a Michelson interferometer with an artificial coherence length below 30 cm.\nWe probe how the suppression depends on the delay mismatch and length of the\nPRN sequence. We also prove that optical resonators can be operated in the\npresence of PRN modulation by measuring the behavior of a linear cavity with\nand without such a modulation. By matching the resonators round-trip length and\nthe PRN sequence repetition length, the classic response is recovered.",

However, in data\npruning which speeds up the prediction phase, there is an issue related to the\nspeed and efficiency of the process itself. In response, the study proposes an\napproach involving transforming the instance selection process into a\nclassification task conducted in a unified meta-feature space where each\ninstance can be classified and assigned to either the \"to keep\" or \"to remove\"\nclass. This approach requires training an appropriate meta-classifier, which\ncan be developed based on historical instance selection results from other\ndatasets using reference instance selection methods as a labeling tool. This\nwork proposes constructing the meta-feature space based on properties extracted\nfrom the nearest neighbor graph. Experiments conducted on 17 datasets of\nvarying sizes and five reference instance selection methods (ENN, Drop3, ICF,\nHMN-EI, and CCIS) demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves results\ncomparable to reference instance selection methods while significantly reducing\ncomputational complexity. In the proposed approach, the computational\ncomplexity of the system depends only on identifying the k-nearest neighbors\nfor each data sample and running the meta-classifier.

    "abstract": "As an affordable and convenient eye scan, fundus photography holds the\npotential for preventing vision impairment, especially in resource-limited\nregions. However, fundus image degradation is common under intricate imaging\nenvironments, impacting following diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, image\nquality assessment (IQA) and enhancement (IQE) are essential for ensuring the\nclinical value and reliability of fundus images. While existing reviews offer\nsome overview of this field, a comprehensive analysis of the interplay between\nIQA and IQE, along with their clinical deployment challenges, is lacking. This\npaper addresses this gap by providing a thorough review of fundus IQA and IQE\nalgorithms, research advancements, and practical applications. We outline the\nfundamentals of the fundus photography imaging system and the associated\ninterferences, and then systematically summarize the paradigms in fundus IQA\nand IQE. Furthermore, we discuss the practical challenges and solutions in\ndeploying IQA and IQE, as well as offer insights into potential future research\ndirections.",

    "abstract": "Capturing high dynamic range (HDR) scenes is one of the most important issues\nin camera design. Majority of cameras use exposure fusion, which fuses images\ncaptured by different exposure levels, to increase dynamic range. However, this\napproach can only handle images with limited exposure difference, normally 3-4\nstops. When applying to very high dynamic range scenes where a large exposure\ndifference is required, this approach often fails due to incorrect alignment or\ninconsistent lighting between inputs, or tone mapping artifacts. In this work,\nwe propose \\model, the first exposure fusion technique that can merge inputs\nwith 9 stops differences. The key idea is that we model exposure fusion as a\nguided inpainting problem, where the under-exposed image is used as a guidance\nto fill the missing information of over-exposed highlights in the over-exposed\nregion. Using an under-exposed image as a soft guidance, instead of a hard\nconstraint, our model is robust to potential alignment issue or lighting\nvariations. Moreover, by utilizing the image prior of the generative model, our\nmodel also generates natural tone mapping, even for very high-dynamic range\nscenes. Our approach outperforms HDR-Transformer on latest HDR benchmarks.\nMoreover, to test its performance in ultra high dynamic range scenes, we\ncapture a new real-world exposure fusion benchmark, UltraFusion dataset, with\nexposure differences up to 9 stops, and experiments show that UltraFusion can\ngenerate beautiful and high-quality fusion results under various scenarios.\nCode and data will be available at\nhttps://openimaginglab.github.io/UltraFusion.",

This\nstudy introduces two novel metrics, PoPDivergence and PoPStat, one to quantify\nthe difference between population pyramids and the other to assess the strength\nand nature of their association with the mortality of a given disease.\nPoPDivergence, based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, measures deviations\nbetween a countrys population pyramid and a reference pyramid. PoPStat is the\ncorrelation between these deviations and the log form of disease-specific\nmortality rates. The reference population is selected by a brute-force\noptimization that maximizes this correlation. Utilizing mortality data from the\nGlobal Burden of Disease 2021 and population statistics from the United\nNations, we applied these metrics to 371 diseases across 204 countries. Results\nreveal that PoPStat outperforms traditional indicators such as median age, GDP\nper capita, and Human Development Index in explaining the mortality of most\ndiseases. Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) like neurological disorders and\ncancers, communicable diseases (CDs) like neglected tropical diseases, and\nmaternal and neonatal diseases were tightly bound to the underlying demographic\nattributes whereas NCDs like diabetes, CDs like respiratory infections and\ninjuries including self-harm and interpersonal violence were weakly associated\nwith population pyramid shapes. Notably, except for diabetes, the NCD mortality\nburden was shared by constrictive population pyramids, while mortality of\ncommunicable diseases, maternal and neonatal causes and injuries were largely\nborne by expansive pyramids. Therefore, PoPStat provides insights into\ndemographic determinants of health and empirical support for models on\nepidemiological transition.

Aims: We\nanalyze how the inclusion of higher-resolution data changes the estimates of\nthe filament properties and test the robustness of filament fitting routines.\nMethods. ArT\\'eMiS and Herschel data are combined to create high-resolution\nimages. Column densities and temperatures are estimated with modified blackbody\nfitting. The nearby OMC-3 cloud is compared to the more distant G202 and G17\nclouds. We compare the OMC-3 cloud as it appears at Herschel and ArT\\'eMiS\nresolution. Results. Column densities of dense clumps in OMC-3 are higher in\ncombined ArT\\'eMiS and Herschel data (FWHM 8.5\"), when compared to\nHerschel-only data (FWHM 20\"). Estimated filament widths are smaller in the\ncombined maps, and also show signs of further fragmentation when observed with\nthe ArT\\'eMiS resolution. In the analysis of Herschel data the estimated\nfilament widths are correlated with the distance of the field. Conclusions.\nMedian filament FWHM in OMC-3 at higher resolution is 0.05 pc, but 0.1 pc with\nthe Herschel resolution, 0.3 pc in G202 and 1.0 pc in G17, also at the Herschel\nresolution. It is unclear what causes the steep relation between distance and\nfilament FWHM, but likely reasons include the effect of the limited telescope\nresolution combined with existing hierarchical structure, and convolution of\nlarge-scale background structures within the ISM.

    "abstract": "In information-theoretic private information retrieval (PIR), a client wants\nto retrieve one desired file out of $M$ files, stored across $N$ servers, while\nkeeping the index of the desired file private from each $T$-sized subset of\nservers. A PIR protocol must ideally maximize the rate, which is the ratio of\nthe file size to the total quantum of the download from the servers, while\nensuring such privacy. In Weak-PIR (WPIR), the criterion of perfect\ninformation-theoretic privacy is relaxed. This enables higher rates to be\nachieved, while some information about the desired file index leaks to the\nservers. This leakage is captured by various known privacy metrics. By\nleveraging the well-established capacity-achieving schemes of Sun and Jafar\nunder non-colluding ($T=1$) and colluding ($1<T\\leq N$) scenarios, we present\nWPIR protocols for these scenarios. We also present a new WPIR scheme for the\nMDS scenario, by building upon the scheme by Banawan and Ulukus for this\nscenario. We present corresponding explicit rate-privacy trade-offs for these\nsetups, under the mutual-information and the maximal leakage privacy metrics.\nIn the collusion-free setup, our presented rate-privacy trade-off under maximal\nleakage matches that of the previous state of the art. With respect to the MDS\nscenario under the maximal leakage metric, we compare with the non-explicit\ntrade-off in the literature, and show that our scheme performs better for some\nnumerical examples. For the $T$-collusion setup (under both privacy metrics)\nand for the MDS setup under the mutual information metric, our rate-privacy\ntrade-offs are the first in the literature, to the best of our knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Programmers regularly use strings to encode many types of data, such as Unix\nfile paths, URLs, and email addresses, that are conceptually different.\nHowever, existing mainstream programming languages use a unified string type to\nrepresent them all. As a result, their type systems will keep quiet when a\nfunction requiring an email address is instead fed an HTML text, which may\ncause unexceptional failures or vulnerabilities.\n  To let the type system distinguish such conceptually different string types,\nin this paper, we propose to regard \\emph{formal languages as types} (FLAT),\nthereby restricting the set of valid strings by context-free grammars and\nsemantic constraints if needed. To this end, email addresses and HTML text are\ntreated as different types. We realize this idea in Python as a testing\nframework FLAT-PY. It contains user annotations, all directly attached to the\nuser's code, to (1) define such \\emph{language types}, (2) specify\npre-/post-conditions serving as \\emph{semantic oracles} or contracts for\nfunctions, and (3) fuzz functions via random string inputs generated from a\n\\emph{language-based fuzzer}. From these annotations, FLAY-PY\n\\emph{automatically} checks type correctness at runtime via \\emph{code\ninstrumentation}, and reports any detected type error as soon as possible,\npreventing bugs from flowing deeply into other parts of the code. Case studies\non real Python code fragments show that FLAT-PY is enable to catch logical bugs\nfrom random inputs, requiring a reasonable amount of user annotations.",

This issue is more critical for\noperational applications in remote sensing (RS), especially when large-scale RS\ndata is processed and analyzed through FL systems with restricted communication\nbandwidth. To address this issue, we introduce an explanation-guided pruning\nstrategy for communication-efficient FL in the context of RS image\nclassification. Our pruning strategy is defined based on the layer-wise\nrelevance propagation (LRP) driven explanations to: 1) efficiently and\neffectively identify the most relevant and informative model parameters (to be\nexchanged between clients and the central server); and 2) eliminate the\nnon-informative ones to minimize the volume of model updates.

The Palisades and Eaton fires\naffected over 20,000 people each, compared to fewer than 500 in rural events.\nThese findings offer valuable insights for the development of targeted wildfire\nmanagement strategies, particularly in wildland urban interface zones, and\nemphasize the need for age- and gender-conscious approaches in emergency\nresponse planning.",

However, when building OOD detection score upon on\nin-distribution (ID) text-image affinity, existing works either focus on each\nID class or whole ID label sets, overlooking inherent ID classes' connection.\nWe find that the semantic information across different ID classes is beneficial\nfor effective OOD detection.

For small objects kinetic effects on scales smaller than an ion\ngyroradius play an important role, and species with various mass-per-charge may\nact differently. In this case the solar wind composition can be important.\nProtons are the dominant ion species in the solar wind; however, sometimes the\ndensity of alpha particles increases significantly. We analyse the effect of\ndifferent solar wind alpha-to-proton ratios on the plasma boundaries of the\ninduced cometary magnetosphere. In addition, we investigate the energy transfer\nbetween the solar wind ions, the cometary ions, and the electromagnetic fields.\nUsing the hybrid model Amitis, we simulate two different alpha-to-proton ratios\nand analyse the resulting plasma structures. We calculate the power density\n(E.J) of all three ion species (solar wind protons and alphas, and cometary\nions) to identify load and generator regions. The integrated 1D power density\nshows the evolution of the power density from the upstream solar wind to\ndownstream of the nucleus. A higher alpha-to-proton ratio leads to a larger\ncomet magnetosphere but weaker magnetic field pile-up. The protons transfer\nenergy to the fields and the cometary ions in the entire upstream region and\nthe pile-up layer. Upstream of the nucleus, alphas are inefficient in\ntransferring energy and can act as a load, especially for low alpha-to-proton\nratios. The transfer of energy from alphas to cometary ions happens further\ndownstream due to their larger inertia. For a multi-species solar wind the mass\nloading and energy transfer upstream of the pile-up layer will be most\nefficient for the species with the lowest inertia, typically protons, since\ndifferent ion gyroradii give different flow patterns for the individual\nspecies.",

Here, we compute the long-term evolution\nof its parameters, particularly the NS spin frequency ($\\nu$) and the surface\nmagnetic field ($B$), to probe its nature and its potential for CW detection.\nWe find that Sco X-1 is an unusually young ($\\sim7\\times10^6$ yr) LMXB and\nconstrain the current NS mass to $\\sim 1.4-1.6~{\\rm M}_\\odot$. Our computations\nreveal a rapid $B$ decay, with the maximum current value of $\\sim\n1.8\\times10^8$ G, which can be useful to constrain the decay models. Note that\nthe maximum current $\\nu$ value is $\\sim 550$ Hz, implying that, unlike what is\ngenerally believed, a CW emission is not required to explain the current source\nproperties. However, $\\nu$ will exceed an observed cut-off frequency of $\\sim\n730$ Hz, and perhaps even the NS break-up frequency, in the future, without a\nCW emission. The minimum NS mass quadrupole moment ($Q$) to avoid this is $\\sim\n(2-3)\\times10^{37}$ g cm$^2$, corresponding to a CW strain of $\\sim 10^{-26}$.\nOur estimation of current $\\nu$ values can improve the CW search sensitivity.",

More precise methods,\nsuch as optimal balance and nonlinear normal mode decomposition, account for\nnonlinear effects, but their application has so far been limited to idealized\nmodel configurations that exclude irregular lateral boundaries, depth\nvariations, a varying Coriolis parameter, or other environmental conditions.\nHere, we address these limitations by modifying the optimal balance method such\nthat it is applicable to more realistic model setups.

    "abstract": "The localization of multiple signal sources using sensor arrays has been a\nlong-standing research challenge. While numerous solutions have been developed,\nsignal space methods like MUSIC and ESPRIT have gained widespread popularity.\nAs sensor arrays grow in size, sources are frequently located in the near-field\nregion. The standard MUSIC algorithm can be adapted to locate these sources by\nperforming a 3D search over both the distance and the angles of arrival (AOA),\nincluding azimuth and elevation, though this comes with significant\ncomputational complexity. To address this, a modified version of MUSIC has been\ndeveloped to decouple the AoA and distance, enabling sequential estimation of\nthese parameters and reducing computational demands. However, this approach\nsuffers from reduced accuracy. To maintain the accuracy of MUSIC while\nminimizing complexity, this paper proposes a novel method that exploits angular\nvariation across the array aperture, eliminating the need for a grid search\nover distance. The proposed method divides the large aperture into smaller\nsections, with each focusing on estimating the angles of arrival. These angles\nare then triangulated to localize the sources in the near-field of the large\naperture. Numerical simulations show that this approach not only surpasses the\nModified MUSIC algorithm in terms of mean absolute error but also achieves\naccuracy comparable to standard MUSIC, all while greatly reducing computational\ncomplexity-370 times in our simulation scenario.",

    "abstract": "To estimate the causal effect of treatments that vary over time from\nobservational data, one must adjust for time-varying confounding. A common\nprocedure to address confounding is the use of inverse probability of treatment\nweighting methods. However, the timing of covariate measurements is often\nirregular, which may introduce additional confounding bias as well as selection\nbias into the causal effect estimate. Two reweighting methods have been\nproposed to adjust for these biases: time-as-confounder and reweighting by\nmeasurement time. However, it is currently not well understood in which\nsituations these irregularly timed measurements induce bias, and how the\navailable reweighting methods compare to each other in different situations. In\nthis work, we provide a complete inventarization of all possible backdoor paths\nthrough which bias is induced. Based on these paths, we distinguish three\ncategories of confounding bias by measurement time: direct confounding (DC),\nconfounding through measured variables (CMV), and confounding through\nunmeasured variables (CUV). These categories differ in the assumptions and\nreweighting methods necessary to adjust for bias and may occur simultaneously\nwith selection bias. Through simulation studies, we illustrate: 1. Reweighting\nby measurement time may be used to adjust for selection bias and confounding\nthrough measured variables; 2. Time-as-confounder may be used to adjust for all\ncategories of confounding bias, but not selection bias; 3. In some cases, the\nuse of a combination of both techniques may be used to adjust for both\nconfounding and selection bias. We finally apply the categorization and\nreweighting methods on the pre-DIVA data set. Adjusting for measurement times\nis crucial in order to avoid bias, and the categorization of biases and\ntechniques that we introduce may help researchers to choose the appropriate\nanalysis.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel framework for decomposing interventional causal effects\ninto synergistic, redundant, and unique components, building on the intuition\nof Partial Information Decomposition (PID) and the principle of M\\\"obius\ninversion. While recent work has explored a similar decomposition of an\nobservational measure, we argue that a proper causal decomposition must be\ninterventional in nature. We develop a mathematical approach that\nsystematically quantifies how causal power is distributed among variables in a\nsystem, using a recently derived closed-form expression for the M\\\"obius\nfunction of the redundancy lattice. The formalism is then illustrated by\ndecomposing the causal power in logic gates, cellular automata, and chemical\nreaction networks. Our results reveal how the distribution of causal power can\nbe context- and parameter-dependent. This decomposition provides new insights\ninto complex systems by revealing how causal influences are shared and combined\namong multiple variables, with potential applications ranging from attribution\nof responsibility in legal or AI systems, to the analysis of biological\nnetworks or climate models.",

High-degree ROADM-based optical networks have\nmultiple parallel fibers between ROADM nodes, requiring the adoption of ROADM\nnodes with a large number of inter-/intra-node components. However, this large\nnumber of inter-/intra-node optical components in high-degree ROADM networks\nincreases the likelihood of multiple failures simultaneously, and calls for\nnovel methods for accurate localization of multiple failed components. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the problem of\nmulti-failure localization for high-degree ROADM-based optical networks. To\nsolve this problem, we first provide a description of the failures affecting\nboth inter-/intra-node components, and we consider different deployments of\noptical power monitors (OPMs) to obtain information (i.e., optical power) to be\nused for automated multi-failure localization. Then, as our main and original\ncontribution, we propose a novel method based on a rules-informed neural\nnetwork (RINN) for multi-failure localization, which incorporates the benefits\nof both rules-based reasoning and artificial neural networks (ANN). Through\nextensive simulations and experimental demonstrations, we show that our\nproposed RINN algorithm can achieve up to around 20 higher localization\naccuracy compared to baseline algorithms, incurring only around 4.14 ms of\naverage inference time.",

    "abstract": "Ontology matching (OM) plays a key role in enabling data interoperability and\nknowledge sharing, but it remains challenging due to the need for large\ntraining datasets and limited vocabulary processing in machine learning\napproaches. Recently, methods based on Large Language Model (LLMs) have shown\ngreat promise in OM, particularly through the use of a retrieve-then-prompt\npipeline. In this approach, relevant target entities are first retrieved and\nthen used to prompt the LLM to predict the final matches. Despite their\npotential, these systems still present limited performance and high\ncomputational overhead. To address these issues, we introduce MILA, a novel\napproach that embeds a retrieve-identify-prompt pipeline within a prioritized\ndepth-first search (PDFS) strategy. This approach efficiently identifies a\nlarge number of semantic correspondences with high accuracy, limiting LLM\nrequests to only the most borderline cases. We evaluated MILA using the\nbiomedical challenge proposed in the 2023 and 2024 editions of the Ontology\nAlignment Evaluation Initiative. Our method achieved the highest F-Measure in\nfour of the five unsupervised tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art OM systems\nby up to 17%. It also performed better than or comparable to the leading\nsupervised OM systems. MILA further exhibited task-agnostic performance,\nremaining stable across all tasks and settings, while significantly reducing\nLLM requests. These findings highlight that high-performance LLM-based OM can\nbe achieved through a combination of programmed (PDFS), learned (embedding\nvectors), and prompting-based heuristics, without the need of domain-specific\nheuristics or fine-tuning.",

The type of dynamic scaling ansatz which is verified depends on the\nrandomness that occurs in the system, whether it is columnar disorder (quenched\nnoise given by the random assignment of natural frequencies), leading to\nanomalous scaling, or else time-dependent noise, inducing the more standard\nFamily-Vicsek dynamic scaling ansatz, as in equilibrium critical dynamics. The\nspecific universality class also depends on the coupling function: for a sine\nfunction (as in the celebrated Kuramoto model) the critical behavior is that of\nthe Edwards-Wilkinson equation for the corresponding type of randomness, with\nGaussian fluctuations around the average growth. In all the other cases\ninvestigated, Tracy-Widom fluctuations ensue, associated with the celebrated\nKardar-Parisi-Zhang equation for rough interfaces. Two questions remain to be\naddressed in order to complete the picture, however: 1) Is the atypical scaling\ndisplayed by the sine coupling preserved if other coupling functions satisfying\nthe same (odd) symmetry are employed (as suggested by continuum approximations\nand symmetry arguments)? and 2) how does the competition between both types of\nrandomness (which are expected to coexist in experimental settings) affect the\nnonequilibrium behavior? We address the latter question by numerically\ncharacterizing the crossover between thermal-noise and columnar-disorder\ncriticality, and the former by providing evidence confirming that it is the\nsymmetry of the coupling function that sets apart the sine coupling, among\nother odd-symmetric couplings, due to the absence of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang\nfluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) agents are increasingly pivotal for addressing\ncomplex tasks in interactive environments. Existing work mainly focuses on\nenhancing performance through behavior cloning from stronger experts, yet such\napproaches often falter in real-world applications, mainly due to the inability\nto recover from errors. However, step-level critique data is difficult and\nexpensive to collect. Automating and dynamically constructing self-critique\ndatasets is thus crucial to empowering models with intelligent agent\ncapabilities. In this work, we propose an iterative self-training framework,\nAgent-R, that enables language Agent to Reflect on the fly. Unlike traditional\nmethods that reward or penalize actions based on correctness, Agent-R leverages\nMCTS to construct training data that recover correct trajectories from\nerroneous ones. A key challenge of agent reflection lies in the necessity for\ntimely revision rather than waiting until the end of a rollout. To address\nthis, we introduce a model-guided critique construction mechanism: the actor\nmodel identifies the first error step (within its current capability) in a\nfailed trajectory. Starting from it, we splice it with the adjacent correct\npath, which shares the same parent node in the tree. This strategy enables the\nmodel to learn reflection based on its current policy, therefore yielding\nbetter learning efficiency. To further explore the scalability of this\nself-improvement paradigm, we investigate iterative refinement of both error\ncorrection capabilities and dataset construction. Our findings demonstrate that\nAgent-R continuously improves the model's ability to recover from errors and\nenables timely error correction. Experiments on three interactive environments\nshow that Agent-R effectively equips agents to correct erroneous actions while\navoiding loops, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods\n(+5.59%).",

We\nshow how the overdetermined problem can be resolved within our model for a\nclass of hybrid devices similar to that studied by Henneberg and Plunk (S.\nHenneberg and G. Plunk, PRR 2024). We are also able to solve the existence\nequation for flux surfaces analytically in the most general case by introducing\na special coordinate system. This will enable us to carry out an optimization\nseeking to minimize the error in our GSE while obeying the flux surface\nexistence equation, which will allow us to find solutions outside the class of\nhybrid devices.

    "abstract": "Payment Channel Networks (PCNs) are a method for improving the scaling and\nlatency of cryptocurrency transactions. For a payment to be made between two\npeers in a PCN, a feasible low-fee path in the network must be planned. Many\nPCN path planning algorithms use a search algorithm that is a variant of\nDijkstra's algorithm. In this article, we prove the correctness and\ncomputational complexity of this algorithm. Specifically, we show that, if the\nPCN satisfies a consistency property relating to the fees charged by payment\nchannels, the algorithm is correct and has polynomial computational complexity.\nHowever, in the general case, the algorithm is not correct and the path\nplanning problem is NP-hard. These newly developed results can be used to\ninform the development of new or existing PCNs amenable to path planning. For\nexample, we show that the Lightning Network, which is the most widely used PCN\nand is built on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, currently satisfies the above\nconsistency property. As a second contribution, we demonstrate that a small\nmodification to the above path planning algorithm which, although having the\nsame asymptotic computational complexity, empirically shows better performance.\nThis modification involves the use of a bidirectional search and is empirically\nevaluated by simulating transactions on the Lightning Network.",

In\nthis work, we analyze how LEO satellites, from the perspective of ground\nterminals, can participate in a time-window-based model training. By splitting\nthe model between a LEO and a ground terminal, the computational burden on the\nsatellite segment is reduced, while each LEO satellite offloads the partially\ntrained model to the next satellite in the constellation. This cyclical\ntraining process allows larger and more energy-intensive models to be deployed\nand trained across multiple LEO satellites, despite their limited energy\nresources.

Motivated by the Boltzmann weight formalism, here we present a\ntheoretical framework to predict the non-Nash equilibrium probabilities of\npossible outcomes in strategic games by focusing on the differences in expected\npayoffs of players rather than traditional utility metrics. In this model,\nbounded rationality is parameterized by assigning a temperature to each player,\nreflecting their level of rationality by interpolating between two\ndecision-making regimes, i.e., utility maximization and equiprobable choices.\nOur framework predicts all possible joint strategies and is able to determine\nthe relative probabilities for multiple pure or mixed strategy equilibria. To\nvalidate model predictions, by analyzing experimental data we demonstrated that\nour model can successfully explain non-Nash equilibrium strategic behavior in\nexperimental games. Our approach reinterprets the concept of temperature in\ngame theory, leveraging the development of theoretical frameworks to bridge the\ngap between the predictions of normative game theory and the results of\nbehavioral experiments.",

    "abstract": "The web has become a crucial source of information, but it is also used to\nspread disinformation, often conveyed through multiple modalities like images\nand text. The identification of inconsistent cross-modal information, in\nparticular entities such as persons, locations, and events, is critical to\ndetect disinformation. Previous works either identify out-of-context\ndisinformation by assessing the consistency of images to the whole document,\nneglecting relations of individual entities, or focus on generic entities that\nare not relevant to news. So far, only few approaches have addressed the task\nof validating entity consistency between images and text in news. However, the\npotential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has not been explored yet. In\nthis paper, we propose an LVLM-based framework for verifying Cross-modal Entity\nConsistency~(LVLM4CEC), to assess whether persons, locations and events in news\narticles are consistent across both modalities. We suggest effective prompting\nstrategies for LVLMs for entity verification that leverage reference images\ncrawled from web. Moreover, we extend three existing datasets for the task of\nentity verification in news providing manual ground-truth data. Our results\nshow the potential of LVLMs for automating cross-modal entity verification,\nshowing improved accuracy in identifying persons and events when using evidence\nimages. Moreover, our method outperforms a baseline for location and event\nverification in documents. The datasets and source code are available on GitHub\nat https://github.com/TIBHannover/LVLM4CEC.",

While some knowledge transfer\ntechniques can enhance the prediction performance for non-overlapping patients,\nthey fall short in addressing scenarios where overlapping and non-overlapping\npatients belong to different domains, resulting in challenges such as feature\nheterogeneity and label heterogeneity. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel unified vertical federated knowledge transfer framework (Unitrans). Our\nframework consists of three key steps. First, we extract the federated\nrepresentation of overlapping patients by employing an effective vertical\nfederated representation learning method to model multi-party joint features\nonline. Next, each hospital learns a local knowledge transfer module offline,\nenabling the transfer of knowledge from the federated representation of\noverlapping patients to the enriched representation of local non-overlapping\npatients in a domain-adaptive manner. Finally, hospitals utilize these enriched\nlocal representations to enhance performance across various downstream medical\nprediction tasks. Experiments on real-world medical datasets validate the\nframework's dual effectiveness in both intra-domain and cross-domain knowledge\ntransfer.

The objective\nis then to quantify the error made by the algorithm on the ranks of the $m$ new\nitems among the total $(n+m)$. In such a setting, the true ranks of the $n$\noriginal items in the total $(n+m)$ depend on the (unknown) true ranks of the\n$m$ new ones. Consequently, we have no direct access to a calibration set to\napply a classical CP method. To address this challenge, we propose to construct\ndistribution-free bounds of the unknown conformity scores using recent results\non the distribution of conformal p-values. Using these scores upper bounds, we\nprovide valid prediction sets for the rank of any item.

In this work, we constructed a strong jet\nsample containing 50 flat-spectrum radio quasars, 51 low-synchrotron-peaked BL\nLac objects and 18 intermediate-synchrotron-peaked BL Lac objects to explore\nthe origin of X-ray emissions. Generally, blazars are the typical radio-loud\nactive galactic nucleus with a powerful jet toward the observer, causing their\nbroadband emissions to be boosted. By considering the Doppler boosting effect,\nwe obtain the intrinsic radio--X-ray correlation and the fundamental plane (FP)\nof black hole activity for the strong jet sources: the intrinsic radio--X-ray\ncorrelation is $L_{\\rm{R,int}}\\propto L_{\\rm{X,int}}^{1.04}$, which favor the\njet-dominated mode, the intrinsic FP is $\\log L_{\\rm{R,int}}=(1.07\\pm0.06)\\log\nL_{\\rm{X,int}}-(0.22\\pm0.10)\\log M_{\\rm{BH}}-(3.77\\pm2.11)$, which can be\ninterpreted by the hybrid mode of jet+standard disk.

    "abstract": "Temporal graphs arise when modeling interactions that evolve over time. They\nusually come in several flavors, depending on the number of parameters used to\ndescribe the temporal aspects of the interactions: time of appearance,\nduration, delay of transmission. In the point model, edges appear at specific\npoints in time, while in the more general interval model, edges can be present\nover multiple time intervals. In both models, the delay for traversing an edge\ncan change with each edge appearance. When time is discrete, the two models are\nequivalent in the sense that the presence of an edge during an interval is\nequivalent to a sequence of point-in-time occurrences of the edge. However,\nthis transformation can drastically change the size of the input and has\ncomplexity issues. Indeed, we show a gap between the two models with respect to\nthe complexity of the classical problem of computing a fastest temporal path\nfrom a source vertex to a target vertex, i.e. a path where edges can be\ntraversed one after another in time and such that the total duration from\nsource to target is minimized. It can be solved in near-linear time in the\npoint model, while we show that the interval model requires quadratic time\nunder classical assumptions of fine-grained complexity. With respect to linear\ntime, our lower bound implies a factor of the number of vertices, while the\nbest known algorithm has a factor of the number of underlying edges.\nInterestingly, we show that near-linear time is possible in the interval model\nwhen restricted to all delays being zero, i.e. traversing an edge is\ninstantaneous.",

JPS4 builds upon the Jump Point Search (JPS8) algorithm, originally\ndesigned for 8-connected environments. To achieve efficient pathfinding on\n4-connected grids, JPS4 employs a canonical ordering and a successor function\nthat enable online graph pruning. This reduces the search space by minimizing\nunnecessary node expansions.\n  The core concept of JPS4 as well as JPS8 lies in the utilization of jump\npoints. Strategically placed at obstacle corners, jump points prevent the\nsearch from overlooking crucial sections of the state space. They essentially\nreinitialize the canonical ordering, allowing exploration beyond obstacles.\nThis mechanism ensures JPS4 finds optimal paths even in complex environments.\n  The paper further explores the optimality of JPS4 and compares its\nperformance against the established A* algorithm on various grid maps.\nBenchmarking results demonstrate that JPS4 significantly outperforms A* in\nscenarios with high obstacle density. However, A* remains more efficient on\nopen maps. Overall, JPS4 presents itself as a promising alternative to A* for\npathfinding on 4-connected grids, particularly applicable in video game\ndevelopment.",

Previous\nstudies provided limited descriptions with no consideration for width, location\nvariability, or curvature. We aimed to offer a comprehensive 3D anatomical\nanalysis of the Linea alba, emphasizing its variations across diverse\ndemographics. Methods: Using open source software, 2D sagittal plane and 3D\nreconstructions were performed on 117 patients' CT scans. Linea alba length,\ncurvature assessed by the sagitta (the longest perpendicular segment between\nxipho-pubic line and the Linea alba), and continuous width along the height\nwere measured. Results: The Linea alba had a rhombus shape, with a maximum\nwidth at the umbilicus of 4.4$\\pm$1.9 cm and a larger width above the umbilicus\nthan below. Its length was 37.5$\\pm$3.6 cm, which increased with body mass\nindex (BMI) (p$\\leq$0.001), and was shorter in women (p$\\leq$0.001). The\nsagitta was 2.6$\\pm$2.2 cm, three times higher in the obese group\n(p$\\leq$0.001), majorated with age (p=0.009), but was independent of gender\n(p=0.212). Linea alba width increased with both age and BMI (p$\\leq$0.001,\np=0.002), being notably wider in women halfway between the umbilicus and pubis\n(p=0.007). Conclusion: This study provides an exhaustive 3D description of\nLinea alba's anatomical variability, presenting new considerations for\ncurvature.

In recent years, physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) have emerged as a novel methodology for addressing this\nproblem. Given their advantages in parallel computing, the potential for data\nassimilation and parameter calibration, and the rapid advancement of artificial\nintelligence, it is crucial to investigate both the capabilities and\nlimitations of PINNs. While current research has demonstrated the significant\npotential of PINNs, many aspects of this new approach remain to be explored. In\nthis study, we employ PINNs enhanced by dimensional transformation and N-LAAF\ntechniques to validate their effectiveness in solving two-dimensional free\nsurface flow with rainfall on terrain topography. The shallow water equations\nprimarily exist in two forms: the variables form and the conservative form.\nThrough theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate that a\nhybrid variable-conservation form offers superior performance. Additionally, we\nfind that incorporating the energy conservation law, specifically the entropy\ncondition, does not yield substantial improvements and may even lead to\ntraining failure. Furthermore, we have developed an open-source module on the\nPINNacle platform for solving shallow water equations using PINNs, which\nincludes over ten case studies and various equation forms, to promote research\nand application in this field.",

For\n2-dimensional RS codes, we provide a complete characterization of codes that\ncannot correct even a single insertion or deletion. Furthermore, we prove that\nfor sufficiently large field size~$q$, nearly all full-length $2$-dimensional\nRS codes can correct up to $(1 - \\delta)q$ insertion and deletion errors for\nany $0 < \\delta < 1$. Extending beyond the 2-dimensional case, we show that for\nany $k \\ge 2$, there exists a full-length $k$-dimensional RS code capable of\ncorrecting $q / (10k)$ insertion and deletion errors, provided $q$ is large\nenough.

However,\nspecializing systems is difficult because of three compounding challenges: i)\nspecialization for optimal performance requires in-depth compile-time changes;\nii) the right combination of specialization choices for optimal performance is\nhard to predict a priori; and iii) workloads and platform details often change\nonline. In practice, benefits of specialization are thus not attainable for\nmany low-level systems. To address this, we advocate for a radically different\napproach for performance-critical low-level systems: designing and implementing\nsystems with and for runtime code specialization. We leverage just-in-time\ncompilation to change systems code based on developer-specified specialization\npoints as the system runs. The JIT runtime automatically tries out\nspecialization choices and measures their impact on system performance, e.g.\nrequest latency or throughput, to guide the search. With Iridescent, our early\nprototype, we demonstrate that online specialization (i) is feasible even for\nlow-level systems code, such as network stacks, (ii) improves system\nperformance without the need for complex cost models, (iii) incurs low\ndeveloper effort, especially compared to manual exploration.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) suffers from severe performance degradation due to\nthe data heterogeneity among clients. Existing works reveal that the\nfundamental reason is that data heterogeneity can cause client drift where the\nlocal model update deviates from the global one, and thus they usually tackle\nthis problem from the perspective of calibrating the obtained local update.\nDespite effectiveness, existing methods substantially lack a deep understanding\nof how heterogeneous data samples contribute to the formation of client drift.\nIn this paper, we bridge this gap by identifying that the drift can be viewed\nas a cumulative manifestation of biases present in all local samples and the\nbias between samples is different. Besides, the bias dynamically changes as the\nFL training progresses. Motivated by this, we propose FedBSS that first\nmitigates the heterogeneity issue in a sample-level manner, orthogonal to\nexisting methods. Specifically, the core idea of our method is to adopt a\nbias-aware sample selection scheme that dynamically selects the samples from\nsmall biases to large epoch by epoch to train progressively the local model in\neach round. In order to ensure the stability of training, we set the\ndiversified knowledge acquisition stage as the warm-up stage to avoid the local\noptimality caused by knowledge deviation in the early stage of the model.\nEvaluation results show that FedBSS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. In\naddition, we also achieved effective results on feature distribution skew and\nnoise label dataset setting, which proves that FedBSS can not only reduce\nheterogeneity, but also has scalability and robustness.",

Its combination of combinatorial complexity and non-convex\nnonlinear constraints makes it particularly challenging. A common approach to\ntackle this issue is to relax the integrality condition, but this often results\nin infeasible solutions. Consequently, rounding heuristics are frequently\nemployed to restore integer feasibility. This paper addresses recent\nadvancements in heuristics aimed at quickly obtaining feasible solutions for\nthe UC-ACOPF problem, focusing specifically on direct relax-and-round\nstrategies. We propose a model-based heuristic that rescales the solution of\nthe integer-relaxed problem before rounding. Furthermore, we introduce rounding\nformulas designed to enforce combinatorial constraints and aim to maintain AC\nfeasibility in the resulting solutions. These methodologies are compared\nagainst standard direct rounding techniques in the literature, applied to a\n6-bus and a 118-bus test systems. Additionally, we integrate the proposed\nheuristics into an implementation of the Feasibility Pump (FP) method,\ndemonstrating their utility and potential to enhance existing rounding\nstrategies.",

Comparing Set Transformer to OASIS\nframework on Lotka Volterra for real-time local dynamical system identification\nand time series forecasting, we find that the Set Transformer architecture is\nwell adapted to learning relationships within data sets.

This strategy consequently assures\nartifacts-free, high-accuracy, and high-resolution quantitative phase\nreconstructions. This regime extends the single-shot lateral shearing digital\nholographic microscopy towards incoherent illumination, thus increasing the\nspace-time bandwidth product of the method. The practical common-path geometry\nalso provides enhanced vibration resistance, which is essential for consistent\ntime-lapse measurements. We verify the scalability and effectiveness of the\nmethod by investigating samples via multiple condenser-objective pairs,\nproviding a wide range of lateral resolutions and fields of view, thereby\nassuring its applicability for various microscope settings. We experimentally\nverify long-term phase stability and unprecedented phase-reconstruction\naccuracy. Finally, we use our method for investigation of biological samples,\nincluding cheek cells, diatoms, and yeast cells, highlighting its potential for\ndynamic label-free analysis at the organelle level.",

    "abstract": "The group recommendation (GR) aims to suggest items for a group of users in\nsocial networks. Existing work typically considers individual preferences as\nthe sole factor in aggregating group preferences. Actually, social influence is\nalso an important factor in modeling users' contributions to the final group\ndecision. However, existing methods either neglect the social influence of\nindividual members or bundle preferences and social influence together as a\nunified representation. As a result, these models emphasize the preferences of\nthe majority within the group rather than the actual interaction items, which\nwe refer to as the preference bias issue in GR. Moreover, the self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) strategies they designed to address the issue of group data\nsparsity fail to account for users' contextual social weights when regulating\ngroup representations, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle these issues,\nwe propose a novel model based on Disentangled Modeling of Preferences and\nSocial Influence for Group Recommendation (DisRec). Concretely, we first design\na user-level disentangling network to disentangle the preferences and social\ninfluence of group members with separate embedding propagation schemes based on\n(hyper)graph convolution networks. We then introduce a socialbased contrastive\nlearning strategy, selectively excluding user nodes based on their social\nimportance to enhance group representations and alleviate the group-level data\nsparsity issue. The experimental results demonstrate that our model\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two realworld datasets.",

This issue\nunderscores the urgent need for effective AI-generated video detectors to\nprevent the dissemination of false information through such videos. However,\nthe development of high-performance generative video detectors is currently\nimpeded by the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets specifically designed\nfor generative video detection. To this end, we introduce GenVidBench, a\nchallenging AI-generated video detection dataset with several key advantages:\n1) Cross Source and Cross Generator: The cross-generation source mitigates the\ninterference of video content on the detection. The cross-generator ensures\ndiversity in video attributes between the training and test sets, preventing\nthem from being overly similar. 2) State-of-the-Art Video Generators: The\ndataset includes videos from 8 state-of-the-art AI video generators, ensuring\nthat it covers the latest advancements in the field of video generation. 3)\nRich Semantics: The videos in GenVidBench are analyzed from multiple dimensions\nand classified into various semantic categories based on their content. This\nclassification ensures that the dataset is not only large but also diverse,\naiding in the development of more generalized and effective detection models.\nWe conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different advanced video generators\nand present a challenging setting. Additionally, we present rich experimental\nresults including advanced video classification models as baselines.

Efficient classification of drivers' behavior while driving, using\nonly the measurements of the sensors already incorporated in the vehicles and\nwithout the need to add extra hardware (smart phones, cameras, etc.), is a\nchallenge. The main advantage of using only the data center signals of modern\nvehicles is economical. The classification of the driving behavior and the\nwarning to the driver of dangerous behaviors without the need to add extra\nhardware (and their software) to the vehicle, would allow the direct\nintegration of these classifiers into the current vehicles without incurring a\ngreater cost in the manufacture of the vehicles and therefore be an added\nvalue. In this work, the classification is obtained based only on speed,\nacceleration and inertial measurements which are already present in many modern\nvehicles.

    "abstract": "The task of policy compliance detection (PCD) is to determine if a scenario\nis in compliance with respect to a set of written policies. In a conversational\nsetting, the results of PCD can indicate if clarifying questions must be asked\nto determine compliance status. Existing approaches usually claim to have\nreasoning capabilities that are latent or require a large amount of annotated\ndata. In this work, we propose logical decomposition for policy compliance\n(LDPC): a neuro-symbolic framework to detect policy compliance using large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in a few-shot setting. By selecting only a few exemplars\nalongside recently developed prompting techniques, we demonstrate that our\napproach soundly reasons about policy compliance conversations by extracting\nsub-questions to be answered, assigning truth values from contextual\ninformation, and explicitly producing a set of logic statements from the given\npolicies. The formulation of explicit logic graphs can in turn help answer\nPCDrelated questions with increased transparency and explainability. We apply\nthis approach to the popular PCD and conversational machine reading benchmark,\nShARC, and show competitive performance with no task-specific finetuning. We\nalso leverage the inherently interpretable architecture of LDPC to understand\nwhere errors occur, revealing ambiguities in the ShARC dataset and highlighting\nthe challenges involved with reasoning for conversational question answering.",

In this paper, we focus on partition and almost\ndisjoint properties of these notions. One of the most remarkable results with\nrespect to this topic is that in an infinite very weakly cancellative semigroup\nof size \\kappa, every central set can be split into \\kappa disjoint central\nsubsets. Moreover, if \\kappa contains \\lambda almost disjoint subsets, then\nevery central set contains a family of \\lambda almost disjoint central subsets.\nAnd many other combinatorial notions are found successively to have analogous\nproperties, among these are thick sets, piecewise syndetic sets, J-sets and\nC-sets. In this paper, we mainly study four other notions: IP sets,\ncombinatorially rich sets, Cp-sets and PP-rich sets. Where the latter two are\nknown in (N, +), related to the polynomial extension of the central sets\ntheorem. We lift them up to commutative cancellative semigroups and obtain an\nuncountable version of the polynomial extension of the central sets theorem\nincidentally.

Particularly, in a\nvehicular network with multiple vehicles and base stations (BSs), computing\ntasks of vehicles are offloaded via BSs to an edge server. Due to the random\nvelocities, the exact trajectories of vehicles cannot be predicted in advance.\nHence, instead of deterministic optimization, the cell association, uplink time\nand throughput allocation of multiple vehicles in a period of task offloading\nare formulated as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. In the proposed\nsolution framework, we first obtain a reference scheduling scheme of cell\nassociation, uplink time and throughput allocation via deterministic\noptimization at the very beginning. The reference scheduling scheme is then\nused to approximate the value functions of the Bellman's equations, and the\nactual scheduling action is determined in each time slot according to the\ncurrent system state and approximate value functions. Thus, the intensive\ncomputation for value iteration in the conventional solution is eliminated.\nMoreover, a non-trivial average cost upper bound is provided for the proposed\nsolution framework. In the simulation, the random trajectories of vehicles are\ngenerated from a high-fidelity traffic simulator. It is shown that the\nperformance gain of the proposed scheduling framework over the baselines is\nsignificant.",

    "abstract": "Recovering signals within limited dynamic range (DR) constraints remains a\ncentral challenge for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). To prevent data\nloss, an ADCs DR typically must exceed that of the input signal. Modulo\nsampling has recently gained attention as a promising approach for addressing\nDR limitations across various signal classes. However, existing methods often\nrely on ideal ADCs capable of capturing the high frequencies introduced by the\nmodulo operator, which is impractical in real-world hardware applications. This\npaper introduces an innovative hardware-based sampling approach that addresses\nthese high-frequency components using an analog mixer followed by a Low-Pass\nFilter (LPF). This allows the use of realistic ADCs, which do not need to\nhandle frequencies beyond the intended sampling rate. Our method eliminates the\nrequirement for high-specification ADCs and demonstrates that the resulting\nsamples are equivalent to those from an ideal high-spec ADC. Consequently, any\nexisting modulo recovery algorithm can be applied effectively. We present a\npractical hardware prototype of this approach, validated through both\nsimulations and hardware recovery experiments. Using a recovery method designed\nto handle quantization noise, we show that our approach effectively manages\nhigh-frequency artifacts, enabling reliable modulo recovery with realistic\nADCs.

The method is based on the density-functional-theory\ncalculation under two different constraints: one constraint governs the change\nof the magnetization with respect to the ground state, and the other is the\nsymmetry constraint responsible for the value of the magnon wave vector. The\nperformance of the method is demonstrated by the application to an altermagnet\nMnTe. An important role in both the formulation and the application of the\nmethod play the aspects of generalized symmetry described by the spin-space\ngroups. The symmetry analysis connects in one coherent picture the following\nthree parts of the consideration: (i) the generalized translational symmetry of\nthe magnons as a crucial condition for their efficient ab-initio calculation,\n(ii) altermagnetic spin-splitting of the electron states in the ground magnetic\nstate, and (iii) chirality splitting of the magnon excitations. It is\ndemonstrated that both the spin splitting of the electron states and the\nchirality splitting of the magnons have identical patterns in the corresponding\nwave vector spaces. Since the altermagnetism of MnTe is the consequence of the\npresence of the Te atoms, an adequate attention is devoted to the symmetry\nanalysis and calculation results for the Te moments induced in the magnon\nstates. The knowledge of the symmetry properties of the Te moments allows to\naccelerate the numerical convergence of the magnon states and serves as a test\nfor the accuracy of the calculations. To expose the connection between electron\nband structures of the magnon states of the system and the chirality properties\nof these states we investigate the transformation of the electron structure in\nthe transition from the collinear ground state to a noncollinear magnon state.",

Based on\nthis discovery, we propose StyleSSP, which focuses on obtaining a better\nstartpoint to address layout changes of original content and content leakage\nfrom style image. StyleSSP comprises two key components: (1) Frequency\nManipulation: To improve content preservation, we reduce the low-frequency\ncomponents of the DDIM latent, allowing the sampling stage to pay more\nattention to the layout of content images; and (2) Negative Guidance via\nInversion: To mitigate the content leakage from style image, we employ negative\nguidance in the inversion stage to ensure that the startpoint of the sampling\nstage is distanced from the content of style image.

    "abstract": "Recently, researchers have proposed many deep generative models, including\ngenerative adversarial networks(GANs) and denoising diffusion models. Although\nsignificant breakthroughs have been made and empirical success has been\nachieved with the GAN, its mathematical underpinnings remain relatively\nunknown. This paper focuses on a rigorous mathematical theoretical framework:\nthe composite-functional-gradient GAN (CFG)[1]. Specifically, we reveal the\ntheoretical connection between the CFG model and score-based models. We find\nthat the training objective of the CFG discriminator is equivalent to finding\nan optimal D(x). The optimal gradient of D(x) differentiates the integral of\nthe differences between the score functions of real and synthesized samples.\nConversely, training the CFG generator involves finding an optimal G(x) that\nminimizes this difference. In this paper, we aim to derive an annealed weight\npreceding the weight of the CFG discriminator. This new explicit theoretical\nexplanation model is called the annealed CFG method. To overcome the limitation\nof the annealed CFG method, as the method is not readily applicable to the SOTA\nGAN model, we propose a nested annealed training scheme (NATS). This scheme\nkeeps the annealed weight from the CFG method and can be seamlessly adapted to\nvarious GAN models, no matter their structural, loss, or regularization\ndifferences. We conduct thorough experimental evaluations on various benchmark\ndatasets for image generation. The results show that our annealed CFG and NATS\nmethods significantly improve the quality and diversity of the synthesized\nsamples.

In this study, we derive a\npower-efficiency trade-off relation for a paradigmatic quantum engine operating\nwithin a finite time, specifically the Otto cycle of a quantum harmonic\noscillator.

Our results\nreveal that the power of the quantum engine vanishes as the efficiency\napproaches the quantum mechanical efficiency bound, which is stricter than the\nCarnot bound. Furthermore, we identify the conditions under which the upper\nbound is attained, which indicate maximum power is achieved when the generation\nof quantum coherence is reduced, and the difference in time durations of the\nisochoric processes increases.

However, given differences in the\ndynamics of individual diseases, it is unlikely that any single forecasting\nmodel would accurately account for each disease and for all time, leading to\nsignificant forecast model uncertainty. Yet, forecasting models for ED\nadmissions to-date do not explore the utility of forecast combinations to\nimprove forecast accuracy and stability. It is also unknown whether\nimprovements in forecast accuracy can be yield from (1) incorporating a large\nnumber of environmental and anthropogenic covariates or (2) forecasting total\nED causes by aggregating cause-specific ED forecasts. To address this gap, we\npropose high-dimensional forecast combination schemes to combine a large number\nof forecasting individual models for forecasting cause-specific ED admissions\nover multiple causes and forecast horizons. We use time series data of ED\nadmissions with an extensive set of explanatory lagged variables at the\nnational level, including meteorological/ambient air pollutant variables and ED\nadmissions of all 16 causes studied. We show that the simple forecast\ncombinations yield forecast accuracies of around 3.81%-23.54% across causes.\nFurthermore, forecast combinations outperform individual forecasting models, in\nmore than 50% of scenarios (across all ED admission categories and horizons) in\na statistically significant manner. Inclusion of high-dimensional covariates\nand aggregating cause-specific forecasts to provide all-cause ED forecasts\nprovided modest improvements in forecast accuracy.

Despite its simplicity and computational\nefficiency, CAM often struggles to identify discriminative regions that\ndistinguish visually similar fine-grained classes. Prior efforts address this\nlimitation by introducing more sophisticated explanation processes, but at the\ncost of extra complexity. In this paper, we propose Finer-CAM, a method that\nretains CAM's efficiency while achieving precise localization of discriminative\nregions. Our key insight is that the deficiency of CAM lies not in \"how\" it\nexplains, but in \"what\" it explains. Specifically, previous methods attempt to\nidentify all cues contributing to the target class's logit value, which\ninadvertently also activates regions predictive of visually similar classes. By\nexplicitly comparing the target class with similar classes and spotting their\ndifferences, Finer-CAM suppresses features shared with other classes and\nemphasizes the unique, discriminative details of the target class. Finer-CAM is\neasy to implement, compatible with various CAM methods, and can be extended to\nmulti-modal models for accurate localization of specific concepts.\nAdditionally, Finer-CAM allows adjustable comparison strength, enabling users\nto selectively highlight coarse object contours or fine discriminative details.\nQuantitatively, we show that masking out the top 5% of activated pixels by\nFiner-CAM results in a larger relative confidence drop compared to baselines.\nThe source code and demo are available at\nhttps://github.com/Imageomics/Finer-CAM.",

We address the problem of minimizing time slots needed for\nWTSN transmissions while ensuring reliability subject to interference\nconstraints -- an NP-hard task. Existing semidefinite programming (SDP) methods\ncan relax and solve the problem but suffer from high polynomial complexity. We\npropose a sparse interference graph-aided SDP (SIG-SDP) framework that exploits\nthe interference's sparsity arising from attenuated signals between distant\nuser pairs. First, the framework utilizes the sparsity to establish the upper\nand lower bounds of the minimum number of slots and uses binary search to\nlocate the minimum within the bounds. Here, for each searched slot number, the\nframework optimizes a positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix indicating how likely\nuser pairs share the same slot, and the constraint feasibility with the\noptimized PSD matrix further refines the slot search range. Second, the\nframework designs a matrix multiplicative weights (MMW) algorithm that\naccelerates the optimization, achieved by only sparsely adjusting interfering\nuser pairs' elements in the PSD matrix while skipping the non-interfering\npairs.

    "abstract": "Urban time series, such as mobility flows, energy consumption, and pollution\nrecords, encapsulate complex urban dynamics and structures. However, data\ncollection in each city is impeded by technical challenges such as budget\nlimitations and sensor failures, necessitating effective data imputation\ntechniques that can enhance data quality and reliability. Existing imputation\nmodels, categorized into learning-based and analytics-based paradigms, grapple\nwith the trade-off between capacity and generalizability. Collaborative\nlearning to reconstruct data across multiple cities holds the promise of\nbreaking this trade-off. Nevertheless, urban data's inherent irregularity and\nheterogeneity issues exacerbate challenges of knowledge sharing and\ncollaboration across cities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\ncollaborative imputation paradigm leveraging meta-learned implicit neural\nrepresentations (INRs). INRs offer a continuous mapping from domain coordinates\nto target values, integrating the strengths of both paradigms. By imposing\nembedding theory, we first employ continuous parameterization to handle\nirregularity and reconstruct the dynamical system. We then introduce a\ncross-city collaborative learning scheme through model-agnostic meta learning,\nincorporating hierarchical modulation and normalization techniques to\naccommodate multiscale representations and reduce variance in response to\nheterogeneity. Extensive experiments on a diverse urban dataset from 20 global\ncities demonstrate our model's superior imputation performance and\ngeneralizability, underscoring the effectiveness of collaborative imputation in\nresource-constrained settings.",

While these methods demonstrate promising performance\nfor single-modality image matching, they often struggle with multimodal data\nbecause the descriptors trained on single-modality data tend to lack robustness\nagainst the non-linear variations present in multimodal data. Extending such\nmethods to multimodal image matching often requires well-aligned multimodal\ndata to learn modality-invariant descriptors. However, acquiring such data is\noften costly and impractical in many real-world scenarios. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a modality-invariant feature learning network (MIFNet) to\ncompute modality-invariant features for keypoint descriptions in multimodal\nimage matching using only single-modality training data. Specifically, we\npropose a novel latent feature aggregation module and a cumulative hybrid\naggregation module to enhance the base keypoint descriptors trained on\nsingle-modality data by leveraging pre-trained features from Stable Diffusion\nmodels. %, our approach generates robust and invariant features across diverse\nand unknown modalities. We validate our method with recent keypoint detection\nand description methods in three multimodal retinal image datasets (CF-FA,\nCF-OCT, EMA-OCTA) and two remote sensing datasets (Optical-SAR and\nOptical-NIR). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIFNet is\nable to learn modality-invariant feature for multimodal image matching without\naccessing the targeted modality and has good zero-shot generalization ability.\nThe code will be released at https://github.com/lyp-deeplearning/MIFNet.",

The\nobserved $H_3^+$ and $H_2$ emission-line spectra probe Uranus' ionosphere and\nthermosphere, respectively. Previous observations have shown that the cooling\nhas continued well past the 2007 vernal equinox, when the seasonal solar\nforcing turned positive, resulting in net heating of the IAU northern\nhemisphere. Most of them, especially for $H_2$, were obtained at moderate\nspectral resolution, R ~1000 to 3000, which admits more sky background, with\nits associated noise, per spectral resolution element relative to spectrographs\nhaving higher spectral resolution. We report the first instance of high\nspectral resolution being used to observe Uranus' fundamental-band,\nrovibrational quadrupole $H_2$ emission spectrum; where the sky background is\nsuppressed and narrow planetary emission lines stand out against the planetary\ncontinuum. The IGRINS spectrograph with spectral resolution R ~45,000 was used\nto observe Uranus in the K-band on Oct 26 & 27, 2018 at the Lowell Discovery\nTelescope, and on Nov 27, 2023 at Gemini South.

The consecutive-nights at elevated\ntemperature observed at the Discovery Telescope suggest that Uranus' near-IR\n$H_2$ aurora was detected over each of the northern and southern magnetic\npoles, respectively.

This paper presents a Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) based alignment framework that achieves better\noverall performance by addressing this ethical-utility trade-off, using\nchemical domain applications as a proof-of-concept. Our alignment pipeline\nstarts with a GPT-assisted three-phase data generation scheme, in which we\ncreate LibraChemQA, a chemical question-answering dataset comprising 31.6k\ntriplet instances. By incorporating an innovative balanced seed in the data\ngeneration process, our framework systematically considers both legitimate and\nillegitimate requests. The framework also introduces a rephrasing mechanism for\nefficient data augmentation that enhances the model's chemical comprehension.\nWe further develop a novel hybrid evaluation scheme with LLM judges for precise\nassessment of both safety and utility. Experimental results demonstrate our\nmodel's substantial improvements in overall performance where both safety and\nutility are considered - the resulting model outperforms leading LLMs including\nClaude-3, GPT-4o, and LLaMA-3 by margins of 13.44%, 7.16%, and 7.10%\nrespectively on our released benchmark.

We will then\npresent a straightforward procedure for introducing complex scaling in the\nno-core shell model in order to calculate nuclear resonance states. For that\nmatter, the complex-scaled two-body matrix elements must firstly be determined,\nand the resulting many-body Hamiltonian complex symmetric matrix must be\ndiagonalized afterwards. Applications pertain to the bound ground states of the\nlightest nuclei $^2$H, $^3$H, $^3$He, and $^4$He, as well as the resonance\nground states of $^5$He and $^5$Li, whereby the realistic interaction Daejeon16\nis utilized.",

    "abstract": "Bluebottles (\\textit{Physalia} spp.) are marine stingers resembling\njellyfish, whose presence on Australian beaches poses a significant public risk\ndue to their venomous nature. Understanding the environmental factors driving\nbluebottles ashore is crucial for mitigating their impact, and machine learning\ntools are to date relatively unexplored. We use bluebottle marine stinger\npresence/absence data from beaches in Eastern Sydney, Australia, and compare\nmachine learning models (Multilayer Perceptron, Random Forest, and XGBoost) to\nidentify factors influencing their presence. We address challenges such as\nclass imbalance, class overlap, and unreliable absence data by employing data\naugmentation techniques, including the Synthetic Minority Oversampling\nTechnique (SMOTE), Random Undersampling, and Synthetic Negative Approach that\nexcludes the negative class. Our results show that SMOTE failed to resolve\nclass overlap, but the presence-focused approach effectively handled imbalance,\nclass overlap, and ambiguous absence data. The data attributes such as the wind\ndirection, which is a circular variable, emerged as a key factor influencing\nbluebottle presence, confirming previous inference studies. However, in the\nabsence of population dynamics, biological behaviours, and life cycles, the\nbest predictive model appears to be Random Forests combined with Synthetic\nNegative Approach. This research contributes to mitigating the risks posed by\nbluebottles to beachgoers and provides insights into handling class overlap and\nunreliable negative class in environmental modelling.",

Current methods often use graph neural networks to\nmodel dialogue context, capturing structural dynamics but heavily relying on\nannotated graph structures and overlooking individual speaking styles. To\naddress these challenges, we propose CMR, a Contrastive learning-based\nMulti-party dialogue Response generation framework.

In this study, we conducted a series of\nexperiments to evaluate the effect of Muse cells on neuropathic pain.

Immunohistochemical analysis and qPCR revealed the ability of Muse cells\nto inhibit spinal cord neuroinflammation caused by SNI. In addition, Transwell\nand ELISA revealed that Muse cells migrated through the injured dorsal root\nganglion (DRG) via the CCR7-CCL21 chemotactic axis.

To date, ultrafast spin transfer has predominantly been explained in\nterms of the initial and final states available for laser excitation. Here, by\ncomparing the measured and calculated dynamics across the entire $M$-edges of\ntwo very similar Heusler compounds, $Co_2MnGa$ and $Co_2MnGe$ as well as a\nsample of elemental Co, we find that simply accounting for the initial and\nfinal electron states available for laser excitation cannot alone explain the\nexperimental observations. The influence of spin lifetimes must also be\nincluded, due to the shifting of the Fermi level upon replacing Ga with Ge, or\nthe presence of crystalline disorder. This explains why the ordered $L2_1$\nphase of $Co_2MnGa$ demonstrates strong laser-induced magnetic signal\nenhancements across the entire Co-edge, while similar enhancements were not\nobserved in partially disordered $Co_2MnGe$. Although intra-site spin-transfers\nwere expected in the minority channel in pure Co due to the presence of many\nmore available states in the minority channel above the Fermi level, no such\nsignal was observed due to very short few-femtosecond spin lifetimes in a\nmetal. Finally, we identify key regions in the magnetic asymmetry where a\ntransiently enhanced signal could be misinterpreted as a light-induced\nspin-transfer signature.",

A graph $G$ is\nsaid to be $3$-sparse if every edge in $G$ is incident on at least one vertex\nof degree at most $3$. We prove the conjecture for the class of $3$-sparse\ngraphs. Further, we give a stronger bound of $\\Delta +1$, if there exists an\nedge $xy$ in the graph with $d_G(x)+ d_G(y) < \\Delta+3$. When $ \\Delta > 3$,\nthe $3$-sparse graphs where no such edge exists is the set of bipartite graphs\nwhere one partition has vertices with degree exactly $3$ and the other\npartition has vertices with degree exactly $\\Delta$.",

Although the\nempirical Bayes approach enables us to estimate the regularization parameter,\nlittle is known on the properties of the estimators. In particular, many\naspects regarding the specific conditions under which the mechanism of\nautomatic relevance determination (ARD) occurs remain unexplained. In this\npaper, we derive the empirical Bayes estimators for the group lasso regularized\nlinear regression models with limited parameters. It is shown that the\nestimators diverge under a specific condition, giving rise to the ARD\nmechanism. We also prove that empirical Bayes methods can produce the ARD\nmechanism in general regularized linear regression models and clarify the\nconditions under which models such as ridge, lasso, and group lasso can do so.",

The\nsimulations are performed at a single lattice spacing and pion mass, both fixed\nfor all $N_f$. Visualizations of the center vortex structure in\nthree-dimensional slices of the lattice reveal a growing roughness in the\nvortex matter as a function of $N_f$, embodied by an increase in the density of\nvortex matter in the percolating cluster and a simultaneous reduction in\nsecondary clusters disconnected from the percolating cluster in 3D slices. This\nis quantified by various bulk properties, including the vortex and branching\npoint densities. A correlation of the vortex structure reveals a turning point\nnear $N_f \\simeq 5$ past which a randomness in the vortex field becomes the\ndominant aspect of its evolution with $N_f$. As a byproduct, extrapolations to\nthe vortex content of a uniform-random gauge field provide a critical point at\nwhich there must be a drastic shift in vacuum field structure.

    "abstract": "Upcoming Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) systems require high\ndata rates ($\\geq$ 500 Mbps) and low power consumption for seamless experience.\nWith an increasing number of subscribing users, the total number of antennas\nacross all transmitting users far exceeds the number of antennas at the access\npoint (AP). This results in a low rank wireless channel, presenting a\nbottleneck for uplink communication systems. The current uplink systems that\nuse orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and the proposed non-orthogonal multiple\naccess (NOMA), fail to achieve the required data rates / power consumption\nunder predominantly low rank channel scenarios. This paper introduces an\noptimal power sub carrier allocation algorithm for multi-carrier NOMA, named\nminPMAC, and an associated time-sharing algorithm that adaptively changes\nsuccessive interference cancellation decoding orders to maximize sum data rates\nin these low rank channels. This Lagrangian based optimization technique,\nalthough globally optimum, is prohibitive in terms of runtime, proving\ninefficient for real-time scenarios. Hence, we propose a novel near-optimal\ndeep reinforcement learning-based energy sum optimization (DRL-minPMAC) which\nachieves real-time efficiency. Extensive experimental evaluations show that\nminPMAC achieves 28\\% and 39\\% higher data rates than NOMA and OMA baselines.\nFurthermore, the proposed DRL-minPMAC runs ~5 times faster than minPMAC and\nachieves 83\\% of the global optimum data rates in real time",

    "abstract": "Quantum two-level systems (TLSs) commonly found at low temperature in\namorphous and disordered materials are responsible for decoherence in\nsuperconducting Josephson junction qubits particularly because they absorb\nenergy of coherent qubit oscillations in the microwave frequency range. In\nplanar Josephson resonators with oxide interfaces this absorption is\ncharacterized by an anomalously weak loss tangent dependence on the field in\nthe non-linear regime that conflicts with the theoretical expectations and the\nobservations in amorphous dielectrics. It was recently suggested that this\nanomalous absorption is due to TLS dynamic interactions. Here we show that such\ninteractions cannot lead to the observed loss-tangent field dependence and\nsuggest the alternative explanation assuming that TLS dipole moments $p$ are\ndistributed according to the specific power law $P(p) \\propto 1/p^{3-\\eta}$\n($0\\leq \\eta <1$). This assumption, indeed, results in the observed loss\ntangent behavior. The hypothesis of a power law distribution is supported both\nby the recent measurements of individual TLS dipole moments and the theoretical\nmodel of TLS formation due to the long-range dipole-dipole interaction, thus\nconnecting the anomalous absorption with the possible solution of the\nlong-standing problem of the nature of TLSs.",

To\naddress this demand, 5G-Advanced has introduced sidelink communication over the\nunlicensed spectrum (SL-U) to increase data rates. However, the primary\nchallenge of SL-U in the unlicensed spectrum is ensuring fair coexistence with\nother incumbent systems, such as Wi-Fi. In this paper, we address the challenge\nby designing channel access mechanisms and power control strategies to mitigate\ninterference and ensure fair coexistence. First, we propose a novel\ncollaborative channel access (CCHA) mechanism that integrates channel access\nwith resource allocation through collaborative interactions between base\nstations (BS) and SL-U users. This mechanism ensures fair coexistence with\nincumbent systems while improving resource utilization. Second, to further\nenhance the performance of the coexistence system, we develop a cooperative\nsubgoal-based hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (C-GHDRL) algorithm\nframework. The framework enables SL-U users to make globally optimal decisions\nby leveraging cooperative operations between the BS and SL-U users, effectively\novercoming the limitations of traditional optimization methods in solving joint\noptimization problems with nonlinear constraints. Finally, we mathematically\nmodel the joint channel access and power control problem and balance the\ntrade-off between fairness and transmission rate in the coexistence system by\ndefining a suitable reward function in the C-GHDRL algorithm. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly enhances the\nperformance of the coexistence system while ensuring fair coexistence between\nSL-U and Wi-Fi users.",

    "abstract": "The pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has become prominent in transfer\nlearning. For example, if the model is pre-trained on ImageNet and then\nfine-tuned to PASCAL, it can significantly outperform that trained on PASCAL\nfrom scratch. While ImageNet pre-training has shown enormous success, it is\nformed in 2D, and the learned features are for classification tasks; when\ntransferring to more diverse tasks, like 3D image segmentation, its performance\nis inevitably compromised due to the deviation from the original ImageNet\ncontext. A significant challenge lies in the lack of large, annotated 3D\ndatasets rivaling the scale of ImageNet for model pre-training. To overcome\nthis challenge, we make two contributions. Firstly, we construct AbdomenAtlas\n1.1 that comprises 9,262 three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) volumes\nwith high-quality, per-voxel annotations of 25 anatomical structures and pseudo\nannotations of seven tumor types. Secondly, we develop a suite of models that\nare pre-trained on our AbdomenAtlas 1.1 for transfer learning. Our preliminary\nanalyses indicate that the model trained only with 21 CT volumes, 672 masks,\nand 40 GPU hours has a transfer learning ability similar to the model trained\nwith 5,050 (unlabeled) CT volumes and 1,152 GPU hours. More importantly, the\ntransfer learning ability of supervised models can further scale up with larger\nannotated datasets, achieving significantly better performance than preexisting\npre-trained models, irrespective of their pre-training methodologies or data\nsources. We hope this study can facilitate collective efforts in constructing\nlarger 3D medical datasets and more releases of supervised pre-trained models.",

Such bugs are severe,\nbecause they can easily be overlooked by both developers and users, and can\ncause applications that rely on the DBMSs to malfunction. In this work, we\npropose Constant-Optimization-Driven Database Testing (CODDTest) as a novel\napproach for detecting logic bugs in DBMSs. This method draws inspiration from\ntwo well-known optimizations in compilers: constant folding and constant\npropagation. Our key insight is that for a certain database state and query\ncontaining a predicate, we can apply constant folding on the predicate by\nreplacing an expression in the predicate with a constant, anticipating that the\nresults of this predicate remain unchanged; any discrepancy indicates a bug in\nthe DBMS. We evaluated CODDTest on five mature and extensively-tested\nDBMSs-SQLite, MySQL, CockroachDB, DuckDB, and TiDB-and found 45 unique,\npreviously unknown bugs in them. Out of these, 24 are unique logic bugs. Our\nmanual analysis of the state-of-the-art approaches indicates that 11 logic bugs\nare detectable only by CODDTest.

Here, we realize a\ntime-reversal symmetric two-dimensional PTAI on silicon platform within the\nnear-IR wavelength range, taking the advantageous valley degree of freedom of\nphotonic crystal. A low-threshold topological Anderson phase transition is\nobserved by applying disorder to the critical topologically trivial phase.\nConversely, we have also realized extremely robust topologically protected edge\nstates based on the stable topological phase. Both two phenomena are validated\nthrough theoretical Dirac Hamiltonian analysis, numerical simulations, and\nexperimental measurements. Our proposed structure holds promise to achieve\nnear-zero topological phase transition thresholds, which breaks the\nconventional cognition that strong disorder is required to induce the phase\ntransition. It significantly alleviates the difficulty of manipulating disorder\nand could be extended to other systems, such as condensed matter systems where\nstrong disorder is hard to implement.

This cluster-specific tuning process results in a set of\ngeneralized parameters for instances belonging to each class. In the execution\nstep, features are extracted from an unknown instance to determine its cluster,\nand the corresponding pre-tuned parameters are applied. Generally, the running\ntime of a solver is evaluated by the time to solution ($TTS$). However, methods\nlike ISAC require preprocessing. Therefore, the total execution time is\n$T_{tot}=TTS+T_{tune}$, where $T_{tune}$ represents the tuning time. While the\ngoal is to minimize $T_{tot}$, it is important to note that extracting features\nin the ISAC method requires a certain amount of computational time. The\nextracting features include summary statistics of the solver execution logs,\nwhich takes several 10 seconds. This research presents a method to\nsignificantly reduce the time of the ISAC execution step by streamlining\nfeature extraction and class determination with a graph neural network.\nExperimental results show that $T_{tune}$ in the execution step, which take\nseveral 10 seconds in the original ISAC manner, could be reduced to\nsub-seconds.",

Both armchair and zigzag\n$P_2C_3$NTs are stable at room temperature and display a degenerate combination\nof Dirac points and electronic flat bands at the Fermi level. Notably, these\nflat bands are highly resilient to elastic deformations. Large strains can\ntransform the nanotube structure from honeycomb-kagome to ``brick-wall'', and\ntrigger multiple quantum phase transitions. Edge states in $P_2C_3$NTs,\nspin-degeneracy lifting induced by vacancies and dopants, and strain-tunable\nmagnetism are also discussed.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nLipschitz-constrained Functional Gradient GANs learning (Li-CFG) method to\nstabilize the training of GAN and provide a theoretical foundation for\neffectively increasing the diversity of synthetic samples by reducing the\nneighborhood size of the latent vector.

To efficiently enlarge the norm of the discriminator gradient, we\nintroduce a novel {\\epsilon}-centered gradient penalty that amplifies the norm\nof the discriminator gradient using the hyper-parameter {\\epsilon}. In\ncomparison to other constraints, our method enlarging the discriminator norm,\nthus obtaining the smallest neighborhood size of the latent vector.

    "abstract": "Threshold fully homomorphic encryption (ThFHE) enables multiple parties to\ncompute functions over their sensitive data without leaking data privacy. Most\nof existing ThFHE schemes are restricted to full threshold and require the\nparticipation of \\textit{all} parties to output computing results. Compared\nwith these full-threshold schemes, arbitrary threshold (ATh)-FHE schemes are\nrobust to non-participants and can be a promising solution to many real-world\napplications. However, existing AThFHE schemes are either inefficient to be\napplied with a large number of parties $N$ and a large data size $K$, or\ninsufficient to tolerate all types of non-participants. In this paper, we\npropose an AThFHE scheme to handle all types of non-participants with lower\ncomplexity over existing schemes. At the core of our scheme is the reduction\nfrom AThFHE construction to the design of a new primitive called\n\\textit{approximate secret sharing} (ApproxSS). Particularly, we formulate\nApproxSS and prove the correctness and security of AThFHE on top of\narbitrary-threshold (ATh)-ApproxSS's properties. Such a reduction reveals that\nexisting AThFHE schemes implicitly design ATh-ApproxSS following a similar idea\ncalled ``noisy share''. Nonetheless, their ATh-ApproxSS design has high\ncomplexity and become the performance bottleneck. By developing ATASSES, an\nATh-ApproxSS scheme based on a novel ``encrypted share'' idea, we reduce the\ncomputation (resp. communication) complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2K)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^2+K)$ (resp. from $\\mathcal{O}(NK)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N+K)$). We\nnot only theoretically prove the (approximate) correctness and security of\nATASSES, but also empirically evaluate its efficiency against existing\nbaselines. Particularly, when applying to a system with one thousand parties,\nATASSES achieves a speedup of $3.83\\times$ -- $15.4\\times$ over baselines.",

Despite attempts to enrich disease descriptions\nwith large language models, the lack of class-specific knowledge often leads to\npoor performance. In addition, empirical evidence suggests that existing proxy\nlearning methods for zero-shot image classification on natural image datasets\nexhibit instability when applied to medical datasets. To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce the Knowledge Proxy Learning (KPL) to mine knowledge\nfrom CLIP. KPL is designed to leverage CLIP's multimodal understandings for\nmedical image classification through Text Proxy Optimization and Multimodal\nProxy Learning. Specifically, KPL retrieves image-relevant knowledge\ndescriptions from the constructed knowledge-enhanced base to enrich semantic\ntext proxies. It then harnesses input images and these descriptions, encoded\nvia CLIP, to stably generate multimodal proxies that boost the zero-shot\nclassification performance.

    "abstract": "Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models\n(LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Alibaba's QwQ, have\nredefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending LLMs with advanced\nreasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex\narchitectures - uniquely combining reinforcement learning (RL), search\nheuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To\naddress these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM\ncomponents into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM\nworks. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees,\ngraphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search,\nBeam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision\nschemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related\nconcepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent\ntools). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic\nspecifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like\nLLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases,\nwe demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To\nillustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM\nprototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide\nkey insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the\nimportance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM\ncloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM\necosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced\nreasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap\nbetween \"rich AI\" and \"poor AI\" by lowering barriers to RLM design and\nexperimentation.",

Zero-determinant strategies\ncontrol payoffs of players by unilaterally enforcing linear relations between\npayoffs. There are many attempts to extend zero-determinant strategies so as to\napply them to broader situations.

    "abstract": "When machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to automate human-related\ndecisions, human agents may gain knowledge of the decision policy and behave\nstrategically to obtain desirable outcomes. Strategic Classification (SC) has\nbeen proposed to address the interplay between agents and decision-makers.\nPrior work on SC has relied on assumptions that agents are perfectly or\napproximately rational, responding to decision policies by maximizing their\nutilities. Verifying these assumptions is challenging due to the difficulty of\ncollecting real-world agent responses. Meanwhile, the growing adoption of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) makes it increasingly likely that human agents in SC\nsettings will seek advice from these tools. We propose using strategic advice\ngenerated by LLMs to simulate human agent responses in SC. Specifically, we\nexamine five critical SC scenarios -- hiring, loan applications, school\nadmissions, personal income, and public assistance programs -- and simulate how\nhuman agents with diverse profiles seek advice from LLMs. We then compare the\nresulting agent responses with the best responses generated by existing\ntheoretical models. Our findings reveal that: (i) LLMs and theoretical models\ngenerally lead to agent score or qualification changes in the same direction\nacross most settings, with both achieving similar levels of fairness; (ii)\nstate-of-the-art commercial LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4) consistently provide\nhelpful suggestions, though these suggestions typically do not result in\nmaximal score or qualification improvements; and (iii) LLMs tend to produce\nmore diverse agent responses, often favoring more balanced effort allocation\nstrategies. These results suggest that theoretical models align with LLMs to\nsome extent and that leveraging LLMs to simulate more realistic agent responses\noffers a promising approach to designing trustworthy ML systems.",

However,\nexisting Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) often rely solely on\naccuracy, overlooking spatial and demographic disparities in their predictions.\nThis oversight can lead to imbalanced resource allocation and exacerbate\nexisting inequities in urban areas. This study introduces a Residual-Aware\nAttention (RAA) Block and an equality-enhancing loss function to address these\ndisparities. By adapting the adjacency matrix during training and incorporating\nspatial disparity metrics, our approach aims to reduce local segregation of\nresiduals and errors. We applied our methodology to urban prediction tasks in\nChicago, utilizing a travel demand dataset as an example. Our model achieved a\n48% significant improvement in fairness metrics with only a 9% increase in\nerror metrics. Spatial analysis of residual distributions revealed that models\nwith RAA Blocks produced more equitable prediction results, particularly by\nreducing errors clustered in central regions. Attention maps demonstrated the\nmodel's ability to dynamically adjust focus, leading to more balanced\npredictions. Case studies of various community areas in Chicago further\nillustrated the effectiveness of our approach in addressing spatial and\ndemographic disparities, supporting more balanced and equitable urban planning\nand policy-making.",

We\nadapt these characteristics to a quantized diffusion model and reveal that the\nmajority of these differences can be represented with reduced bit-width, and\neven zero. Based on our observations, we propose the Ditto algorithm, a\ndifference processing algorithm that leverages temporal similarity with\nquantization to enhance the efficiency of diffusion models.

    "abstract": "Tracing the cosmic path of galaxies requires an understanding of their\nchemical enrichment and merging histories. One of the most important\nconstraints is the internal structure of galaxies, notably the internal\ndistribution of elements acting as fossils in extra-galactic archaeology. Using\nour cosmological chemodynamical simulations, which include all relevant\nphysical processes and the latest nucleosynthesis yields, we investigate the\nevolution of radial metallicity gradients of stellar populations and the\ninterstellar medium within each galaxy. This work explores the role of\nsupernova feedback on the metallicity gradients by comparing three feedback\nmodels, ejecting energy in thermal, stochastic and mechanical forms. At $z=0$,\nthe mechanical feedback model produces the gradient--mass relations of stars\nand gas both in excellent agreement with observations; gradients are the\nsteepest at intermediate-mass ($M_*\\sim10^{10}M_\\odot$) and become flatter in\nmassive galaxies probably by major mergers. For each model, we predict similar\ngradient--mass relations up to $z=4$ and find that the mechanical feedback\nmodel gives flatter gradients of both stars and gas for lower-mass galaxies\n($M_*<10^{10}M_\\odot$) possibly due to the suppression of star formation and\nmetal ejection by stellar feedback. With all feedback models, most galaxies\nhave negative gas-phase metallicity gradients up to $z=5$, suggesting an\ninside-out growth, which is consistent with other cosmological simulations but\nnot with recent observations at $z\\sim1$--2.5. We find a mild redshift\nevolution of gradients up to $z=4$, while there seems to be an evolutionary\ntransition at $z=5$ where the metallicity gradients become steep for gas and\nstars.",

Such models often couple environmental semantic and\ngeometric properties. As a result, semantic variables are interconnected,\ncausing semantic state space dimensionality to increase exponentially. In this\npaper, we consider planning under uncertainty using partially observable Markov\ndecision processes (POMDPs) with hybrid semantic-geometric beliefs. The models\nand priors consider the coupling between semantic and geometric variables.\nWithin POMDP, we introduce the concept of semantically aware safety. Obtaining\nrepresentative samples of the theoretical hybrid belief, required for\nestimating the value function, is very challenging. As a key contribution, we\ndevelop a novel form of the hybrid belief and leverage it to sample\nrepresentative samples. We show that under certain conditions, the value\nfunction and probability of safety can be calculated efficiently with an\nexplicit expectation over all possible semantic mappings. Our simulations show\nthat our estimates of the objective function and probability of safety achieve\nsimilar levels of accuracy compared to estimators that run exhaustively on the\nentire semantic state-space using samples from the theoretical hybrid belief.\nNevertheless, the complexity of our estimators is polynomial rather than\nexponential.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of cognition is frequently discussed as the evolution of\ncognitive abilities or the evolution of some neuronal structures in the brain.\nHowever, since such traits or abilities are often highly complex, understanding\ntheir evolution requires explaining how they could have gradually evolved\nthrough selection acting on heritable variations in simpler cognitive\nmechanisms. With this in mind, making use of a previously proposed theory, here\nwe show how the evolution of cognitive abilities can be captured by the\nfine-tuning of basic learning mechanisms and, in particular, chunking\nmechanisms. We use the term chunking broadly for all types of non-elemental\nlearning, claiming that the process by which elements are combined into chunks\nand associated with other chunks, or elements, is critical for what the brain\ncan do, and that it must be fine-tuned to ecological conditions. We discuss the\nrelevance of this approach to studies in animal cognition, using examples from\nanimal foraging and decision-making, problem solving, and cognitive\nflexibility. Finally, we explain how even the apparent human-animal gap in\nsequence learning ability can be explained in terms of different fine-tunings\nof a similar chunking process.",

    "abstract": "Accurate classification of clinical text often requires fine-tuning\npre-trained language models, a process that is costly and time-consuming due to\nthe need for high-quality data and expert annotators. Synthetic data generation\noffers an alternative, though pre-trained models may not capture the syntactic\ndiversity of clinical notes. We propose an embedding-driven approach that uses\ndiversity sampling from a small set of real clinical notes to guide large\nlanguage models in few-shot prompting, generating synthetic text that better\nreflects clinical syntax. We evaluated this method using the CheXpert dataset\non a classification task, comparing it to random few-shot and zero-shot\napproaches. Using cosine similarity and a Turing test, our approach produced\nsynthetic notes that more closely align with real clinical text. Our pipeline\nreduced the data needed to reach the 0.85 AUC cutoff by 40% for AUROC and 30%\nfor AUPRC, while augmenting models with synthetic data improved AUROC by 57%\nand AUPRC by 68%.

    "abstract": "Rapid advancements in autonomous vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize\ntransportation and communities, including disaster evacuations, particularly\nthrough the deployment of Shared Autonomous Vehicles (SAVs). Despite the\npotential, the use of SAVs in rural disaster evacuations remains an\nunderexplored area. To address this gap, this study proposes a simulation-based\nframework that integrates both mathematical programming and SUMO traffic\nsimulation to deploy SAVs in pre- and post-disaster evacuations in rural areas.\nThe framework prioritizes the needs of vulnerable groups, including individuals\nwith disabilities, limited English proficiency, and elderly residents. Sumter\nCounty, Florida, serves as the case study due to its unique characteristics: a\nhigh concentration of vulnerable individuals and limited access to public\ntransportation, making it one of the most transportation-insecure counties in\nthe state. These conditions present significant challenges for evacuation\nplanning in the region. To explore potential solutions, we conducted mass\nevacuation simulations by incorporating SAVs across seven scenarios. These\nscenarios represented varying SAV penetration levels, ranging from 20% to 100%\nof the vulnerable population, and were compared to a baseline scenario using\nonly passenger cars. Additionally, we examined both pre-disaster and\npost-disaster conditions, accounting for infrastructure failures and road\nclosures. According to the simulation results, higher SAV integration\nsignificantly improves traffic distribution and reduces congestion. Scenarios\nfeaturing more SAVs exhibited lower congestion peaks and more stable traffic\nflow. Conversely, mixed traffic environments demonstrate reduced average speeds\nattributable to interactions between SAVs and passenger cars, while exclusive\nuse of SAVs results in higher speeds and more stable travel patterns.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices have become increasingly ubiquitous with\napplications not only in urban areas but remote areas as well. These devices\nsupport industries such as agriculture, forestry, and resource extraction. Due\nto the device location being in remote areas, satellites are frequently used to\ncollect and deliver IoT device data to customers. As these devices become\nincreasingly advanced and numerous, the amount of data produced has rapidly\nincreased potentially straining the ability for radio frequency (RF) downlink\ncapacity. Free space optical communications with their wide available\nbandwidths and high data rates are a potential solution, but these\ncommunication systems are highly vulnerable to weather-related disruptions.\nThis results in certain communication opportunities being inefficient in terms\nof the amount of data received versus the power expended. In this paper, we\npropose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) method using Deep Q-Networks that\ntakes advantage of weather condition forecasts to improve energy efficiency\nwhile delivering the same number of packets as schemes that don't factor\nweather into routing decisions. We compare this method with simple approaches\nthat utilize simple cloud cover thresholds to improve energy efficiency. In\ntesting the DRL approach provides improved median energy efficiency without a\nsignificant reduction in median delivery ratio. Simple cloud cover thresholds\nwere also found to be effective but the thresholds with the highest energy\nefficiency had reduced median delivery ratio values.",

To address\nthis gap, this research introduces a novel framework that combines quantum\ncomputing technology with an equity-focused approach to network restoration.\nOptimization of road link recovery within budget constraints is achieved by\nleveraging D Wave's hybrid quantum solver, which targets the connectivity needs\nof low, average, and high income communities.
