    "abstract": "While frontier large language models (LLMs) are capable tool-using agents,\ncurrent AI systems still operate in a strict turn-based fashion, oblivious to\npassage of time. This synchronous design forces user queries and tool-use to\noccur sequentially, preventing the systems from multitasking and reducing\ninteractivity. To address this limitation, we introduce asynchronous AI agents\ncapable of parallel processing and real-time tool-use. Our key contribution is\nan event-driven finite-state machine architecture for agent execution and\nprompting, integrated with automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech.\nDrawing inspiration from the concepts originally developed for real-time\noperating systems, this work presents both a conceptual framework and practical\ntools for creating AI agents capable of fluid, multitasking interactions.",

Although recent studies have applied conformal\nprediction to graph neural networks, they have largely emphasized post-hoc\nprediction set generation.

In this work, we tackle this challenge from a\ndenoising perspective by introducing SparGCP, which incorporates graph\nsparsification and a conformal prediction-specific objective into GNN training.\nSparGCP employs a parameterized graph sparsification module to filter out\ntask-irrelevant edges, thereby improving conformal prediction efficiency.\nExtensive experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that SparGCP\noutperforms existing methods, reducing prediction set sizes by an average of\n32\\% and scaling seamlessly to large networks on commodity GPUs.",

    "abstract": "We report the discovery of a peculiar X-ray transient, EP240408a, by Einstein\nProbe (EP) and follow-up studies made with EP, Swift, NICER, GROND, ATCA and\nother ground-based multi-wavelength telescopes. The new transient was first\ndetected with Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board EP on April 8th, 2024,\nmanifested in an intense yet brief X-ray flare lasting for 12 seconds. The\nflare reached a peak flux of 3.9x10^(-9) erg/cm2/s in 0.5-4 keV, about 300\ntimes brighter than the underlying X-ray emission detected throughout the\nobservation. Rapid and more precise follow-up observations by EP/FXT, Swift and\nNICER confirmed the finding of this new transient. Its X-ray spectrum is\nnon-thermal in 0.5-10 keV, with a power-law photon index varying within\n1.8-2.5. The X-ray light curve shows a plateau lasting for about 4 days,\nfollowed by a steep decay till becoming undetectable about 10 days after the\ninitial detection. Based on its temporal property and constraints from previous\nEP observations, an unusual timescale in the range of 7-23 days is found for\nEP240408a, which is intermediate between the commonly found fast and long-term\ntransients. No counterparts have been found in optical and near-infrared, with\nthe earliest observation at 17 hours after the initial X-ray detection,\nsuggestive of intrinsically weak emission in these bands. We demonstrate that\nthe remarkable properties of EP240408a are inconsistent with any of the\ntransient types known so far, by comparison with, in particular, jetted tidal\ndisruption events, gamma-ray bursts, X-ray binaries and fast blue optical\ntransients. The nature of EP240408a thus remains an enigma. We suggest that\nEP240408a may represent a new type of transients with intermediate timescales\nof the order of about 10 days. The detection and follow-ups of more of such\nobjects are essential for revealing their origin.",

    "abstract": "When solving long-horizon tasks, it is intriguing to decompose the high-level\ntask into subtasks. Decomposing experiences into reusable subtasks can improve\ndata efficiency, accelerate policy generalization, and in general provide\npromising solutions to multi-task reinforcement learning and imitation learning\nproblems. However, the concept of subtasks is not sufficiently understood and\nmodeled yet, and existing works often overlook the true structure of the data\ngeneration process: subtasks are the results of a $\\textit{selection}$\nmechanism on actions, rather than possible underlying confounders or\nintermediates. Specifically, we provide a theory to identify, and experiments\nto verify the existence of selection variables in such data. These selections\nserve as subgoals that indicate subtasks and guide policy. In light of this\nidea, we develop a sequential non-negative matrix factorization (seq- NMF)\nmethod to learn these subgoals and extract meaningful behavior patterns as\nsubtasks. Our empirical results on a challenging Kitchen environment\ndemonstrate that the learned subtasks effectively enhance the generalization to\nnew tasks in multi-task imitation learning scenarios.

VPR faces challenges such as accurate image\nneighbor retrieval and appearance change in scenery. Event cameras, also known\nas dynamic vision sensors, are a new sensor modality for VPR and offer a\npromising solution to the challenges with their unique attributes: high\ntemporal resolution (1MHz clock), ultra-low latency (in {\\mu}s), and high\ndynamic range (>120dB). These attributes make event cameras less susceptible to\nmotion blur and more robust in variable lighting conditions, making them\nsuitable for addressing VPR challenges. However, the scarcity of event-based\nVPR datasets, partly due to the novelty and cost of event cameras, hampers\ntheir adoption. To fill this data gap, our paper introduces the NYC-Event-VPR\ndataset to the robotics and computer vision communities, featuring the\nProphesee IMX636 HD event sensor (1280x720 resolution), combined with RGB\ncamera and GPS module. It encompasses over 13 hours of geotagged event data,\nspanning 260 kilometers across New York City, covering diverse lighting and\nweather conditions, day/night scenarios, and multiple visits to various\nlocations. Furthermore, our paper employs three frameworks to conduct\ngeneralization performance assessments, promoting innovation in event-based VPR\nand its integration into robotics applications.",

The dynamical\nrealization of the spin-charge conversion, the electric dipole spin resonance\n(EDSR), of Dirac electrons displays distinctive THz features, upon emerging\nspin-pseudospin proximity terms in the Hamiltonian. To capture the effect of\nfast pseudospin dynamics on the electron spin, we develop a mean-field theory\nand complement it with a quantum-mechanical treatment. As a specific example,\nwe investigate the THz response of a single graphene layer proximitized by a\nmagnetic substrate. Our analysis demonstrates a strong enhancement and\nanomalous polarization structure of the THz-light absorption which can enable\nTHz detection and efficient generation and control of spins in spin-based\nquantum devices.

Three point cloud objective metrics were selected to assess the\nquality of the reconstructed point clouds, notably the PSNR YUV, the Point\nCloud Quality Metric, and GraphSIM.

This\ngave rise to the hyper-Hermitian double copy in the Kerr-Schild approach. In\nthe present article, we further study the hyper-Hermitian case using the Weyl\ndouble copy formalism. In particular, we have found solutions within this\nformalism for different hyper-Hermitian metrics.

    "abstract": "Model selection is a key task in statistics, playing a critical role across\nvarious scientific disciplines. While no model can fully capture the\ncomplexities of a real-world data-generating process, identifying the model\nthat best approximates it can provide valuable insights. Bayesian statistics\noffers a flexible framework for model selection by updating prior beliefs as\nnew data becomes available, allowing for ongoing refinement of candidate\nmodels. This is typically achieved by calculating posterior probabilities,\nwhich quantify the support for each model given the observed data. However, in\ncases where likelihood functions are intractable, exact computation of these\nposterior probabilities becomes infeasible. Approximate Bayesian computation\n(ABC) has emerged as a likelihood-free method and it is traditionally used with\nsummary statistics to reduce data dimensionality, however this often results in\ninformation loss difficult to quantify, particularly in model selection\ncontexts. Recent advancements propose the use of full data approaches based on\nstatistical distances, offering a promising alternative that bypasses the need\nfor handcrafted summary statistics and can yield posterior approximations that\nmore closely reflect the true posterior under suitable conditions. Despite\nthese developments, full data ABC approaches have not yet been widely applied\nto model selection problems. This paper seeks to address this gap by\ninvestigating the performance of ABC with statistical distances in model\nselection. Through simulation studies and an application to toad movement\nmodels, this work explores whether full data approaches can overcome the\nlimitations of summary statistic-based ABC for model choice.",

    "abstract": "Decision Trees have remained a popular machine learning method for tabular\ndatasets, mainly due to their interpretability. However, they lack the\nexpressiveness needed to handle highly nonlinear or unstructured datasets.\nMotivated by recent advances in tree-based machine learning (ML) techniques and\nfirst-order optimization methods, we introduce Generalized Soft Trees (GSTs),\nwhich extend soft decision trees (STs) and are capable of processing images\ndirectly. We demonstrate their advantages with respect to tractability,\nperformance, and interpretability. We develop a tractable approach to growing\nGSTs, given by the DeepTree algorithm, which, in addition to new regularization\nterms, produces high-quality models with far fewer nodes and greater\ninterpretability than traditional soft trees. We test the performance of our\nGSTs on benchmark tabular and image datasets, including MIMIC-IV, MNIST,\nFashion MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Celeb-A. We show that our approach outperforms\nother popular tree methods (CART, Random Forests, XGBoost) in almost all of the\ndatasets, with Convolutional Trees having a significant edge in the hardest\nCIFAR-10 and Fashion MNIST datasets. Finally, we explore the interpretability\nof our GSTs and find that even the most complex GSTs are considerably more\ninterpretable than deep neural networks. Overall, our approach of Generalized\nSoft Trees provides a tractable method that is high-performing on\n(un)structured datasets and preserves interpretability more than traditional\ndeep learning methods.",

For instance, UniswapDAO\nallows members to vote on policy changes for the Uniswap exchange. However,\nDAOs face challenges regarding scalability, governance, and compliance.\nHybrid-DAOs, which combine the decentralized nature of DAOs with traditional\nlegal frameworks, provide solutions to these issues. This research explores\nvarious aspects of DAOs, including their voting mechanisms, which, while\nensuring fairness, are susceptible to Sybil attacks, where a user can create\nmultiple accounts to exploit the system. Hybrid-DAOs offer robust solutions to\nthese attacks, enabling more equitable voting methods. Moreover,\ndecentralization can be understood through four properties: anonymity,\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness, each with distinct implications for\nDAOs. Lastly, this work discusses legal challenges Hybrid-DAOs face and their\npromising applications across sectors such as nonprofit management, corporate\ngovernance, and startup funding.

Large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have shown great potential in supporting medical tasks\nand performing well in general coding tests. However, existing evaluations fail\nto assess their capability in biomedical data science, particularly in handling\ndiverse data types such as genomics and clinical datasets. To address this gap,\nwe developed a benchmark of data science coding tasks derived from the analyses\nof 39 published studies. This benchmark comprises 293 coding tasks (128 in\nPython and 165 in R) performed on real-world TCGA-type genomics and clinical\ndata. Our findings reveal that the vanilla prompting of LLMs yields suboptimal\nperformances due to drawbacks in following input instructions, understanding\ntarget data, and adhering to standard analysis practices. Next, we benchmarked\nsix cutting-edge LLMs and advanced adaptation methods, finding two methods to\nbe particularly effective: chain-of-thought prompting, which provides a\nstep-by-step plan for data analysis, which led to a 21% code accuracy\nimprovement (56.6% versus 35.3%); and self-reflection, enabling LLMs to refine\nthe buggy code iteratively, yielding an 11% code accuracy improvement (45.5%\nversus 34.3%). Building on these insights, we developed a platform that\nintegrates LLMs into the data science workflow for medical professionals. In a\nuser study with five medical professionals, we found that while LLMs cannot\nfully automate programming tasks, they significantly streamline the programming\nprocess. We found that 80% of their submitted code solutions were incorporated\nfrom LLM-generated code, with up to 96% reuse in some cases. Our analysis\nhighlights the potential of LLMs to enhance data science efficiency in\nbiomedical research when integrated into expert workflows.",

Although the response of MBI\ndevices is modeled by the Airy function, existing reconstruction techniques are\noften limited to Fourier-transform spectroscopy, which is tailored for two-beam\ninterference (TBI). These methods impose limitations for MBI and are\nsusceptible to non-idealities like irregular sampling and noise, highlighting\nthe need for an in-depth numerical framework. To fill this gap, we propose a\nrigorous taxonomy of the TBI and MBI instrument description and propose a\nunified Bayesian formulation which both embeds the description of existing\nliterature works and adds some of the real-world non-idealities of the\nacquisition process.

Orbital similarity measures, such as the D-values, have been\nextensively used in meteor science to identify meteoroid streams and associate\nmeteorite falls with near-Earth objects (NEOs).

We aim to assess the statistical significance of using orbital\nsimilarity measures for identifying streams of meteoroids or asteroids and\nexplore the implications of chaotic dynamics on the long-term coherence of\nthese streams.\n  Conclusions. The rapid decoherence of meteoroid streams and the chaotic\ndynamics of near-Earth orbits suggest that no reported stream or NEO\nassociations of meteorites or fireballs are statistically significant according\nto orbital discriminates. Many are likely coincidental rather than indicative\nof a true physical link. However, several statistically significant clusters\nfound within the NEO population are consistent with a tidal disruption\nformation. This contrast and lack of statistically significant associations\namongst the impact datasets is likely due to the fireball databases being 2\norders of magnitude smaller than the NEO database and the higher intrinsic\nuncertainties of fireball observation derived orbits.",

Treating\nthe radiative atmosphere is crucial for sub-Neptunes, due to the large scale\nheight and low gravity, which contributes up to 40\\% of their observed radius,\nespecially for low-mass, highly irradiated planets. Consequently, we\ngenerically find that lower H/He mass fractions are needed to match a given\nplanetary radius, compared to previous work. While the presence of\nmetal-enrichment in the H/He layers (here modeled as 50$\\times$ solar) does not\nsubstantially influence the size of the convective envelope, it notably reduces\nthe transit radius by shrinking the radiative atmospheric scale height.\nSub-Neptunes cool differently from terrestrial planets, with the rock/iron\ncore's cooling rate limited by the envelope, leading to longer solidification\ntimescales.

    "abstract": "Highly performant large-scale pre-trained models promise to also provide a\nvaluable foundation for learning specialized tasks, by fine-tuning the model to\nthe desired task. By starting from a good general-purpose model, the goal is to\nachieve both specialization in the target task and maintain robustness. To\nassess the robustness of models on out-of-distribution samples after\nfine-tuning on downstream datasets, we introduce a new robust fine-tuning\nbenchmark, ImageNet-RIB (Robustness Inheritance Benchmark). The benchmark\nconsists of a set of related but distinct specialized (downstream) datasets;\npre-trained models are fine-tuned on one dataset in the set and their\nrobustness is assessed on the rest, iterating across all tasks for fine-tuning\nand assessment. The distance between the pre-training and downstream datasets,\nmeasured by optimal transport, predicts this performance degradation on the\npre-training dataset. Though continual learning methods help maintain\nrobustness, fine-tuning generally reduces generalization performance on related\ndownstream tasks across models. Counterintuitively, model robustness after\nfine-tuning on related downstream tasks is the worst when the pre-training\ndataset is the richest and the most diverse. This suggests that starting with\nthe strongest foundation model is not necessarily the best approach for\nperformance on specialist tasks. ImageNet-RIB thus offers key insights for\ndeveloping more resilient fine-tuning strategies and building robust machine\nlearning models. https://jd730.github.io/projects/ImageNet-RIB",

The exact cause of this bimodality is disputed, but one\nclass of explanations involves the merger between the Milky Way and a\nrelatively massive satellite (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus) at z~2. However,\nreproducing this bimodality in simulations is not straightforward, with\nconflicting results on the prevalence, morphology, and mechanism behind\nmultimodality. We present a case study of a galaxy in the Illustris TNG50\nsimulation which undergoes sequential phases of starburst, brief quiescence,\nand then rejuvenation. This scenario results in a pronounced abundance\nbimodality after a post-processing adjustment of the [alpha/Fe] of old stars\ndesigned to mimic a higher star formation efficiency in dense gas. The high-\nand low-alpha sequences are separated in time by the brief quiescent period,\nwhich is not associated with a merger but by the formation of a bar followed by\nAGN activity. This galaxy indicates a novel scenario in which the\nalpha-bimodality in the Milky Way is caused by the formation of the bar via\nAGN-induced quenching. In addition to a stellar age gap in the Milky Way, we\npredict that abundance bimodalities should be more common in barred as opposed\nto unbarred galaxies.",

To verify chemical\ndifferences between the RC groups, we performed low-resolution spectroscopy for\nRC and red giant branch (RGB) stars using Gemini-South/GMOS in three fields of\nthe bulge, and collected diverse data from literature. We divided our sample\nstars not only into bright and faint RC groups, but also into bluer ([Fe/H] <\n-0.1) and redder ([Fe/H] > -0.1) groups following the recent u-band photometric\nstudies. For the metal-poor stars, no statistically significant difference in\nCN index was detected between the bright and faint RC groups for all observed\nfields. However, we found, from cross-matching with high-resolution\nspectroscopic data, a sign of Na enhancement in the \"metal-poor and bright\" RC\ngroup compared to the \"metal-poor and faint\" group at (l,b)=(-1 deg,-8.5 deg).\nWhen the contributions of the RGB stars on the RC regimes are taken into\naccount, the Na abundance difference between genuine RCs would correspond to\napproximately 0.23 dex, similar to globular cluster (GCs) with multiple\npopulations. In contrast, the metal-rich stars do not show chemical differences\nbetween the bright and faint RCs. It implies that the double RC observed in the\nmetal-poor component of the bulge might be linked to the multiple populations\noriginated from GC-like subsystem, whereas that of the metal-rich component\nwould have produced by the X-shaped structure. Our results support the previous\nstudies suggesting composite nature of the Milky Way bulge.",

With the increasing number of discoveries of globular clusters in\nthe inner Milky Way, the need for spectroscopic confirmation and further\ninvestigation of their stellar populations and chemodynamical properties has\nbecome crucial.

This study aims to\ninvestigate the stellar populations of Gran 5 and their detailed chemical\nproperties. Methods. We performed high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy on\nseven stars in the field of Gran 5 using IGRINS on the Gemini-South telescope.\nResults. We identified six stars as cluster members and reveal that they are\ndivided into two stellar populations with different metallicities, with mean\n[Fe/H] values of -0.76 dex and -0.55 dex, respectively. In addition, the\nchemodynamical properties of Gran 5 agree with those of in situ globular\nclusters. Conclusions. Our findings represent the first detection of two\nstellar populations with different metallicities in a low-mass globular\ncluster. This suggests that the metallicity variation in Gran 5 may have arisen\nfrom processes different from those in other globular clusters with metallicity\nvariation, or that it may have lost a substantial amount of its initial mass\nduring its evolution.",

    "abstract": "In deep learning, Residual Networks (ResNets) have proven effective in\naddressing the vanishing gradient problem, allowing for the successful training\nof very deep networks.

This\noverestimation can cause inefficiencies in optimization, as some updates may\novershoot optimal regions, affecting weight updates. To address this, we\nexamine Z-score Normalization (ZNorm) as a technique to manage gradient\noverlap. ZNorm adjusts the gradient scale, standardizing gradients across\nlayers and reducing the negative impact of overlapping gradients. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that ZNorm improves training process, especially in\nnon-convex optimization scenarios common in deep learning, where finding\noptimal solutions is challenging.

Employing energy-scaling arguments, we predict the\nmagnitude of each higher-dimensional operator's contribution. Utilizing the\ngeometric formulation of SMEFT, our analysis incorporates dimension-eight\noperators not previously considered.

This suggests that the SMEFT\nremains valid for lower $\\Lambda$ than expected. Combined with the fact that\nLEP constrains the dimension-six operators with the most considerable impact on\nvector boson fusion, a regime exists where dimension-eight operators can have\nsignificant effects.

    "abstract": "Sonar based audio classification techniques are a growing area of research in\nthe field of underwater acoustics. Usually, underwater noise picked up by\npassive sonar transducers contains all types of signals that travel through the\nocean and is transformed into spectrographic images. As a result, the\ncorresponding spectrograms intended to display the temporal-frequency data of a\ncertain object often include the tonal regions of abundant extraneous noise\nthat can effectively interfere with a 'contact'. So, a majority of\nspectrographic samples extracted from underwater audio signals are rendered\nunusable due to their clutter and lack the required indistinguishability\nbetween different objects. With limited clean true data for supervised\ntraining, creating classification models for these audio signals is severely\nbottlenecked.\n  This paper derives several new techniques to combat this problem by\ndeveloping a novel Score-CAM based denoiser to extract an object's signature\nfrom noisy spectrographic data without being given any ground truth data. In\nparticular, this paper proposes a novel generative adversarial network\narchitecture for learning and producing spectrographic training data in similar\ndistributions to low-feature spectrogram inputs.

    "abstract": "In this work we revisit the arithmetic and bit complexity of Hermitian\neigenproblems. Recently, [BGVKS, FOCS 2020] proved that a (non-Hermitian)\nmatrix can be diagonalized with a randomized algorithm in\n$O(n^{\\omega}\\log^2(n/\\epsilon))$ arithmetic operations, where $\\omega\\lesssim\n2.371$ is the square matrix multiplication exponent, and [Shah, SODA 2025]\nsignificantly improved the bit complexity for the Hermitian case. Our main goal\nis to obtain similar deterministic complexity bounds for various Hermitian\neigenproblems. In the Real RAM model, we show that a Hermitian matrix can be\ndiagonalized deterministically in\n$O(n^{\\omega}\\log(n)+n^2\\mathrm{polylog}(n/\\epsilon))$ arithmetic operations,\nimproving the classic deterministic $\\widetilde O(n^3)$ algorithms, and\nderandomizing the aforementioned state-of-the-art. The main technical step is a\ncomplete, detailed analysis of a well-known divide-and-conquer tridiagonal\neigensolver of Gu and Eisenstat [GE95], when accelerated with the Fast\nMultipole Method, asserting that it can accurately diagonalize a symmetric\ntridiagonal matrix in nearly-$O(n^2)$ operations. In finite precision, we show\nthat an algorithm by Sch\\\"onhage [Sch72] to reduce a Hermitian matrix to\ntridiagonal form is stable in the floating point model, using\n$O(\\log(n/\\epsilon))$ bits of precision. This leads to a deterministic\nalgorithm to compute all the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix in\n$O\\left(n^{\\omega}\\mathcal{F}\\left(\\log(n/\\epsilon)\\right)+n^2\\mathrm{polylog}(n/\\epsilon)\\right)$\nbit operations, where $\\mathcal{F}(b)\\in\\widetilde O(b)$ is the bit complexity\nof a single floating point operation on $b$ bits. This improves the best known\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^3)$ deterministic and\n$O\\left(n^{\\omega}\\log^2(n/\\epsilon)\\mathcal{F}\\left(\\log(n/\\epsilon)\\right)\\right)$\nrandomized complexities.

However, clients may also need to make real-time\npredictions on streaming data in non-stationary environments. In such dynamic\nenvironments, employing pre-trained models may be inefficient, as they struggle\nto adapt to the constantly evolving data streams. To address this challenge,\nclients can fine-tune models online, leveraging their observed data to enhance\nperformance. Despite the potential benefits of client participation in\nfederated online model fine-tuning, existing analyses have not conclusively\ndemonstrated its superiority over local model fine-tuning. To bridge this gap,\nthe present paper develops a novel personalized federated learning algorithm,\nwherein each client constructs a personalized model by combining a locally\nfine-tuned model with multiple federated models learned by the server over\ntime.

We propose Context-Aware Reward\nModeling (CARMO), a novel approach that first generates dynamic,\ncontext-relevant criteria to ground the reward model before producing reward\nscores.

Our model consists\nof the canonical IGM absorption and an additional absorption component due to\ndense neutral hydrogen gas clouds proximate to the galaxy, and we derive the\nredshift evolution of HI column density of the proximate clouds by calibrating\nthe model using CANUCS JWST observations. The resulting total transmission\ncurve resolves the photometric redshift bias at $z>7$, an improvement that is\nrobust to choice of template-fitting code, template set, and photometric\ncatalog used.

    "abstract": "In the highly competitive environment of the banking industry, it is\nessential to precisely forecast the behavior of customers in order to maximize\nthe effectiveness of marketing initiatives and improve financial consequences.\nThe purpose of this research is to examine the efficacy of logit and probit\nmodels in predicting term deposit subscriptions using a Portuguese bank's\ndirect marketing data. There are several demographic, economic, and behavioral\ncharacteristics in the dataset that affect the probability of subscribing. To\nincrease model performance and provide an unbiased evaluation, the target\nvariable was balanced, considering the inherent imbalance in the dataset. The\ntwo model's prediction abilities were evaluated using Bayesian techniques and\nLeave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV). The logit model performed better than\nthe probit model in handling this classification problem. The results highlight\nthe relevance of model selection when dealing with complicated decision-making\nprocesses in the financial services industry and imbalanced datasets. Findings\nfrom this study shed light on how banks can optimize their decision-making\nprocesses, improve their client segmentation, and boost their marketing\ncampaigns by utilizing machine learning models.",

    "abstract": "Consensus is arguably the most studied problem in distributed computing as a\nwhole, and particularly in the distributed message-passing setting. In this\nlatter framework, research on consensus has considered various hypotheses\nregarding the failure types, the memory constraints, the algorithmic\nperformances (e.g., early stopping and obliviousness), etc. Surprisingly,\nalmost all of this work assumes that messages are passed in a \\emph{complete}\nnetwork, i.e., each process has a direct link to every other process. A\nnoticeable exception is the recent work of Casta\\~neda et al. (Inf. Comput.\n2023) who designed a generic oblivious algorithm for consensus running in\n$\\radius(G,t)$ rounds in every graph~$G$, when up to $t$ nodes can crash by\nirrevocably stopping, where $t$ is smaller than the node-connectivity $\\kappa$\nof~$G$. Here, $\\radius(G,t)$ denotes a graph parameter called the \\emph{radius\nof~$G$ whenever up to $t$ nodes can crash}. For $t=0$, this parameter coincides\nwith $\\radius(G)$, the standard radius of a graph, and, for $G=K_n$, the\nrunning time $\\radius(K_n,t)=t +1$ of the algorithm exactly matches the known\nround-complexity of consensus in the clique~$K_n$.\n  Our main result is a proof that $\\radius(G,t)$ rounds are necessary for\noblivious algorithms solving consensus in $G$ when up to $t$ nodes can crash,\nthus validating a conjecture of Casta\\~neda et al., and demonstrating that\ntheir consensus algorithm is optimal for any graph~$G$. We also extend the\nresult of Casta\\~neda et al. to two different settings: First, to the case\nwhere the number $t$ of failures is not necessarily smaller than the\nconnectivity $\\kappa$ of the considered graph; Second, to the $k$-set agreement\nproblem for which agreement is not restricted to be on a single value as in\nconsensus, but on up to $k$ different values.",

Additionally, the balance between high performance and\nefficiency remains an under-explored problem for exposure correction task.\nInspired by Mamba which demonstrates powerful and highly efficient sequence\nmodeling, we introduce a novel framework based on Mamba for Exposure Correction\n(ECMamba) with dual pathways, each dedicated to the restoration of reflectance\nand illumination map, respectively.

Recently, component reduced order modeling method is developed to\ntackle this challenge by combining projection reduced order modeling and\ndiscontinuous Galerkin domain decomposition. However, while many scientific or\nengineering applications involve nonlinear physics, this method has been only\ndemonstrated for various linear systems. In this work, the component reduced\norder modeling method is extended to steady Navier-Stokes flow, with\napplication to general nonlinear physics in view.

Linear subspaces for\nflow velocity and pressure are identified via proper orthogonal decomposition\nover sample snapshots collected at small scale unit component. Velocity bases\nare augmented with pressure supremizer, in order to satisfy inf-sup condition\nfor stable pressure prediction. Two different nonlinear reduced order modeling\nmethods are employed and compared for efficient evaluation of nonlinear\nadvection: 3rd-order tensor projection operator and empirical quadrature\nprocedure. The proposed method is demonstrated on flow over arrays of five\ndifferent unit objects, achieving $23$ times faster prediction with less than\n$4\\%$ relative error up to $256$ times larger scale domain than unit\ncomponents. Furthermore, a numerical experiment with pressure supremizer\nstrongly indicates the need of supremizer for stable pressure prediction.

We posit that this can\nbe attributed to two factors: 1) tabular data contains heterogeneous data type,\nwhile the autoregressive model is primarily designed to model discrete-valued\ndata; 2) tabular data is column permutation-invariant, requiring a generation\nmodel to generate columns in arbitrary order. This paper proposes a\nDiffusion-nested Autoregressive model (TabDAR) to address these issues. To\nenable autoregressive methods for continuous columns, TabDAR employs a\ndiffusion model to parameterize the conditional distribution of continuous\nfeatures. To ensure arbitrary generation order, TabDAR resorts to masked\ntransformers with bi-directional attention, which simulate various permutations\nof column order, hence enabling it to learn the conditional distribution of a\ntarget column given an arbitrary combination of other columns. These designs\nenable TabDAR to not only freely handle heterogeneous tabular data but also\nsupport convenient and flexible unconditional/conditional sampling. We conduct\nextensive experiments on ten datasets with distinct properties, and the\nproposed TabDAR outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 18% to 45% on\neight metrics across three distinct aspects.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of deterministic systems, specifically\nlarge language models (LLMs), to exhibit the functional capacities of moral\nagency and compatibilist free will. We develop a functional definition of free\nwill grounded in Dennett's compatibilist framework, building on an\ninterdisciplinary theoretical foundation that integrates Shannon's information\ntheory, Dennett's compatibilism, and Floridi's philosophy of information. This\nframework emphasizes the importance of reason-responsiveness and value\nalignment in determining moral responsibility rather than requiring\nmetaphysical libertarian free will. Shannon's theory highlights the role of\nprocessing complex information in enabling adaptive decision-making, while\nFloridi's philosophy reconciles these perspectives by conceptualizing agency as\na spectrum, allowing for a graduated view of moral status based on a system's\ncomplexity and responsiveness. Our analysis of LLMs' decision-making in moral\ndilemmas demonstrates their capacity for rational deliberation and their\nability to adjust choices in response to new information and identified\ninconsistencies. Thus, they exhibit features of a moral agency that align with\nour functional definition of free will. These results challenge traditional\nviews on the necessity of consciousness for moral responsibility, suggesting\nthat systems with self-referential reasoning capacities can instantiate degrees\nof free will and moral reasoning in artificial and biological contexts. This\nstudy proposes a parsimonious framework for understanding free will as a\nspectrum that spans artificial and biological systems, laying the groundwork\nfor further interdisciplinary research on agency and ethics in the artificial\nintelligence era.",

In this study, we address this issue by directly\ncalculating the driving force for nucleation using equations of state (EOS) and\nintegrating this approach into the calculation of nucleation rates within the\nframework of CNT and its modified model. We apply this method to examine the\ncondensation of a Lennard-Jones fluid and compare the resulting nucleation\nrates with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Our results demonstrate\nthat at relatively low supersaturation, where the capillary approximation is\nreasonable, our thermodynamic models exhibit excellent agreement with MD\nresults, significantly outperforming traditional models. At moderate and high\nsupersaturation, our approach continues to show a reasonable agreement with MD\nresults.

    "abstract": "Technological trends show that Radio Frequency Reinforcement Learning (RFRL)\nwill play a prominent role in the wireless communication systems of the future.\nApplications of RFRL range from military communications jamming to enhancing\nWiFi networks. Before deploying algorithms for these purposes, they must be\ntrained in a simulation environment to ensure adequate performance. For this\nreason, we previously created the RFRL Gym: a standardized, accessible tool for\nthe development and testing of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in the\nwireless communications space. This environment leveraged the OpenAI Gym\nframework and featured customizable simulation scenarios within the RF\nspectrum. However, the RFRL Gym was limited to training a single RL agent per\nsimulation; this is not ideal, as most real-world RF scenarios will contain\nmultiple intelligent agents in cooperative, competitive, or mixed settings,\nwhich is a natural consequence of spectrum congestion. Therefore, through\nintegration with Ray RLlib, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\nfunctionality for training and assessment has been added to the RFRL Gym,\nmaking it even more of a robust tool for RF spectrum simulation. This paper\nprovides an overview of the updated RFRL Gym environment.

In this paper, we propose a sub-population specific\nprotein evolution model, which predicts the time-resolved distributions of\nviral proteins in different locations. The algorithm explicitly models the\ntransmission rates between sub-populations and learns their interdependence\nfrom data. The change in protein distributions across all sub-populations is\ndefined through a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) parametrized by\ntransmission rates. Solving this ODE yields the likelihood of a given protein\noccurring in particular sub-populations. Multi-year evaluation on both\nSARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/H3N2 demonstrates that our model outperforms\nbaselines in accurately predicting distributions of viral proteins across\ncontinents and countries.

This study investigates the safety and security index for six GCC\ncountries using machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost, to forecast\nsecurity trends for the next five years. Data from the Global Peace Index and\nWorld Bank development indicators were employed to construct the model. Key\nindicators related to economic, political, and environmental factors were\nselected using the Edit Distance on Real Sequence feature selection method. The\nmodel demonstrated high accuracy, with a mean absolute percentage error of less\nthan 10% across all countries. The results indicate that Bahrain and Saudi\nArabia are likely to experience improvements in their safety and security\nindexes. At the same time, Kuwait and Oman may face challenges in maintaining\ntheir current levels of security. The findings suggest that economic\ndiversification, environmental sustainability, and social stability are\ncritical for ensuring long-term security in the region.

Whether similar effects are important in\nplasmas well-described by magnetohydrodynamics is an open question. In nuclear\nfusion experiments, the onset of turbulence often enhances undesirable heat\ntransport between the core and the edge, and a vast number of studies have\nattempted to understand these phenomena via linear and nonlinear numerical\ncodes. If there are plasma experiments where instabilities and turbulence onset\nare dominated by nonmodal effects, the tools of non-modal stability and\nresolvent analysis could prove to be essential to practitioners. Towards that\ngoal, in this work we provide a detailed derivation of non-modal stability\ntools and the resolvent operator for incompressible, resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Concretely, optimal initial conditions that\nmaximize transient growth are computed, along with bounds on linear transient\ngrowth, and are numerically verified with a nonlinear solver to show that these\nlinear effects can be reproduced in nonlinear simulations. The potential of\nsuch initial conditions to initiate the tearing mode in a spectrally stable\nsystem is explored. We found the approach common in nonmodal hydrodynamic\nstability of using pseudospectral methods to be infeasible for many parameter\ncombinations due to numerical ill-conditioning. Further, transient growth in\nthe Harris current sheet proved to be highly norm-dependent, with the observed\ndifferences being of an order of magnitude. Nonlinear simulations showed that\ntransient growth occurs to some extent in all norms, both in the infinitesimal\nas well as finite limit. No case was observed of transient growth being strong\nenough to trigger the full plasmoid instability.",

Utilizing HuBERT\ncodes, our model generates discrete representations that are optimized for TTS\ntasks, thereby reducing the dependency on diacritic-based text processing. This\nadvancement not only simplifies the language modeling process but also improves\nthe robustness and shows controllability of the speech output due to\ndisentenglement properties of the semantic units.

It implies that a rater (e.g., teacher, doctor) rates a\nsubject (e.g., student, doctor) on a rating scale. Given raters variability,\nseveral statistical methods have been proposed for assessing and improving the\nquality of ratings. Model estimation in the presence of heterogeneity has been\none of the recent challenges in this research line. Consequently, several\nmethods have been proposed to address this issue under a parametric multilevel\nmodelling framework, in which strong distributional assumptions are made. We\npropose a more flexible model under the Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) framework,\nin which most of those assumptions are relaxed. By eliciting hierarchical\ndiscrete nonparametric priors, the model accommodates clusters among raters and\nsubjects, naturally accounts for heterogeneity, and improves estimates\naccuracy. We propose a general BNP heteroscedastic framework to analyse\ncontinuous and coarse rating data and possible latent differences among\nsubjects and raters. The estimated densities are used to make inferences about\nthe rating process and the quality of the ratings. By exploiting a\nstick-breaking representation of the Dirichlet Process, a general class of\nIntraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) indices might be derived for these\nmodels. Our method allows us to independently identify latent similarities\nbetween subjects and raters and can be applied in precise education to improve\npersonalised teaching programs or interventions.

    "abstract": "Objective: Scientific publications play a crucial role in uncovering\ninsights, testing novel drugs, and shaping healthcare policies. Accessing the\nquality of publications requires evaluating their Risk of Bias (RoB), a process\ntypically conducted by human reviewers. In this study, we introduce a new\ndataset for machine reading comprehension and RoB assessment and present RoBIn\n(Risk of Bias Inference), an innovative model crafted to automate such\nevaluation. The model employs a dual-task approach, extracting evidence from a\ngiven context and assessing the RoB based on the gathered evidence. Methods: We\nuse data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) as ground\ntruth to label open-access clinical trial publications from PubMed. This\nprocess enabled us to develop training and test datasets specifically for\nmachine reading comprehension and RoB inference. Additionally, we created\nextractive (RoBInExt) and generative (RoBInGen) Transformer-based approaches to\nextract relevant evidence and classify the RoB effectively. Results: RoBIn is\nevaluated across various settings and benchmarked against state-of-the-art\nmethods for RoB inference, including large language models in multiple\nscenarios. In most cases, the best-performing RoBIn variant surpasses\ntraditional machine learning and LLM-based approaches, achieving an ROC AUC of\n0.83. Conclusion: Based on the evidence extracted from clinical trial reports,\nRoBIn performs a binary classification to decide whether the trial is at a low\nRoB or a high/unclear RoB. We found that both RoBInGen and RoBInExt are robust\nand have the best results in many settings.",

To\naddress this controversy, we obtain two new transit observations of WASP-12 b\nwith the optical high-resolution PEPSI spectrograph on the Large Binocular\nTelescope.

We conduct\ninjection-recovery experiments to place constraints on the radial extent of\nWASP-12 b's escaping atmosphere as probed by Balmer lines, but find that our\ndata do not have the sensitivity to probe down to the planet's Roche Lobe.\nUsing physically motivated models of atmospheric escape, we explore upper limit\nconstraints on the planet's mass-loss rate and deem the data quality in the\nwavelength regime of Balmer lines insufficient to determine a physically\nmeaningful constraint. We also conduct a spectral survey of other optical\nabsorbers to trace atmospheric circulation but detect no additional absorption.\nWe conclude that previous claims of H$\\alpha$ absorption from the atmosphere of\nWASP-12 b should be reevaluated.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed as the backbone with\nadditional tools and text information for real-world applications. However,\nintegrating external information into LLM-integrated applications raises\nsignificant security concerns. Among these, prompt injection attacks are\nparticularly threatening, where malicious instructions injected in the external\ntext information can exploit LLMs to generate answers as the attackers desire.\nWhile both training-time and test-time defense methods have been developed to\nmitigate such attacks, the unaffordable training costs associated with\ntraining-time methods and the limited effectiveness of existing test-time\nmethods make them impractical. This paper introduces a novel test-time defense\nstrategy, named Formatting AuThentication with Hash-based tags (FATH). Unlike\nexisting approaches that prevent LLMs from answering additional instructions in\nexternal text, our method implements an authentication system, requiring LLMs\nto answer all received instructions with a security policy and selectively\nfilter out responses to user instructions as the final output. To achieve this,\nwe utilize hash-based authentication tags to label each response, facilitating\naccurate identification of responses according to the user's instructions and\nimproving the robustness against adaptive attacks. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our defense method can effectively defend against indirect\nprompt injection attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance under Llama3\nand GPT3.5 models across various attack methods.

The\nefficiency of this connection, however, depends on the availability of reliable\nchannel state information (CSI). Due to the large space-ground propagation\ndelays, the estimated CSI is outdated. In this paper we consider the downlink\nof a satellite operating as a base station in support of multiple mobile users.\nThe estimated outdated CSI is used at the satellite side to design a transmit\nprecoding (TPC) matrix for the downlink. We propose a deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL)-based approach to optimize the TPC matrices, with the goal of\nmaximizing the achievable data rate. We utilize the deep deterministic policy\ngradient (DDPG) algorithm to handle the continuous action space, and we employ\nstate augmentation techniques to deal with the delayed observations and\nrewards. We show that the DRL agent is capable of exploiting the time-domain\ncorrelations of the channels for constructing accurate TPC matrices. This is\nbecause the proposed method is capable of compensating for the effects of\ndelayed CSI in different frequency bands. Furthermore, we study the effect of\nhandovers in the system, and show that the DRL agent is capable of promptly\nadapting to the environment when a handover occurs.",

    "abstract": "Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a\nheteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism\nbehind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of\ntemplated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the\ntemplate. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the\ntemplate-binding free energies of both correctly-matched and incorrect monomers\nare heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences\nof detachment, and the consequences of heterogeniety for polymerisation speed\nand accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeniety remains\nunexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying\nthat simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge\nof the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing\ncoarse-graining methods for models of polymerisation to allow for heterogeneous\ninteractions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit\ndetachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behaviour observed in the absence of\ndetachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct\nmonomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while\nheterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more\naccurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of\neither correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity\ncan improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but\nthese increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased\nefficiencies of information transfer.",

The usual method for analysing the stability\nof heteroclinic cycles and networks is to construct return maps to\ncross-sections near the network. From these return maps, transition matrices\ncan be defined, whose eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be analysed to determine\nstability. In this paper, we introduce an extension to this methodology, the\nprojected map, which we define by identifying trajectories with, in a certain\nsense, qualitatively the same dynamics. The projected map is a discrete,\npiecewise-smooth map of one dimension one fewer than the rank of the transition\nmatrix. We use these maps to describe the dynamics of trajectories near three\nheteroclinic networks in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ with four equilibria. We find in all\nthree cases that the onset of trajectories that switch between cycles of the\nnetwork can be caused by a fold bifurcation or border-collision bifurcation,\nwhere fixed points of the map no longer exist in the corresponding function's\ndomain of definition. We are able to show that trajectories near these three\nnetworks are asymptotic to only one subcycle, and cannot switch between\nsubcycles multiple times, in contrast to examples with more than four\nequilibria, and resolving a 30-year-old claim by Brannath.

    "abstract": "Follow-up conversations with virtual assistants (VAs) enable a user to\nseamlessly interact with a VA without the need to repeatedly invoke it using a\nkeyword (after the first query). Therefore, accurate Device-directed Speech\nDetection (DDSD) from the follow-up queries is critical for enabling\nnaturalistic user experience. To this end, we explore the notion of Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and model the first query when making inference about\nthe follow-ups (based on the ASR-decoded text), via prompting of a pretrained\nLLM, or by adapting a binary classifier on top of the LLM. In doing so, we also\nexploit the ASR uncertainty when designing the LLM prompts. We show on the\nreal-world dataset of follow-up conversations that this approach yields large\ngains (20-40% reduction in false alarms at 10% fixed false rejects) due to the\njoint modeling of the previous speech context and ASR uncertainty, compared to\nwhen follow-ups are modeled alone.",

We\nintroduce AiSciVision, a framework that specializes Large Multimodal Models\n(LMMs) into interactive research partners and classification models for image\nclassification tasks in niche scientific domains. Our framework uses two key\ncomponents: (1) Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) and (2)\ndomain-specific tools utilized in an agentic workflow. To classify a target\nimage, AiSciVision first retrieves the most similar positive and negative\nlabeled images as context for the LMM. Then the LMM agent actively selects and\napplies tools to manipulate and inspect the target image over multiple rounds,\nrefining its analysis before making a final prediction. These VisRAG and\ntooling components are designed to mirror the processes of domain experts, as\nhumans often compare new data to similar examples and use specialized tools to\nmanipulate and inspect images before arriving at a conclusion. Each inference\nproduces both a prediction and a natural language transcript detailing the\nreasoning and tool usage that led to the prediction. We evaluate AiSciVision on\nthree real-world scientific image classification datasets: detecting the\npresence of aquaculture ponds, diseased eelgrass, and solar panels. Across\nthese datasets, our method outperforms fully supervised models in low and\nfull-labeled data settings. AiSciVision is actively deployed in real-world use,\nspecifically for aquaculture research, through a dedicated web application that\ndisplays and allows the expert users to converse with the transcripts. This\nwork represents a crucial step toward AI systems that are both interpretable\nand effective, advancing their use in scientific research and scientific\ndiscovery.",

Since\ntraditional Bayesian approaches to atmospheric retrieval (e.g., nested\nsampling) are computationally expensive, a growing number of machine learning\n(ML) methods such as neural posterior estimation (NPE) have been proposed. We\nseek to make ML-based atmospheric retrieval (1) more reliable and accurate with\nverified results, and (2) more flexible with respect to the underlying neural\nnetworks and the choice of the assumed noise models. First, we adopt flow\nmatching posterior estimation (FMPE) as a new ML approach to atmospheric\nretrieval. FMPE maintains many advantages of NPE, but provides greater\narchitectural flexibility and scalability. Second, we use importance sampling\n(IS) to verify and correct ML results, and to compute an estimate of the\nBayesian evidence. Third, we condition our ML models on the assumed noise level\nof a spectrum (i.e., error bars), thus making them adaptable to different noise\nmodels. Both our noise level-conditional FMPE and NPE models perform on par\nwith nested sampling across a range of noise levels when tested on simulated\ndata. FMPE trains about 3 times faster than NPE and yields higher IS\nefficiencies. IS successfully corrects inaccurate ML results, identifies model\nfailures via low efficiencies, and provides accurate estimates of the Bayesian\nevidence. FMPE is a powerful alternative to NPE for fast, amortized, and\nparallelizable atmospheric retrieval. IS can verify results, thus helping to\nbuild confidence in ML-based approaches, while also facilitating model\ncomparison via the evidence ratio. Noise level conditioning allows design\nstudies for future instruments to be scaled up, for example, in terms of the\nrange of signal-to-noise ratios.",

In this paper, we propose a\nnew approach incorporating non-Gaussian processes (NGPs) into a hybrid model\nwhich identifies both smooth and rough components. Specifically, we model the\nrough process using scaled mixtures of Gaussian distributions in a Bayesian\nhierarchical model (BHM).\n  Our motivation comes from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble\n(CESM-LE), where we seek to emulate climate sensitivity fields that exhibit\ncomplex spatial patterns, including abrupt transitions at ocean-land\nboundaries. We demonstrate that traditional GP models fail to capture such\nabrupt changes and that our proposed hybrid model, implemented through a full\nGibbs sampler. This significantly improves model interpretability and accurate\nrecovery of process parameters.\n  Through a multi-factor simulation study, we evaluate the performance of\nseveral scaled mixtures designed to model the rough process. The results\nhighlight the advantages of using these heavier tailed priors as a replacement\nto the Bayesian fused LASSO. One prior in particular, the normal Jeffrey's\nprior stands above the rest.

For the case when the\nmonoid is defined by the set of all mixed-integer points contained in a convex\ncone, we show that strong duality holds under milder conditions and over a more\nrestrictive set of dual functions. Finally, we provide some examples of\napplications of our results.",

However, as the key-value (KV) cache expands with the sequence\nlength, the increasing memory footprint and the need to access it for each\ntoken generation both result in low throughput when serving long-context LLMs.\nWhile various dynamic sparse attention methods have been proposed to speed up\ninference while maintaining generation quality, they either fail to\nsufficiently reduce GPU memory consumption or introduce significant decoding\nlatency by offloading the KV cache to the CPU. We present ShadowKV, a\nhigh-throughput long-context LLM inference system that stores the low-rank key\ncache and offloads the value cache to reduce the memory footprint for larger\nbatch sizes and longer sequences. To minimize decoding latency, ShadowKV\nemploys an accurate KV selection strategy that reconstructs minimal sparse KV\npairs on-the-fly.

While deep\nlearning models can generate 3D rock microstructures that match static rock\nproperties, they have two key limitations: they don't account for the spatial\ndistribution of rock properties that can have an important influence on the\nflow and transport characteristics (such as permeability and relative\npermeability) of the rock and they generate structures below the representative\nelementary volume (REV) scale for those transport properties. Addressing these\nissues is crucial for building a consistent workflow between pore-scale\nanalysis and field-scale modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a\ntwo-stage modeling framework that combines a Vector Quantized Variational\nAutoencoder (VQVAE) and a transformer model for spatial upscaling and\narbitrary-size 3D porous media reconstruction in an autoregressive manner. The\nVQVAE first compresses and quantizes sub-volume training images into\nlow-dimensional tokens, while we train a transformer to spatially assemble\nthese tokens into larger images following specific spatial order. By employing\na multi-token generation strategy, our approach preserves both sub-volume\nintegrity and spatial relationships among these sub-image patches. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-token transformer generation\napproach and validate it using real data from a test well, showcasing its\npotential to generate models for the porous media at the well scale using only\na spatial porosity model.

Furthermore, our results suggest that,\nto first order, dissipation effects do not appear to significantly impede this\nprocess, and that it can feasibly generate coherent seed fields on\nmacroscopically large ISM scales (much larger than turbulent dissipation scales\nor electron mean-free-paths in the ISM). These seed fields could then be\namplified by subsequent dynamo actions to the observed magnetic fields in\ngalaxies.

We investigate the possibility of using\nSAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image\ndiffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by\ntransformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting.\nInterestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to\nthe multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional\ntraining. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable,\ncausally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the\nblocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing\nbenchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off\nindividual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks'\nfeatures are the most impactful depending on the edit category.

This work probes\nthe archetypal wind-accreting HMXB Vela X-1 using MAXI observations over 14\nyears, focusing on orbit-to-orbit absorption variability in the 2-10 keV band.\nAdditionally, the relation between hardness ratio trends in binary orbits and\nneutron star spin states is investigated. We calculate hardness ratios to track\nabsorption variability, comparing flux changes across energy bands, as the\neffect of absorption on the flux is energy-dependent. Variability is analyzed\nby comparing hardness ratio trends across binary orbits to the MAXI long-term\naveraged evolution. The long-term averaged hardness ratio evolution displays a\nstable pattern. Yet, individual binary orbits reveal different hardness ratio\nevolutions between consecutive orbits with no evident periodicity. Less than\nhalf of the binary orbits align with the long-term evolution. Moreover, neutron\nstar spin-up episodes exhibit harder-than-average hardness trends compared to\nspin-down episodes, although their distributions overlap considerably. The\nlong-term averaged hardness ratio dispersion is consistent with absorption\ncolumn densities reported in literature from shorter observations, suggesting\nthat heterogeneous wind structures, including accretion wakes and wind clumps,\ndrive observed variations. The orbit-to-orbit variability indicates that\npointed X-ray observations provide limited insight into wind structure.

    "abstract": "Gradient attacks and data poisoning tamper with the training of machine\nlearning algorithms to maliciously alter them and have been proven to be\nequivalent in convex settings. The extent of harm these attacks can produce in\nnon-convex settings is still to be determined. Gradient attacks can affect far\nless systems than data poisoning but have been argued to be more harmful since\nthey can be arbitrary, whereas data poisoning reduces the attacker's power to\nonly being able to inject data points to training sets, via e.g. legitimate\nparticipation in a collaborative dataset. This raises the question of whether\nthe harm made by gradient attacks can be matched by data poisoning in\nnon-convex settings. In this work, we provide a positive answer in a worst-case\nscenario and show how data poisoning can mimic a gradient attack to perform an\navailability attack on (non-convex) neural networks. Through gradient\ninversion, commonly used to reconstruct data points from actual gradients, we\nshow how reconstructing data points out of malicious gradients can be\nsufficient to perform a range of attacks. This allows us to show, for the first\ntime, an availability attack on neural networks through data poisoning, that\ndegrades the model's performances to random-level through a minority (as low as\n1%) of poisoned points.",

The evolution of quantum signals through the direct-sequence spread\nspectrum multiple access communication system is carefully characterized by a\nnovel approach called the decomposition of creation operators. In this\nmethodology, the creation operator of the transmitted quantum signal is\ndecomposed into the chip-time interval creation operators each of which is\ndefined over the duration of a chip. These chip-time interval creation\noperators are the invariant building blocks of the spread spectrum quantum\ncommunication systems. With the aid of the proposed chip-time decomposition\napproach, we can find closed-form relations for quantum signals at the receiver\nof such a quantum communication system. Further, the paper details the\nprinciples of narrow-band filtering of quantum signals required at the\nreceiver, a crucial step in designing and analyzing quantum communication\nsystems. We show that by employing coherent states as the transmitted quantum\nsignals, the inter-user interference appears as an additive term in the\nmagnitude of the output coherent (Glauber) state, and the output of the quantum\ncommunication system is a pure quantum signal. On the other hand, if the\ntransmitters utilize particle-like quantum signals (Fock states) such as single\nphoton states, entanglement and a spread spectrum version of the Hong-Ou-Mandel\neffect can arise at the receivers. The important techniques developed in this\npaper are expected to have far-reaching implications for various applications\nin the exciting field of quantum communication and signal processing.",

Building upon this\ninsight, we introduce a novel architecture the Temporal Linear Net (TLN), that\nextends the capabilities of linear models while maintaining interpretability\nand computational efficiency. TLN is designed to effectively capture both\ntemporal and feature-wise dependencies in multivariate time series data. Our\napproach is a variant of TSMixer that maintains strict linearity throughout its\narchitecture. TSMixer removes activation functions, introduces specialized\nkernel initializations, and incorporates dilated convolutions to handle various\ntime scales, while preserving the linear nature of the model. Unlike\ntransformer-based models that may lose temporal information due to their\npermutation-invariant nature, TLN explicitly preserves and leverages the\ntemporal structure of the input data. A key innovation of TLN is its ability to\ncompute an equivalent linear model, offering a level of interpretability not\nfound in more complex architectures such as TSMixer. This feature allows for\nseamless conversion between the full TLN model and its linear equivalent,\nfacilitating both training flexibility and inference optimization.",

The starting point of the derivation is a\nmicroscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing\nequation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived.\nFrom this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the\nshear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming\ntransition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the\nvanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as\noriginally demonstrated in [Zaccone & Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205\n(2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in\nparameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys.\nRev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity\nupon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the\nfirst time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic\nprediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with\nnumerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson & Teitel, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 99, 178001 (2007)].",

However, to enhance its utility and reduce potential harm, SFT and\nalignment are applied sequentially to the pretrained model. Due to the\ndiffering nature and objective functions of SFT and alignment, catastrophic\nforgetting has become a significant issue. To address this, we introduce\nUnified Fine-Tuning (UFT), which integrates SFT and alignment into a single\ntraining stage using the same objective and loss functions through an implicit\nreward function. Our experimental results demonstrate that UFT outperforms SFT\non instruction-tuning data alone. Moreover, when combining instruction-tuning\ndata with alignment data, UFT effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting\nacross these two stages and shows a clear advantage over sequentially applying\nSFT and alignment. This is evident in the significant improvements observed in\nthe \\textbf{ifeval} task for instruction-following and the \\textbf{truthful-qa}\ntask for factuality. The proposed general fine-tuning framework UFT establishes\nan effective and efficient pretraining-UFT paradigm for LLM training.",

We applied\nspatially resolved spectral energy distribution fitting to the latest iteration\nof infrared data to get constraints on the galaxy dust masses and the\nsmall-to-large grain abundance ratio. For comparison, we took the radial\nprofiles of the stellar mass and gas mass surface density for NGC628 combined\nwith its metallicity gradient in the literature to calibrate a single-galaxy\nsimulation using the GADGET4-OSAKA code. The simulations include a\nparametrization to separate the dense and diffuse phases of the ISM where\ndifferent dust-evolution mechanisms are in action.

Changing the dust-accretion timescale has little impact on\nthe dust mass or SLR, as most of the available metals are accreted onto dust\ngrains at early times (< 3Gyr), except in the outer regions of the galaxy.

The HD 45364 system, discovered via the\nradial velocity (RV) method to host two giant planets in a 3:2 MMR, has been\nthe subject of several studies attempting to reconstruct the system's orbital\nmigration history based on its present-day resonant configuration. Recently, Li\net al. (2022) called into question the system's residence in the 3:2 MMR based\non a revised orbital solution derived from an expanded set of RV observations\nthat extend the time baseline of the original discovery data by over a decade.\nHowever, we show that inferences about the planets' dynamical state with\nrespect to the 3:2 MMR are sensitive to the particular prior assumptions\nadopted in the orbital modeling. Using $N$-body dynamical models, we show that\norbital solutions constrained to reside deep in the 3:2 MMR fit the RV data\nwith a similar quality to unconstrained orbital solutions. We conclude that the\nRV observations of HD 45364 are consistent with orbital configurations produced\nby smooth migration and resonance capture. We further show that past convergent\norbital migration can reproduce the system's present-day orbital configuration\nprovided that the ratio of migration to eccentricity damping timescales, $K$,\nwas in the range $11\\lesssim K \\lesssim 144$. We also find that dynamical\ninteractions in the system can break the usual mass-inclination degeneracy\ninherent to Keplerian models of RV observations and constrain the planets'\nabsolute masses to within a factor of $\\sim1.5$.",

    "abstract": "Metal nitrides possess exceptional catalytic, electronic and physical\nproperties making them widely used in (opto-)electronics and as hard coatings.\nWhen used as films in surface-active applications, however, their performance\nremains limited by poor mass transfer and reduced accessibility of reactive\nsites. This is associated to compact film architecture yielded by conventional\ndeposition techniques (e.g., 16-26% for sputtered W$_2$N). Here, we demonstrate\na template-free method for the design of highly porous (porosity > 84%) metal\nnitride films with high compositional versatility, as demonstrated for Cu3N,\nW2N, MoNx and TiN. These are obtained by exploiting the self-assembly of\nfractal-like metal oxide agglomerates during deposition from aerosols followed\nby their dry nitridation. In case of Cu$_3$N, monocristalline oxide\nnanoparticles were converted to polycrystalline nitrides during nitridation, as\ntraced by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Such films feature\nconsistently lower resistances than their metal oxide counterparts, as well as\nhigh reactivity and mass transfer. This is exploited exemplarily for molecular\nsensing of NO$_2$ at only 75$^\\circ$C temperature, leading to up to a five-fold\nhigher response with faster response time over more compact spin-coated films\nfor. As a result, our approach overcomes critical mass transfer performance\nlimitations of metal nitride films that are also relevant for other\napplications like electrocatalysis and energy storage.",

    "abstract": "Tree tensor network states (TTNS) generalize the notion of having low\nSchmidt-rank to multipartite quantum states, through a parameter known as the\nbond dimension. This leads to succinct representations of quantum many-body\nsystems with a tree-like entanglement structure. In this work, we study the\ntask of testing whether an unknown pure state is a TTNS on $n$ qudits with bond\ndimension at most $r$, or is far in trace distance from any such state. We\nfirst establish that, independent of the physical dimensions, $O(nr^2)$ copies\nof the state suffice to acccomplish this task with one-sided error, as in the\nmatrix product state (MPS) test of Soleimanifar and Wright. We then prove that\n$\\Omega(n r^2/\\log n)$ copies are necessary for any test with one-sided error\nwhenever $r\\geq 2 + \\log n$. In particular, this closes a quadratic gap in the\nprevious bounds for MPS testing in this setting, up to log factors. On the\nother hand, when $r=2$ we show that $\\Theta(\\sqrt{n})$ copies are both\nnecessary and sufficient for the related task of testing whether a state is a\nproduct of $n$ bipartite states having Schmidt-rank at most $r$, for some\nchoice of physical dimensions.\n  We also study the performance of tests using measurements performed on a\nsmall number of copies at a time. In the setting of one-sided error, we prove\nthat adaptive measurements offer no improvement over non-adaptive measurements\nfor many properties, including TTNS. We then derive a closed-form solution for\nthe acceptance probability of an $(r+1)$-copy rank test with rank parameter\n$r$. This leads to nearly tight bounds for testing rank, Schmidt-rank, and TTNS\nwhen the tester is restricted to making measurements on $r+1$ copies at a time.\nFor example, when $r=2$ there is an MPS test with one-sided error which uses\n$O(n^2)$ copies and measurements performed on just three copies at a time.",

Tracing opposite phases of the IGM on\nlarge scales during reionization, the two signals together serve as a powerful\nprobe for the reionization history. However, because long-wavelength,\nline-of-sight Fourier modes -- the only modes probed by NIRB fluctuations --\nare contaminated by 21 cm foregrounds and thus inevitably lost to foreground\ncleaning or avoidance, a direct cross-correlation of the two signals vanishes.\nWe show that this problem can be circumvented by squaring the\nforeground-filtered 21 cm signal and cross-correlating the squared field with\nthe NIRB. This statistic is related to the 21 cm--21 cm--NIRB cross-bispectrum\nand encodes valuable information regarding the reionization timeline.\nParticularly, the 21 cm$^2$ and NIRB signals are positively correlated during\nthe early phases of reionization and negatively correlated at later stages. We\ndemonstrate that this behavior is generic across several different reionization\nmodels and compare our simulated results with perturbative calculations.

Based on this framework, we study the\nprospect of using galaxy summary statistics to distinguish models where SFR\nfluctuations are prescribed by different power spectral density (PSD) forms.\nUsing the Fisher matrix approach, we forecast the constraints on parameters in\nour PSD-based model that can be extracted from mock JWST observations of the UV\nand H$\\alpha$ luminosity functions and clustering bias factors at $z\\sim6$.\nThese constraints demonstrate the feasibility of constraining the burstiness of\nhigh-$z$ galaxies solely from their one-point and two-point statistics and\nunderscore the importance of combining tracers of both long-term and short-term\nSFR variations. Our flexible framework can be readily extended to characterize\nthe SFH of high-redshift galaxies with a wider range of observational\ndiagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Sub-dimensional localization, also known as directional localization, arises\nwhen 2d electrons are subject to a periodic potential and incommensurate\nmagnetic field which cause them to become exponentially localized along one\ncrystal axis, while remaining extended in the orthogonal direction. We\nestablish that sub-dimensional localization is robust to the presence of\nelectronic interactions, which are known to generically destabilize\nsingle-particle localization. Consequently we predict that sub-dimensional\nlocalization may occur in moire materials, where it is manifest as a total\nabsence of conductivity in the localized (transverse) direction, with finite\nconductivity in the extended (longitudinal) direction. We find the electrons\nform longitudinal charge density waves which are incommensurate with the moire\npotential, allowing them to slide and hence conduct in the longitudinal\ndirection. The conductivity remains prohibited in the transverse direction due\nan emergent charge dipole moment conservation law.",

In this work, we show how robust\nsteady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological\norder can be stabilized against generic ``heralded\" noise using active dynamics\nthat incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a $\\textit{fully local}$\nLindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way\nconnected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum\nchannels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially\nlarge in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of\nfamilies of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\\mathbb{Z}_2$) and\nnon-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state\ntopological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise\nstrength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to\nintermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories,\nfollowed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise\nrates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears\nbut our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded\nlogical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian\n$D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that\npermits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.",

To this end, we have developed a fully data-driven approach to\nmodel the metal-dependent SFR and coupled it to BBH evolution. We have adopted\nthe most up-to-date scaling relations, based on recent observational results,\nand we have studied how the BBH merger rate density varies over a wide grid of\ngalaxy and binary evolution parameters. Our results show that including a\nrealistic metal-dependent SFR evolution yields a value of the merger rate\ndensity which is too high compared to the one inferred from gravitational-wave\ndata. Moreover, variations in the SFR in low-mass galaxies ($M_\\ast \\lesssim\n10^8 \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) do not contribute more than a factor $\\sim 2$ to the\noverall merger rate density at redshift $z=0$.

The closest binaries, those with periods of less than about 10 days,\nundergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning, with many of them\nexperiencing a nuclear-timescale contact phase. Current binary population\nsynthesis models predict the mass-ratio distribution of contact binaries to be\nheavily skewed toward a mass ratio of unity, which is inconsistent with\nobservations. It has been shown that effects of tidal deformation due to the\nRoche potential, as well as energy transfer in the common layers of a contact\nbinary, alter the internal structure of close binary components. However,\nprevious population studies neglected these effects. We model a population of\nmassive binary stars that undergo mass transfer during core-hydrogen burning,\nwhile consistently considering the effects of tidal deformation and energy\ntransfer in contact phases. We use the MESA binary-evolution code to compute\nlarge grids of models with primary star masses of $8\\,M_\\odot$ to $70\\,M_\\odot$\nat Solar metallicity. We then perform a population synthesis study to predict\ndistribution functions of the observational properties of close binary systems,\nfocusing in particular on the mass and luminosity ratio distribution. We find\nthat the effects of tidal deformation and energy transfer have a limited effect\non the predicted mass-ratio distribution of massive contact binaries. Only a\nsmall fraction of the population has their mass ratio significantly shifted\ntoward a more unequal configuration. However, we suggest that orbital hardening\ncould affect the evolution of contact binaries and their progenitors, and we\nadvocate for a homogeneous set of observed contact binary parameters.",

The additional pseudospin degrees of freedom in this model could\nprovide greater stability against perturbations, making this model appealing.\nHowever, a mechanism to realize such an interaction in a standard honeycomb\nlattice remains unknown.

This\nmechanism leads to the desired bond-dependent interaction among spins rather\nthan orbitals, unique to our model, implying that the orbitals fractionalize\ninto gapless Majorana fermions and fermionic octupolar excitations emerge.\nSince the conventional Kugel-Khomskii interaction also appears, we examine the\nphase diagram including these interactions using classical Monte Carlo\nsimulations and exact diagonalization techniques.

We present several\napplications of spin-phonon pumping two-dimensional nearest-neighbor\nHeisenberg, XYZ and Kitaev models to examine what kind of further neighbor\ninteractions and chiral fields can be generated, and how anisotropic couplings\ncan be enhanced, showing that experimentally accessible non-equilibrium phonon\ndistributions can generically drive significant frustration and realize a\nvariety of spin liquid regimes. This effect is described for both direct and\nsuperexchange mechanisms, and we derive simple geometric rules for which phonon\nmodes are \"spin-phonon'' active and for which magnetic interactions.\nSpin-phonon pumping provides an intriguing possibility for preferentially\npumping specific magnetic interaction terms. In addition to generating further\nneighbor interactions, such pumping can lead to increased magnetic anisotropy\nfor initially weakly anisotropic models, and selectively pumping the\nKitaev-Heisenberg model can suppress undesirable Heisenberg terms while\nenhancing Kitaev interactions.",

The FIRE-2 cosmological simulations of MW-mass galaxies show the same\ntrend as the MW, which in FIRE-2 arises because the metallicity gradient of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), and thus of stars at birth, became steeper over\ntime. We seek to understand this evolution in the context of inside-out radial\ngrowth of galaxies. Most FIRE-2 galaxies grew radially inside-out in both gas\nand stars; specifically, their surface density profiles, $\\Sigma(R)$, became\nshallower over time. Combined with a realized superlinear\n(Kennicutt-Schmidt-like) relation between star formation and total gas density,\nthe profile of the ratio $\\Sigma_{\\rm star}(R)/\\Sigma_{\\rm gas}(R)$ became\nshallower (flatter) over time. Thus, if metals stayed where they were injected\ninto the ISM from stars, the metallicity gradient would become shallower over\ntime, as some models predict. However, metallicity gradients in FIRE-2 became\nsteeper over time, because of the additional effects of (radial) mixing of\nmetals in the ISM. Specifically, the velocity dispersion and net radial\nadvection of gas declined over time, as ISM turbulence decreased and the disk\nsettled, leading to upside-down vertical growth. In FIRE-2, this evolution in\nmetal mixing of gas associated with upside-down growth dominates over\ninside-out radial growth, causing the metallicity radial gradient of the ISM\nand of stars at birth to become steeper over time. We argue that this reflects\nthe ISM history of the MW and of typical MW-mass galaxies.",

As a\nresult, the discrepancies seen in GR between the total lensing mass of galaxies\nand their stellar mass from photometry may be accounted for. This holds true\nboth for lenses at high redshift like JWST-ER1 and at low redshift like in the\nSLACS sample.

The second maximum\nis followed by periodic undulations with a period of P ~ 12.5 days.

One\npossibility is that the second maximum is powered by a magnetar with an initial\nspin period of P=48.5 ms and a magnetic field of B = 8.5x10^{14} G, while the\nlight curve periodic undulations could be produced by accretion of material\nfrom a companion star onto the neutron star in a binary system.

To untangle this, we consider the\nmixtures of chemical information, in a given region of integral of motion\nspace, as a variant of the blind source separation problem using non-negative\nmatrix factorisation (NMF). Specifically, we examine the variation in [Fe/H],\n[Mg/Fe], and [Al/Fe] distributions of APOGEE DR17 stars across the $(E,L_z)$\nplane of the halo. When 2 components are prescribed, the NMF algorithm splits\nstellar halo into low- and high-energy components in the $(E,L_z)$ plane which\napproximately correspond to the accreted and \\textit{in-situ} halo\nrespectively. We use these components to define a boundary between the\n\\textit{in-situ} and the accreted stellar halo, and calculate their fractional\ncontribution to the stellar halo as a function of energy, galactocentric\nspherical radius ($r$), height ($z$), and galactocentric cylindrical radius\n($R$). Using a stellar halo defined by kinematic cuts, we derive a boundary in\n$(E,L_z)$ space where the halo transitions from \\textit{in-situ} dominated to\naccretion dominated. Spatially, we find that this transition happens at\n$(r,z,R) \\approx (8.7, 3.0, 8.1)$ kpc. We find that between 34\\% to 53\\% of the\nstellar halo's content is of accreted origin. Upon prescribing more components\nto the NMF model, we find evidence for overlapping chemical evolution\nsequences. We examine features within these components that resemble known\nsubstructures in the halo, such as \\textit{Eos} and \\textit{Aurora}.",

Identified X-ray cavities vary in configuration\n(single, pairs, or multiples), with some still attached to SMBHs, while others\nhave buoyantly risen. Their size ranges from a few to several tens of kpc. In\nterms of gas physical properties, TNG-Cluster X-ray cavities are underdense\ncompared to the surrounding halo and filled with hot gas ($\\sim$10$^8$K); 25\nper cent of them are surrounded by an X-ray bright and compressed rim\nassociated with a weak shock (Mach number $\\sim 1.5$).

Although these\ntemplates are informed by various physical expectations, the morphology of the\nexcess is a priori unknown. For the first time, we describe the GCE using a\nflexible, non-parametric machine learning model -- the Gaussian process (GP).\nWe assess our model's performance on synthetic data, demonstrating that the\nmodel can recover the templates used to generate the data. We then fit the\n\\Fermi data with our model in a single energy bin from 2-20 GeV (leaving a\nspectral GP analysis of the GCE for future work) using a variety of template\nmodels of diffuse gamma-ray emission to quantify our fits' systematic\nuncertainties associated with diffuse emission modeling. We interpret our\nbest-fit GP in terms of GCE templates consisting of an NFW squared template and\na bulge component to determine which bulge models can best describe the fitted\nGP and to what extent the best-fit GP is described better by an NFW squared\ntemplate versus a bulge template. The best-fit GP contains morphological\nfeatures that are typically not associated with traditional GCE studies. These\ninclude a localized bright source at around $(\\ell,b) = (20^{\\circ},\n0^{\\circ})$ and a diagonal arm extending Northwest from the Galactic Center. In\nspite of these novel features, the fitted GP is explained best by a\ntemplate-based model consisting of the bulge presented in Coleman et al. (2020)\nand a squared NFW component. Our results suggest that the physical\ninterpretation of the GCE in terms of stellar bulge and NFW-like components is\nhighly sensitive to the assumed morphologies, background models, and the region\nof the sky used for inference.",

Some models predict that stars form in atomic gas at low\nmetallicity, in contrast to forming in molecular gas as observed in\nhigher-metallicity galaxies. To understand the very high star-formation rates\nat early epochs, it is necessary to determine whether molecular gas formation\nrepresents a bottleneck to star formation, or if it is plentiful even at\nextremely low metallicity. Despite repeated searches, star-forming molecular\ngas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% of the Solar metallicity,\nleaving the question of how stars form at lower metallicities unresolved. Here,\nwe report the detection of rotationally excited emission from molecular\nhydrogen in the star-forming region of the nearby, 3% Solar metallicity galaxy\nLeo P with the MIRI-MRS instrument onboard JWST. These observations place a\nlower limit on the molecular gas content of Leo P and, combined with our upper\nlimit on carbon monoxide emission from a deep search of this galaxy,\ndemonstrate that MIRI-MRS is sensitive to much smaller molecular gas masses at\nextremely low metallicity compared to the traditional observational tracer.\nThis discovery pushes the maximum metallicity at which purely atomic gas may\nfuel star formation a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance\nfor models of star formation in the early universe.",

The proposal addresses\nthe challenges posed to the axion dark matter scenario by an overabundance of\naxions overclosing the Universe, as well as by isocurvature constraints. Many\nstate-of-the-art experiments are searching for QCD axion dark matter with a\ndecay constant as large as $10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, motivating the need for a\ntheoretical framework such as ours. In our model, hidden sector magnetic\nmonopoles generated in the early Universe give the axion a large mass via the\nWitten effect, causing early oscillations that reduce the misalignment angle\nand axion abundance. As the hidden gauge symmetry breaks, its monopoles confine\nvia cosmic strings, dissipating energy into the Standard Model and leading to\nmonopole-antimonopole annihilation. This removes the monopole-induced mass,\nleaving only the standard QCD term. We consider the symmetry breaking pattern\nof $\\mathrm{SU}(2)' \\to \\mathrm{U}(1)' \\to 1$, leading to monopole and string\nformation respectively. We calculate the monopole abundance, their interactions\nwith the axion field, and the necessary conditions for monopole-induced axion\noscillations, while accounting for UV instanton effects. We present three model\nvariations based on different symmetry breaking scales and show that they can\naccommodate an axion decay constant of up to $10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$ with an\ninflationary scale of $10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$.

In this work, we obtain the\nnear-infrared spectrum for 42 clumpy and non-clumpy star-forming galaxies of\nsimilar masses, SFRs, and colors at $z\\approx0.7$ using the Gemini\nNear-Infrared Spectrograph (GNIRS) and infer their gas-phase metallicity from\nthe {\\nii} and {\\halpha} line ratio.

Similarly, lower {\\nii}/{\\halpha} ratio are typically found\nin galaxies that have more of their $\\mathrm{UV_{rest}}$ luminosity originating\nfrom clumps, suggesting that \\enquote{clumpier} galaxies are more metal poor.\nWe also derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion and line-of-sight rotational\nvelocity for galaxies from the GNIRS sample.

To that end, we study the bandstructure of\ntwisted moir\\'e potentials in detail. At sets of commensurate twisting angles,\nthe low energy single-particle spectrum of a twisted moir\\'e potential will\nform into distinct bands and gaps. To a first approximation, energy bands can\nbe qualitatively modelled by harmonic states, localised in different potential\nminima. The bands are intrinsically linked to the number of distinct minima and\nsize of the moir\\'e unit cell, with smaller cells producing larger gaps and\nvice versa. For shallower potential depths, degeneracies between harmonic\nstates are lifted by virtue of anharmonic confinement and coupling between\nstates. Depending on the exact geometry of potential minima, bands can then be\nclassified by $4$ unique forms of tight-binding models. We find excellent\nagreement between the continuous spectrum and fitting to our tight-binding\nmodels, allowing for accurate tunnelling rates and onsite energies to be\nextracted. Our results are directly relevant to the bosonic, many-body problem,\nand thus provide further understanding on the relative stability of quantum\nphases both in theory and experiments.

    "abstract": "Despite their wide-scale deployment and ability to make accurate\nhigh-frequency voltage measurements, communication network limitations have\nlargely precluded the use of smart meters for real-time monitoring purposes in\nelectric distribution systems. Although smart meter communication networks have\nlimited bandwidth available per meter, they also have the ability to dedicate\nhigher bandwidth to varying subsets of meters. Using this capability to enable\nreal-time monitoring from smart meters, this paper proposes an online\nbandwidth-constrained sensor sampling algorithm that takes advantage of the\ngraphical structure inherent in the power flow equations. The key idea is to\nuse a spectral bandit framework where the estimated parameters are the graph\nFourier transform coefficients of the nodal voltages. The structure provided by\nthis framework promotes a sampling policy that strategically accounts for\nelectrical distance. Maxima of sub-Gaussian random variables model the policy\nrewards, which relaxes distributional assumptions common in prior work. The\nscheme is implemented on a synthetic electrical network to dynamically identify\nmeters exposing violations of voltage magnitude limits, illustrating the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The scaling up has brought tremendous success in the fields of vision and\nlanguage in recent years. When it comes to audio, however, researchers\nencounter a major challenge in scaling up the training data, as most natural\naudio contains diverse interfering signals. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Omni-modal Sound Separation (OmniSep), a novel framework capable of\nisolating clean soundtracks based on omni-modal queries, encompassing both\nsingle-modal and multi-modal composed queries. Specifically, we introduce the\nQuery-Mixup strategy, which blends query features from different modalities\nduring training. This enables OmniSep to optimize multiple modalities\nconcurrently, effectively bringing all modalities under a unified framework for\nsound separation. We further enhance this flexibility by allowing queries to\ninfluence sound separation positively or negatively, facilitating the retention\nor removal of specific sounds as desired. Finally, OmniSep employs a\nretrieval-augmented approach known as Query-Aug, which enables open-vocabulary\nsound separation. Experimental evaluations on MUSIC, VGGSOUND-CLEAN+, and\nMUSIC-CLEAN+ datasets demonstrate effectiveness of OmniSep, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in text-, image-, and audio-queried sound\nseparation tasks.

In the weighted variant of this problem, each page has its own fetching\ncost; a substantial line of work on this problem culminated in an (optimal)\n$O(\\log k)$-competitive randomized algorithm, due to Bansal, Buchbinder and\nNaor (FOCS'07).\n  Existing work for weighted paging assumes that page weights are known in\nadvance, which is not always the case in practice. For example, in multi-level\ncaching architectures, the expected cost of fetching a memory block is a\nfunction of its probability of being in a mid-level cache rather than the main\nmemory. This complex property cannot be predicted in advance; over time,\nhowever, one may glean information about page weights through sampling their\nfetching cost multiple times.\n  We present the first algorithm for online weighted paging that does not know\npage weights in advance, but rather learns from weight samples. In terms of\ntechniques, this requires providing (integral) samples to a fractional solver,\nrequiring a delicate interface between this solver and the randomized rounding\nscheme; we believe that our work can inspire online algorithms to other\nproblems that involve cost sampling.",

Modular dualization\ninvolves first assigning operator norms to layers based on the semantics of\neach layer, and then using these layerwise norms to recursively induce a\nduality map on the weight space of the full neural architecture.

This design allows LARP to capture more global and semantic\nrepresentations, rather than being limited to local patch-level information.\nFurthermore, it offers flexibility by supporting an arbitrary number of\ndiscrete tokens, enabling adaptive and efficient tokenization based on the\nspecific requirements of the task. To align the discrete token space with\ndownstream AR generation tasks, LARP integrates a lightweight AR transformer as\na training-time prior model that predicts the next token on its discrete latent\nspace. By incorporating the prior model during training, LARP learns a latent\nspace that is not only optimized for video reconstruction but is also\nstructured in a way that is more conducive to autoregressive generation.\nMoreover, this process defines a sequential order for the discrete tokens,\nprogressively pushing them toward an optimal configuration during training,\nensuring smoother and more accurate AR generation at inference time.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate LARP's strong performance, achieving\nstate-of-the-art FVD on the UCF101 class-conditional video generation\nbenchmark.

BPI (Blind Power Identification) is a recent\napproach that determines the power consumption of different cores and the\nthermal model of the chip using only thermal sensor measurements and total\npower consumption. BPI relies on steady-state thermal data along with a naive\ninitialization in its Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) process, which\nnegatively impacts the power estimation accuracy of BPI. This paper proposes a\ntwo-fold approach to reduce these impacts on BPI. First, this paper introduces\nan innovative approach for NMF initializing, i.e., density-oriented spatial\nclustering to identify centroid data points of active cores as initial values.\nThis enhances BPI accuracy by focusing on dense regions in the dataset and\nexcluding outlier data points. Second, it proposes the utilization of\nsteady-state temperature data points to enhance the power estimation accuracy\nby leveraging the physical relationship between temperature and power\nconsumption. Our extensive simulations of real-world cases demonstrate that our\napproach enhances BPI accuracy in estimating the power per core with no\nperformance cost. For instance, in a four-core processor, the proposed approach\nreduces the error rate by 76% compared to BPI and by 24% compared to the state\nof the art in the literature, namely, Blind Power Identification Steady State\n(BPISS).

    "abstract": "Treatment selection in breast cancer is guided by molecular subtypes and\nclinical characteristics. However, current tools including genomic assays lack\nthe accuracy required for optimal clinical decision-making. We developed a\nnovel artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach that integrates digital\npathology images with clinical data, providing a more robust and effective\nmethod for predicting the risk of cancer recurrence in breast cancer patients.\nSpecifically, we utilized a vision transformer pan-cancer foundation model\ntrained with self-supervised learning to extract features from digitized\nH&E-stained slides. These features were integrated with clinical data to form a\nmulti-modal AI test predicting cancer recurrence and death. The test was\ndeveloped and evaluated using data from a total of 8,161 female breast cancer\npatients across 15 cohorts originating from seven countries. Of these, 3,502\npatients from five cohorts were used exclusively for evaluation, while the\nremaining patients were used for training. Our test accurately predicted our\nprimary endpoint, disease-free interval, in the five evaluation cohorts\n(C-index: 0.71 [0.68-0.75], HR: 3.63 [3.02-4.37, p<0.001]). In a direct\ncomparison (n=858), the AI test was more accurate than Oncotype DX, the\nstandard-of-care 21-gene assay, achieving a C-index of 0.67 [0.61-0.74] versus\n0.61 [0.49-0.73], respectively. Additionally, the AI test added independent\nprognostic information to Oncotype DX in a multivariate analysis (HR: 3.11\n[1.91-5.09, p<0.001)]). The test demonstrated robust accuracy across major\nmolecular breast cancer subtypes, including TNBC (C-index: 0.71 [0.62-0.81],\nHR: 3.81 [2.35-6.17, p=0.02]), where no diagnostic tools are currently\nrecommended by clinical guidelines. These results suggest that our AI test\nimproves upon the accuracy of existing prognostic tests, while being applicable\nto a wider range of patients.",

Many of these models are computed in 1-D to allow for an efficient way\nto account for the variability of properties of their local environment.\nHowever, small-scale simulations revealed that the release of energy from SNe\nwithin molecular clouds can be highly asymmetrical. This is largely due to the\npresence of pre-SN feedback, such as ionizing radiation, that are able to carve\ncavities and channels around the progenitors prior to their detonation. Being\npartially confined, the SN energy escapes into the outer ISM preferentially\nthrough these channels, departing from the spherically symmetric 1-D\ndescriptions. To understand by how much the feedback output could differ, we\npresent a theoretical model for a semi-confined SN. The problem concerns a SN\nexpanding into an evolved HII region, bounded by a molecular cloud with\npre-existing vents. With the aid of simple 3-D hydrodynamical simulations, we\nshow that this mode of energy release increases the local dynamical impact of\nthe outflows, and extends the timescales over which the SN is energetically\ncoupled to the surrounding matter. We also show that the amount of small-scale\nsolenoidal turbulence driven by semi-confined SNe may be amplified.",

First, we\nconsider flavor-diagonal couplings to charged leptons and quantify the expected\namount of dark radiation as a function of the coupling strength. Leptophilic\naxions are immune from complications due to strong interactions and our\npredictions do not suffer from theoretical uncertainties. We then focus on\nflavor-diagonal interactions with the three heavier quarks whose masses are all\nabove the scale where strong interactions become non-perturbative. The top\nquark case is rather safe because its mass is orders of magnitude above the\nconfinement scale, and the consequent predictions are solid. The bottom and\ncharm masses are in more dangerous territory because they are very close to the\nQCD crossover. We present a comprehensive discussion of theoretical\nuncertainties due to both the choice of the scale where we stop the Boltzmann\nevolution and the running of QCD parameters. Finally, we compute the predicted\namount of dark radiation expressed as an effective number of additional\nneutrino species.

Credibility signals provide a more granular, more\neasily explainable and widely utilizable information in contrast to currently\npredominant fake news detection, which utilizes various (mostly latent)\nfeatures. A growing body of research on automatic credibility assessment and\ndetection of credibility signals can be characterized as highly fragmented and\nlacking mutual interconnections.

By combining LongReward and offline RL algorithm DPO, we are able to\neffectively improve long-context SFT models. Our experiments indicate that\nLongReward not only significantly improves models' long-context performance but\nalso enhances their ability to follow short instructions.

    "abstract": "Many real-world sequential repair problems can be effectively modeled using\nmonotonic Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), where the system state\nstochastically decreases and can only be increased by performing a restorative\naction. This work addresses the problem of solving multi-component monotonic\nMDPs with both budget and capacity constraints. The budget constraint limits\nthe total number of restorative actions and the capacity constraint limits the\nnumber of restorative actions that can be performed simultaneously. While prior\nmethods dealt with budget constraints, including capacity constraints in prior\nmethods leads to an exponential increase in computational complexity as the\nnumber of components in the MDP grows. We propose a two-step planning approach\nto address this challenge. First, we partition the components of the\nmulti-component MDP into groups, where the number of groups is determined by\nthe capacity constraint. We achieve this partitioning by solving a Linear Sum\nAssignment Problem (LSAP). Each group is then allocated a fraction of the total\nbudget proportional to its size. This partitioning effectively decouples the\nlarge multi-component MDP into smaller subproblems, which are computationally\nfeasible because the capacity constraint is simplified and the budget\nconstraint can be addressed using existing methods. Subsequently, we use a\nmeta-trained PPO agent to obtain an approximately optimal policy for each\ngroup. To validate our approach, we apply it to the problem of scheduling\nrepairs for a large group of industrial robots, constrained by a limited number\nof repair technicians and a total repair budget. Our results demonstrate that\nthe proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of maximizing the\naverage uptime of the robot swarm, particularly for large swarm sizes.",

The extensive collection of\nfamilies within this problem constitutes a complex network, fundamentally\ncomprising the so-called basic families of periodic solutions, including the\norbits of the satellite $g$, $f$, the libration (Lyapunov) $a,c$, and collision\n$\\mathcal B_0$ families. Since the Conley-Zehnder index leads to a grading on\nthe local Floer homology and its Euler characteristics, a bifurcation\ninvariant, the computation of those indices facilitates the construction of\nwell-organized bifurcation graphs depicting the interconnectedness among\nfamilies of periodic solutions. The critical importance of the symmetries of\nperiodic solutions in comprehending the interaction among these families is\ndemonstrated.",

Recent work has looked to overcome this challenge\nby using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate hypothetical documents that\ncan be used to find the closest real document. However, this approach relies\nsolely on the LLM to have domain-specific knowledge relevant to the query,\nwhich may not be practical. Furthermore, generating hypothetical documents can\nbe inefficient as it requires the LLM to generate a large number of tokens for\neach query. To address these challenges, we introduce Real Document Embeddings\nfrom Relevance Feedback (ReDE-RF). Inspired by relevance feedback, ReDE-RF\nproposes to re-frame hypothetical document generation as a relevance estimation\ntask, using an LLM to select which documents should be used for nearest\nneighbor search. Through this re-framing, the LLM no longer needs\ndomain-specific knowledge but only needs to judge what is relevant.\nAdditionally, relevance estimation only requires the LLM to output a single\ntoken, thereby improving search latency. Our experiments show that ReDE-RF\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot dense retrieval methods\nacross a wide range of low-resource retrieval datasets while also making\nsignificant improvements in latency per-query.",

Recently, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nhave been shown to effectively fine-tune LLMs with an extreme reduction in\ntrainable parameters. But, \\emph{are their learned solutions really\nequivalent?} We study how LoRA and full-finetuning change pre-trained models by\nanalyzing the model's weight matrices through the lens of their spectral\nproperties. We find that LoRA and full fine-tuning yield weight matrices whose\nsingular value decompositions exhibit very different structure: weight matrices\ntrained with LoRA have new, high-ranking singular vectors, which we call\n\\emph{intruder dimensions}, while those trained with full fine-tuning do not.\nFurther, we extend the finding that LoRA forgets less than full fine-tuning and\nfind its forgetting is vastly localized to the intruder dimension -- by\ncausally intervening on the intruder dimensions by changing their associated\nsingular values post-fine-tuning, we show that they cause forgetting. Moreover,\nscaling them down significantly improves modeling of the pre-training\ndistribution with a minimal drop in downstream task performance. Given this, we\nshould expect accumulating intruder dimensions to be harmful and lead to more\nforgetting. This will be amplified during continual learning because of\nsequentially fine-tuning, and we show that LoRA models do accumulate intruder\ndimensions here tend to perform worse in this setting, emphasizing the\npracticality of our findings.",

We present a new framework\nutilizing higher-order cross-correlations to study HI clustering around\ngalaxies, tested using real-space data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation.\nThis approach computes the joint distributions of $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$NN)\noptical galaxies and the HI brightness temperature field smoothed at relevant\nscales (the $k$NN-field framework), providing sensitivity to all higher-order\ncross-correlations, unlike two-point statistics. To simulate HI data from\nactual surveys, we add random thermal noise and apply a simple foreground\ncleaning model, filtering out Fourier modes of the brightness temperature field\nwith $k_\\parallel < k_{\\rm min,\\parallel}$. Under current levels of thermal\nnoise and foreground cleaning, typical of a Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping\nExperiment (CHIME)-like survey, the HI-galaxy cross-correlation signal in our\nsimulations, using the $k$NN-field framework, is detectable at $>30\\sigma$\nacross $r = [3,12] \\, h^{-1}$Mpc. In contrast, the detectability of the\nstandard two-point correlation function (2PCF) over the same scales depends\nstrongly on the foreground filter: a sharp $k_\\parallel$ filter can spuriously\nboost detection to $8\\sigma$ due to position-space ringing, whereas a less\nsharp filter yields no detection. Nonetheless, we conclude that $k$NN-field\ncross-correlations are robustly detectable across a broad range of foreground\nfiltering and thermal noise conditions, suggesting their potential for enhanced\nconstraining power over 2PCFs.",

Schaefer's dichotomy theorem, and its extension to\nall alphabets due to Bulatov and Zhuk, shows that CSP languages are either\nefficiently decidable, or NP-complete. It is possible to extend CSP languages\nto quantum assignments using the formalism of nonlocal games. Due to the\nequality of complexity classes MIP$^\\ast=$ RE, general succinctly-presented\nentangled CSPs are RE-complete. In this work, we show that a wide range of\nNP-complete CSPs become RE-complete in this setting, including all boolean\nCSPs, such as 3SAT, as well as $3$-colouring. This also implies that these CSP\nlanguages remain undecidable even when not succinctly presented.\n  To show this, we work in the weighted algebra framework introduced by Mastel\nand Slofstra, where synchronous strategies for a nonlocal game are represented\nby tracial states on an algebra. Along the way, we improve the subdivision\ntechnique in order to be able to separate constraints in the CSP while\npreserving constant soundness, construct commutativity gadgets for all boolean\nCSPs, and show a variety of relations between the different ways of presenting\nCSPs as games.",

Second, we have developed a novel\nprogressive training framework that enables self-evolving online curriculum\nreinforcement learning for AutoGLM.

The trained transformer is\nthen tested with the sparse data from the target system. The output of the\ntransformer is further fed into a reservoir computer for predicting the\nlong-term dynamics or the attractor of the target system. The power of the\nproposed hybrid machine-learning framework is demonstrated using a large number\nof prototypical nonlinear dynamical systems, with high reconstruction accuracy\neven when the available data is only 20% of that required to faithfully\nrepresent the dynamical behavior of the underlying system.

We used high resolution HI mapping to gain insights into the processes\ndriving the observed properties of a sample of extremely metal poor (XMP) BCDs.\nWe present Very Large Array B- and C-configuration HI mapping of four BCDs. For\nthree of the targeted BCDs we also detect and map the HI in their nearby\ncompanions. In these three cases there is HI evidence for a recent flyby\ninteraction between the BCD and a nearby companion. The HI evidence for recent\ninteractions for these three BCDs is corroborated by our analysis of the tidal\nforces exerted on the BCDs by companions with available spectroscopic\nredshifts. For J0204-1009 we had sufficient spatial resolution to determine\nthat it is dark matter dominated and estimate its DM halo mass to be in the\nrange 1.2 x 10^11 to 5.2 x 10^11 solar masses. It is the most isolated BCD in\nour small sample, J0301-0052, which shows one of the most asymmetric HI\nmorphologies. J0301-0052 has a similar cometary HI morphology to the BCD's\noptical morphology, although the HI column density maximum is projected at the\nend of the of the optical tail. Our HI observations suggest J0301-0052 may be\nundergoing a merger, while the other BCDs show evidence of a recent tidal\ninteraction with a near neighbour. While our selection criteria favoured BCDs\nwith companions our results are consistent with the earlier finding by other\nauthors that most BCDs are associated with either mild tidal interactions or\nmergers.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have sparked significant impact with regard to\nboth intelligence and productivity. Numerous enterprises have integrated LLMs\ninto their applications to solve their own domain-specific tasks. However,\nintegrating LLMs into specific scenarios is a systematic process that involves\nsubstantial components, which are collectively referred to as the LLM supply\nchain. A comprehensive understanding of LLM supply chain composition, as well\nas the relationships among its components, is crucial for enabling effective\nmitigation measures for different related risks. While existing literature has\nexplored various risks associated with LLMs, there remains a notable gap in\nsystematically characterizing the LLM supply chain from the dual perspectives\nof contributors and consumers. In this work, we develop a structured taxonomy\nencompassing risk types, risky actions, and corresponding mitigations across\ndifferent stakeholders and components of the supply chain. We believe that a\nthorough review of the LLM supply chain composition, along with its inherent\nrisks and mitigation measures, would be valuable for industry practitioners to\navoid potential damages and losses, and enlightening for academic researchers\nto rethink existing approaches and explore new avenues of research.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, we have seen that dual quaternion algorithms are used in 3D\ncoordinate transformation problems due to their advantages. 3D coordinate\ntransformation problem is one of the important problems in geodesy. This\ntransformation problem is encountered in many application areas other than\ngeodesy. Although there are many coordinate transformation methods (similarity,\naffine, projective, etc.), similarity transformation is used because of its\nsimplicity. The asymmetric transformation is preferred to the symmetric\ncoordinate transformation because of its ease of use. In terms of error theory,\nthe symmetric transformation should be preferred. In this study, the topic of\nsymmetric similarity 3D coordinate transformation based on the dual quaternion\nalgorithm is discussed, and the bottlenecks encountered in solving the problem\nand the solution method are discussed. A new iterative algorithm based on the\ndual quaternion is presented. The solution is implemented in two different\nmodels: with constraint equations and without constraint equations. The\nadvantages and disadvantages of the two models compared to each other are also\nevaluated. Not only the transformation parameters but also the errors of the\ntransformation parameters are determined. The detailed derivation of the\nformulas for estimating the symmetric similarity of 3D transformation\nparameters is presented step by step. Since symmetric transformation is the\ngeneral form of asymmetric transformation, we can also obtain asymmetric\ntransformation results with a simple modification of the model we developed for\nsymmetric transformation. The proposed algorithm is capable of performing both\n2D and 3D symmetric and asymmetric similarity transformations. For the 2D\ntransformation, it is sufficient to replace the z and Z coordinates in both\nsystems with zero.",

We argue that\nlong-term decay is outdated in the era of LLMs, as LLMs are now applied to\ntasks demanding precise retrieval of in-context information from arbitrary\npositions. Firstly, we present empirical analyses on various PEs, demonstrating\nthat models inherently learn attention with only a local-decay pattern while\nforming a U-shape pattern globally, contradicting the principle of long-term\ndecay. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of rotary position encoding\n(RoPE, a prevalent relative positional encoding in LLMs), and found that the\nU-shape attention is caused by some learned components, which are also the key\nfactor limiting RoPE's expressiveness and extrapolation.Inspired by these\ninsights, we propose High-frequency rotary Position Encoding (HoPE). HoPE\nreplaces the specific components in RoPE with position-independent ones,\nretaining only high-frequency signals, which also breaks the principle of\nlong-term decay in theory. HoPE achieves two major advantages: (1) Without\nconstraints imposed by long-term decay, contradictory factors that limit\nspontaneous attention optimization and model extrapolation performance are\nremoved. (2) Components representing positions and semantics are are optimized.\nThese enhances model's context awareness and extrapolation, as validated by\nextensive experiments.",

As a standard\nmodel, we study hypergraph states, a representative class of many-body magic\nstates, subject to depolarizing noise.

Recently,\nMamba has emerged as a promising alternative, offering efficient long-range\ncontextual modeling capabilities without the quadratic complexity associated\nwith Transformer's attention mechanisms. However, despite Mamba's potential,\nearly efforts have all failed to achieve better performance than the best\nCNN-based and Transformer-based methods. In this work, we address this\nchallenge by identifying the key components of an effective and efficient point\ncloud segmentation architecture. Specifically, we show that: 1) Spatial\nlocality and robust contextual understanding are critical for strong\nperformance, and 2) Mamba features linear computational complexity, offering\nsuperior data and inference efficiency compared to Transformers, while still\nbeing capable of delivering strong contextual understanding. Additionally, we\nfurther enhance the standard Mamba specifically for point cloud segmentation by\nidentifying its two key shortcomings. First, the enforced causality in the\noriginal Mamba is unsuitable for processing point clouds that have no such\ndependencies. Second, its unidirectional scanning strategy imposes a\ndirectional bias, hampering its ability to capture the full context of\nunordered point clouds in a single pass. To address these issues, we carefully\nremove the causal convolutions and introduce a novel Strided Bidirectional SSM\nto enhance the model's capability to capture spatial relationships. Our efforts\nculminate in the development of a novel architecture named MEEPO, which\neffectively integrates the strengths of CNN and Mamba.

    "abstract": "We model and investigate the collective nonlinear optical response of an\nensemble of two-level emitters that are weakly coupled to a single-mode\nwaveguide. Our approach generalizes the insight that photon-photon correlations\nin the light scattered by a single two-level emitter result from two-photon\ninterference to the case of many emitters. Using our model, we study different\nconfigurations for probing the nonlinear response of the ensemble, e.g.,\nthrough the waveguide or via external illumination, and derive analytical\nexpressions for the second-order quantum coherence function, $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$,\nas well as for the squeezing spectrum of the output light in the waveguide,\n$S_\\theta(\\omega)$. For the transmission of resonant guided light, we recover\nthe same predictions as previously made with far more involved theoretical\nmodels when analyzing experimental results regarding $g^{(2)}(\\tau)$ (Prasad et\nal. [1]) and $S_\\theta(\\omega)$ (Hinney et al. [2]). We also study the\ntransmission of light that is detuned from the transition of the two-level\nemitter, a situation that we recently studied experimentally (Cordier et al.\n[3]). Our model predictions show how the collectively enhanced nonlinear\nresponse of weakly coupled emitters can be harnessed to generate non-classical\nstates of light using ensembles ranging from a few to many emitters.",

    "abstract": "Trace distance and infidelity (induced by square root fidelity), as basic\nmeasures of the closeness of quantum states, are commonly used in quantum state\ndiscrimination, certification, and tomography.

We present a quantum algorithm that estimates the trace\ndistance and square root fidelity between pure states to within additive error\n$\\varepsilon$, given sample access to their identical copies. Our algorithm\nachieves the optimal sample complexity $\\Theta(1/\\varepsilon^2)$, improving the\nlong-standing folklore $O(1/\\varepsilon^4)$. Our algorithm is composed of a\nsamplized phase estimation of the product of two Householder reflections.\nNotably, an improved (multi-)samplizer for pure states is used as an\nalgorithmic tool in our construction, through which any quantum query algorithm\nusing $Q$ queries to the reflection operator about a pure state $|\\psi\\rangle$\ncan be converted to a $\\delta$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum sample\nalgorithm using $\\Theta(Q^2/\\delta)$ samples of $|\\psi\\rangle$.

    "abstract": "The origin of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and the potential role of Supernova\nRemnants (SNRs) as cosmic-ray (CR) accelerators remain subjects of ongoing\ndebate. To shed more light on this topic, we have studied the spectral shape of\ntwo SNRs, RX J1713.7-3946 and HAWC J2227+610, performing simulations for the\nCherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). The previous multi-wavelength\n(MWL) analysis on these two sources showed an important hadronic contribution\nat high energies. The interaction of the GCRs accelerated by the SNRs with the\nmedium around the accelerator leads to a process of pion decay (PD) that\nproduces gamma-rays ($\\gamma$-rays). These emissions, detectable by CTAO, offer\nan indirect means of pinpointing the CR source. Two scenarios have been\nconsidered: the contribution of heavy CRs and different cut-off sharpnesses\n($\\beta$) of the particle spectra. The simulations were performed by using\ndifferent CR composition distributions (protons, CNO, Fe) and different\nsharpness values ranging from $\\beta$=0.5 to $\\beta$=1.5. The results show\nthat, in the cases studied here, CTAO will increase the sensitivity to the\nspectral shape of $\\gamma$-rays. This allows us to distinguish protons from\nheavy CRs and obtain information on $\\beta$ values and therefore on different\nacceleration scenarios.",

The ensuing \"active\"\nsystem, exhibiting both dissipation and anti-dissipation, features stationary\nand traveling wave solutions. While the former represent static cells, the\nlatter describe propagating pulses (solitary waves) mimicking the autonomous\nlocomotion of the same cells. In this paper we provide the first proof of the\nasymptotic nonlinear stability of both of such solutions, static and dynamic.\nIn the case of stationary solutions, the linear stability is established using\nthe spectral theorem for compact, self-adjoint operators, and thus linear\nstability is determined classically, solely by eigenvalues. For traveling waves\nthe picture is more complex because the linearized problem is non-self-adjoint,\nopening the possibility of a \"dark\" area in the phase space which is not\n\"visible\" in the purely eigenvalue/eigenvector approach. To establish linear\nstability in this case we employ spectral methods together with the\nGearhart-Pruss-Greiner (GPG) theorem, which controls the entire spectrum via\nbounds on the resolvent operator. For both stationary and traveling wave\nsolutions, nonlinear stability is then proved by showing how the nonlinear part\nof the problem may be dominated by the linear part and then employing a\nGronwall inequality argument. The developed novel methodology can prove useful\nalso in other problems involving non-self-adjoint (non-Hermitian or\nnon-reciprocal) operators which are ubiquitous in the modeling of \"active\"\nmatter.",

This study systematically evaluates the\nepistemic reasoning capabilities of modern LMs, including GPT-4, Claude-3, and\nLlama-3, using a new dataset, KaBLE, consisting of 13,000 questions across 13\ntasks. Our results reveal key limitations. First, while LMs achieve 86%\naccuracy on factual scenarios, their performance drops significantly with false\nscenarios, particularly in belief-related tasks. Second, LMs struggle with\nrecognizing and affirming personal beliefs, especially when those beliefs\ncontradict factual data, which raises concerns for applications in healthcare\nand counseling, where engaging with a person's beliefs is critical. Third, we\nidentify a salient bias in how LMs process first-person versus third-person\nbeliefs, performing better on third-person tasks (80.7%) compared to\nfirst-person tasks (54.4%). Fourth, LMs lack a robust understanding of the\nfactive nature of knowledge, namely, that knowledge inherently requires truth.\nFifth, LMs rely on linguistic cues for fact-checking and sometimes bypass the\ndeeper reasoning.

In the standard BB84 protocol, the\nreceiver immediately measures the qubits sent by the sender using randomly\nchosen bases. Due to mismatches between the sender and receiver's bases, a\nsignificant portion of the qubits are discarded, reducing the overall key\ngeneration rate. Our proposed protocol allows the receiver to store the\nreceived qubits in quantum memory and defer measurement until after the sender\nreveals her basis choices, effectively eliminating the need to discard\nmismatched qubits. This modification improves the key generation efficiency\nwhile maintaining the core security features of the standard BB84 protocol. By\navoiding the unnecessary loss of qubits, our protocol achieves a higher secret\nkey rate without introducing additional vulnerabilities.

Specifically, we investigate the capabilities to repair soundness\nof DPNs by restricting the transition guards and propose a new repair algorithm\nthat follows this approach. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is the\nabsence of a requirement for an input DPN to have a sound control flow. The\nalgorithm is implemented and results of the preliminary evaluation demonstrate\nits applicability to process models of moderate sizes.",

This leads to the realization that\nShannon interpolation can be interpreted as implicitly expecting that the\nunknown signal has uniform spectral density within its bandwidth. However, in\nmany practical applications, we often expect more energy at some frequencies\nthan at others. This leads us to propose novel Shannon-like interpolators that\nare optimal with respect to appropriately-constructed weighted Hilbert spaces,\nwhere weighting enables us to accommodate prior information about nonuniform\nspectral density. Although our new interpolants are derived for data obtained\nwith any sampling rate, we observe that they are particularly useful for\ninterpolating sub-Nyquist data.

Explainability is becoming an essential requirement for people\nto understand, trust and adopt AI applications.\n  Despite a vast collection of explainable AI (XAI) algorithms produced by the\nAI research community, successful examples of XAI are still relatively scarce\nin real-world AI applications. This can be due to the gap between what the XAI\nis designed for and how the XAI is actually perceived by end-users.

Then\nwe analyze the diverse stakeholders and needs-finding approaches. Next, we\nprovide an overview of the design space explored in the current human-centered\nXAI design.

    "abstract": "Protecting intellectual property (IP) in federated learning (FL) is\nincreasingly important as clients contribute proprietary data to\ncollaboratively train models. Model watermarking, particularly through\nbackdoor-based methods, has emerged as a popular approach for verifying\nownership and contributions in deep neural networks trained via FL. By\nmanipulating their datasets, clients can embed a secret pattern, resulting in\nnon-intuitive predictions that serve as proof of participation, useful for\nclaiming incentives or IP co-ownership. However, this technique faces practical\nchallenges: (i) client watermarks can collide, leading to ambiguous ownership\nclaims, and (ii) malicious clients may exploit watermarks to manipulate model\npredictions for harmful purposes. To address these issues, we propose\nSanitizer, a server-side method that ensures client-embedded backdoors can only\nbe activated in harmless environments but not natural queries. It identifies\nsubnets within client-submitted models, extracts backdoors throughout the FL\nprocess, and confines them to harmless, client-specific input subspaces. This\napproach not only enhances Sanitizer's efficiency but also resolves conflicts\nwhen clients use similar triggers with different target labels. Our empirical\nresults demonstrate that Sanitizer achieves near-perfect success verifying\nclient contributions while mitigating the risks of malicious watermark use.\nAdditionally, it reduces GPU memory consumption by 85% and cuts processing time\nby at least 5x compared to the baseline.

    "abstract": "Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity\ncan induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking.\nParticularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity\nfields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological\nbands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that\nfeature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where\nvarious large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design\nfor high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that\nachieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We\nincorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived\nmicroscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in\ngraphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an\nenhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an\nenergy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising\nplatform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.",

The previous approach [13], a\nnon-end-to-end model, requires extra user clicks to specify a part of the\ninput, making system deployment more error-prone or even not feasible. In\ncontrast, we introduce an end-to-end joint audio-visual IVD task designed to\ndetect vehicles visually under three states: moving, idling and engine off.\nUnlike feature co-occurrence task such as audio-visual vehicle tracking, our\nIVD task addresses complementary features, where labels cannot be determined by\na single modality alone. To this end, we propose AVIVD-Net, a novel network\nthat integrates audio and visual features through a bidirectional attention\nmechanism. AVIVD-Net streamlines the input process by learning a joint feature\nspace, reducing the deployment complexity of previous methods. Additionally, we\nintroduce the AVIVD dataset, which is seven times larger than previous\ndatasets, offering significantly more annotated samples to study the IVD\nproblem. Our model achieves performance comparable to prior approaches, making\nit suitable for automated deployment.

Many simple\nand popular covariance matrix estimators are known to be severely affected by\nmodel misspecification and the presence of outliers in the data; on the other\nhand robust estimators with reasonably high efficiency are often\ncomputationally challenging for modern large and complex datasets. In this\nwork, we propose a new, simple, robust and highly efficient method for\nestimation of the location vector and the scatter matrix for elliptically\nsymmetric distributions.

Consistency and asymptotic normality of the\nproposed sequential estimators of the multivariate location and scatter are\nestablished along with asymptotic positive definiteness of the estimated\nscatter matrix. Robustness of our estimators are studied by means of influence\nfunctions. All theoretical results are illustrated further under multivariate\nnormality. A large-scale simulation study is presented to assess finite sample\nperformances and scalability of our method in comparison to the usual maximum\nlikelihood estimator (MLE), the ordinary minimum DPD estimator (MDPDE) and\nother popular non-parametric methods.

This allows for fast\nlookup and retrieval of data subsets that satisfy specific predicates.\nUnfortunately, indexes cannot be directly applied to encrypted databases due to\nstrong data dependent leakages. Recent approaches apply differential privacy\n(DP) to construct noisy indexes that enable faster access to encrypted data\nwhile maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Large-scale\nknowledge graphs to this end have demonstrated their utility in effectively\nrepresenting structured knowledge. To further facilitate the application of\nmachine learning techniques, knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models have been\ndeveloped. Such models can transform entities and relationships within\nknowledge graphs into vectors. However, these embedding models often face\nchallenges related to noise, missing information, distribution shift,\nadversarial attacks, etc. This can lead to sub-optimal embeddings and incorrect\ninferences, thereby negatively impacting downstream applications. While the\nexisting literature has focused so far on adversarial attacks on KGE models,\nthe challenges related to the other critical aspects remain unexplored. In this\npaper, we, first of all, give a unified definition of resilience, encompassing\nseveral factors such as generalisation, performance consistency, distribution\nadaption, and robustness. After formalizing these concepts for machine learning\nin general, we define them in the context of knowledge graphs. To find the gap\nin the existing works on resilience in the context of knowledge graphs, we\nperform a systematic survey, taking into account all these aspects mentioned\npreviously. Our survey results show that most of the existing works focus on a\nspecific aspect of resilience, namely robustness.

Contemporary deep learning-based vascular segmentation models rival\nhuman accuracy but still face substantial challenges in accurately segmenting\nminuscule blood vessels in neural network applications. Due to the necessity of\nmultiple downsampling operations in the CNN models, fine details from\nhigh-resolution images are inevitably lost. The objective of this study is to\ndesign a structure to capture the delicate and small blood vessels. Methods: To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel network (KaLDeX) for vascular\nsegmentation leveraging a Kalman filter based linear deformable cross attention\n(LDCA) module, integrated within a UNet++ framework. Our approach is based on\ntwo key components: Kalman filter (KF) based linear deformable convolution (LD)\nand cross-attention (CA) modules. The LD module is designed to adaptively\nadjust the focus on thin vessels that might be overlooked in standard\nconvolution. The CA module improves the global understanding of vascular\nstructures by aggregating the detailed features from the LD module with the\nhigh level features from the UNet++ architecture. Finally, we adopt a\ntopological loss function based on persistent homology to constrain the\ntopological continuity of the segmentation. Results: The proposed method is\nevaluated on retinal fundus image datasets (DRIVE, CHASE_BD1, and STARE) as\nwell as the 3mm and 6mm of the OCTA-500 dataset, achieving an average accuracy\n(ACC) of 97.25%, 97.77%, 97.85%, 98.89%, and 98.21%, respectively.

Neural\nstochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling\ntechnique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of\nan SDE with neural networks.

In the classical flow decomposition problem, a network flow is\ndecomposed into a set of weighted paths from a fixed source node to a fixed\nsink node that precisely represents the flow distribution across all edges.\nWhile MFDs are often used in bioinformatics applications, they are also\napplicable in other fields, representing the flow of goods or passengers in\ndistribution networks, where the decomposition represents the vehicles and\ncorresponding capacities needed to cover these flows. Motivated by these\napplications, we generalize the MFD to the weighted inexact case with lower and\nupper bounds on the flow values, provide a detailed analysis, and explore\ndifferent variants that are solvable in polynomial time. Moreover, we introduce\nthe concept of robust flow decomposition by incorporating uncertain bounds and\napplying different robustness concepts to handle the uncertainty.

Our findings show that LLM-based test generation approaches are also\nprone on generating oracles that capture the actual program behaviour rather\nthan the expected one.

However, the strings can\nonly be broken by quenching the tension energy due to the system size\nlimitation, such \"tensile breaking\" behaves quite the same as in one-dimension\n\\cite{ion_string_breaking}. To discover the distinctive properties of quantum\nstrings in two dimensions, we utilize a newly developed quantum Monte Carlo\nmethod to simulate a ten times larger scale (743-site) Kagome Rydberg atom\narray which can be described with U(1) lattice gauge theory. With designed\nedges, one end of the string can be easily grasped, allowing for clearly\nobserving the dynamics of the dangling gauge charge at the open end. Then, we\ncan drag each end in opposite directions perpendicular to the string. As the\nseparation distance increases, asymptotic freedom-like behavior is detected.\nEventually, the string breaks because the distance between both ends surpasses\nthe string's length, so named \"geometric breaking\". Distinct from \"tensile\nbreaking,\" the two newly formed strings are suddenly uncorrelated, accompanied\nby a sudden energy increase. Lastly, we study multiple strings and successfully\nprepare a heart-like superposition state of broken and unbroken quantum strings\nwith three gauge charges attached reminiscent of quarks and gluon.

The emergence of deep learning\nmethods for protein modeling has demonstrated superior results at lower costs\ncompared to traditional approaches such as directed evolution and rational\ndesign. In mutation effect prediction, the key to pre-training deep learning\nmodels lies in accurately interpreting the complex relationships among protein\nsequence, structure, and function. This study introduces a retrieval-enhanced\nprotein language model for comprehensive analysis of native properties from\nsequence and local structural interactions, as well as evolutionary properties\nfrom retrieved homologous sequences. The state-of-the-art performance of the\nproposed ProtREM is validated on over 2 million mutants across 217 assays from\nan open benchmark (ProteinGym). We also conducted post-hoc analyses of the\nmodel's ability to improve the stability and binding affinity of a VHH\nantibody. Additionally, we designed 10 new mutants on a DNA polymerase and\nconducted wet-lab experiments to evaluate their enhanced activity at higher\ntemperatures. Both in silico and experimental evaluations confirmed that our\nmethod provides reliable predictions of mutation effects, offering an auxiliary\ntool for biologists aiming to evolve existing enzymes.

However, despite the\npotential of the technology, there are significant concerns regarding AI\nmisuse, particularly by students in assessments. There are two schools of\nthought: one advocates for a complete ban on it, while the other views it as a\nvaluable educational tool, provided it is governed by a robust usage policy.\nThis contradiction clearly indicates a major policy gap in academic practices,\nand new policies are required to uphold academic standards while enabling staff\nand students to benefit from technological advancements. We surveyed 117\nacademics from three countries (UK, UAE, and Iraq), and identified that most\nacademics retain positive opinions regarding AI in education. For example, the\nmajority of experienced academics do not favour complete bans, and they see the\npotential benefits of AI for students, teaching staff, and academic\ninstitutions. Importantly, academics specifically identified the particular\nbenefits of AI for autonomous assessment (71.79% of respondents agreed).\nTherefore, for the first time, we propose a novel AI framework for autonomously\nevaluating students' work (e.g., reports, coursework, etc.) and automatically\nassigning grades based on their knowledge and in-depth understanding of the\nsubmitted content. The survey results further highlight a significant lack of\nawareness of modern AI-based tools (e.g., ChatGPT) among experienced academics,\na gap that must be addressed to uphold educational standards.",

If the\nCritic believes the produced SQL is wrong, it notifies the Actor to reproduce\nthe SQL and perform evaluation again. By this simple iterative process,\nexpected performance can be derived in theory.

    "abstract": "We are concerned with a new solution formula and its applications to the\nanalysis of properties of entropy solutions of the Cauchy problem for\none-dimensional scalar hyperbolic conservation laws, wherein the flux functions\nexhibit convexity degeneracy and the initial data are in $L^\\infty$. We first\nintroduce/validate the novel formula for entropy solutions for the Cauchy\nproblem, which generalizes the Lax-Oleinik formula. Then, by employing this\nformula, we obtain a series of fine properties of entropy solutions and\ndiscover several new structures and phenomena, which include: (i) Series of\nresults on the fine structures of entropy solutions, especially including the\nnew criteria for all six types of initial waves for the Cauchy problem, the new\nstructures of entropy solutions inside the backward characteristic triangle,\nand the new features of the formation and development of shocks such as all\nfive types of continuous shock generation points, along with their criteria and\nthe optimal regularities of the corresponding resulting shocks; (ii) Series of\nresults on the global structures of entropy solutions, including the four new\ninvariants of entropy solutions, the new criteria for the locations and speeds\nof divides, and the exact determination of the global structures of entropy\nsolutions; (iii) Series of new results on the asymptotic behaviors of entropy\nsolutions, including the asymptotic profiles and decay rates of entropy\nsolutions for initial data in $L^\\infty$, respectively in the $L^\\infty$--norm\nand the $L^p_{{\\rm loc}}$--norm. Through these results above, we obtain the\nglobal dynamic patterns of entropy solutions for scalar hyperbolic conservation\nlaws with the flux functions satisfying (1.3) and general initial data in\n$L^\\infty$. Moreover, the new solution formula is also extended to more general\nscalar hyperbolic conservation laws.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for surveillance in public spaces presents significant\nchallenges due to the shortage of human resources. Current AI-based video\nsurveillance systems heavily rely on core computer vision models that require\nextensive finetuning, which is particularly difficult in surveillance settings\ndue to limited datasets and difficult setting (viewpoint, low quality, etc.).\nIn this work, we propose leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), known\nfor their strong zero and few-shot generalization, to tackle video\nunderstanding tasks in surveillance. Specifically, we explore VideoLLaMA2, a\nstate-of-the-art LVLM, and an improved token-level sampling method,\nSelf-Reflective Sampling (Self-ReS). Our experiments on the UCF-Crime dataset\nshow that VideoLLaMA2 represents a significant leap in zero-shot performance,\nwith 20% boost over the baseline. Self-ReS additionally increases zero-shot\naction recognition performance to 44.6%. These results highlight the potential\nof LVLMs, paired with improved sampling techniques, for advancing surveillance\nvideo analysis in diverse scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Vascular diseases such as thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and aneurysm, which\ncan lead to blockage of blood flow or blood vessel rupture, are common and\nlife-threatening. Conventional minimally invasive treatments utilize catheters,\nor long tubes, to guide small devices or therapeutic agents to targeted regions\nfor intervention. Unfortunately, catheters suffer from difficult and unreliable\nnavigation in narrow, winding vessels such as those found in the brain.\nMagnetically actuated untethered robots, which have been extensively explored\nas an alternative, are promising for navigation in complex vasculatures and\nvascular disease treatments.

We investigate the effect of\nrelaxing the assumption of a deterministic relationship between the market\ninterest rate incentive and the prepayment rate.

The replication framework\nis flexible and focuses on different regions in the exposure distribution.\nSince a non-hedgeable risk factor entails the existence of multiple equivalent\nmartingale measures, pricing and optimal replication are not unique.

Second, while the conventional use of\nTWD is to speed up the computation of the Wasserstein distance, we use its\ninherent tree as a means to learn the latent feature hierarchy.

Comparing experimental and computational\ndata on the miscibility of hydrogen and water to adiabatic profiles suggests\nphase separation between these components occurs in the ice giants Uranus and\nNeptune. We aim to predict the atmospheric water abundance and transition\npressure between the water-poor outer envelope and the water-rich deep interior\nin Uranus and Neptune. We construct seven H2-H2O phase diagrams from the\navailable experimental and computational data. We compute interior adiabatic\nstructure models and compare these to the phase diagrams to infer whether\ndemixing is occurring. We obtain a strong water depletion in the top layer due\nto rain-out of water and find upper limits on the atmospheric water mass\nfraction Z_atm of 0.21 for Uranus and 0.16 for Neptune. The transition from the\nwater-poor to the water-rich layer is sharp and occurs at pressures P_Z between\n4 and 11 GPa. Using these constraints on Z_atm and P_Z, we find that the\nobserved gravitational harmonics J2 and J4 can be reproduced if P_Z > 10 GPa in\nUranus and > 5 GPa in Neptune, and if the deep interior has a high primordial\nwater mass fraction of 0.8, unless rocks are also present. The agreement with\nJ4 is improved if rocks are confined deeper than P_Z, for instance below a rock\ncloud level at 2000 K (20-30 GPa). These findings confirm classical few-layer\nmodels and suggest that a layered structure may result from a combination of\nprimordial mass accretion and subsequent phase separation. Reduced\nobservational uncertainty in J4 and its dynamic contribution, atmospheric water\nabundance measurements from an Orbiter with a Probe mission to Uranus (UOP) or\nNeptune, and better understanding of the mixing behaviour of constituents are\nneeded to constrain the interiors of ice giants.",

This provides a two-player analogue of Ma\\~ne's lemma\nfrom ergodic control. This also extends to the two-player case results of\nKohlberg and Neyman (1981), Karlsson (2001), and Vigeral and the second author\n(2012), concerning the asymptotic behavior of nonexpansive mappings. We discuss\ntwo special cases of this game: order preserving and positively homogeneous\nself-maps of a cone equipped with Funk's and Thompson's metrics, and groups of\ntranslations.",

These solutions are\nuniformly far from vacuum, suggesting that weak turbulence in quantum\nhydrodynamics is not necessarily related to the occurrence of vortex\nstructures.\n  In view of possible connections with instability mechanisms for the classical\ncompressible Euler equations, we also keep track of the dependence on the\nsemiclassical parameter, showing that, at high regularity, the time at which\nthe Sobolev norm inflations occur is uniform when approaching the semiclassical\nlimit.\n  Our construction relies on a novel result of Sobolev instability for the\nplane waves of the cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLS), which is\nconnected to the quantum Euler equations through the Madelung transform}. More\nprecisely, we show the existence of smooth solutions to NLS, which are\nsmall-amplitude perturbations of a plane wave and undergo a polynomially fast\n$H^s$-norm inflation for $s>1$. The proof is based on a partial Birkhoff normal\nform procedure, involving the normalization of non-homogeneous Hamiltonian\nterms.",

To this end, many model compression techniques are\nproposed to increase the efficiency of LLMs. However, current researches only\nvalidate their methods on limited models, datasets, metrics, etc, and still\nlack a comprehensive evaluation under more general scenarios. So it is still a\nquestion of which model compression approach we should use under a specific\ncase. To mitigate this gap, we present the Large Language Model Compression\nBenchmark (LLMCBench), a rigorously designed benchmark with an in-depth\nanalysis for LLM compression algorithms. We first analyze the actual model\nproduction requirements and carefully design evaluation tracks and metrics.\nThen, we conduct extensive experiments and comparison using multiple mainstream\nLLM compression approaches. Finally, we perform an in-depth analysis based on\nthe evaluation and provide useful insight for LLM compression design.

In this paper, we propose FedTDD,\na novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer\nacross clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and\naggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by\nimputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional\nfederated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series\nthrough the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A\ncoordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging\nshared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the\ndistiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality\nof the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve\nits local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate\ndistiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's\neffectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of\nsharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series.

Artifacts generated by state of the art LLM technology\nare expected to be useful in the sense that a user will be able to use the LLM\ngenerated artifact after a small number of easy modifications. Quantifying this\nvague notion is challenging and it is thus hard to determine the quality of\ncode related LLM solutions. We refer to evaluation of LLM solutions using LLM\njudgment as \"LLM as a Judge\", or LaaJ for short. In this work we introduce a\nmethodology to generate and evaluate LaaJ implementations, utilizing an\nautomatically generated benchmark. The purpose of the benchmark is two fold,\nnamely, it is used both to develop and validate the LaaJs and to validate and\ntest the LLM code related solution using the LaaJs. To that end, we developed\nan automated benchmark generation engine, which generates code in multiple\nprogramming languages for multiple code related tasks and which serves as the\ninput for LaaJ evaluation. We utilize a graph representation, G, of the\npotential code related generations. The graph vertices are generated artifacts\nand edges represent possible generations, e.g., the generation of a Java\nprogram from its natural language requirements. Utilizing a chain of LLM agents\nand G we generate code related artifacts. Using cycles in G we formulate\nexpectations on the generated artifacts.

Our PIP\nintegrates the Lagrangian multiplier as a basis to enhance constraint awareness\nand introduces preventative infeasibility masking to proactively steer the\nsolution construction process. Moreover, we present PIP-D, which employs an\nauxiliary decoder and two adaptive strategies to learn and predict these\ntailored masks, potentially enhancing performance while significantly reducing\ncomputational costs during training. To verify our PIP designs, we conduct\nextensive experiments on the highly challenging Traveling Salesman Problem with\nTime Window (TSPTW), and TSP with Draft Limit (TSPDL) variants under different\nconstraint hardness levels. Notably, our PIP is generic to boost many neural\nmethods, and exhibits both a significant reduction in infeasible rate and a\nsubstantial improvement in solution quality.",

To bridge the gap, we\npropose CTINexus, a novel framework leveraging optimized in-context learning\n(ICL) of large language models (LLMs) for data-efficient CTI knowledge\nextraction and high-quality cybersecurity knowledge graph (CSKG) construction.\nUnlike existing methods, CTINexus requires neither extensive data nor parameter\ntuning and can adapt to various ontologies with minimal annotated examples.\nThis is achieved through: (1) a carefully designed automatic prompt\nconstruction strategy with optimal demonstration retrieval for extracting a\nwide range of cybersecurity entities and relations; (2) a hierarchical entity\nalignment technique that canonicalizes the extracted knowledge and removes\nredundancy; (3) an long-distance relation prediction technique to further\ncomplete the CSKG with missing links. Our extensive evaluations using 150\nreal-world CTI reports collected from 10 platforms demonstrate that CTINexus\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate and\ncomplete CSKG, highlighting its potential to transform CTI analysis with an\nefficient and adaptable solution for the dynamic threat landscape.",

We conduct comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world\ndatasets, demonstrating that our approach consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art SR models. Moreover, we provide a thorough analysis of AWRSR's\neffectiveness in capturing higher-level dependencies.

Although multi-robot\ndecentralized and centralized task planners using LLMs have been proposed, none\nof these studies focus on precedence dependencies from the perspective of task\nefficiency or leverage traditional optimization methods. It addresses key\nchallenges in managing dependencies between skills and optimizing task\nallocation.

The LLMs are utilized to generate a comprehensive list of skills\nand to construct a dependency graph that maps the relationships and sequential\nconstraints among these skills. To ensure the feasibility and efficiency of\nskill execution, the skill list is generated by calculated likelihood, and\nlinear programming is used to optimally allocate tasks to each robot.\nExperimental evaluations in simulated environments demonstrate that this method\noutperforms existing task planners, achieving higher success rates and\nefficiency in executing complex, multi-robot tasks. The results indicate the\npotential of combining LLMs with optimization techniques to enhance the\ncapabilities of multi-robot systems in executing coordinated tasks accurately\nand efficiently.

    "abstract": "The increasing use and cost of high performance computing (HPC) requires new\neasy-to-use tools to enable HPC users and HPC systems engineers to\ntransparently understand the utilization of resources. The MIT Lincoln\nLaboratory Supercomputing Center (LLSC) has developed a simple command, LLload,\nto monitor and characterize HPC workloads. LLload plays an important role in\nidentifying opportunities for better utilization of compute resources. LLload\ncan be used to monitor jobs both programmatically and interactively. LLload can\ncharacterize users' jobs using various LLload options to achieve better\nefficiency. This information can be used to inform the user to optimize HPC\nworkloads and improve both CPU and GPU utilization. This includes improvements\nusing judicious oversubscription of the computing resources. Preliminary\nresults suggest significant improvement in GPU utilization and overall\nthroughput performance with GPU overloading in some cases. By enabling users to\nobserve and fix incorrect job submission and/or inappropriate execution setups,\nLLload can increase the resource usage and improve the overall throughput\nperformance. LLload is a light-weight, easy-to-use tool for both HPC users and\nHPC systems engineers to monitor HPC workloads to improve system utilization\nand efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive (AR) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated\nsignificant success across numerous tasks. However, the AR modeling paradigm\npresents certain limitations; for instance, contemporary autoregressive LLMs\nare trained to generate one token at a time, which can result in noticeable\nlatency. Recent advances have indicated that search and repeated sampling can\nenhance performance in various applications, such as theorem proving, code\ngeneration, and alignment, by utilizing greater computational resources during\ninference. In this study, we demonstrate that diffusion language models are\ncapable of generating at least 32 tokens simultaneously, while exceeding the\nperformance of AR models in text quality and on the LAMBADA natural language\nunderstanding benchmark. This outcome is achieved through a novel distillation\nmethod for discrete diffusion models, which reduces the number of inference\nsteps by a factor of 32-64. Practically, at the 1.3B parameters scale,\ndiffusion models, even without caching, can generate tokens at a rate that is\nup to 8 times faster than AR models employing KV-caching, and we anticipate\nfurther improvements with the inclusion of caching. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our approach for diffusion language models with up to 860M\nparameters.",

Calibration - learning item parameters in a test -\nis done using AutoIRT, a new method that uses automated machine learning\n(AutoML) in combination with item response theory (IRT), originally proposed in\n[Sharpnack et al., 2024]. AutoIRT trains a non-parametric AutoML grading model\nusing item features, followed by an item-specific parametric model, which\nresults in an explanatory IRT model. In our work, we use tabular AutoML tools\n(AutoGluon.tabular, [Erickson et al., 2020]) along with BERT embeddings and\nlinguistically motivated NLP features. In this framework, we use Bayesian\nupdating to obtain test taker ability posterior distributions for\nadministration and scoring.\n  For administration of our adaptive test, we propose the BanditCAT framework,\na methodology motivated by casting the problem in the contextual bandit\nframework and utilizing item response theory (IRT). The key insight lies in\ndefining the bandit reward as the Fisher information for the selected item,\ngiven the latent test taker ability from IRT assumptions. We use Thompson\nsampling to balance between exploring items with different psychometric\ncharacteristics and selecting highly discriminative items that give more\nprecise information about ability. To control item exposure, we inject noise\nthrough an additional randomization step before computing the Fisher\ninformation.

Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the\nexpectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials\nin three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for\nthe three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric\nand complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of\nnon-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI$^\\dag$ and\nAII$^\\dag$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive\nexplicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials\nfor finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the\nglobal limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum,\nproviding new analytical results for classes AI$^\\dag$ and AII$^\\dag$. For\ngeneral $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the\nnon-linear $\\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly,\nthey agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone\nmanifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are\ndifferent and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk.

Specifically, not only bounds on\nthe values themselves, but also bounds on moment constraints can be taken into\naccount. Thus, inadmissible assumptions on the data can be avoided, while the\noptimal design of a problem can be identified.

Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven\nwinds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon, [C i] 8727 A. We compare\nfor the first time the spatial location of the emission in the [O i] 5577 A, [O\ni] 6300 A, and [C i] 8727 A lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM, with the ALMA Band 7\ncontinuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster\n(ONC). We confirm that the [O i] 5577 A emission is co-spatial with the disk\nemission, whereas the [O i] 6300 A is emitted both on the disk surface and on\nthe ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the [C i]\n8727 A line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in\nthe MUSE and ALMA data comparison. To verify whether the [C i] 8727 A line is\ndetected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examine\nVLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the [O i]\nlines are well detected in all these targets, there is <<10% detection rate in\nthe case of the [C i] 8727 A line. This number increases substantially to a\n~40% detection rate in sigma-Orionis, a region with intermediate UV radiation.\nThe spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its\ndetection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is\na tell-tale tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees\nwith recent excitation models.",

We assessed study quality and risk of bias\nusing the Radiomics Quality Score and the QUADAS-2 tool. Our meta-analysis\nemployed a bivariate model to compute pooled sensitivity and specificity, and\nmeta-regression to assess interstudy heterogeneity.\n  Results Among the 1517 unique publications, 104 were included in the\nqualitative synthesis, and 72 underwent meta-analysis. Pooled estimates for IDH\nprediction in test cohorts yielded a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of\n0.85. For 1p/19q co-deletion, sensitivity was 0.75 and specificity was 0.82.\nMeta-regression identified the tumor segmentation method and the extent of DL\nintegration into the radiomics pipeline as significant contributors to\ninterstudy variability.\n  Conclusion Although DL models demonstrate strong potential for noninvasive\nmolecular classification of gliomas, clinical translation requires several\ncritical steps: harmonization of multi-center MRI data using techniques such as\nhistogram matching and DL-based style transfer; adoption of standardized and\nautomated segmentation protocols; extensive multi-center external validation;\nand prospective clinical validation.",

    "abstract": "The prediction of non-local phenomena is a key attribute of quantum mechanics\nthat distinguishes it from classical theories. It was recently suggested that\nstate swapping is one such effect that a fundamentally classical gravitational\nfield cannot give rise to. The reasoning was that the phenomenology of\nclassical fields is restricted to Local Operations and Classical\nCommunication~(LOCC) whereas swapping is a non-LOCC effect, so gravity must not\nbe a classical channel if it can give rise to such a phenomenon. Here, we show\nthat the Hamiltonian of semiclassical gravity results in an evolution of\ncoherent states that is virtually indistinguishable from swapping them, both\ntheoretically and experimentally. Our results indicate that drawing a\ndefinitive conclusion about the nature of gravity based solely on its ability\nto swap a pair of coherent states would be premature. We discuss the\nimplications of these results regarding proposed experimental tests for the\nquantum nature of gravity and clarify some conceptual issues.",

The Political Compass Test and the Big Five Personality\nTest were employed 100 times for each scenario, providing statistically\nsignificant results and an insight into the results correlations. The responses\nwere analyzed by computing averages, standard deviations, and performing\nsignificance tests to investigate differences between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.\nCorrelations were found for traits that have been shown to be interdependent in\nhuman studies. Both models showed a progressive and libertarian political bias,\nwith GPT-4's biases being slightly, but negligibly, less pronounced.\nSpecifically, on the Political Compass, GPT-3.5 scored -6.59 on the economic\naxis and -6.07 on the social axis, whereas GPT-4 scored -5.40 and -4.73. In\ncontrast to GPT-3.5, GPT-4 showed a remarkable capacity to emulate assigned\npolitical viewpoints, accurately reflecting the assigned quadrant\n(libertarian-left, libertarian-right, authoritarian-left, authoritarian-right)\nin all four tested instances. On the Big Five Personality Test, GPT-3.5 showed\nhighly pronounced Openness and Agreeableness traits (O: 85.9%, A: 84.6%). Such\npronounced traits correlate with libertarian views in human studies. While\nGPT-4 overall exhibited less pronounced Big Five personality traits, it did\nshow a notably higher Neuroticism score. Assigned political orientations\ninfluenced Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, again reflecting\ninterdependencies observed in human studies. Finally, we observed that test\nsequencing affected ChatGPT's responses and the observed correlations,\nindicating a form of contextual memory.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the channel estimation (CE) of intelligent reflecting\nsurface-aided near-field (NF) multi-user communication is investigated.\nInitially, the least square (LS) estimator and minimum mean square error (MMSE)\nestimator for the estimated channel are designed, their mean square errors\n(MSEs) are derived, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to serve\nas a benchmark for performance evaluation. Subsequently, in view of the fact\nthat the NF channel model is more sensitive to distance variations compared to\nthe far-field model, this leads to pronounced discrepancies in the user channel\ncharacteristics in different regions. To effectively capture and utilize these\ndiverse channel features, users are initially divided into distinct regions\npredicated on pivotal parameters, such as channel angle and distance.\nCorrespondingly, a user region classifier based on convolutional neural\nnetworks is designed. Then, to fully harness the potential of deep residual\nnetworks (DRNs) in denoising, the aforementioned CE problem is reconceptualized\nas a denoising task, and a DRN-driven single region NF CE network, named\nSR-DRN-NFCE, is proposed. In addition, by integrating SR-DRN-NFCE networks\ncorresponding to different regions and conducting joint training in a federated\nlearning (FL) manner, a new network is obtained, named FL-DRN-NFCE. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the proposed FL-DRN-NFCE network outperforms LS, MMSE,\nand no residual connections in terms of MSE, and the proposed FL-DRN-NFCE\nmethod has higher CE accuracy than the SR-DRN-NFCE method.",

By examining the phase-locked Stokes parameters, we\nestimated the orbital inclination at about 55+5/-55 deg, and the orientation at\n148+20/-22 deg. The binary's rotation direction is clockwise. Using the Dipol-2\npolarimeter with the 60 cm KVA and Tohoku T60 telescopes, we achieved\npolarization measurement accuracy around 0.01 percent in the B, V, and R\npassbands. Period analysis identified a strong periodic signal with a cycle of\nabout 1.48 days, corresponding to half of the orbital period of about 2.96\ndays. The second Fourier harmonics suggest a symmetric scattering geometry,\nlikely due to electron scattering in interacting stellar winds.

To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a new retargeting framework, MeshRet, which directly models the dense\ngeometric interactions in motion retargeting.

Neuroscientific studies indicate that\nhumans can decode imagined 3D objects by perceiving or imagining various visual\ninformation, such as color, shape, and rotation. Existing EEG-based visual\ndecoding methods typically focus only on the reconstruction of 2D visual\nstimulus images and face various challenges in generation quality, including\ninconsistencies in texture, shape, and color between the visual stimuli and the\nreconstructed images. This paper proposes an EEG-based 3D object reconstruction\nmethod with style consistency and diffusion priors. The method consists of an\nEEG-driven multi-task joint learning stage and an EEG-to-3D diffusion stage.\nThe first stage uses a neural EEG encoder based on regional semantic learning,\nemploying a multi-task joint learning scheme that includes a masked EEG signal\nrecovery task and an EEG based visual classification task. The second stage\nintroduces a latent diffusion model (LDM) fine-tuning strategy with\nstyle-conditioned constraints and a neural radiance field (NeRF) optimization\nstrategy. This strategy explicitly embeds semantic- and location-aware latent\nEEG codes and combines them with visual stimulus maps to fine-tune the LDM. The\nfine-tuned LDM serves as a diffusion prior, which, combined with the style loss\nof visual stimuli, is used to optimize NeRF for generating 3D objects. Finally,\nthrough experimental validation, we demonstrate that this method can\neffectively use EEG data to reconstruct 3D objects with style consistency.",

However, they sometimes struggle to accurately depict specific\nentities described in prompts, a limitation known as the entity missing problem\nin compositional generation. While prior studies suggested that adjusting\ncross-attention maps during the denoising process could alleviate this problem,\nthey did not systematically investigate which objective functions could best\naddress it. This study examines three potential causes of the entity-missing\nproblem, focusing on cross-attention dynamics: (1) insufficient attention\nintensity for certain entities, (2) overly broad attention spread, and (3)\nexcessive overlap between attention maps of different entities. We found that\nreducing overlap in attention maps between entities can effectively minimize\nthe rate of entity missing. Specifically, we hypothesize that tokens related to\nspecific entities compete for attention on certain image regions during the\ndenoising process, which can lead to divided attention across tokens and\nprevent accurate representation of each entity. To address this issue, we\nintroduced four loss functions, Intersection over Union (IoU), center-of-mass\n(CoM) distance, Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, and clustering compactness\n(CC) to regulate attention overlap during denoising steps without the need for\nretraining. Experimental results across a wide variety of benchmarks reveal\nthat these proposed training-free methods significantly improve compositional\naccuracy, outperforming previous approaches in visual question answering (VQA),\ncaptioning scores, CLIP similarity, and human evaluations.

There is currently no uniqueness\ntheorem for the solutions, and for fixed circle size multiple solutions with\nthe same mass co-exist. Intuitively for small circle sizes we might expect the\ntheory truncates to become 4-dimensional, and correspondingly the only black\nholes are the homogeneous black strings. Thus we conjecture that for fixed mass\nand sufficiently small circle size, the only black holes are homogeneous ones.\nHere we give evidence that this is indeed the case. Firstly we introduce a toy\nscalar field model with a potential that allows tachyonic behaviour. Putting\nthis theory on a product of Minkowski with a circle gives an analogous set of\nstatic homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions to that of the black holes. We\nprove that solutions must be homogeneous for small circle sizes, the analog of\nour conjecture for this toy model. A weaker statement that is straightforward\nto derive is a bound on how inhomogeneous a solution can be - putting this\nscalar theory in a large but finite cavity, a norm of the wavefunction of the\nKaluza-Klein modes can be shown to vanish in the small circle limit. Turning to\nthe full gravitational theory, we employ a metric ansatz that imposes static\naxisymmetry, encompasses the homogeneous and inhomogeneous black strings (but\nnot the localized solutions) and allows us to measure inhomogeneity of a\nsolution. Employing a finite cavity and imposing boundary conditions that are\ncompatible with homogeneity we show a similar result; the norm of certain\nKaluza-Klein modes is bounded by the circle size, providing evidence that our\nconjecture is true.",

    "abstract": "Current techniques for detecting AI-generated text are largely confined to\nmanual feature crafting and supervised binary classification paradigms. These\nmethodologies typically lead to performance bottlenecks and unsatisfactory\ngeneralizability. Consequently, these methods are often inapplicable for\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data and newly emerged large language models (LLMs).\nIn this paper, we revisit the task of AI-generated text detection. We argue\nthat the key to accomplishing this task lies in distinguishing writing styles\nof different authors, rather than simply classifying the text into\nhuman-written or AI-generated text. To this end, we propose DeTeCtive, a\nmulti-task auxiliary, multi-level contrastive learning framework. DeTeCtive is\ndesigned to facilitate the learning of distinct writing styles, combined with a\ndense information retrieval pipeline for AI-generated text detection. Our\nmethod is compatible with a range of text encoders. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method enhances the ability of various text encoders in\ndetecting AI-generated text across multiple benchmarks and achieves\nstate-of-the-art results. Notably, in OOD zero-shot evaluation, our method\noutperforms existing approaches by a large margin. Moreover, we find our method\nboasts a Training-Free Incremental Adaptation (TFIA) capability towards OOD\ndata, further enhancing its efficacy in OOD detection scenarios. We will\nopen-source our code and models in hopes that our work will spark new thoughts\nin the field of AI-generated text detection, ensuring safe application of LLMs\nand enhancing compliance.

Compared to traditional numerical\nmethods based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) algorithm, our model\ndemonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy.\n  Code is available at: https://github.com/Axect/Neural_Hamilton",

The results reveal that VO, VSr, and\nTiSr are the dominant intrinsic defects, influencing STO's conductivity under\nvarying O chemical potentials (oxygen partial pressures).

As the\noxygen pressure increases, TiSr emerges as a critical donor defect under O-rich\ncondition, significantly affecting conductivity. Additionally, the study\nelucidates the abnormal phenomenon where VTi, typically an acceptor, exhibits\ndonor-like behavior due to the formation of O-trimer. This work offers a\ncomprehensive understanding of how intrinsic defects tune the Fermi level,\nthereby altering STO's conductivity from metallic to n-type, and eventually to\np-type across different O chemical potentials.

To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework that scores\nand selects the best result from k autoformalization candidates based on two\ncomplementary self-consistency methods: symbolic equivalence and semantic\nconsistency. Elaborately, symbolic equivalence identifies the logical\nhomogeneity among autoformalization candidates using automated theorem provers,\nand semantic consistency evaluates the preservation of the original meaning by\ninformalizing the candidates and computing the similarity between the\nembeddings of the original and informalized texts. Our extensive experiments on\nthe MATH and miniF2F datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly\nenhances autoformalization accuracy, achieving up to 0.22-1.35x relative\nimprovements across various LLMs and baseline methods.",

This last result implies that if any of\nthese experiment's hardness conjectures hold, then quantum computers can\nimplement functions classical computers cannot ($\\mathsf{FBQP\\neq FBPP}$)\nunless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its 2nd level. These results are\nan improvement over previous work which either achieved a collapse to the third\nlevel or were concerned with exact sampling, a physically impractical case.\n  The workhorse of these results is a new technical complexity-theoretic result\nwhich we believe could have value beyond quantum computation. In particular, we\nprove that if there exists an equivalence between problems solvable with an\nexact counting oracle and problems solvable with an approximate counting\noracle, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level, indeed to\n$\\mathsf{ZPP^{NP}}$.",

Understanding the\nproperties of the dissipation of magnetic fields and the formation of non-ideal\nelectric fields is of paramount importance to quantify the efficiency of\nreconnection at energizing charged particles. Recent results from\nparticle-in-cell (PIC) simulations suggest that the fundamental properties of\nhow magnetic fields dissipate in a current sheet might be captured by an\n\"effective resistivity\" formulation, which would locally enhance the amount of\nmagnetic energy dissipated and favor the onset of fast reconnection. Our goal\nis to assess this ansatz quantitatively by comparing fluid models of magnetic\nreconnection with a non-constant magnetic diffusivity and fully-kinetic models.\nWe perform 2D resistive relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (ResRMHD) simulations\nof magnetic reconnection combined to PIC simulations using the same initial\nconditions (namely a Harris current sheet). We explore the impact of crucial\nparameters such as the plasma magnetization, its mass density, the grid\nresolution, and the characteristic plasma skin depth. Our ResRMHD models with\neffective resistivity can quantitatively reproduce the dynamics of\nfully-kinetic models of relativistic magnetic reconnection. In particular, they\nlead to reconnection rates consistent with PIC simulations, while for\nconstant-resistivity fluid models the reconnection dynamics is generally 10\ntimes slower. Even at modest resolutions the adoption of an effective\nresistivity can qualitatively capture the properties of kinetic reconnection\nmodels and produce reconnection rates compatible with collisionless models,\ni.e. of the order of $\\sim10^{-1}$.",

Furthermore, FACTS supports parallel\ncomputation of high-dimensional sequences. We empirically evaluate FACTS across\ndiverse tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, object-centric\nworld modelling, and spatial-temporal graph prediction, demonstrating that it\nconsistently outperforms or matches specialised state-of-the-art models,\ndespite its general-purpose world modelling design.",

Traditional methods for\nassessing well-being often face significant challenges, with a major issue\nbeing the lack of trust and confidence employees may have in these processes.\nEmployees may hesitate to provide honest feedback due to concerns not only\nabout data integrity and confidentiality, but also about power imbalances among\nstakeholders. In this context, blockchain-based decentralised surveys,\nleveraging the immutability, transparency, and pseudo-anonymity of blockchain\ntechnology, offer significant improvements in aligning responsive actions with\nemployees' feedback securely and transparently. Nevertheless, their\nimplementation raises complex issues regarding the balance between trust and\nconfidence. While blockchain can function as a confidence machine for data\nprocessing and management, it does not inherently address the equally important\ncultural element of trust. To effectively integrate blockchain technology into\nwell-being assessments, decentralised well-being surveys must be supported by\ncultural practices that build and sustain trust. Drawing on blockchain\ntechnology management and relational cultural theory, we explain how\ntrust-building can be achieved through the co-production of decentralised\nwell-being surveys, which helps address power imbalances between the\nimplementation team and stakeholders. Our goal is to provide a dual\ncultural-technological framework along with conceptual clarity on how the\ntechnological implementation of confidence can connect with the cultural\ndevelopment of trust, ensuring that blockchain-based decentralised well-being\nsurveys are not only secure and reliable but also perceived as trustworthy\nvector to improve workplace conditions.",

This paper proposes an extension of the Fusco\nand Vidoli [2013] SEM-like approach, which globally accounts for spatial and\ntemporal effects in the term of inefficiency. In particular, coherently with\nthe stochastic panel frontier literature, two different versions of the model\nare proposed: the time-invariant and the time-varying spatial stochastic\nfrontier models.

    "abstract": "In our prior work, we investigated the minimum fuel consumption of a hybrid\nelectric vehicle (HEV) under a state-of-charge (SOC) balance constraint,\nassuming perfect SOC measurements and accurate reference speed profiles. The\nconstrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) problem was addressed using a\nconstrained reinforcement learning (CRL) framework. However, in real-world\nscenarios, SOC readings are often corrupted by sensor noise, and reference\nspeeds may deviate from actual driving conditions. To account for these\nimperfections, this study reformulates the COFC problem by explicitly\nincorporating observational noise in both SOC and reference speed. We adopt a\nrobust CRL approach, where the noise is modeled as a uniform distribution, and\nemploy a structured training procedure to ensure stability. The proposed method\nis evaluated through simulations on the Toyota Prius hybrid system (THS), using\nboth the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide Harmonized Light\nVehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Results show that fuel consumption and SOC\nconstraint satisfaction remain robust across varying noise levels. Furthermore,\nthe analysis reveals that observational noise in SOC and speed can impact fuel\nconsumption to different extents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst study to explicitly examine how observational noise -- commonly\nencountered in dynamometer testing and predictive energy control (PEC)\napplications -- affects constrained optimal fuel consumption in HEVs.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is emerging as a promising method for\nadaptive robotic motion and complex task automation, effectively addressing the\nlimitations of traditional control methods. However, ensuring safety throughout\nboth the learning process and policy deployment remains a key challenge due to\nthe risky exploration inherent in DRL, as well as the discrete nature of\nactions taken at intervals. These discontinuities, despite being part of a\ncontinuous action space, can lead to abrupt changes between successive actions,\ncausing instability and unsafe intermediate states. To address these\nchallenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework that combines DRL with\na jerk-bounded trajectory generator (JBTG) and a robust low-level control\nstrategy, significantly enhancing the safety, stability, and reliability of\nrobotic manipulators. The low-level controller ensures the precise execution of\nDRL-generated commands, while the JBTG refines these motions to produce smooth,\ncontinuous trajectories that prevent abrupt or unsafe actions.

    "abstract": "For the discrete-time or the continuous-time Markov spin models for image\ngeneration when each pixel $n=1,..,N$ can take only two values $S_n=\\pm 1$, the\nfinite-time forward propagator depends on the initial and on the final\nconfigurations of the $N$ spins only via a single global variable, namely the\nextensive overlap that counts the number of spins that have the same value or\nnot in the two configurations. The joint probability distribution of the\noverlap and of the magnetization during the forward noising dynamics can be\nwritten for any finite number $N$ of pixels and in the limit $N \\to + \\infty$\nto extract the large deviations properties.

Among its notable variants, Vector\nApproximate Message Passing (VAMP), Generalized Approximate Survey Propagation\n(GASP), and Vector Approximate Survey Propagation (VASP) have demonstrated\neffectiveness even when the assumed generative models differ from the true\nmodels. However, many fundamental questions regarding model mismatch remain\nunanswered. For instance, it is still unclear what level of model mismatch is\nrequired for the postulated posterior estimate (PPE) to exhibit a replica\nsymmetry breaking (RSB) structure in the extremum conditions of its free\nenergy, and what order of RSB is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a novel\napproximate message passing algorithm that incorporates K-step RSB (KRSB) and\nnaturally reduces to VAMP and VASP with specific parameter selections. We refer\nto this as the K-step VASP (KVASP) algorithm. Simulations show that KVASP\nsignificantly outperforms VAMP and GASP in estimation accuracy, particularly\nwhen the assumed prior has discrete support and the measurement matrix is\nnon-i.i.d.. Additionally, the state evolution (SE) of KVASP, derived\nheuristically, accurately tracks the per-iteration mean squared error (MSE). A\ncomparison between the SE and the free energy under the KRSB ansatz reveals\nthat the fixed-point equations of SE align with the saddle-point equations of\nthe free energy. This suggests that, once the KRSB ansatz holds and the SE\nfixed point is reached, KVASP can accurately compute the PPE in the large\nsystem limit (LSL).",

We use this dependence to\nconstrain the velocity dispersion function (VDF) evolution from the Strong\nLensing Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample of lenses in the redshift range 0.25 < z <\n0.75. Our modeling of the lens population includes lens identifiability given\nsurvey parameters, and constrains the evolution of the VDF based on the\nredshift distributions of sources and lenses as well as the distribution of\nEinstein radii. We consider five different assumptions for the reference VDF at\nredshift zero and two sets of scaling relations for the VDF. We find that in\nall cases the observed lens sample favors a slow evolution of both the VDF\nnormalization factor and the VDF characteristic velocity with redshift which is\nconsistent with a VDF that is constant in redshift for z < 0.75.",

    "abstract": "Consider a market where a seller owns an item for sale and a buyer wants to\npurchase it. Each player has private information, known as their type. It can\nbe costly and difficult for the players to reach an agreement through direct\ncommunication. However, with a mediator as a trusted third party, both players\ncan communicate privately with the mediator without worrying about leaking too\nmuch or too little information. The mediator can design and commit to a\nmulti-round communication protocol for both players, in which they update their\nbeliefs about the other player's type. The mediator cannot force the players to\ntrade but can influence their behaviors by sending messages to them.\n  We study the problem of designing revenue-maximizing mechanisms for the\nmediator. We show that the mediator can, without loss of generality, focus on a\nset of direct and incentive-compatible mechanisms. We then formulate this\nproblem as a mathematical program and provide an optimal solution in closed\nform under a regularity condition. Our mechanism is simple and has a threshold\nstructure. Additionally, we extend our results to general cases by utilizing a\nvariant version of the ironing technique. In the end, we discuss some\ninteresting properties revealed from the optimal mechanism, such as, in the\noptimal mechanism, the mediator may even lose money in some cases.",

Based on the\nstandard conceptual model, we develop an analytic minimal model of the\nconvection lifecycle in the form of coupled reaction rules. This reaction\nscheme is equivalent to a system of coupled nonlinear differential equations\nthat qualitatively agree with the empirically known dynamics. In order to\ndemonstrate quantitative agreement of our convection-lifecycle model, we\nconstruct a representative random sample of satellite and radar observations of\ndeep-convection events over Germany.

In this paper, we present the findings from a think-aloud study\nconducted to investigate what students think when working on method-level\nrefactoring exercises. We use grounded theory to identify and classify student\nreasoning. As a result of the analysis, we identify a set of eight reasons\ngiven by students to refactor code, which either concerns the presence of code\nquality issues, the improvement of software quality attributes, or code\nsemantics. We also analyze which quality issues are identified by students, and\nto which reasonings these quality issues are related. We found that experienced\nstudents reason more often about code quality attributes rather than pointing\nat a problem they see in the code. Students were able to remove code quality\nissues in most cases. However, they often overlooked particular issues, such as\nthe presence of a method with multiple responsibilities or the use of a less\nsuitable loop structure.",

However, explaining the decisions made\nby these AI systems poses a significant challenge due to the opaque nature of\nrecent deep learning models, which typically function as black boxes. To\naddress this opacity, a multitude of explainability techniques have emerged.\nHowever, in practical business applications, the challenge lies in selecting an\nappropriate explainability method that balances comprehensibility with\naccuracy. This paper addresses the practical need of understanding differences\nin the output of explainability techniques by proposing a novel method for the\nassessment of the agreement of different explainability techniques. Based on\nour proposed methods, we provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of six\nleading explainability techniques to help guiding the selection of such\ntechniques in practice. Our proposed general-purpose method is evaluated on top\nof one of the most popular deep learning architectures, the Vision Transformer\nmodel, which is frequently employed in business applications. Notably, we\npropose a novel metric to measure the agreement of explainability techniques\nthat can be interpreted visually.

Advances in muscle\nrecordings and deep learning allow us to decode the spiking activity of spinal\nmotor neurons (MNs) in real time and with high accuracy. MNs represent the\nmotor output layer of the CNS, receiving and sampling signals originating in\ndifferent regions in the nervous system, and generating the neural commands\nthat control muscles. The input signals to MNs can be estimated from the MN\noutputs. Here we argue that peripheral neural interfaces using muscle sensors\nrepresent a promising, non-invasive approach to estimate some neural activity\nfrom the CNS that reaches the MNs but does not directly modulate force\nproduction. We also discuss the evidence supporting this concept, and the\nnecessary advances to consolidate and test MN-based CNS interfaces in\ncontrolled and real-world settings.",

Inspired by the\ncontext-dependent plasticity mechanism of the brain, we propose a\nSimilarity-based Context Aware Spiking Neural Network (SCA-SNN) continual\nlearning algorithm to efficiently accomplish task incremental learning and\nclass incremental learning. Based on contextual similarity across tasks, the\nSCA-SNN model can adaptively reuse neurons from previous tasks that are\nbeneficial for new tasks (the more similar, the more neurons are reused) and\nflexibly expand new neurons for the new task (the more similar, the fewer\nneurons are expanded). Selective reuse and discriminative expansion\nsignificantly improve the utilization of previous knowledge and reduce energy\nconsumption. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR100, ImageNet generalized\ndatasets, and FMNIST-MNIST, SVHN-CIFAR100 mixed datasets show that our SCA-SNN\nmodel achieves superior performance compared to both SNN-based and DNN-based\ncontinual learning algorithms.

Most of\nthese works designed protocols for complete networks. A key goal in Byzantine\nprotocols is to tolerate as many Byzantine nodes as possible.\n  The work of Dwork, Peleg, Pippenger, and Upfal [STOC 1986, SICOMP 1988] was\nthe first to address the Byzantine agreement problem in sparse, bounded degree\nnetworks and presented a protocol that achieved almost-everywhere agreement\namong honest nodes. In such networks, all known Byzantine agreement protocols\n(e.g., Dwork, Peleg, Pippenger, and Upfal, STOC 1986; Upfal, PODC 1992; King,\nSaia, Sanwalani, and Vee, FOCS 2006) that tolerated a large number of Byzantine\nnodes had a major drawback that they were not fully-distributed -- in those\nprotocols, nodes are required to have initial knowledge of the entire network\ntopology. This drawback makes such protocols inapplicable to real-world\ncommunication networks such as peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, which are typically\nsparse and bounded degree and where nodes initially have only local knowledge\nof themselves and their neighbors. Indeed, a fundamental open question raised\nby the above works is whether one can design Byzantine protocols that tolerate\na large number of Byzantine nodes in sparse networks that work with only local\nknowledge, i.e., fully-distributed protocols. The work of Augustine,\nPandurangan, and Robinson [PODC 2013] presented the first fully-distributed\nByzantine agreement protocol that works in sparse networks, but it tolerated\nonly up to $O(\\sqrt{n}/ polylog(n))$ Byzantine nodes (where $n$ is the total\nnetwork size).\n  We answer the earlier open question by presenting fully-distributed Byzantine\nagreement protocols for sparse, bounded degree networks that tolerate\nsignificantly more Byzantine nodes -- up to $O(n/ polylog(n))$ of them.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the mental health penalty for women after childbirth\nin Switzerland. Leveraging insurance data, we employ a staggered\ndifference-in-difference research design. The findings reveal a substantial\nmental health penalty for women following the birth of their first child.\nApproximately four years after childbirth, there is a one percentage point\n(p.p.) increase in antidepressant prescriptions, representing a 50% increase\ncompared to pre-birth levels. This increase rises to 1.7 p.p. (a 75% increase)\nsix years postpartum. The mental health penalty is likely not only a direct\nconsequence of giving birth but also a consequence of the changed life\ncircumstances and time constraints that accompany it, as the penalty is rising\nover time and is higher for women who are employed.",

In\nthe absence of reliable polling data, we analyze media sentiment toward two\nmain political parties L'Alliance Lepep and L'Alliance Du Changement by\nclassifying news articles from prominent Mauritian media outlets as positive,\nnegative, or neutral. We employ a multilingual BERT-based model and a custom\nSentiment Scoring Algorithm to quantify sentiment dynamics and apply the\nSentiment Impact Score (SIS) for measuring sentiment influence over time. Our\nforecast model suggests L'Alliance Du Changement is likely to secure a minimum\nof 37 seats, while L'Alliance Lepep is predicted to obtain the remaining 23\nseats out of the 60 available.

LLMs have been a dominant solution due to their remarkable\ncapacity to adapt to new datasets with very few labeled data samples, i.e.,\nfew-shot adaptability.

    "abstract": "Multimedia file fragment classification (MFFC) aims to identify file fragment\ntypes, e.g., image/video, audio, and text without system metadata. It is of\nvital importance in multimedia storage and communication. Existing MFFC methods\ntypically treat fragments as 1D byte sequences and emphasize the relations\nbetween separate bytes (interbytes) for classification. However, the more\ninformative relations inside bytes (intrabytes) are overlooked and seldom\ninvestigated. By looking inside bytes, the bit-level details of file fragments\ncan be accessed, enabling a more accurate classification. Motivated by this, we\nfirst propose Byte2Image, a novel visual representation model that incorporates\npreviously overlooked intrabyte information into file fragments and\nreinterprets these fragments as 2D grayscale images. This model involves a\nsliding byte window to reveal the intrabyte information and a rowwise stacking\nof intrabyte ngrams for embedding fragments into a 2D space. Thus, complex\ninterbyte and intrabyte correlations can be mined simultaneously using powerful\nvision networks. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end dual-branch network\nByteNet to enhance robust correlation mining and feature representation.\nByteNet makes full use of the raw 1D byte sequence and the converted 2D image\nthrough a shallow byte branch feature extraction (BBFE) and a deep image branch\nfeature extraction (IBFE) network. In particular, the BBFE, composed of a\nsingle fully-connected layer, adaptively recognizes the co-occurrence of\nseveral some specific bytes within the raw byte sequence, while the IBFE, built\non a vision Transformer, effectively mines the complex interbyte and intrabyte\ncorrelations from the converted image.

While MRI, CT, and PET modalities have significantly benefited\nfrom deep learning segmentation techniques, more recent modalities, like\nfunctional ultrasound (fUS), have seen limited progress. fUS is a non invasive\nimaging method that measures changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) with high\nspatio-temporal resolution. However, distinguishing arterioles from venules in\nfUS is challenging due to opposing blood flow directions within the same pixel.\nUltrasound localization microscopy (ULM) can enhance resolution by tracking\nmicrobubble contrast agents but is invasive, and lacks dynamic CBV\nquantification. In this paper, we introduce the first deep learning-based\nsegmentation tool for fUS images, capable of differentiating signals from\ndifferent vascular compartments, based on ULM automatic annotation and enabling\ndynamic CBV quantification. We evaluate various UNet architectures on fUS\nimages of rat brains, achieving competitive segmentation performance, with 90%\naccuracy, a 71% F1 score, and an IoU of 0.59, using only 100 temporal frames\nfrom a fUS stack.

Additionally, models trained on\nresting-state data generalize well to images captured during visual\nstimulation, highlighting robustness. This work offers a non-invasive,\ncost-effective alternative to ULM, enhancing fUS data interpretation and\nimproving understanding of vessel function.

Ultra- and hyper-luminous IR galaxies (U/HyLIRGs) are thought to\nrepresent a transition phase of galaxies from a rapidly growing period to a\nquiescent status as gas swept out by outflows, providing a laboratory to\ninvestigate outflows and their feedback effects on the hosts. In this paper we\nreport recent Gemini and ALMA observations of a HyLIRG, J1126 at $z=0.46842$,\nwhich has been identified with a puzzling co-existence of a fast ionized\noutflow ($>2000$ km s$^{-1}$) and an intense starburst (star formation rate of\n800 $M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The Gemini observation shows the fast ionized\noutflow is extended to several kpc with a mass-loss rate of 180 $M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$. A massive molecular outflow with a high mass-loss rate (2500\n$M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is revealed by ALMA. The multi-phase outflows show large\nfactors of momentum boost and loading of kinetic power, indicating a driving by\nthermal pressure of a nuclear hot wind and/or radiation pressure of a highly\nobscured AGN. In addition to ejection of kinetic energy, it is also found that\nthe powerful outflow can induce an ionizing shock in the galaxy disk and\nenhance the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas. The powerful outflow\nprobably results in an instantaneous negative feedback and shows potential to\nregulate the host growth in a long term.",

Here we show\nhow generic multiterminal circuits can be expressed as gyrator networks with\nquantized gyration conductance, giving rise to anyonic excitations carrying\n$q/p$ fractional fluxes ($q,p$ integer), measurable via a fractional\nAharonov-Casher phase.

These challenges make\nit difficult to compute realistic and reliable CV hemodynamics by incorporating\nclinical data such as 4D magnetic resonance imaging. To address these\nchallenges, we focus on controlling the outflow boundary conditions to optimize\nCV flow dynamics and minimize the discrepancy between target and computed flow\nvelocity profiles. The fluid flow is governed by unsteady Navier--Stokes\nequations with physical parametric dependence, i.e. the Reynolds number.\nNumerical solutions of OCP$_{(\\mu)}$s require substantial computational\nresources, highlighting the need for robust and efficient ROMs to perform\nreal-time and many-query simulations.

The\nGalerkin finite element method is used to compute the high-fidelity solutions\nin the offline phase.

The results show that the power spectrum based\non the tip velocity exhibits a scaling akin to that of the Lagrangian\nstatistics of fluid elements, but decays with a distinct timescale and\nmagnitude modulated by the Weber number based on the bubble size.

In research, the papers generated by the\nCycleResearcher model achieved a score of 5.36 in simulated peer reviews,\nshowing some competitiveness in terms of simulated review scores compared to\nthe preprint level of 5.24 from human experts, while still having room for\nimprovement compared to the accepted paper level of 5.69.

    "abstract": "Recently, Gaussian splatting has received more and more attention in the\nfield of static scene rendering. Due to the low computational overhead and\ninherent flexibility of explicit representations, plane-based explicit methods\nare popular ways to predict deformations for Gaussian-based dynamic scene\nrendering models. However, plane-based methods rely on the inappropriate\nlow-rank assumption and excessively decompose the space-time 4D encoding,\nresulting in overmuch feature overlap and unsatisfactory rendering quality. To\ntackle these problems, we propose Grid4D, a dynamic scene rendering model based\non Gaussian splatting and employing a novel explicit encoding method for the 4D\ninput through the hash encoding. Different from plane-based explicit\nrepresentations, we decompose the 4D encoding into one spatial and three\ntemporal 3D hash encodings without the low-rank assumption. Additionally, we\ndesign a novel attention module that generates the attention scores in a\ndirectional range to aggregate the spatial and temporal features. The\ndirectional attention enables Grid4D to more accurately fit the diverse\ndeformations across distinct scene components based on the spatial encoded\nfeatures. Moreover, to mitigate the inherent lack of smoothness in explicit\nrepresentation methods, we introduce a smooth regularization term that keeps\nour model from the chaos of deformation prediction. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat Grid4D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in visual\nquality and rendering speed.",

    "abstract": "One key challenge in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is the absence of\nground-truth OOD samples during training. One principled approach to address\nthis issue is to use samples from external datasets as outliers (i.e., pseudo\nOOD samples) to train OOD detectors. However, we find empirically that the\noutlier samples often present a distribution shift compared to the true OOD\nsamples, especially in Long-Tailed Recognition (LTR) scenarios, where ID\nclasses are heavily imbalanced, \\ie, the true OOD samples exhibit very\ndifferent probability distribution to the head and tailed ID classes from the\noutliers. In this work, we propose a novel approach, namely normalized outlier\ndistribution adaptation (AdaptOD), to tackle this distribution shift problem.\nOne of its key components is dynamic outlier distribution adaptation that\neffectively adapts a vanilla outlier distribution based on the outlier samples\nto the true OOD distribution by utilizing the OOD knowledge in the predicted\nOOD samples during inference. Further, to obtain a more reliable set of\npredicted OOD samples on long-tailed ID data, a novel dual-normalized energy\nloss is introduced in AdaptOD, which leverages class- and sample-wise\nnormalized energy to enforce a more balanced prediction energy on imbalanced ID\nsamples. This helps avoid bias toward the head samples and learn a\nsubstantially better vanilla outlier distribution than existing energy losses\nduring training. It also eliminates the need of manually tuning the sensitive\nmargin hyperparameters in energy losses. Empirical results on three popular\nbenchmarks for OOD detection in LTR show the superior performance of AdaptOD\nover state-of-the-art methods.

Although many evidences\nsuggest that CMEs can undergo significant rotation during the early phases of\nevolution in the solar corona, there are few reports that CMEs rotate in the\ninterplanetary space. In this work, we use multi-spacecraft observations and a\nnumerical simulation starting from the lower corona close to the solar surface\nto understand the CME event on 2021 December 4, with an emphatic investigation\nof its rotation. This event is observed as a partial halo CME from the back\nside of the Sun by coronagraphs, and reaches the BepiColombo spacecraft and the\nMAVEN/Tianwen-1 as a magnetic flux rope-like structure. The simulation\ndiscloses that in the solar corona the CME is approximately a translational\nmotion, while the interplanetary propagation process evidences a gradual change\nof axis orientation of the CME's flux rope-like structure. It is also found\nthat the downside and the right flank of the CME moves with the fast solar\nwind, and the upside does in the slow-speed stream. The different parts of the\nCME with different speeds generate the nonidentical displacements of its\nmagnetic structure, resulting in the rotation of the CME in the interplanetary\nspace. Furthermore, at the right flank of the CME exists a corotating\ninteraction region (CIR), which makes the orientation of the CME alter, and\nalso deviates from its route due to the CME. These results provide new insight\non interpreting CMEs' dynamics and structures during their travelling through\nthe heliosphere.",

The exact spatial positions of natural fractures and\nthe dynamic in-situ distribution of fluids were imaged using a CT-scan setup.\nTo model the targeted system, we followed a domain decomposition approach for\nmatrix and fractures and a multi-network architecture for the separate\ncalculation of water saturation and pressure. The flow equations in the matrix,\nfractures and interplay between them were solved during training. Prior to\nfully-coupled simulations, we proposed pre-training the model. This aided in a\nmore efficient and successful training of the coupled system. Both for the\nsynthetic and experimental inverse problems, we determined flow parameters\nwithin the matrix and the fractures. Multiple random initializations of network\nand system parameters were performed to assess the uncertainty and uniqueness\nof the results. The results confirmed the precision of the inverse calculated\nparameters in retrieving the main flow characteristics of the system. The\nconsideration of multiscale matrix-fracture impacts is commonly overlooked in\nexisting workflows. Accounting for them led to several orders of magnitude\nvariations in the calculated flow properties compared to not accounting for\nthem.

However, the\nintensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader\nadoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video\nframes, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the\nskipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff\nComputation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires\nto cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear\ncomputations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance\nof sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy\ndegradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling\nmethod to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to\nminimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our\nframework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders.\nSparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with\nminimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead.

The outcomes indicate that\nincorporating levels of detail into Gaussian avatars can decrease computational\ncosts during rendering while upholding commendable visual quality, thereby\nenhancing runtime frame rates. We advocate adopting LoDAvatar to render\nmultiple dynamic Gaussian avatars or extensive Gaussian scenes to balance\nvisual quality and computational costs.",

While existing optimization methods are\neffective in optimizing short prompts, they struggle with longer, more complex\nones, often risking information loss and being sensitive to small\nperturbations. To address these challenges, we propose SCULPT (Systematic\nTuning of Long Prompts), a framework that treats prompt optimization as a\nhierarchical tree refinement problem. SCULPT represents prompts as tree\nstructures, enabling targeted modifications while preserving contextual\nintegrity. It employs a Critic-Actor framework that generates reflections and\napplies actions to refine the prompt. Evaluations demonstrate SCULPT's\neffectiveness on long prompts, its robustness to adversarial perturbations, and\nits ability to generate high-performing prompts even without any initial\nhuman-written prompt. Compared to existing state of the art methods, SCULPT\nconsistently improves LLM performance by preserving essential task information\nwhile applying structured refinements. Both qualitative and quantitative\nanalyses show that SCULPT produces more stable and interpretable prompt\nmodifications, ensuring better generalization across tasks.",

Recent\nNIMROD simulations have demonstrated that the local impurity radiation cooling\ncan drive the seed island growth and trigger the subsequent onset of\nneoclassical tearing mode instability. The seed island is mainly driven by the\nlocal helical perturbation of the diamagnetic current induced by the perturbed\npressure gradient as a result of the impurity radiative cooling on the rational\nsurface. A heuristic closure for the neoclassical viscosity is adopted, and the\nseed island is further driven by the perturbed bootstrap current induced from\nthe neoclassical electron viscous stress in the extended Ohm's law. The growth\nrate of the NTM in simulations is found proportional to the electron\nneoclassical viscosity, and a theoretical neoclassical driving term is adopted\nto account for the nonlinear neoclassical island growth in the simulations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent advances in immunology and synthetic biology have accelerated\nthe development of deep generative methods for DNA sequence design. Two\ndominant approaches in this field are AutoRegressive (AR) models and Diffusion\nModels (DMs). However, genomic sequences are functionally heterogeneous,\nconsisting of multiple connected regions (e.g., Promoter Regions, Exons, and\nIntrons) where elements within each region come from the same probability\ndistribution, but the overall sequence is non-homogeneous. This heterogeneous\nnature presents challenges for a single model to accurately generate genomic\nsequences. In this paper, we analyze the properties of AR models and DMs in\nheterogeneous genomic sequence generation, pointing out crucial limitations in\nboth methods: (i) AR models capture the underlying distribution of data by\nfactorizing and learning the transition probability but fail to capture the\nglobal property of DNA sequences. (ii) DMs learn to recover the global\ndistribution but tend to produce errors at the base pair level. To overcome the\nlimitations of both approaches, we propose a post-training sampling method,\ntermed Absorb & Escape (A&E) to perform compositional generation from AR models\nand DMs. This approach starts with samples generated by DMs and refines the\nsample quality using an AR model through the alternation of the Absorb and\nEscape steps. To assess the quality of generated sequences, we conduct\nextensive experiments on 15 species for conditional and unconditional DNA\ngeneration. The experiment results from motif distribution, diversity checks,\nand genome integration tests unequivocally show that A&E outperforms\nstate-of-the-art AR models and DMs in genomic sequence generation.",

Recognizing the\ncritical role of public awareness, individual vaccination choices appear to be\nan essential factor in collective efforts against emerging health threats. This\nstudy aims to characterize disease transmission dynamics under evolving social\nconnections, information sharing, and individual vaccination decisions. To\naddress this important problem, we present an integrated behaviour-prevalence\nmodel on an adaptive multiplex network. While the physical layer (layer-II)\nfocuses on disease transmission under vaccination, the virtual layer (layer-I),\nrepresenting individuals' social contacts, is adaptive and deals with\ninformation dissemination, resulting in the dynamics of vaccination choice in a\nsocially influenced environment. Utilizing the microscopic Markov Chain Method\n(MMCM), we derive analytical expressions of the epidemic threshold for\npopulations with different levels of perceived vaccine risk. It indicates that\nthe adaptive nature of social contacts contributes to the higher epidemic\nthreshold compared to non-adaptive scenarios, and numerical simulations also\nsupport that. The network topology, such as the power-law exponent of a\nscale-free network, also significantly influences the spreading of infections\nin the network population. We also observe that vaccine uptake increases\nproportionately with the number of individuals with a higher perceived\ninfection risk or a higher sensitivity of an individual to their non-vaccinated\nneighbours. As a result, our findings provide insights for public health\nofficials in developing vaccination programs in light of the evolution of\nsocial connections, information dissemination, and vaccination choice in the\ndigital era.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the acoustic scene classification (ASC) task is to classify\nrecordings into one of the predefined acoustic scene classes. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, ASC systems often encounter challenges such as recording\ndevice mismatch, low-complexity constraints, and the limited availability of\nlabeled data. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, a data-efficient and\nlow-complexity ASC system is built with a new model architecture and better\ntraining strategies. Specifically, we firstly design a new low-complexity\narchitecture named Rep-Mobile by integrating multi-convolution branches which\ncan be reparameterized at inference. Compared to other models, it achieves\nbetter performance and less computational complexity. Then we apply the\nknowledge distillation strategy and provide a comparison of the data efficiency\nof the teacher model with different architectures. Finally, we propose a\nprogressive pruning strategy, which involves pruning the model multiple times\nin small amounts, resulting in better performance compared to a single step\npruning. Experiments are conducted on the TAU dataset. With Rep-Mobile and\nthese training strategies, our proposed ASC system achieves the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) results so far, while also winning the first place with\na significant advantage over others in the DCASE2024 Challenge.",

    "abstract": "Data from observational studies (OSs) is widely available and readily\nobtainable yet frequently contains confounding biases. On the other hand, data\nderived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) helps to reduce these biases;\nhowever, it is expensive to gather, resulting in a tiny size of randomized\ndata. For this reason, effectively fusing observational data and randomized\ndata to better estimate heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) has gained\nincreasing attention. However, existing methods for integrating observational\ndata with randomized data must require \\textit{complete} observational data,\nmeaning that both treated subjects and untreated subjects must be included in\nOSs. This prerequisite confines the applicability of such methods to very\nspecific situations, given that including all subjects, whether treated or\nuntreated, in observational studies is not consistently achievable. In our\npaper, we propose a resilient approach to \\textbf{C}ombine \\textbf{I}ncomplete\n\\textbf{O}bservational data and randomized data for HTE estimation, which we\nabbreviate as \\textbf{CIO}. The CIO is capable of estimating HTEs efficiently\nregardless of the completeness of the observational data, be it full or\npartial. Concretely, a confounding bias function is first derived using the\npseudo-experimental group from OSs, in conjunction with the pseudo-control\ngroup from RCTs, via an effect estimation procedure. This function is\nsubsequently utilized as a corrective residual to rectify the observed outcomes\nof observational data during the HTE estimation by combining the available\nobservational data and the all randomized data.

Recent linear and transformer-based forecasters have\nshown superior performance in time series forecasting.

Furthermore, they typically sacrifice essential temporal\ncorrelation among consecutive training samples by shuffling them into\nmini-batches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fast and effective\nSpectral Attention mechanism, which preserves temporal correlations among\nsamples and facilitates the handling of long-range information while\nmaintaining the base model structure. Spectral Attention preserves long-period\ntrends through a low-pass filter and facilitates gradient to flow between\nsamples.

While character- or\nbyte-level models like ByT5 attempt to address these concerns, they have not\ngained widespread adoption -- processing raw byte streams without tokenization\nresults in significantly longer sequence lengths, making training and inference\ninefficient. This work introduces MrT5 (MergeT5), a more efficient variant of\nByT5 that integrates a token deletion mechanism in its encoder to dynamically\nshorten the input sequence length. After processing through a fixed number of\nencoder layers, a learned delete gate determines which tokens are to be removed\nand which are to be retained for subsequent layers. MrT5 effectively \"merges\"\ncritical information from deleted tokens into a more compact sequence,\nleveraging contextual information from the remaining tokens. In continued\npre-training experiments, we find that MrT5 can achieve significant gains in\ninference runtime with minimal effect on performance, as measured by\nbits-per-byte. Additionally, with multilingual training, MrT5 adapts to the\northographic characteristics of each language, learning language-specific\ncompression rates. Furthermore, MrT5 shows comparable accuracy to ByT5 on\ndownstream evaluations such as XNLI, TyDi QA, and character-level tasks while\nreducing sequence lengths by up to 75%.

    "abstract": "Hydrogen in its metallic form is the most common material in our solar\nsystem, found under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions found in\ngiant planets. Such conditions are inaccessible to experiment and consequently,\ntheoretical work has typically led experiment. Many remarkable properties are\nproposed for metallic hydrogen, which is expected to exist in solid form down\nto low temperatures. Relevant here is that solid metallic hydrogen is not\nexpected to have a close-packed structure, even at extreme pressures. The\npredicted crystal structure has a packing fraction of only 0.44 compared with\n0.74 for fcc. Alloying with other metallic elements can form compounds with\natomic hydrogen and much reduced metallization pressure. Here, we investigate\nthe possible solid solubility of a representative range of elements (Be, B, Mg,\nS, Fe, La) in metallic atomic hydrogen near 500GPa. Zero point energy is highly\nsignificant in all cases. The metallic elements Be, Mg, Fe, and La have a\nwell-defined clathrate-style first neighbour shell at 300K, while the\nnon-metallic B and S have more open arrangements. All the elements considered\nare soluble, in sites substituting for more than one hydrogen atom. The solid\nsolubility of such a wide range of ambient bonding types: simple metals,\ncovalent materials, transition metals, lanthanides, which gives a strong\nindication that most elements will dissolve in solid metallic hydrogen.",

    "abstract": "In statistical inference, we commonly assume that samples are independent and\nidentically distributed from a probability distribution included in a\npre-specified statistical model. However, such an assumption is often violated\nin practice. Even an unexpected extreme sample called an {\\it outlier} can\nsignificantly impact classical estimators. Robust statistics studies how to\nconstruct reliable statistical methods that efficiently work even when the\nideal assumption is violated. Recently, some works revealed that robust\nestimators such as Tukey's median are well approximated by the generative\nadversarial net (GAN), a popular learning method for complex generative models\nusing neural networks. GAN is regarded as a learning method using integral\nprobability metrics (IPM), which is a discrepancy measure for probability\ndistributions. In most theoretical analyses of Tukey's median and its GAN-based\napproximation, however, the Gaussian or elliptical distribution is assumed as\nthe statistical model. In this paper, we explore the application of GAN-like\nestimators to a general class of statistical models. As the statistical model,\nwe consider the kernel exponential family that includes both finite and\ninfinite-dimensional models. To construct a robust estimator, we propose the\nsmoothed total variation (STV) distance as a class of IPMs. Then, we\ntheoretically investigate the robustness properties of the STV-based\nestimators. Our analysis reveals that the STV-based estimator is robust against\nthe distribution contamination for the kernel exponential family. Furthermore,\nwe analyze the prediction accuracy of a Monte Carlo approximation method, which\ncircumvents the computational difficulty of the normalization constant.",

Variations over time scales of weeks, months or years are mostly\nrestricted to irregular low-amplitude modulations. However, some of them\noccasionally suffer from so-called stunted outbursts, that is, small-scale\nbrightenings of less than a magnitude lasting for a couple of days to weeks.\nThere is no consensus about the physical mechanisms behind these outbursts.\nHere I discuss the common properties of a group of novalike variables (which I\ncall AH~Pictoris stars after its most prominent member) that exhibit a\ncontinuous train of successive stunted outbursts over their entire\nobservational history, or at least for several years. The outburst amplitudes\nare stable in a given system, always ranging between 0.5 and 1~mag in the\nvisual band. The outburst intervals, at an overall range between 12 and 30\ndays, and the outburst profiles can gradually evolve, but no sudden changes are\nobserved. On shorter time scales the orbital waveforms are not only\nsurprisingly similar, but also evolve in the same way over the outburst cycle.\nAll AH~Pic stars have absolute visual magnitudes in the overlap region between\nabsolute magnitudes of all novalike variables and of quiescent dwarf novae\nabove the CV period gap. So far, I identified seven novalike variables with the\nconsistent photometric behavior which may be termed the AH~Pic syndrome.\nSeveral more systems may be related objects.

    "abstract": "We construct 2d Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity in the framework of symmetric\nteleparallel gravity based on a non-metricity tensor. In symmetric teleparallel\ngravity, we often use the scalar quantity $Q$ composed of the bilinear terms of\nthe non-metricity tensor but $Q$ is not a unique scalar quantity from the\nviewpoint of covariance. However, other scalar quantities composed of the\nnon-metricity tensor generate ghosts in general. In two dimensions, because a\npropagating gravitational mode does not exist, if we consider general scalar\nquantities, there might appear any propagating modes although these modes are\noften ghosts. We consider a general combination of the terms given by the\nbi-linear of the non-metricity tensors. After finding the condition that the\nconformal form of the metric is compatible with the coincident gauge, where\nconnections vanish, we determine the combination so that a solution with\nconstant curvature exists. The obtained model corresponds to 2d JT gravity in\nthe framework of the symmetric teleparallel gravity. The conformal mode\npropagates as a scalar in this theory and we also consider the condition that\nthe scalar mode is not a ghost.",

With Shopping MMLU, we benchmark over 20 existing\nLLMs and uncover valuable insights about practices and prospects of building\nversatile LLM-based shop assistants.

After that, we invest\nsignificant efforts in comprehending the detection rules of each tool,\nsubsequently unifying 67 general/common vulnerability types for {Android} SAST\ntools. We also redefine and implement a standardized reporting format, ensuring\nuniformity in presenting results across all tools.

Compared with interaction\nmodeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene,\nheterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error\naccumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more\ncomplex. To tackle the two problems, this paper proposes heterogeneous\ninteraction modeling with reduced accumulated error for multi-agent trajectory\nprediction.

A heterogeneous attention mechanism is defined on the\ninteraction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors\nto the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this paper\nanalyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and\nproposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for\nreducing the two types of errors respectively.

An anchoring strength linking the\nactive and passive media tunes the system between active suspension theory in\nNewtonian fluids in one limit, and active nematic theory in another. For\nextensile active stresses, beyond a critical active Ericksen number or particle\nconcentration, the suspension first comes into alignment, then buckles via a\nclassical bend instability. Rather than entering the fully developed roiling\nstate observed in isotropic fluids, the development is arrested into a steady,\nflowing state by fluid elasticity. Arrested states of higher wavenumber appear\nat yet larger extensile activity, and a phase transition is identified at\nfinite anchoring strength.

    "abstract": "Entity alignment is crucial for merging knowledge across knowledge graphs, as\nit matches entities with identical semantics. The standard method matches these\nentities based on their embedding similarities using semi-supervised learning.\nHowever, diverse data sources lead to non-isomorphic neighborhood structures\nfor aligned entities, complicating alignment, especially for less common and\nsparsely connected entities. This paper presents a soft label propagation\nframework that integrates multi-source data and iterative seed enhancement,\naddressing scalability challenges in handling extensive datasets where scale\ncomputing excels. The framework uses seeds for anchoring and selects optimal\nrelationship pairs to create soft labels rich in neighborhood features and\nsemantic relationship data. A bidirectional weighted joint loss function is\nimplemented, which reduces the distance between positive samples and\ndifferentially processes negative samples, taking into account the\nnon-isomorphic neighborhood structures. Our method outperforms existing\nsemi-supervised approaches, as evidenced by superior results on multiple\ndatasets, significantly improving the quality of entity alignment.",

While generating a single high-quality 3D\nobject is now feasible, generating multiple objects with reasonable\ninteractions within a 3D space, a.k.a. compositional 3D generation, presents\nsubstantial challenges. This paper introduces CompGS, a novel generative\nframework that employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) for efficient, compositional\ntext-to-3D content generation. To achieve this goal, two core designs are\nproposed: (1) 3D Gaussians Initialization with 2D compositionality: We transfer\nthe well-established 2D compositionality to initialize the Gaussian parameters\non an entity-by-entity basis, ensuring both consistent 3D priors for each\nentity and reasonable interactions among multiple entities; (2) Dynamic\nOptimization: We propose a dynamic strategy to optimize 3D Gaussians using\nScore Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. CompGS first automatically decomposes\n3D Gaussians into distinct entity parts, enabling optimization at both the\nentity and composition levels. Additionally, CompGS optimizes across objects of\nvarying scales by dynamically adjusting the spatial parameters of each entity,\nenhancing the generation of fine-grained details, particularly in smaller\nentities. Qualitative comparisons and quantitative evaluations on T3Bench\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of CompGS in generating compositional 3D objects\nwith superior image quality and semantic alignment over existing methods.\nCompGS can also be easily extended to controllable 3D editing, facilitating\nscene generation.

While numerous tools are available for analyzing smart contracts in\nsource code, only about 1.79% of smart contracts on Ethereum are open-source.\nFor existing tools that target bytecodes, most of them only consider the\nsemantic logic context and disregard function interface information in the\nbytecodes. In this paper, we propose COBRA, a novel framework that integrates\nsemantic context and function interfaces to detect vulnerabilities in bytecodes\nof the smart contract. To our best knowledge, COBRA is the first framework that\ncombines these two features. Moreover, to infer the function signatures that\nare not present in signature databases, we propose SRIF, automatically learn\nthe rules of function signatures from the smart contract bytecodes. The\nbytecodes associated with the function signatures are collected by constructing\na control flow graph (CFG) for the SRIF training. We optimize the semantic\ncontext using the operation code in the static single assignment (SSA) format.\nFinally, we integrate the context and function interface representations in the\nlatent space as the contract feature embedding. The contract features in the\nhidden space are decoded for vulnerability classifications with a decoder and\nattention module. Experimental results demonstrate that SRIF can achieve 94.76%\nF1-score for function signature inference. Furthermore, when the ground truth\nABI exists, COBRA achieves 93.45% F1-score for vulnerability classification. In\nthe absence of ABI, the inferred function feature fills the encoder, and the\nsystem accomplishes an 89.46% recall rate.",

To overcome\nthis challenge, we present a novel method named contextual representation\nanchor Network (CRA), where an anchor refers to a cluster center of the\nrepresentations of molecules and serves as a bridge to transfer enriched\ncontextual knowledge into molecular representations and enhance their\nexpressiveness. CRA introduces a dual-augmentation mechanism that includes\ncontext augmentation, which dynamically retrieves analogous unlabeled molecules\nand captures their task-specific contextual knowledge to enhance the anchors,\nand anchor augmentation, which leverages the anchors to augment the molecular\nrepresentations. We evaluate our approach on the MoleculeNet and FS-Mol\nbenchmarks, as well as in domain transfer experiments.

On the other hand,\nthese novel schemes consider more UAN characteristics involving more complex\nparameter configurations, which also challenges simulators in flexibility and\nfineness. To keep abreast of advances in UANs, we propose the Fourth Generation\n(FG) ns-3-based simulator Aqua-Sim~FG, enhancing the general and intelligent\nsimulation ability.

Existing works based on neural radiance fields demonstrate successful 3D\nreconstruction quality on egocentric videos, yet they suffer from long training\nand rendering times. Recently, 3D Gaussian splatting has gained attention for\nits fast optimization and real-time rendering. However, directly using a\nperspective rasterizer to omnidirectional images results in severe distortion\ndue to the different optical properties between two image domains. In this\nwork, we present ODGS, a novel rasterization pipeline for omnidirectional\nimages, with geometric interpretation. For each Gaussian, we define a tangent\nplane that touches the unit sphere and is perpendicular to the ray headed\ntoward the Gaussian center. We then leverage a perspective camera rasterizer to\nproject the Gaussian onto the corresponding tangent plane. The projected\nGaussians are transformed and combined into the omnidirectional image,\nfinalizing the omnidirectional rasterization process. This interpretation\nreveals the implicit assumptions within the proposed pipeline, which we verify\nthrough mathematical proofs. The entire rasterization process is parallelized\nusing CUDA, achieving optimization and rendering speeds 100 times faster than\nNeRF-based methods. Our comprehensive experiments highlight the superiority of\nODGS by delivering the best reconstruction and perceptual quality across\nvarious datasets.

In particular, we include species/energy groups coupled neutrino-matter\ninteractions, such as inelastic neutrino-electron scattering and\nelectron-positron annihilation kernels, into simulations up to 50 ms.\nNeutrino-electron inelastic scattering is known to have effective\nneutrino-matter energy exchange. We show that, with neutrino-electron inelastic\nscattering, simulations predict 75% higher disc mass with slightly different\nmass-averaged compositions, and 18% more ejected mass with similar\ndistributions. The enhancement of the mass of the disc and the ejecta results\nin stronger baryon pollution, leading to less favourable jet launching\nenvironments. Furthermore, neutrino luminosities are about 50, 40, and 30%\nhigher for electron neutrino, electron anti-neutrino, and heavy-lepton\nneutrinos. In contrast, we do not see any significant impacts due to\nelectron-positron annihilation.",

However,\nthe sensitive nature of healthcare data often restricts individual clinical\ninstitutions from sharing data to train sufficiently generalized and unbiased\nML models. Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging approach, which offers a\npromising solution by enabling collaborative model training across multiple\nparticipants without compromising the privacy of the individual data owners.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, there has been limited prior research\napplying FL to the cardiovascular disease domain. Moreover, existing FL\nbenchmarks and datasets are typically simulated and may fall short of\nreplicating the complexity of natural heterogeneity found in realistic datasets\nthat challenges current FL algorithms. To address these gaps, this paper\npresents the first real-world FL benchmark for cardiovascular disease\ndetection, named FedCVD. This benchmark comprises two major tasks:\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) classification and echocardiogram (ECHO) segmentation,\nbased on naturally scattered datasets constructed from the CVD data of seven\ninstitutions. Our extensive experiments on these datasets reveal that FL faces\nnew challenges with real-world non-IID and long-tail data.

Here, our\nRecursive Transformers are efficiently initialized from standard pretrained\nTransformers, but only use a single block of unique layers that is then\nrepeated multiple times in a loop. We further improve performance by\nintroducing Relaxed Recursive Transformers that add flexibility to the layer\ntying constraint via depth-wise low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, yet still\npreserve the compactness of the overall model. We show that our recursive\nmodels (e.g., recursive Gemma 1B) outperform both similar-sized vanilla\npretrained models (such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Pythia 1B) and knowledge\ndistillation baselines -- and can even recover most of the performance of the\noriginal \"full-size\" model (e.g., Gemma 2B with no shared parameters).

In time-reversal\ninvariant systems, we prove a microscopic reciprocity theorem showing that only\ndissipative currents at the Fermi level contribute to density accumulation,\nwhile undergap currents do not. In contrast, in non-time-reversal invariant\nsystems, non-dissipative density accumulations, such as magnetoelectric\npolarization, can appear in both the bulk and edges. Importantly, we find that\nthe net density accumulation does not always vanish, pointing to a global\nnon-conservation that implies the existence of a non-vanishing integrated ``net\ntorque'' in addition to a ``distributed torque'', which has zero spatial\naverage. We show that the distributed torque can be absorbed in the divergence\nof a redefined current that satisfies Onsager reciprocity, while the net torque\nmust be explicitly accounted for.

    "abstract": "We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a\ntwo-sided black hole by constructing non-perturbative length and timeshift\noperators in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We first construct projection\noperators onto the fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift subspaces using the\nreplica trick. We calculate the densities of state for the length and the\ntimeshift, which are found to be finite. This finiteness implies the\ndiscreteness in the spectrum of these quantities. We then construct the\nnon-perturbative length and timeshift operators, and apply them to study the\ntime evolution of the two-sided black hole. We find that at early time, the\nprobability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply\npeaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the\ndistribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and\nthe timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty. In particular, the probability\nof having the negative timeshift states, which corresponds to the white hole\nprobability, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.",

Conditional 3D structure-based drug design\n(3D-SBDD) models, which take into account complex three-dimensional\ninteractions and molecular geometries, are particularly promising. Scaffold\nhopping is an efficient strategy that facilitates the identification of similar\nactive compounds by strategically modifying the core structure of molecules,\neffectively narrowing the wide chemical space and enhancing the discovery of\ndrug-like products. However, the practical application of 3D-SBDD generative\nmodels is hampered by their slow processing speeds. To address this bottleneck,\nwe introduce TurboHopp, an accelerated pocket-conditioned 3D scaffold hopping\nmodel that merges the strategic effectiveness of traditional scaffold hopping\nwith rapid generation capabilities of consistency models. This synergy not only\nenhances efficiency but also significantly boosts generation speeds, achieving\nup to 30 times faster inference speed as well as superior generation quality\ncompared to existing diffusion-based models, establishing TurboHopp as a\npowerful tool in drug discovery. Supported by faster inference speed, we\nfurther optimize our model, using Reinforcement Learning for Consistency Models\n(RLCM), to output desirable molecules.

The adversarial losses aid in content translation while\npreserving style. Unlike traditional video-to-video synthesis methods requiring\npaired inputs, our proposed approach is more general because it does not\nrequire paired inputs. Thus, when dealing with limited videos in the target\ndomain, i.e., few-shot learning, it is particularly effective.

In this work,\nconsidering the constraints from CMB, BBN and the DM relic density, we\ninvestigate the direct detection of the Higgs portal for a sub-GeV SIDM with a\nscalar mediator. For this end, we consider two approaches : one is the\ncosmic-ray accelerated dark matter (CRDM) scattering off the nucleon, the other\nis the electron recoil caused by the halo dark matter. We present direct\ndetection limits for the parameter space of light SIDM and scalar mediator. We\nfind that the detectability in either approach needs a sizable mediator-Higgs\nmixing angle ($\\sin\\theta$) which is larger than one for the CRDM approach and\nlarger than $10^{-3}$ for the electron recoil approach. While the former case\ncannot be realized in the Higgs-portal light SIDM model with a scalar mediator,\nthe latter case may also be constrained by some astrophysical observations or\nbeam dump experiment.

However, their application in the financial\ndomain remains relatively limited. The financial field is inherently complex,\nrequiring a deep understanding across various perspectives, from macro, micro\neconomic trend to quantitative analysis. Motivated by this complexity, a\nmixture of expert LLMs tailored to specific financial domains could offer a\nmore comprehensive understanding for intricate financial tasks. In this paper,\nwe present the FinTeamExperts, a role-specialized LLM framework structured as a\nMixture of Experts (MOEs) for financial analysis. The framework simulates a\ncollaborative team setting by training each model to specialize in distinct\nroles: Macro Analysts, Micro analysts, and Quantitative Analysts. This\nrole-specific specialization enhances the model's ability to integrate their\ndomain-specific expertise. We achieve this by training three 8-billion\nparameter models on different corpus, each dedicated to excelling in specific\nfinance-related roles. We then instruct-tune FinTeamExperts on downstream tasks\nto align with practical financial tasks. The experimental results show that\nFinTeamExperts outperform all models of the same size and larger on three out\nof four datasets.

Furthermore, the cold-start problem -- where\nsystems have insufficient data for new users -- limits their ability to\ngenerate accurate recommendations. Existing methods often address this by\nleveraging similar trajectories from other users, but this approach can be\ncomputationally expensive and increases the context length for LLM-based\nmethods, making them difficult to scale. To address these limitations, we\npropose a method that generates natural language (NL) user profiles from\nlarge-scale, location-based social network (LBSN) check-ins, utilizing robust\npersonality assessments and behavioral theories. These NL profiles capture user\npreferences, routines, and behaviors, improving POI prediction accuracy while\noffering enhanced transparency.

Our method\nis not only competitive with other LLM-based methods but is also more scalable\nfor real-world POI recommender systems.
