However, current practices often rely on rigid pipelines that\noverlook critical data-centric choices in how brain graphs are constructed. In\nthis work, we adopt a Data-Centric AI perspective and systematically define and\nbenchmark a data-centric design space for brain graph construction,\nconstrasting with primarily model-centric prior work. We organize this design\nspace into three stages: temporal signal processing, topology extraction, and\ngraph featurization. Our contributions lie less in novel components and more in\nevaluating how combinations of existing and modified techniques influence\ndownstream performance. Specifically, we study high-amplitude BOLD signal\nfiltering, sparsification and unification strategies for connectivity,\nalternative correlation metrics, and multi-view node and edge features, such as\nincorporating lagged dynamics. Experiments on the HCP1200 and ABIDE datasets\nshow that thoughtful data-centric configurations consistently improve\nclassification accuracy over standard pipelines. These findings highlight the\ncritical role of upstream data decisions and underscore the importance of\nsystematically exploring the data-centric design space for graph-based\nneuroimaging.

We challenge this\nbelief through systematic testing, showing that poor optimization choices,\nrather than inherent trade-offs, often cause safety problems, measured as\nharmful responses to adversarial prompts. By properly selecting key training\nhyper-parameters, e.g., learning rate, batch size, and gradient steps, we\nreduce unsafe model responses from 16\\% to approximately 5\\%, as measured by\nkeyword matching, while maintaining utility performance.

Our experiments on the Llama families across multiple datasets\n(Dolly, Alpaca, ORCA) demonstrate that safety problems during fine-tuning can\nlargely be avoided without specialized interventions, outperforming existing\napproaches that require additional safety data while offering practical\nguidelines for maintaining both model performance and safety during adaptation.",

To avoid posterior collapse, many prior\nworks have tried to control the influence of regularization loss. However, the\ntrade-off between reconstruction and regularization is not satisfactory. For\nthis reason, several methods have been proposed to guarantee latent\nidentifiability, which is the key to avoiding posterior collapse. However, they\nrequire structural constraints on the network architecture. For further\nclarification, we define local posterior collapse to reflect the importance of\nindividual sample points in the data space and to relax the network constraint.\nThen, we propose Latent Reconstruction(LR) loss, which is inspired by\nmathematical properties of injective and composite functions, to control\nposterior collapse without restriction to a specific architecture.

    "abstract": "Following a type Ia supernova (SN Ia) in a double white dwarf (WD) binary, a\nsurviving WD companion leaves at its orbital velocity $\\approx 1$,000 - 3,000\nkm/s. The Gaia mission has discovered seven such hypervelocity WDs with\ninflated radii indicative of shock heating by SN ejecta. We study the\ninteraction between SN ejecta and Roche lobe-filling 0.08 - 0.45 $M_{\\odot}$\nhelium WD companions using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with\nAthena++. Given the importance of the later thermal evolution, we include an\naccurate equation-of-state for the degenerate helium WD donor. We show that a\nlower-mass, larger-radius WD companion is more strongly impacted by SN ejecta\nand undergoes substantial mass loss. We find a tight relation between the\nfractional mass loss and the ratio between the ejecta ram pressure and donor\nvolume-averaged pressure, which can be used for predicting mass loss in other\nsystems. In the most extreme case, the companion becomes a very inflated\n$\\approx0.02\\,M_{\\odot}$ object. We find helium mass loss $\\approx 0.005 -\n0.06\\,M_{\\odot}$ with velocities $\\approx $ 1,000$-$4,000 km/s, which may lead\nto emission lines in the nebular phase. The surviving helium WD receives a kick\nvelocity, but its final velocity is essentially determined by its orbital\nvelocity $\\lesssim$ 1,600 km/s. We model the post-explosion evolution of the\nshock-heated companions using MESA, and find reasonable agreement with the\nhypervelocity stars D6-2, J0546+0836, J1332-3541 & SDSS J1637+3631. A surviving\n$\\gtrsim 0.3\\,M_{\\odot}$ helium WD can be ruled out in SN1972E & SN2011fe, and\nany surviving helium WD is likely ruled out in SN remnants 0509-67.5 & SN1006.",

Our findings indicate that BSS\ncan reduce renewable curtailment by 34% and load shedding by 21%, contributing\nto a more resilient power system in achieving NYS 2030 energy targets.\nFurthermore, the cost of employing BSS for the reduction of load shedding and\nRES curtailment does not increase linearly with additional capacity, revealing\na complex relationship between costs and renewable penetration.

MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and\ngenerates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning,\nin conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target\nsamples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only\nconfident target features are combined.

This association reflects the increased space and\namenities typically found in premium cabins that existing discourse suggests\nmakes their carriage more fuel, and consequently carbon, intensive. One\nincreasingly popular solution is disincentivizing the use of premium cabins in\nfavor of all-economy cabins. How effective might such a policy be. To what\nextent. And how may the revenue impact affect travelers. We address these\nquestions by leveraging an empirical model that integrates cabin configuration\ndata, fuel burn profiles across various aircraft types, and multi-month airfare\ndatasets. Our findings are threefold. First, we find that favoring entirely\nforegoing premium travel classes can reduce per-passenger emissions by between\n8.1 and 21.5 percent, the precise figure varying based on the type of aircraft\nand aircraft stage length involved. Second, we observe that these emissions\nreductions are far less assured on a per-flight and a lifespan basis. Here, an\nall-economy configuration can reduce emissions by 0.45 percent or increase\nemissions by as much as 1.43 percent. Third, we enumerate pronounced revenue\nconsequences associated with an all-economy configuration. This configuration\nproduces aggregate revenue declines of between 4.92 and 23.1 percent,\nnecessitating airfare increases of between 6 and 30 percent to maintain\nbaseline revenue. This increase risks imposing a profound and regressive\neconomic burden on working-class travelers who exhibit markedly higher price\nelasticities of demand compared to their wealthier counterparts and highlights\nthe cross-subsidization airlines leverage to ensure the accessibility of air\ntravel.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age\nindividuals. Early detection of DR can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to\n95%, but a shortage of retinologists and challenges in timely examination\ncomplicate detection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus\nphotographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical\nsettings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to\nlearn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a\nResponsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles\nacross the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for\npreprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification\nmodels. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local\ndataset of 1,046 patients, unseen by both systems. RAIS-DR demonstrated\nsignificant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by\n6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as\nDisparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable\nperformance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to\nreduce healthcare disparities. These results highlight RAIS-DR as a robust and\nethically aligned solution for DR screening in clinical settings.

    "abstract": "X-ray phase-contrast imaging has the potential to improve image contrast with\nlower dose by probing an object's refractive properties as well as its\nabsorptive properties. To reconstruct a phase-contrast image from a raw\ndataset, a phase retrieval algorithm must be applied to invert the forward\nmodel of the image acquisition scheme. Discrete forward modeling presents\nunique computational challenges due to high x-ray wave field sampling\nrequirements. At the cost of accuracy, approximations are often applied for the\nsake of simplicity and experimental convenience. One of the most ubiquitous\nsimplifications is the projection approximation, which neglects refractive\neffects within an object. The approximation's validity decreases when imaging\nthicker objects or using a detector with higher spatial resolution. For greater\naccuracy, one might use the multislice model instead. In this work, we explore\nthe accuracy of the projection approximation in simulated synchrotron micro-CT\nimages. We simulated images using two detector resolutions (0.5 and 2 micron)\nwith either the projection approximation or multislice forward model. Paganin\nphase retrieval was applied to the resulting datasets, and the final\nphase-contrast images were reconstructed using filtered back-projection. The\n2-micron resolution detector images showed little difference between forward\nmodels, indicating the projection approximation is satisfied. With sub-micron\nresolution, there is a noticeable difference in the phase-contrast images,\nespecially around fine details. An accurate phase retrieval algorithm for such\nhigh-resolution data likely requires more detailed forward modeling that avoids\nmaking the projection approximation.",

A critical research gap lies in\nidentifying the underlying causes of hydrogen bond formation and separation\n-understanding which interactions or prior events contribute to their emergence\nover time. With this challenge in mind, we propose leveraging spatio-temporal\ndata analytics and machine learning models to enhance the detection of these\nphenomena. In this paper, our approach is inspired by causal modeling and aims\nto identify the root cause variables of hydrogen bond formation and separation\nevents. Specifically, we treat the separation of hydrogen bonds as an\n\"intervention\" occurring and represent the causal structure of the bonding and\nseparation events in the MDS as graphical causal models. These causal models\nare built using a variational autoencoder-inspired architecture that enables us\nto infer causal relationships across samples with diverse underlying causal\ngraphs while leveraging shared dynamic information. We further include a step\nto infer the root causes of changes in the joint distribution of the causal\nmodels. By constructing causal models that capture shifts in the conditional\ndistributions of molecular interactions during bond formation or separation,\nthis framework provides a novel perspective on root cause analysis in molecular\ndynamic systems.

The QLI is a differential sensor, or gradiometer,\nthat uses a pair of co-trapped atomic ions to perform label-free detection of\nthe electric field gradient produced by a single ligand binding to its receptor\nin vitrified samples. This gradiometric approach provides robust common-mode\nrejection of background electric field noise.

Using IFS-ECMWF ensemble forecasts and ERA5 reanalysis, we\nanalyze the large-scale dynamical mechanisms driving Lidias intensification.\nResults show that the trough played a crucial role in promoting RI by enhancing\nsynoptic-scale ascent, upper-level divergence, and eddy flux convergence. In\nthe higher-intensification ensemble group, stronger Trenberth forcing emerged\nprior to RI onset, suggesting a causative role in preconditioning the storm\nenvironment. This dynamical forcing likely triggered latent heat release, which\nin turn modified the upper-level potential vorticity structure and contributed\nto a subsequent reduction in vertical wind shear. In contrast, the\nlower-intensification group exhibited weaker forcing, higher shear, and a lack\nof sustained ventilation. These findings highlight the importance of diagnosing\nearly dynamical triggers for RI, particularly in regions where operational\naccess to high-resolution models is limited. This approach provides a\ncost-effective framework for anticipating RI using ensemble-based diagnostics\nand could serve as a valuable forecasting tool in data-sparse areas such as the\nPacific coast of Mexico.

Although the standard\nRobbins--Monro method iteratively approaches solutions, its convergence speed\nis limited by noisy measurements and naivety to any prior information about the\nobjective function. The proposed Bayesian sequence dynamically updates the\nprior distribution with newly obtained observations to accelerate convergence\nrates and robustness. The paper demonstrates almost sure convergence of the\nsequence and analyses its convergence rates for both one-dimensional and\nmulti-dimensional problems. We evaluate the method in a practical application\nthat suffers from large variability and allows only a few function evaluations,\nspecifically estimating thresholds in noninvasive brain stimulation, where the\nmethod is more robust and accurate than conventional alternatives.

    "abstract": "Quantum federated learning (QFL) is an emerging field that has the potential\nto revolutionize computation by taking advantage of quantum physics concepts in\na distributed machine learning (ML) environment. However, the majority of\navailable quantum simulators are primarily built for general quantum circuit\nsimulation and do not include integrated support for machine learning tasks\nsuch as training, evaluation, and iterative optimization. Furthermore,\ndesigning and assessing quantum learning algorithms is still a difficult and\nresource-intensive task. Real-time updates are essential for observing model\nconvergence, debugging quantum circuits, and making conscious choices during\ntraining with the use of limited resources. Furthermore, most current\nsimulators fail to support the integration of user-specific data for training\npurposes, undermining the main purpose of using a simulator. In this study, we\nintroduce SimQFL, a customized simulator that simplifies and accelerates QFL\nexperiments in quantum network applications. SimQFL supports real-time,\nepoch-wise output development and visualization, allowing researchers to\nmonitor the process of learning across each training round. Furthermore, SimQFL\noffers an intuitive and visually appealing interface that facilitates ease of\nuse and seamless execution. Users can customize key variables such as the\nnumber of epochs, learning rates, number of clients, and quantum\nhyperparameters such as qubits and quantum layers, making the simulator\nsuitable for various QFL applications. The system gives immediate feedback\nfollowing each epoch by showing intermediate outcomes and dynamically\nillustrating learning curves.

The end-to-end platform\norchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning\nLLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning\nworkflows using LLM Agents.

We challenge both fundamental\nassumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel\napproach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the\nconventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text\nspace, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation\nspace and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through\nselective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic\nintegration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive\nimage-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal\nbenchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves\nnotable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%,\nVizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing\nexpected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text\nassociations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%).

The spatial power spectra of the horizontal-flow divergence reveal\nwell-defined characteristic scales of solar supergranulation in the upper 4 Mm\nlayer, while the giant-cell scale is prominent below levels of d ~ 8 Mm. We\nfind that the characteristic scales of supergranulation remain stable while the\ngiant scales increase during the periods of the 11-year activity cycle maxima.\nThe power of the giant-cell scales increases with the enhancement of solar\nactivity. This may be due to large-scale flows around active regions and,\npresumably, solar-cycle variations of the convection-zone stratification.",

    "abstract": "The $NK$ model, introduced by Kauffman, Levin, and Weinberger, is a random\nfield used to describe the fitness landscape of certain species with $N$\ngenetic loci, each interacting with $K$ others. The model has wide applications\nin understanding evolutionary and natural selection as it captures ruggedness\nfeature of the fitness landscape. Earlier literature has been focused on the\ncase $K$ being a fixed positive integer and used tools from Ergodic and Markov\ntheory. In this paper, by viewing it as a statistical physics object, we\ninvestigate the $NK$ model in the regime $K/N\\to\\alpha \\in(0,1]$ via the spin\nglass methodologies. Our main result identifies the exact limits for the free\nenergy at any temperature and the maximum fitness. Moreover, we show that the\n$NK$ model exhibits a multiple-peak structure, namely, the number of\nnear-fittest genomes that are asymptotically orthogonal to each other is\nexponentially large. Based on establishing the overlap gap properties, we\nobtain quantitative descriptions for the geometry of the fitness landscape and\ndeduce that, in particular, near-fittest evolutionary paths become impossible\nas the fitness levels of the genomes approach the global maximum for any\n$\\alpha\\in (0,1]$. Nevertheless, we also show that by choosing $\\alpha$\nsufficiently small, an evolutionary path maintained at a given fitness level\ncan be constructed with high probability.",

Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT)\nand existing preference optimization methods like RLHF and DPO frequently\nstruggle to efficiently leverage the model's own generation space to identify\nhighly informative \"hard negative\" samples. To address these challenges, we\npropose Multimodal-Model-Guided Preference Optimization (M3PO), a novel and\ndata-efficient method designed to enhance LVLMs' capabilities in visual\ninstruction following. M3PO intelligently selects the most \"learning-valuable\"\npreference sample pairs from a diverse pool of LVLM-generated candidates. This\nselection is driven by a sophisticated mechanism that integrates two crucial\nsignals: a Multimodal Alignment Score (MAS) to assess external quality and the\nmodel's Self-Consistency / Confidence (log-probability) to gauge internal\nbelief. These are combined into a novel M3P-Score, which specifically\nidentifies preferred responses and challenging dispreferred responses that the\nmodel might confidently generate despite being incorrect. These high-quality\npreference pairs are then used for efficient Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) fine-tuning on base LVLMs like LLaVA-1.5 (7B/13B) using LoRA. Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate that M3PO consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines, including SFT, simulated RLHF, vanilla DPO, and RM-DPO, across a\ncomprehensive suite of multimodal instruction following benchmarks (MME-Bench,\nPOPE, IFT, Human Pref.

Accurate\nreal-time trajectory forecasting and coordinated mitigation are vital for\nminimizing the impact of these disasters.

This study evaluates the economic viability of sugarcane\nbagasse-based biochar in Brazil, focusing on its potential to enhance\nagricultural productivity and contribute to environmental sustainability. While\nexisting literature predominantly explores the production, crop yield benefits,\nand carbon sequestration capabilities of biochar, there is a notable gap in\ncomprehensive economic modeling and viability analysis for the region. This\npaper aims to fill this gap by employing a scenario-based economic modeling\napproach, incorporating relevant economic models. Findings include that biochar\nimplementation can be economically viable for medium and large sugarcane farms\n(20000-50000 hectares) given the availability of funding, breaking even in\nabout 7.5 years with an internal rate of return of 18% on average.

While the economic models are\nwell-grounded in existing literature, the production of biochar at the studied\nscales is not yet widespread, especially in Brazil and uncertainties can\nresult.

    "abstract": "This article presents an adaptive mean shift algorithm designed for datasets\nwith varying local scale and cluster cardinality. Local distance distributions,\nfrom a point to all others, are used to estimate the cardinality of the local\ncluster by identifying a local minimum in the density of the distance\ndistribution. Based on these cardinality estimates, local cluster parameters\nare then computed for the entire cluster in contrast to KDE-based methods,\nwhich provide insight only into localized regions of the cluster. During the\nmean shift execution, the cluster cardinality estimate is used to adaptively\nadjust the bandwidth and the mean shift kernel radius threshold. Our algorithm\noutperformed a recently proposed adaptive mean shift method on its original\ndataset and demonstrated competitive performance on a broader clustering\nbenchmark.",

As these capabilities advance, the range of applicable domains continues\nto expand significantly. However, identifying the precise mechanisms or\ninternal structures within LLMs that allow successful ICL across diverse,\ndistinct classes of tasks remains elusive. Physics-based tasks offer a\npromising testbed for probing this challenge. Unlike synthetic sequences such\nas basic arithmetic or symbolic equations, physical systems provide\nexperimentally controllable, real-world data based on structured dynamics\ngrounded in fundamental principles. This makes them particularly suitable for\nstudying the emergent reasoning behaviors of LLMs in a realistic yet tractable\nsetting. Here, we mechanistically investigate the ICL ability of LLMs,\nespecially focusing on their ability to reason about physics. Using a dynamics\nforecasting task in physical systems as a proxy, we evaluate whether LLMs can\nlearn physics in context. We first show that the performance of dynamics\nforecasting in context improves with longer input contexts. To uncover how such\ncapability emerges in LLMs, we analyze the model's residual stream activations\nusing sparse autoencoders (SAEs). Our experiments reveal that the features\ncaptured by SAEs correlate with key physical variables, such as energy. These\nfindings demonstrate that meaningful physical concepts are encoded within LLMs\nduring in-context learning. In sum, our work provides a novel case study that\nbroadens our understanding of how LLMs learn in context.",

However, existing approaches often struggle to\ncapture fine-grained local deformations and large-scale global deformations\nsimultaneously within a unified framework. We present FractMorph, a novel 3D\ndual-parallel transformer-based architecture that enhances cross-image feature\nmatching through multi-domain fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) branches.\nEach Fractional Cross-Attention (FCA) block applies parallel FrFTs at\nfractional angles of $0^\\circ$, $45^\\circ$, $90^\\circ$, along with a\nlog-magnitude branch, to effectively extract local, semi-global, and global\nfeatures at the same time. These features are fused via cross-attention between\nthe fixed and moving image streams. A lightweight U-Net style network then\npredicts a dense deformation field from the transformer-enriched features. On\nthe intra-patient ACDC cardiac MRI dataset, FractMorph achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with an overall Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)\nof $86.45\\%$, an average per-structure DSC of $75.15\\%$, and a 95th-percentile\nHausdorff distance (HD95) of $1.54~\\mathrm{mm}$ on our data split.\nFractMorph-Light, a lightweight variant of our model with only 29.6M\nparameters, preserves high accuracy while halving model complexity.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our approach with solid\nperformance on a cerebral atlas-to-patient dataset. Our results demonstrate\nthat multi-domain spectral-spatial attention in transformers can robustly and\nefficiently model complex non-rigid deformations in medical images using a\nsingle end-to-end network, without the need for scenario-specific tuning or\nhierarchical multi-scale networks.

Gradient-boosted decision tree models (XGBoost, CatBoost,\nLightGBM) trained on these features achieve nearly 10% mean absolute percentage\nerror across groups, demonstrating robust scalability beyond part-specific\nheuristics. By coupling cost prediction with explainability tools such as SHAP,\nthe framework identifies geometric design drivers including rotated dimension\nmaxima, arc statistics and divergence metrics, offering actionable insights for\ncost-aware design.

The DFB laser head employs a built-in\nisolator with a linewidth of approximately 1 MHz.

This is\nespecially true for large carnivore populations for which management decisions\nare often based on population size estimates. In France, gray wolves (Canis\nlupus) have been monitored for more than two decades using non-invasive genetic\nsampling and capture-recapture models. Population size estimates directly\ninform the annual number of wolves that can be killed legally. It is therefore\nkey to use appropriate methods to obtain robust population size estimates. To\ntrack the recent numerical and geographical expansion of the population, a\nsubstantial increase in sample collection was performed during the winter\n2023/24 within the entire wolf distribution range in France. A total of 1964\nsamples were genotyped and assigned to 576 different individuals using\nmicrosatellites genetic markers. During the winter 2023/24, spatial\ncapture-recapture models estimated the wolf population size in France to be\nlikely between 920 and 1125 individuals (95% credible interval). Detection\nprobability varied spatially and was positively influenced by snow cover and\naccessibility. Wolf density was strongly associated with historical presence,\nreflecting the ongoing recolonization process from the Alps.

One challenge\nis the real-time characterization of false data injections, which can mask\nsensor signals and potentially disrupt reactor control systems. While\nsignificant progress has been made in anomaly detection within reactor systems,\npotential false data injections have been shown to bypass conventional linear\ntime-invariant state estimators and failure detectors based on statistical\nthresholds. The dynamic, nonlinear, multi-variate nature of sensor signals,\ncombined with inherent noise and limited availability of real-world training\ndata, makes the characterization of such threats and more importantly their\ndifferentiation from anticipated process anomalies particularly challenging. In\nthis paper, we present an eXplainable AI (XAI) framework for identifying\nnon-stationary concurrent replay attacks in nuclear reactor signals with\nminimal training data. The proposed framework leverages progress on recurrent\nneural networks and residual analysis coupled with a modified SHAP algorithm\nand rule-based correlations. The recurrent neural networks are trained only on\nnormal operational data while for residual analysis we introduce an adaptive\nwindowing technique to improve detection accuracy. We successfully benchmarked\nthis framework on a real-world dataset from Purdue's nuclear reactor (PUR-1).\nWe were able to detect false data injections with accuracy higher than 0.93 and\nless than 0.01 false positives, differentiate from expected process anomalies,\nand to identify the origin of the falsified signals.",

    "abstract": "Copatterns give functional programs a flexible mechanism for responding to\ntheir context, and composition can greatly enhance their expressiveness.\nHowever, that same expressive power makes it harder to precisely specify the\nbehavior of programs. Using Danvy's functional and syntactic correspondence\nbetween different semantic artifacts, we derive a full suite of semantics for\ncopatterns, twice. First, a calculus of monolithic copatterns is taken on a\njourney from small-step operational semantics to abstract machine to\ncontinuation-passing style. Then within continuation-passing style, we refactor\nthe semantics to derive a more general calculus of compositional copatterns,\nand take the return journey back to derive the other semantic artifacts in\nreverse order.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Attributing cyberattacks remains a central challenge in modern cybersecurity,\nparticularly within denied environments where defenders have limited visibility\ninto attacker infrastructure and are restricted by legal or operational rules\nof engagement. This perspective examines the strategic value of passive\nhack-back techniques that enable covert attribution and intelligence collection\nwithout initiating direct offensive actions. Key vectors include tracking\nbeacons, honeytokens, environment-specific payloads, and supply-chain-based\ntraps embedded within exfiltrated or leaked assets. These approaches rely on\nthe assumption that attackers will interact with compromised data in traceable\nways, allowing defenders to gather signals without violating engagement\npolicies. The paper also explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in\nenhancing passive hack-back operations. Topics include the deployment of\nautonomous agents for forensic reconnaissance, the use of Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to generate dynamic payloads, and Adversarial Machine Learning (AML)\ntechniques for evasion and counter-deception. A dedicated section discusses the\nimplications of quantum technologies in this context, both as future threats to\ncryptographic telemetry and as potential tools for stealthy communication and\npost-quantum resilience. Finally, the paper advocates for hybrid defensive\nframeworks that combine passive attribution with delayed or conditional active\nresponses, while maintaining compliance with legal, ethical, and operational\nconstraints.",

Our theoretical analysis\nshows that the FS bound is intrinsically incompatible with the GSL in\ncontracting $(2+1)$-dimensional universes, regardless of spatial curvature or\nexotic matter content, and that this incompatibility persists even when quantum\ncorrections are considered. In contrast, the HE bound is consistent with the\nGSL in expanding universes under classical conditions and can also be\nreconciled in certain contracting scenarios when quantum effects are included.\nTo complement the theoretical study, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) analysis using recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), Cosmic\nChronometer (CC), and Hubble parameter datasets to constrain the model\nparameters. The best-fit results reveal good cross-dataset consistency, with\nthe cosmological constant parameter $\\psi$ remaining stable across all probes.\nThese findings identify the HE bound as a more robust candidate for holographic\nconstraints in lower-dimensional cosmology, while demonstrating the limitations\nof the FS bound.

Furthermore,\nwe establish that in this modified quasispecies model, defined on a single-peak\nfitness landscape, in the presence of backward mutation and periodic\nfluctuations in replication rates and in replication probabilities, the\nconcentration of the $i$th replicating species exhibits a periodic behavior in\ntime independent of the magnitude of the time delays.

Moreover, under the presence of time delays and non-constant periodic\nfluctuations in replication rates, we show that if the probability that a\nmutated replicator of type $j$ produces an offspring of type $i$ remains\nconstant across all replicators, then the unique positive periodic solution is\nnecessarily a constant solution.",

Deep\nReinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving\nthis task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample\ninefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL\nfor multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the\nenvironment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable\nenvironment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots\nmust visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths.\nThe task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe\nthe multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to\nfinding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the\nenvironment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient\nbased RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world\napplicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with\nuncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness\nby running inference on the learned models.

As artificial\nvision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask:\ndoes AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions? This article\nexplores how AI responds to classic visual illusions that involve color, size,\nshape, and motion. We find that some illusion-like effects can emerge in these\nmodels, either through targeted training or as by-products of pattern\nrecognition. In contrast, we also identify illusions unique to AI, such as\npixel-level sensitivity and hallucinations, that lack human counterparts. By\nsystematically comparing human and AI responses to visual illusions, we uncover\nalignment gaps and AI-specific perceptual vulnerabilities invisible to human\nperception.

Most existing MAS\nobservability frameworks focus on analyzing each individual agent separately,\noverlooking failures associated with the entire MAS.

These logs serve as input to\nthe anomaly detection layer, which detects anomalies across the MAS workflow in\nreal time. Then, the anomaly explanation layer performs classification and root\ncause analysis (RCA) of the detected anomalies. LumiMAS was evaluated on seven\ndifferent MAS applications, implemented using two popular MAS platforms, and a\ndiverse set of possible failures.

There is certain work aiming to optimize the\nmemory footprint of KV cache, inspired by the observation that attention heads\ncan be categorized into retrieval heads that are of great significance and\nstreaming heads that are of less significance. Typically, identifying the\nstreaming heads and and waiving the KV cache in the streaming heads would\nlargely reduce the overhead without hurting the performance that much.

By using\nthe Wasserstein ambiguity set, a prevalent data-driven tool in distributionally\nrobust optimization (DRO), we first propose a new security metric to deal with\nthe absence of disturbance distribution. This metric is designed by asymptotic\nreachability analysis of state deviations caused by stealthy FDI attacks and\ndisturbance in a distributionally robust confidence set.

Extensive experiments on challenging\nVisual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and\nScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms\nestablished baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant\naccuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual\nunderstanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and\ncompleteness of the generated answers. Ablation studies further highlight the\nimportance of diverse prompt templates and the number of generated\nperspectives. This work underscores the efficacy of leveraging LVLMs' inherent\ngenerative capabilities to enrich input contexts, thereby unlocking their\nlatent reasoning potential for complex multimodal tasks.",

In this paper, we present the first analysis of dLLMs'\nsafety performance and propose a novel safety alignment method tailored to\ntheir unique generation characteristics. Specifically, we identify a critical\nasymmetry between the defender and attacker in terms of security. For the\ndefender, we reveal that the middle tokens of the response, rather than the\ninitial ones, are more critical to the overall safety of dLLM outputs; this\nseems to suggest that aligning middle tokens can be more beneficial to the\ndefender. The attacker, on the contrary, may have limited power to manipulate\nmiddle tokens, as we find dLLMs have a strong tendency towards a sequential\ngeneration order in practice, forcing the attack to meet this distribution and\ndiverting it from influencing the critical middle tokens. Building on this\nasymmetry, we introduce Middle-tOken Safety Alignment (MOSA), a novel method\nthat directly aligns the model's middle generation with safe refusals\nexploiting reinforcement learning. We implement MOSA and compare its security\nperformance against eight attack methods on two benchmarks. We also test the\nutility of MOSA-aligned dLLM on coding, math, and general reasoning.

When the inversion symmetry is further broken by the\nantiferromagnetic order, the emerging odd-parity multipole order renders the\nbands spin-degenerate but asymmetric in the momentum space. For such\nparity-time-symmetric antiferromagnets, it has been predicted that electronic\nnematicity is induced by current, allowing unconventional nonlinear transport\nphenomena.

This\nlimitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal\ndeficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To\naddress this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models'\nunderstanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core\nstages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement,\nwhere an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic\nunits and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and\nAdaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or\noptimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments\non the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and\nsubstantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all\nevaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like \"Text\" and\n\"Composition\". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators\n(Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with\nInfinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline\nInfinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each\nDeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting.

To address these limitations, we introduce MedKGent, a\nLLM agent framework for constructing temporally evolving medical KGs.\nLeveraging over 10 million PubMed abstracts published between 1975 and 2023, we\nsimulate the emergence of biomedical knowledge via a fine-grained daily time\nseries.

The Extractor\nAgent identifies knowledge triples and assigns confidence scores via\nsampling-based estimation, which are used to filter low-confidence extractions\nand inform downstream processing. The Constructor Agent incrementally\nintegrates the retained triples into a temporally evolving graph, guided by\nconfidence scores and timestamps to reinforce recurring knowledge and resolve\nconflicts. The resulting KG contains 156,275 entities and 2,971,384 relational\ntriples. Quality assessments by two SOTA LLMs and three domain experts\ndemonstrate an accuracy approaching 90%, with strong inter-rater agreement. To\nevaluate downstream utility, we conduct RAG across seven medical question\nanswering benchmarks using five leading LLMs, consistently observing\nsignificant improvements over non-augmented baselines.

Existing efforts have improved SLM performance,\nbut typically at the cost of one or more of three key aspects: (1) reasoning\ncapability, due to biased supervision that filters out negative reasoning paths\nand limits learning from errors; (2) autonomy, due to over-reliance on\nexternally generated reasoning signals; and (3) generalization, which suffers\nwhen models overfit to teacher-specific patterns. In this paper, we introduce\nReaLM, a reinforcement learning framework for robust and self-sufficient\nreasoning in vertical domains. To enhance reasoning capability, we propose\nMulti-Route Process Verification (MRPV), which contrasts both positive and\nnegative reasoning paths to extract decisive patterns. To reduce reliance on\nexternal guidance and improve autonomy, we introduce Enabling Autonomy via\nAsymptotic Induction (EAAI), a training strategy that gradually fades external\nsignals. To improve generalization, we apply guided chain-of-thought\ndistillation to encode domain-specific rules and expert knowledge into SLM\nparameters, making them part of what the model has learned. Extensive\nexperiments on both vertical and general reasoning tasks demonstrate that ReaLM\nsignificantly improves SLM performance across aspects (1)-(3) above.",

The findings indicate that structured and proactive system\nguidance helps novices engage more effectively in architectural design,\nespecially when addressing tasks where knowledge and experience gaps are most\ncritical.

In addition,\nparticipants reported that the ability to simulate and compare multiple\narchitecture options enabled them to deepen their understanding of cloud design\nprinciples and trade-offs, demonstrating the educational value of system-driven\nsupport.

    "abstract": "The stochastic self-propagating star-formation (SSPSF) model is an important\ntheoretical framework for explaining how localised star-formation events\ntrigger subsequent activity across galactic discs. While widely used to\ninterpret spiral and irregular structures, its probabilistic rules have lacked\na formal statistical foundation. In this work, we establish a connection\nbetween the SSPSF model and spatio-temporal point processes (STPP), which\ndescribe events in space and time through history-dependent intensities. We\nshow that the SSPSF update law is equivalent to a separable spatio-temporal\nHawkes process, and we derive a simple likelihood function that recovers SSPSF\nparameters from historical star-formation event data under simplifying\nassumptions. Beyond the statistical formulation, the framework provides a new\napproach to analysing the propagation of star formation in galaxies, enabling\nobservational surveys of star-forming regions to be interpreted within the STPP\nframework. Furthermore, the approach naturally extends to continuous-time\nmodels, offering a more realistic representation of galactic dynamics.",

Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is a\nmainstream candidate ISAC waveform. However, there are inter-symbol\ninterference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) when the round-trip\ndelay exceeds the cyclic prefix (CP) duration for OFDM signals, which limits\nthe maximum sensing range of ISAC system. When detecting a long-range target,\nthe wide beam inevitably covers the close-range target, of which the echo's\npower is much larger than that of the long-range target. In order to tackle the\nabove problem, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and least squares\n(LS)-based spatial signal separation method is proposed to separate the echo\nsignals reflected from different targets. Moreover, a coherent\ncompensation-based sensing signal processing method at the receiver is proposed\nto enhance the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of the OFDM\nblock for generating the range-Doppler map (RDM) with higher SINR. Simulation\nresults reveal that the proposed method greatly enhances the SINR of RDM by 10\ndB for a target at 500 m compared with two-dimensional fast Fourier transform\n(2D-FFT) method.

It brings in\nexpression displacement from the reference image emotion to the audio emotion\nand stores it in the memory.Given a cross-emotion feature as a query, the\nmatching displacement can be retrieved at inference time.

For a symmetric dimer of resonators, these\nsmall-amplitude nonlinear resonant states exhibit either symmetric or\nantisymmetric profiles.

Motivated by the recent\ninvestigation of non-Hermitian $s$-wave superfluidity, we study the\nnon-Hermitian chiral $p+ip$ superfluid (SF) with a complex-valued interaction,\noriginating from inelastic scattering between fermions. We reformulate the\nnon-Hermitian mean-field theory for chiral SFs and derive the gap equation in\nthe path integral approach. By numerically solving the gap equation, we obtain\nthe phase diagram of the non-Hermitian $p+ip$ SF, characterized by the\nreentrant SF transition and dissipation-induced SF phase, as a result of the\nevolution of the exceptional lines. The method can be extended to higher\npartial-wave chiral SFs, such as $d+id$ and $f+if$-wave SFs. We further\nconsider such a chiral $p+ip$ SF on a square lattice, to investigate the\ninfluence of dissipation on topology. We find that the non-Hermitian skin\neffect is absent in the specific cylinder geometry, in which the topology\nassociated with the edge modes and Chern number is robust to dissipation.\nBesides, we find that the energies at the robust point nodes and line nodes are\npure real.

Previous research has given little attention to how\nthe specific characteristics of these datasets might influence the results of\nthe Diffusion Map and what conditions must be met for the Diffusion Map to\nyield meaningful and interpretable results. Moreover, there is a lack of clear,\ncomprehensive explanations of the fundamental principles, which has led to\nmisunderstandings in the literature.\n  This work first addresses the fundamental principles of the Diffusion Map and\ncompares them with other spectral methods. It investigates the impact of the\nDiffusion Map parameters as well as the structure of the underlying data on the\nresults. The V-Dem democracy dataset, British census data, and data on German\nurban and rural districts are then analyzed, considering their possible natural\nparameters. A focus is placed on the benefits of the Diffusion Map in\ncomparison to the established linear principal component analysis (PCA). The\nanalysis shows that the time parameter t of the Diffusion Map framework has no\nsignificant influence on the analysis. In contrast, discrete and redundant\nvariables, as well as the scaling and normalization of the data, have a\nsubstantial impact. Unlike PCA, the Diffusion Map eigenspectrum does not\nprovide a clear indication of which components are important. Therefore,\ntypical polynomial patterns related to one-dimensional datasets within the\nDiffusion Map framework are explored.\n  The thesis presents insights suggesting that several underconsidered effects\nneed further examination, and emphasizes the need for a framework to accurately\nanalyze complex datasets using the Diffusion Map.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools in software\ndevelopment, widely used for requirements engineering, code generation and\nreview tasks. Software engineers often rely on LLMs to assess whether system\ncode implementation satisfy task requirements, thereby enhancing code\nrobustness and accuracy. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs can reliably\ndetermine whether the code complies fully with the given task descriptions,\nwhich is usually natural language specifications. In this paper, we uncover a\nsystematic failure of LLMs in evaluating whether code aligns with natural\nlanguage requirements. Specifically, with widely used benchmarks, we employ\nunified prompts to judge code correctness. Our results reveal that LLMs\nfrequently misclassify correct code implementations as either ``not satisfying\nrequirements'' or containing potential defects. Surprisingly, more complex\nprompting, especially when leveraging prompt engineering techniques involving\nexplanations and proposed corrections, leads to higher misjudgment rate, which\nhighlights the critical reliability issues in using LLMs as code review\nassistants. We further analyze the root causes of these misjudgments, and\npropose two improved prompting strategies for mitigation. For the first time,\nour findings reveals unrecognized limitations in LLMs to match code with\nrequirements.

Initially, the wind generation cost, arising from discrepancies\nbetween scheduled and actual wind power outputs, is meticulously modeled using\na Gaussian mixture model based on historical wind power data. This modelled\nwind generation cost is subsequently incorporated into the objective function\nof the conventional OPF problem.

In this regard, a SOCR, combined\nwith a second-order Taylor series expansion, is employed to facilitate the\nconvex approximation of the AC power flow equations.

Existing research has mostly\nfocused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how\nto interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of\ncapturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and\nthe target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is\ncrucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic\nmotion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction\nlocalization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references,\nbut suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although\ncurrent temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting\nverb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training\nand exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation\nmoments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed\nEgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric\nvideos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate\nhigh-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify\ncontact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide\nclosed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for\nobject masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot\nimplementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel\nbenchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric\nvideos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream\napplications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks.

    "abstract": "The Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative to CNNs and\nTransformers for image deblurring. However, its flatten-and-scan strategy often\nresults in local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy, limiting its ability\nto effectively aggregate 2D spatial information. Although existing methods\nmitigate this by modifying the scan strategy or incorporating local feature\nmodules, it increase computational complexity and hinder real-time performance.\nIn this paper, we propose a structure-aware image deblurring network without\nchanging the original Mamba architecture. Specifically, we design a memory\nbuffer mechanism to preserve historical information for later fusion, enabling\nreliable modeling of relevance between adjacent features. Additionally, we\nintroduce an Ising-inspired regularization loss that simulates the energy\nminimization of the physical system's \"mutual attraction\" between pixels,\nhelping to maintain image structure and coherence. Building on this, we develop\nMBMamba. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches on widely used benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "As technology scales, nano-scale digital circuits face heightened\nsusceptibility to single event upsets (SEUs) and transients (SETs) due to\nshrinking feature sizes and reduced operating voltages. While logical,\nelectrical, and timing masking effects influence soft error probability (SEP),\nthe combined impact of process variation (PV) and aging-induced degradation\nfurther complicates SEP estimation. Existing approaches often address PV or\naging in isolation, or rely on computationally intensive methods like Monte\nCarlo simulations, limiting their practicality for large-scale circuit\noptimization. This paper introduces a novel framework for SEP analysis that\nholistically integrates PV and aging effects. We propose an enhanced electrical\nmasking model and a statistical methodology to quantify soft error probability\nunder process and aging variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed approach achieves high accuracy while reducing computational overhead\nby approximately 2.5% compared to Monte Carlo-based methods.

This is an\noperator series method primarily designed for low grazing incidence and found\nin many cases to converge rapidly, often within one or two terms even for large\nincident angles. However, convergence is not guaranteed and semi-convergence\nmay be observed.\n  Our aims are two-fold: (1) To obtain theoretical and physical insight into\nthe regimes in which rapid convergence occurs and the mechanisms by which it\nfails, by examining and modifying eigenvalues of the operator; (2) provide a\nstrategy for increasing the speed of convergence or more crucially for\novercoming divergence, and providing a stopping criterion. The first is\naddressed by subtracting successive dominant eigenvectors from the incident\nfield, to examine the impact on divergence and on the incident spectrum. For\nthe second, we apply a generalisation of Shanks' transformation to the operator\nseries; this effectively improves convergence and (unlike eigenvalue\nsubtraction) readily generalises to 3D and composite problems. These results\nalso explain why the method converges so rapidly for much larger incident\nangles. Finally we ask and give an analytical solution to a key question: For a\ndivergent eigenvector of the iterating operator, what is the exact solution and\ncan it be deduced from the divergent series? We show that the exact solution is\nwell-behaved and can be found from the series in a way which is related to the\nShanks transformation.",

While\nexisting self-feedback methods aim to address this problem, they are\nconstrained by the capabilities of a single model, which can lead to\noverconfidence in incorrect answers, reward hacking, and even training\ncollapse. To this end, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Coevolutionary\nCollective Feedback (RLCCF), a novel RL framework that enables multi-model\ncollaborative evolution without external supervision.

Moreover, each model's vote is\nweighted by its Self-Consistency (SC) score, ensuring that more confident\nmodels contribute more to the collective decision. Benefiting from the diverse\noutput distributions and complementary abilities of multiple LLMs, RLCCF\nenables the model collective to continuously enhance its reasoning ability\nthrough coevolution. Experiments on four mainstream open-source LLMs across\nfour mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our framework yields\nsignificant performance gains, achieving an average relative improvement of\n16.72\\% in accuracy.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for collision avoidance in optimal and\nmodel predictive control, in which the environment is represented by a large\nnumber of points and the robot as a union of padded polygons. The conditions\nthat none of the points shall collide with the robot can be written in terms of\nan infinite number of constraints per obstacle point. We show that the\nresulting semi-infinite programming (SIP) optimal control problem (OCP) can be\nefficiently tackled through a combination of two methods: local reduction and\nan external active-set method. Specifically, this involves iteratively\nidentifying the closest point obstacles, determining the lower-level distance\nminimizer among all feasible robot shape parameters, and solving the\nupper-level finitely-constrained subproblems.\n  In addition, this paper addresses robust collision avoidance in the presence\nof ellipsoidal state uncertainties. Enforcing constraint satisfaction over all\npossible uncertainty realizations extends the dimension of constraint\ninfiniteness. The infinitely many constraints arising from translational\nuncertainty are handled by local reduction together with the robot shape\nparameterization, while rotational uncertainty is addressed via a backoff\nreformulation.\n  A controller implemented based on the proposed method is demonstrated on a\nreal-world robot running at 20Hz, enabling fast and collision-free navigation\nin tight spaces. An application to 3D collision avoidance is also demonstrated\nin simulation.",

This is critical for several aspects of CA, such as quality\ncontrol (e.g., monitoring variations over time), course comparisons (e.g.,\narticulation), and course recommendation (e.g., advising). Measuring course\ndifficulty requires careful consideration of multiple factors: First, when\ndifficulty measures are sensitive to the performance level of enrolled\nstudents, it can bias interpretations by overlooking student diversity. By\nassessing difficulty independently of enrolled students' performances, we can\nreduce the risk of bias and enable fair, representative assessments of\ndifficulty. Second, from a measurement theoretic perspective, the measurement\nmust be reliable and valid to provide a robust basis for subsequent analyses.\nThird, difficulty measures should account for covariates, such as the\ncharacteristics of individual students within a diverse populations (e.g.,\ntransfer status). In recent years, various notions of difficulty have been\nproposed. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and comparison of\nexisting approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point\naverages and latent trait modeling. It further offers a hands-on tutorial on\nmodel selection, assumption checking, and practical CA applications.

    "abstract": "Wireless jamming identification, which detects and classifies electromagnetic\njamming from non-cooperative devices, is crucial for emerging low-altitude\nwireless networks consisting of many drone terminals that are highly\nsusceptible to electromagnetic jamming. However, jamming identification schemes\nadopting deep learning (DL) are vulnerable to attacks involving carefully\ncrafted adversarial samples, resulting in inevitable robustness degradation. To\naddress this issue, we propose a differential transformer framework for\nwireless jamming identification. Firstly, we introduce a differential\ntransformer network in order to distinguish jamming signals, which overcomes\nthe attention noise when compared with its traditional counterpart by\nperforming self-attention operations in a differential manner. Secondly, we\npropose a randomized masking training strategy to improve network robustness,\nwhich leverages the patch partitioning mechanism inherent to transformer\narchitectures in order to create parallel feature extraction branches. Each\nbranch operates on a distinct, randomly masked subset of patches, which\nfundamentally constrains the propagation of adversarial perturbations across\nthe network. Additionally, the ensemble effect generated by fusing predictions\nfrom these diverse branches demonstrates superior resilience against\nadversarial attacks. Finally, we introduce a novel consistent training\nframework that significantly enhances adversarial robustness through dualbranch\nregularization. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed methodology is\nsuperior to existing methods in boosting robustness to adversarial samples.",

In this work, we propose an optical detection system for\na spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometer based on the inverse weak\nmeasurement (IWM) framework. By using the spatial pattern of a probe laser as\nthe measurement pointer, we successfully detect ultra-weak magnetic fields. In\nour model, the spatial pattern of the probe laser is weakly coupled to its\npolarization, which is sensitive to external magnetic fields. Through\npost-selection on the optical polarization, the ultra-small magnetic field is\nsignificantly amplified with the amplification factor inversely proportional to\nthe coupling strength, as reflected in the measured displacement of the final\nspatial pattern. By analysing the response curve of the probe laser\ndisplacement to the magnetic field, we identify the point of maximum\nsensitivity, achieving a magnetic field sensitivity of 182.8 fT/Hz1/2.\nFurthermore, in the IWM scheme, the detected signals depend only on the\ninternal degrees of freedom of the probe laser, making the system robust\nagainst the fluctuations in laser power. To demonstrate this advantage, we\ncompute the Allan standard deviation of the output signals for both\nconventional and IWM detection methods. The results indicate that the IWM-based\nmethod improves stability of detection by one to two orders of magnitude.

    "abstract": "Transmitting structured light robustly through complex random media is\ncrucial in many applications, from sensing to communication. Unfortunately, the\nspatial structure of light is distorted in such media due to refractive index\ninhomogeneities that cause multiple scattering, requiring mitigating strategies\nsuch as iterative optimisation and adaptive optics. Here, we use topological\nlight to see through random media without the need for any corrective measures.\nUsing skyrmions as our optical topology, we first demonstrate their robustness\nto randomness using controlled digital random phase masks before showing the\nuniversality of the approach with physical samples, from biological tissue to\nhighly scattering materials. We benchmark the invariance of the topology\nagainst orbital angular momentum (OAM) and show no modal crosstalk using\ntopology in channels where orbital angular momentum exhibits crosstalk greater\nthan 70%. With the control in hand, we transmit images encoded into an alphabet\nof 10 topological numbers and show information transfer with high fidelity in\nregimes where traditional degrees of freedom, such as OAM, fail. Our work\nrepresents an important step towards noise-free transmission through noisy\nchannels with the spatial structure of light without the need for active\ncompensation strategies, opening potential applications in imaging, sensing and\ncommunicating with topology.",

In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a\ncore component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test\ntwo ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for\ntraining data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two\nhidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based\ntraining points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.\nThe results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,\nrandom and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility.

This Essay reveals the fatal\nflaw: though AI poses national security challenges, the solution demands\nstronger regulatory frameworks, not weaker ones. A race without guardrails\nbreeds shared danger, not competitive strength. The Regulation Sacrifice makes\nthree false promises. First, it promises durable technological leads. But AI\ncapabilities spread rapidly - performance gaps between U.S. and Chinese systems\ncollapsed from 9 percent to 2 percent in thirteen months. When advantages\nevaporate in months, sacrificing permanent safety for temporary speed makes no\nsense. Second, it promises deregulation accelerates innovation. The opposite\noften proves true. Companies report well-designed governance streamlines\ndevelopment. Investment flows toward regulated markets. Clear rules reduce\nuncertainty; uncertain liability creates paralysis. Environmental standards did\nnot kill the auto industry; they created Tesla and BYD. Third, enhanced\nnational security through deregulation actually undermines security across all\ntimeframes.

Quantitative analyses show that all therapies\nsuppress tumor growth to varying degrees and reshape the tumor\nmicroenvironment.

In this paper, we\ntherefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with\nnoisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this\nend, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score\nfrom the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we\ndesign inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images\ninto a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to\nalleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping\nfunction in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image\nfeatures from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image\nfeatures for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization\nability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of\nlearnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin,\nSketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR\nconsistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\nmethods.",

In this study, we introduce a\nframework to derive the scaling laws for global kinetic dissipation by\nestablishing its linkage with potential energy conversion. This potential\nenergy-based dissipation relationship provides a rigorous theoretical\nfoundation for characterizing universal global kinetic dissipation scaling. The\nproposed universal scaling laws successfully reconcile previously divergent\nresults of classical Rayleigh-B\\'enard and horizontal convection. Leveraging\nthis framework, we can extend the Grossmann-Lohse (GL) theory to a unified\ndescription of thermal convective transport processes.

Remarkably, in horizontal convection with non-monotonic temperature\ndependence of density, our analysis reveals that a transition in the scaling\nlaws occurs when thermal plumes reach a characteristic height scaling as $\\sim\nH$. Through direct numerical simulations, we quantitatively verify these\nfindings.

Despite its importance, the current Intelligent\nJudicial Assistant System (IJAS) lacks dedicated methods for probation\nprediction, and research on the underlying factors influencing probation\neligibility remains limited. In addition, probation eligibility requires a\ncomprehensive analysis of both criminal circumstances and remorse. Much of the\nexisting research in IJAS relies primarily on data-driven methodologies, which\noften overlooks the legal logic underpinning judicial decision-making. To\naddress this gap, we propose a novel approach that integrates legal logic into\ndeep learning models for probation prediction, implemented in three distinct\nstages. First, we construct a specialized probation dataset that includes fact\ndescriptions and probation legal elements (PLEs). Second, we design a distinct\nprobation prediction model named the Multi-Task Dual-Theory Probation\nPrediction Model (MT-DT), which is grounded in the legal logic of probation and\nthe \\textit{Dual-Track Theory of Punishment}. Finally, our experiments on the\nprobation dataset demonstrate that the MT-DT model outperforms baseline models,\nand an analysis of the underlying legal logic further validates the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Noting that\nonly the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\\star}\\ge\n10^{10.5}\\,h^{-1}\\,M_{\\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular\nalignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\\star}$-controlled samples\naccording to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or\nbluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found\nthat the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases\nthat the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower\nsSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the\nanalytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of\na linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local\ntidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due\nto the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial\ninfall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant\nvoid-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of\ncosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also\ndiscuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface\ngalaxies as a probe of dark energy.",

This limitation severely\nimpedes progress in Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD), where anomalies are\ninherently rare, costly to label, and may actively camouflage their patterns to\nevade detection. To address these problems, we propose Context Refactoring\nContrast (CRoC), a simple yet effective framework that trains GNNs for GAD by\njointly leveraging limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. Different from\nprevious works, CRoC exploits the class imbalance inherent in GAD to refactor\nthe context of each node, which builds augmented graphs by recomposing the\nattributes of nodes while preserving their interaction patterns. Furthermore,\nCRoC encodes heterogeneous relations separately and integrates them into the\nmessage-passing process, enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex\ninteraction semantics. These operations preserve node semantics while\nencouraging robustness to adversarial camouflage, enabling GNNs to uncover\nintricate anomalous cases. In the training stage, CRoC is further integrated\nwith the contrastive learning paradigm. This allows GNNs to effectively harness\nunlabeled data during joint training, producing richer, more discriminative\nnode embeddings. CRoC is evaluated on seven real-world GAD datasets with\nvarying scales.

By constructing the convexe-concave\ncharacteristics of the free energy density (convexity with respect to plasma\nnumber density and concavity with respect to temperature), the model\nself-consistently derives key thermodynamic quantities such as chemical\npotential, entropy density, and internal energy.

We rigorously prove that the proposed method satisfies the first\nlaw of thermodynamics (global energy conservation) and the second law\n(non-decreasing total entropy).

    "abstract": "Robot-assisted dressing is a popular but challenging topic in the field of\nrobotic manipulation, offering significant potential to improve the quality of\nlife for individuals with mobility limitations. Currently, the majority of\nresearch on robot-assisted dressing focuses on how to put on loose-fitting\nclothing, with little attention paid to tight garments. For the former, since\nthe armscye is larger, a single robotic arm can usually complete the dressing\ntask successfully. However, for the latter, dressing with a single robotic arm\noften fails due to the narrower armscye and the property of diminishing\nrigidity in the armscye, which eventually causes the armscye to get stuck. This\npaper proposes a bimanual dressing strategy suitable for dressing tight-fitting\nclothing. To facilitate the encoding of dressing trajectories that adapt to\ndifferent human arm postures, a spherical coordinate system for dressing is\nestablished. We uses the azimuthal angle of the spherical coordinate system as\na task-relevant feature for bimanual manipulation. Based on this new\ncoordinate, we employ Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture\nRegression (GMR) for imitation learning of bimanual dressing trajectories,\ngenerating dressing strategies that adapt to different human arm postures. The\neffectiveness of the proposed method is validated through various experiments.",

In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on\noperations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are\nincompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed\nSNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and\nhardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of\nbinary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic\nBlock (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual\nlearning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM)\nmodule introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication\nand highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation.\nComplementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further\nimproves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature\ninteraction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive\nexperiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak\nremoval, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution\ndemonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while\nsignificantly reducing computational overhead.

Applying\ncryptographic techniques, such as multi-party computation (MPC), to PEFT\nsettings still incurs substantial encrypted computation across both the\nbackbone and adapter, mainly due to the inherent two-way communication between\nthem.

To maintain strong model utility under this\nconstraint, we explore the design space of OWC-compatible adapters and employ\nan automated architecture search algorithm to optimize the trade-off between\nprivate inference efficiency and model utility. We evaluated CryptPEFT using\nVision Transformer backbones across widely used image classification datasets.\nOur results show that CryptPEFT significantly outperforms existing baselines,\ndelivering speedups ranging from $20.62\\times$ to $291.48\\times$ in simulated\nwide-area network (WAN) and local-area network (LAN) settings.

To address the lack of datasets, we\nintroduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset\nthat covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\\&P-Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal\npersonalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free\nevaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the\nregion-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL\nmodels with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental\nresults indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding\nperformance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications\nin multimodal RAG and personalized conversation.

    "abstract": "Photocatalytic CO2 reduction is limited by inefficient CO2 activation and\npoor solar spectrum utilization. Here, we discovered and revealed the vibration\ncoupling mechanism among photons, phonons, and molecules, which remarkably\nenhances photocatalytic catalysis of CO2 into fuels. We designed the\nnitrogen-doped Cu2O-based catalyst loaded onto the quartz optical substrate.\nThe N-doping Cu2O converts linearly geometry of adsorbed CO2 molecules, which\nefficiently lowers the activation barrier and facilitates CO2 dissociation.\nOnce the Cu-based catalyst is combined with a micro-pillar quartz film, the\nsystem induces vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between the asymmetric CO2\nstretching mode and surface phonon polariton resonances. These resonances arise\nfrom the photothermal conversion of incident solar photons on the\nmicro-pillars. The resonant coupling phenomena were further verified by\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using Synchrotron Radiation Source\n(SRS), which directly confirmed the interactions between molecular vibrations\nand photonic-phononic modes. The synergetic functions originated from this\nhybrid architecture achieve a CO yield of 167.7 umol h-1 g-1 under pure water\nconditions, which is the highest reported yield for Cu2O-based photocatalysts\nwith 46% enhancement over non-VSC systems. This work uncovers a novel\nphoto-thermal mechanism. It further provides a new strategy to control bond\nactivation in photocatalytic CO2 conversion through light-vibration-matter\ncoupling.",

    "abstract": "Low-rank tensor representation (LRTR) has emerged as a powerful tool for\nmulti-dimensional data processing. However, classical LRTR-based methods face\ntwo critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is\nlow-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with\nsignificant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete\nmeshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor\nRepresentation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling\nof multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our\napproach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation\nthat semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics\nthan holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This\ndesign not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances\nadaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel\nasymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific\nfactor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized\nheads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local\nadaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel\ncommonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation\nthat is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with\nadaptability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat SCTR achieves 3-5 dB PSNR improvements over existing LRTR-based methods\nacross multispectral images, videos, and color images.",

In\nthis work, we show that a partial transpose of a bipartite density operator is\na two-time pseudo-density operator, which by definition encodes temporal\ncorrelations associated with two-point sequential measurement scenarios. As\nsuch, it follows that partial transposition admits a precise physical\ninterpretation as mapping spatial correlations to temporal correlations, thus\nswapping the roles of space and time for bipartite quantum systems. For\nmaximally entangled qubits, we show that partial transposition maps spatial\ncorrelations which violate Bell inequalities to causal correlations which\ncannot be replicated by spacelike separated systems, thus further solidifying\nthe interpretation of partial transpose as a space-time swap. As it is known\nthat gravitational effects swap the roles of space and time inside a black\nhole, our results suggest that at a quantum mechanical level, a traversal of a\nblack hole's event horizon by a bipartite quantum system may be described by a\npartial transpose.",

Yet it remains unclear whether the benefits extend to\nspoken language understanding (SLU) tasks that require a deeper understanding\nthan widely studied ones, such as speech recognition. The limited exploration\nof SLU is primarily due to a lack of relevant datasets. To alleviate that, this\nthesis contributes tasks, specifically spoken named entity recognition (NER)\nand named entity localization (NEL), to the Spoken Language Understanding\nEvaluation benchmark. We develop SFM-based approaches for NER and NEL, and find\nthat end-to-end (E2E) models leveraging SFMs can surpass traditional cascaded\n(speech recognition followed by a text model) approaches. Further, we evaluate\nE2E SLU models across SFMs and adaptation strategies to assess the impact on\ntask performance.\n  Collectively, this thesis tackles previously unanswered questions about SFMs,\nproviding tools and datasets to further our understanding and to enable the\ncommunity to make informed design choices for future model development and\nadoption.",

To verify algorithm\ngeneralization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and\na real test set.

Different from the\nconventional age-based approaches, we jointly consider the information\nfreshness and the semantic importance, and then formulate a time-averaged AoIS\nminimization problem by jointly optimizing the semantic actuation indicator,\ntransceiver beamformer, and the semantic symbol design. We first transform the\noriginal problem into a low-complexity problem via the Lyapunov optimization.\nThen, we decompose the transformed problem into multiple subproblems and adopt\nthe alternative optimization (AO) method to solve each subproblem.\nSpecifically, we propose two efficient algorithms, i.e., the successive convex\napproximation (SCA) algorithm and the low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)\nalgorithm for optimizing transceiver beamformer. We adopt exhaustive search\nmethods to solve the semantic actuation policy indicator optimization problem\nand the transmitted semantic symbol design problem. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our scheme can preserve more than 50\\% of the original\ninformation under the same AoIS compared to the constrained baselines.",

The long-term spatio-temporal\ndependency learning brings two new challenges: 1) The long-term temporal\nsequence includes multiscale information naturally which is hard to extract\nefficiently; 2) The multiscale temporal information from different nodes is\nhighly correlated and hard to model. To address these challenges, we propose an\nefficient \\textit{\\textbf{S}patio-\\textbf{T}emporal \\textbf{M}ultiscale\n\\textbf{M}amba} (STM2) that includes a multiscale Mamba architecture to capture\nthe multiscale information efficiently and simultaneously, and an adaptive\ngraph causal convolution network to learn the complex multiscale\nspatio-temporal dependency. STM2 includes hierarchical information aggregation\nfor different-scale information that guarantees their distinguishability.

    "abstract": "LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the\nOrion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as\ncatalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region,\nwhich is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth\nanalysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne\nArray Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to\nobserve 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the\nC18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each\nof these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic\ntemperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute\nthe non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical\ninsights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of\nmass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess\nthe gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified\nclumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion\n(RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our\nresults suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within\nthe PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low\ninterstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps\nindependently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional\ncompression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of\nRDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the\ninstability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.",

Despite\nthe proposal of numerous HNN methods, there is no comprehensive benchmark for\nHNNs, which creates a great obstacle to understanding the progress of DHGL in\nseveral aspects: (i) insufficient coverage of datasets, algorithms, and tasks;\n(ii) a narrow evaluation of algorithm performance; and (iii) inconsistent\ndataset usage, preprocessing, and experimental setups that hinder\ncomparability.

In the first\naspect, CC-Time incorporates cross-modality learning to model temporal\ndependency and channel correlations in the language model from both time series\nsequences and their corresponding text descriptions. In the second aspect,\nCC-Time further proposes the cross-model fusion block to adaptively integrate\nknowledge from the PLMs and time series model to form a more comprehensive\nmodeling of time series patterns.

    "abstract": "Issue-to-commit link recovery plays an important role in software\ntraceability and improves project management. However, it remains a challenging\ntask. A study on GitHub shows that only 42.2% of the issues are correctly\nlinked to their commits. This highlights the potential for further development\nand research in this area. Existing studies have employed various AI/ML-based\napproaches, and with the recent development of large language models,\nresearchers have leveraged LLMs to tackle this problem. These approaches suffer\nfrom two main issues. First, LLMs are constrained by limited context windows\nand cannot ingest all of the available data sources, such as long commit\nhistories, extensive issue comments, and large code repositories. Second, most\nmethods operate on individual issue-commit pairs; that is, given a single\nissue-commit pair, they determine whether the commit resolves the issue. This\nquickly becomes impractical in real-world repositories containing tens of\nthousands of commits. To address these limitations, we present LinkAnchor, the\nfirst autonomous LLM-based agent designed for issue-to-commit link recovery.\nThe lazy-access architecture of LinkAnchor enables the underlying LLM to access\nthe rich context of software, spanning commits, issue comments, and code files,\nwithout exceeding the token limit by dynamically retrieving only the most\nrelevant contextual data. Additionally, LinkAnchor is able to automatically\npinpoint the target commit rather than exhaustively scoring every possible\ncandidate. Our evaluations show that LinkAnchor outperforms state-of-the-art\nissue-to-commit link recovery approaches by 60-262% in Hit@1 score across all\nour case study projects. We also publicly release LinkAnchor as a ready-to-use\ntool, along with our replication package. LinkAnchor is designed and tested for\nGitHub and Jira, and is easily extendable to other platforms.",

    "abstract": "Machine anomalous sound detection (ASD) is a valuable technique across\nvarious applications. However, its generalization performance is often limited\ndue to challenges in data collection and the complexity of acoustic\nenvironments. Inspired by the success of large pre-trained models in numerous\nfields, this paper introduces a robust ASD model that leverages self-supervised\npre-trained models trained on large-scale speech and audio datasets. Although\nthere are inconsistencies between the pre-training datasets and the ASD task,\nour findings indicate that pre-training still provides substantial benefits for\nASD. To mitigate overfitting and retain learned knowledge when fine-tuning with\nlimited data, we explore Fully-Connected Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as an\nalternative to full fine-tuning. Additionally, we propose a Machine-aware Group\nAdapter module, which enables the model to capture differences between various\nmachines within a unified framework, thereby enhancing the generalization\nperformance of ASD systems. To address the challenge of missing attribute\nlabels, we design a novel objective function that dynamically clusters\nunattributed data using vector quantization and optimizes through a dual-level\ncontrastive learning loss. The proposed methods are evaluated on all benchmark\ndatasets, including the DCASE 2020-2024 five ASD challenges, and the\nexperimental results show significant improvements of our new approach and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies.",

However, achieving optimal\nphase shift design in multi-user scenarios faces two major challenges: the\nhigh-dimensional optimization introduced by massive RIS elements, and the\npersistent coupling of multi-user signals caused by shared RIS reflections.\nThis paper utilize the visible region of an RIS arranged as the uniform\ncylindrical array (UCA) to reduce the complexity of phase shift design. Under\nthe UCA architecture, RIS elements are categorized into two types:\nuser-specific units and multi-user shared units. We then determine the optimal\nphase shifts by iteratively optimizing the phase shifts of multi-user shared\nunits while directly configuring those of user-specific units based on a\nderived closed-form solution.

In humans, conformity arises from informational\ninfluence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence\n(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by\nshifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear\nwhether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts\nthe information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively\ndisentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated\nnine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,\ninvestment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,\nrespectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the\nmodels' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently\nrising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is\ndramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,\nthis informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs\nsystematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty\ntriggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models\nadditionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight\npublic signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).",

Many active systems exhibit circular swimming, ubiquitous in chemical,\nphysical, and biological systems, that biases motion and reduces transport\nefficiency. We show that stochastic position-orientation resetting can overcome\nthese limitations in two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles by\ninterrupting circular motion, resulting in tunable dynamics. When resets are\ninfrequent compared to chiral rotation, the steady-state mean-squared\ndisplacement varies non-monotonically with rotational diffusion. Steady state\nexcess kurtosis and orientation autocorrelation yields spatiotemporal state\ndiagram comprising three states: an activity-dominated chiral state, and two\nresetting-dominated states with and without chirality; in contrast, the achiral\ncounterpart supports only the resetting-dominated state. Chirality thus\nenriches the dynamical landscape, enabling tunable transitions between\ntransport modes absent in achiral systems.

To address this, we propose a novel symbol-level precoding\n(SLP)-based AFDM transmission framework, which shifts the signal processing\nburden in downlink communications from user side to the base station (BS),\nenabling direct symbol detection without requiring channel estimation or\nequalization at the receiver. Specifically, in the uplink phase, we propose a\nSparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) based channel estimation algorithm by exploiting\nthe inherent sparsity of affine frequency (AF) domain channels. In particular,\nthe sparse prior is modeled via a hierarchical Laplace distribution, and\nparameters are iteratively updated using the Expectation-Maximization (EM)\nalgorithm. We also derive the Bayesian Cramer-Rao Bound (BCRB) to characterize\nthe theoretical performance limit. In the downlink phase, the BS employs the\nSLP technology to design the transmitted waveform based on the estimated uplink\nchannel state information (CSI) and channel reciprocity. The resulting\noptimization problem is formulated as a second-order cone programming (SOCP)\nproblem, and its dual problem is investigated by Lagrangian function and\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nSBL estimator outperforms traditional orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) in\naccuracy and robustness to off-grid effects, while the SLP-based waveform\ndesign scheme achieves performance comparable to conventional AFDM receivers\nwhile significantly reducing the computational complexity at receiver,\nvalidating the practicality of our approach.",

While this design enables unified modeling of multimodal\nprotein information, it suffers from two major limitations: (1) The\nconcatenation of sequence and structure tokens approximately doubles the\nprotein length and breaks the intrinsic residue-level alignment between\nmodalities. (2) Constrained by the training corpus and limited context window,\nProtTeX is typically trained on single-protein inputs, rendering it\nincompatible with in-context learning (ICL) and thus limiting its\ngeneralization capability. To address these issues, we propose ProtTeX-CC, a\nlightweight two-stage compression framework designed to enhance ProtTeX under\nfew-shot settings. We first design a joint embedding compression mechanism that\nfuses sequence and structure representations at the residue level, effectively\nreducing the protein input length by half without sacrificing performance. Then\nwe propose a self-compression module that aggregates each full demonstration\ninto the latent space of the last few linguistic tokens, reducing the average\ndemonstration length from 751 tokens to less than 16 tokens. Compared to the\noriginal ProtTeX, our self-compression approach achieves a compression ratio of\napproximately 93.68% in the total prompt length under the 16-shot setting.\nWithout modifying the backbone model, ProtTeX-CC introduces only a small number\nof additional parameters through PEFT-based tuning in the joint embedding\ncompression stage and a single trainable projection layer in the\nself-compression stage. Extensive experiments on protein function prediction\nshow that ProtTeX-CC improves performance on the in-domain benchmark by 2%, and\ngeneralizes well to the out-of-domain dataset with a performance gain of 11%.",

Among all solutions, distributed\ncooperative localization (DCL) has garnered widespread attention due to its\nrobustness and scalability. The main challenge of DCL lies in how to fuse\nrelative measurements between agents under unknown correlations. To address\nthis, covariance intersection (CI) was introduced to DCL. However, the\nclassical CI optimization criteria suffer from issues such as scale imbalance\nand correlation mismatch during the fusion process. These deficiencies are not\nas pronounced in 2D scenarios, where the state space is relatively simple and\nthe observability of each state component is well. However, in 3D scenarios,\nwhere the state space is more complex and there are significant disparities in\nthe scale and observability of state components, performance degradation\nbecomes severe. This necessitates the design of specialized mechanisms to\nimprove the data fusion process. In this paper, we identify three main\ndrawbacks of the classical CI optimization criteria in recursive filtering and\nintroduce a weighting mechanism, namely weighted covariance intersection (WCI),\nto improve its performance. We then introduce WCI into range-based distributed\ncooperative localization in 3D scenarios, developing a concurrent fusion\nstrategy for multiple distance measurements and designing a weighting matrix\nbased on the error propagation rule of the inertial navigation system (INS).\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed WCI significantly enhances\ncooperative localization performance compared to classical CI, while the\ndistributed approach outperforms the centralized approach in terms of\nrobustness, scalability, and is more suitable for large-scale swarms.",

The main concern is the lack of explainability of these trained\nML models and the significant risks posed to network functionalities in case of\nfailures, especially since (i) testing on every exhaustive case is infeasible\nand (ii) the data used for model training may not be available. This paper\nproposes ATLAS, an AI-guided approach that generates a battery of tests for\npre-trained AI-native receiver models and benchmarks the performance against a\nclassical receiver architecture. Using gradient-based optimization, it avoids\nspanning the exhaustive set of all environment and channel conditions; instead,\nit generates the next test in an online manner to further probe specific\nconfigurations that offer the highest risk of failure. We implement and\nvalidate our approach by adopting the well-known DeepRx AI-native receiver\nmodel as well as a classical receiver using differentiable tensors in NVIDIA's\nSionna environment. ATLAS uncovers specific combinations of mobility, channel\ndelay spread, and noise, where fully and partially trained variants of\nAI-native DeepRx perform suboptimally compared to the classical receivers. Our\nproposed method reduces the number of tests required per failure found by 19%\ncompared to grid search for a 3-parameters input optimization problem,\ndemonstrating greater efficiency. In contrast, the computational cost of the\ngrid-based approach scales exponentially with the number of variables, making\nit increasingly impractical for high-dimensional problems.",

Recent\nspillover events in dairy cattle in the United States, linked to wild birds,\nhighlight the critical importance of understanding transmission pathways at the\ncattle--wild bird--environment interface. In this work, we formulate and\nanalyze a deterministic compartmental model that captures the transmission of\nHPAI between dairy cattle and wild birds, incorporating both direct and\nindirect (environmental) routes. The model combines an $SEIR$ framework for\ncattle with an $SIR$ structure for wild birds, coupled through an environmental\ncompartment. We derive the basic reproduction number, $\\mathcal{R}_{0}$, using\nthe next-generation matrix approach, decomposing it into cattle-to-cattle,\nbird-to-bird, and environmental contributions. Qualitative analysis establishes\npositivity, boundedness, and global stability of equilibria through Lyapunov\nfunctions. Numerical simulations confirm the results of the theoretical\nanalyses, illustrating outbreak trajectories, extinction thresholds, and\npersistence dynamics. A global sensitivity analysis, based on Latin hypercube\nsampling and partial rank correlation coefficients, identifies key parameters,\nparticularly transmission among cattle, environmental contamination, and\nrecovery rate as critical drivers of epidemic outcomes.

In this\nstudy, we present a lightweight AI assistant that interprets Skew-T diagrams\nusing a small language model (LM) and a small VLM fine-tuned to emulate human\nforecasters. Using a curriculum learning framework, we first train the models\nto identify key atmospheric features from diagrams through visual question\nanswering, followed by chain-of-thought reasoning tasks that estimate\nprecipitation probability based on the derived visual groundings. Model inputs\ninclude either textual summaries or generated Skew-T diagrams derived from\noperational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecasts, paired with\nthree-hour precipitation observations from South Korea's Auto Weather Stations\nnetwork. Evaluation results demonstrate that the fine-tuned VLM achieves skill\ncomparable to an operational NWP model, despite relying solely on static\natmospheric profiles. Ablation studies reveal that visual grounding and\nreasoning supervision are critical for performance, while attention map\nanalysis confirms that the model learns to focus on relevant meteorological\nfeatures.

A Vanka smoother and local spectral\ncoarse grids come with significant computational cost in the setup phase. To\navoid constructing a new solver for each time step and/or nonlinear iteration,\nwe utilize an implicit-explicit integration scheme in time, where we partition\nthe nonlinear operator as a sum of linear and nonlinear parts.

We\nalso accurately reproduce established results from two-point correlation\nfunctions and energy spectra, where we recover the incompressible kinetic\nenergy spectrum with little memory overhead. These results demonstrate the\nrepresentative capabilities of the MPS ansatz for quantum turbulence and pave\nthe way for studying this nonequilibrium state using previously-prohibited\nsystem sizes to uncover novel physics.",

    "abstract": "Skin diseases impose a substantial burden on global healthcare systems,\ndriven by their high prevalence (affecting up to 70% of the population),\ncomplex diagnostic processes, and a critical shortage of dermatologists in\nresource-limited areas. While artificial intelligence(AI) tools have\ndemonstrated promise in dermatological image analysis, current models face\nlimitations-they often rely on large, manually labeled datasets and are built\nfor narrow, specific tasks, making them less effective in real-world settings.\nTo tackle these limitations, we present DermNIO, a versatile foundation model\nfor dermatology. Trained on a curated dataset of 432,776 images from three\nsources (public repositories, web-sourced images, and proprietary collections),\nDermNIO incorporates a novel hybrid pretraining framework that augments the\nself-supervised learning paradigm through semi-supervised learning and\nknowledge-guided prototype initialization. This integrated method not only\ndeepens the understanding of complex dermatological conditions, but also\nsubstantially enhances the generalization capability across various clinical\ntasks. Evaluated across 20 datasets, DermNIO consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models across a wide range of tasks. It excels in high-level\nclinical applications including malignancy classification, disease severity\ngrading, multi-category diagnosis, and dermatological image caption, while also\nachieving state-of-the-art performance in low-level tasks such as skin lesion\nsegmentation. Furthermore, DermNIO demonstrates strong robustness in\nprivacy-preserving federated learning scenarios and across diverse skin types\nand sexes. In a blinded reader study with 23 dermatologists, DermNIO achieved\n95.79% diagnostic accuracy (versus clinicians' 73.66%), and AI assistance\nimproved clinician performance by 17.21%.",

    "abstract": "Recent works have shown the promise of inference-time search over action\nsamples for improving generative robot policies. In particular, optimizing\ncross-chunk coherence via bidirectional decoding has proven effective in\nboosting the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies. However, this\napproach remains computationally expensive as the diversity of sampled actions\ngrows. In this paper, we introduce self-guided action diffusion, a more\nefficient variant of bidirectional decoding tailored for diffusion-based\npolicies. At the core of our method is to guide the proposal distribution at\neach diffusion step based on the prior decision. Experiments in simulation\ntasks show that the proposed self-guidance enables near-optimal performance at\nnegligible inference cost. Notably, under a tight sampling budget, our method\nachieves up to 70% higher success rates than existing counterparts on\nchallenging dynamic tasks.

To address this need, we present\nAUTOVR, an automatic framework for dynamic UI and user event interaction in VR\napps built on the Unity Engine.

Using sensitive data exposure as a performance metric, we compare\nAUTOVR with Android Monkey, a widely used headless Android GUI stress testing\ntool.

Misinformation in speech often\nunfolds across multi-turn dialogues, shaped by speaker interactions,\ndisfluencies, overlapping speech, and emotional tone-factors that complicate\nboth claim detection and verification. Existing datasets fall short by focusing\non isolated sentences or text transcripts, without modeling the conversational\nand acoustic complexity of spoken misinformation. We introduce MAD (Multi-turn\nAudio Dialogues), the first fact-checking dataset aligned with multi-turn\nspoken dialogues and corresponding audio. MAD captures how misinformation is\nintroduced, contested, and reinforced through natural conversation. Each\ndialogue includes annotations for speaker turns, dialogue scenarios,\ninformation spread styles, sentence-level check-worthiness, and both sentence-\nand dialogue-level veracity. The dataset supports two core tasks: check-worthy\nclaim detection and claim verification. Benchmarking shows that even strong\npretrained models reach only 72-74% accuracy at the sentence level and 71-72%\nat the dialogue level in claim verification, underscoring MAD's difficulty. MAD\noffers a high-quality benchmark for advancing multimodal and conversational\nfact-checking, while also surfacing open challenges related to reasoning over\nspeech and dialogue dynamics.",

    "abstract": "This paper characterizes the fundamental trade-off between throughput and Age\nof Information (AoI) in wireless networks where multiple devices transmit\nstatus updates to a central base station over unreliable channels. To address\nthe complexity introduced by stochastic transmission successes, we propose the\nthroughput-AoI capacity region, which defines all feasible throughput-AoI pairs\nachievable under any scheduling policy. Using a second-order approximation that\nincorporates both mean and temporal variance, we derive an outer bound and a\ntight inner bound for the throughput-AoI capacity region. Furthermore, we\npropose a simple and low complexity scheduling policy and prove that it\nachieves every interior point within the tight inner bound. This establishes a\nsystematic and theoretically grounded framework for the joint optimization of\nthroughput and information freshness in practical wireless communication\nscenarios.\n  To validate our theoretical framework and demonstrate the utility of the\nthroughput-AoI capacity region, extensive simulations are implemented.\nSimulation results demonstrate that our proposed policy significantly\noutperforms conventional methods across various practical network optimization\nscenarios.

To analyze human\nmotion, we collect 3+ hours of motion capture data across 20 individuals where\na real-time operational space controller mimics human motion on a simulated\nhumanoid robot.

To evaluate generated motions using the synergy library, the\nfoot-sliding ratio and proposed metrics for motion smoothness involving total\nmomentum and kinetic energy deviations are computed for each generated motion,\nand compared with reference motions. Finally, we leverage the synergies with a\nmotion-language transformer, where the humanoid, during execution of motion\ntasks with its end-effectors, adapts its posture based on the chosen synergy.\nSupplementary material, code, and videos are available at\nhttps://rhea-mal.github.io/humanoidsynergies.io.",
