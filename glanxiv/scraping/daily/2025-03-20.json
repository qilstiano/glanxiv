This system, which is\ncurrently under construction at the UC San Diego Supercomputing Center,\ncomprises a co-designed hard- and software stack that is optimized for run-time\nmassively parallel processing and hierarchical address-event routing (HiAER) of\nspikes while promoting memory-efficient network storage and execution. Our\narchitecture efficiently handles both sparse connectivity and sparse activity\nfor robust and low-latency event-driven inference for both edge and cloud\ncomputing. A Python programming interface to HiAER-Spike, agnostic to\nhardware-level detail, shields the user from complexity in the configuration\nand execution of general spiking neural networks with virtually no constraints\nin topology. The system is made easily available over a web portal for use by\nthe wider community. In the following we provide an overview of the hard- and\nsoftware stack, explain the underlying design principles, demonstrate some of\nthe system's capabilities and solicit feedback from the broader neuromorphic\ncommunity.",

Our findings include a\nmarginal detection of the polarised region and low fractional polarisation\n(peaking at 1.4%). Assuming a certain level of validity, we observed\nwell-organised dust grains aligned along the equatorial plane of the PN,\nindicating a magnetic field alignment with the outflows.

We also modelled the SED of\nK3-35, and our best-fit models included a mixture of silicates and amorphous\ncarbon. The grains of amorphous carbon are less susceptible to alignment with\nthe magnetic field, which could, at least partially, explain the observed low\npolarisation.

Repeatedly\nopening and closing a DRAM row (RowHammer) or keeping a DRAM row open for a\nlong period of time (RowPress) induces bitflips in nearby unaccessed DRAM rows.\nPrior works on DRAM read disturbance either 1) perform experimental\ncharacterization using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) DRAM chips to\ndemonstrate the high-level characteristics of the read disturbance bitflips, or\n2) perform device-level simulations to understand the low-level error\nmechanisms of the read disturbance bitflips.\n  In this paper, we attempt to align and cross-validate the real-chip\nexperimental characterization results and state-of-the-art device-level studies\nof DRAM read disturbance. To do so, we first identify and extract the key\nbitflip characteristics of RowHammer and RowPress from the device-level error\nmechanisms studied in prior works. Then, we perform experimental\ncharacterization on 96 COTS DDR4 DRAM chips that directly match the data and\naccess patterns studied in the device-level works. Through our experiments, we\nidentify fundamental inconsistencies in the RowHammer and RowPress bitflip\ndirections and access pattern dependence between experimental characterization\nresults and the device-level error mechanisms.\n  Based on our results, we hypothesize that either 1) the retention failure\nbased DRAM architecture reverse-engineering methodologies do not fully work on\nmodern DDR4 DRAM chips, or 2) existing device-level works do not fully uncover\nall the major read disturbance error mechanisms. We hope our findings inspire\nand enable future works to build a more fundamental and comprehensive\nunderstanding of DRAM read disturbance.",

In this context, the\ndeep learning-based RouteNet family of models has recently redefined network\nmodeling by showing an unprecedented cost-performance trade-off. In this work,\nwe revisit RouteNet's sophisticated design and uncover its hidden connection to\nTopological Deep Learning (TDL), an emerging field that models higher-order\ninteractions beyond standard graph-based methods. We demonstrate that, although\noriginally formulated as a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network, RouteNet serves\nas the first instantiation of a new form of TDL. More specifically, this paper\npresents OrdGCCN, a novel TDL framework that introduces the notion of ordered\nneighbors in arbitrary discrete topological spaces, and shows that RouteNet's\narchitecture can be naturally described as an ordered topological neural\nnetwork. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful\nreal-world application of state-of-the-art TDL principles --which we confirm\nthrough extensive testbed experiments--, laying the foundation for the next\ngeneration of ordered TDL-driven applications.",

    "abstract": "We consider price competition among multiple sellers over a selling horizon\nof $T$ periods. In each period, sellers simultaneously offer their prices and\nsubsequently observe their respective demand that is unobservable to\ncompetitors. The demand function for each seller depends on all sellers' prices\nthrough a private, unknown, and nonlinear relationship. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a semi-parametric least-squares estimation of the\nnonlinear mean function, which does not require sellers to communicate demand\ninformation. We show that when all sellers employ our policy, their prices\nconverge at a rate of $O(T^{-1/7})$ to the Nash equilibrium prices that sellers\nwould reach if they were fully informed. Each seller incurs a regret of\n$O(T^{5/7})$ relative to a dynamic benchmark policy. A theoretical contribution\nof our work is proving the existence of equilibrium under shape-constrained\ndemand functions via the concept of $s$-concavity and establishing regret\nbounds of our proposed policy. Technically, we also establish new concentration\nresults for the least squares estimator under shape constraints. Our findings\noffer significant insights into dynamic competition-aware pricing and\ncontribute to the broader study of non-parametric learning in strategic\ndecision-making.",

This is the first\ntime that a bloated star candidate has been tested for the theoretically\npredicted periodic variability. The source is found to be variable at optical\nand mid-infrared wavelengths and classified as a long-period variable MYSO. The\nobserved TJO data gives a period of the source of $\\sim$ 270$\\pm$40 days (in\nthe Rc band) and $\\sim$ 270$\\pm$50 days (in the Ic band), which is very close\nto the value predicted by the theoretical Period-Luminosity relation for a\nbloated young star of $\\sim 10^5 L\\odot$. Additionally, a large period of\n$\\sim$ 460$\\pm$80 days (in the G band) and $\\sim$ 440$\\pm$70 (in the Rp band)\nis also visible in the Gaia light curve. The physical parameters of the source,\nsuch as mass, radius, and accretion rate, based on the theoretical predictions\nfor the spherical accretion case and corresponding to a period of 270--460\ndays, are $\\sim 24$--28$\\,M\\odot$, $\\sim 650$--900$\\,R\\odot$ and $\\sim\n(6$--$9)\\times10^{-3}\\,M\\odot yr^{-1}$. However, these numbers are very\nsensitive to the effective temperatures assumed in the models. Additionally,\nthese values strongly depend on the geometry of accretion and could\nsignificantly decrease for the case of a MYSO accreting through a disc.

The algorithm presented is\ninput-robust and structurally adaptive. Exploration is guided and narrows into\nareas in the solution space where solutions are possible, referred to as\nin-bound solution space, skipping all areas where solutions are impossible.\nUnfortunately, this can lead to false positives: paths that are hinted to\npotential have solutions but ultimately realized to not lead to solutions. The\nin-bound solution space navigated can therefore be filled with only false\npositives, only true solutions or a mix of the two, affecting the algorithm's\nperformance in different ways. We then detail the challenges of exploring the\nin-bound solution space for different instances. Further, we show how this\nalgorithm may practically generalize to other NP/NP-complete problems with\nappropriate adaptation. An introductory discussion is done on this\ngeneralization to k-SAT and general CNF-SAT, deferring extensive detail to a\nfollow-up paper. This paper does not satisfy P vs NP proof requirements and\ndoes not claim to resolve the problem.

    "abstract": "This article provides a brief overview of the field of Natural Language\nGeneration. The term Natural Language Generation (NLG), in its broadest\ndefinition, refers to the study of systems that verbalize some form of\ninformation through natural language. That information could be stored in a\nlarge database or knowledge graph (in data-to-text applications), but NLG\nresearchers may also study summarisation (text-to-text) or image captioning\n(image-to-text), for example. As a subfield of Natural Language Processing, NLG\nis closely related to other sub-disciplines such as Machine Translation (MT)\nand Dialog Systems. Some NLG researchers exclude MT from their definition of\nthe field, since there is no content selection involved where the system has to\ndetermine what to say. Conversely, dialog systems do not typically fall under\nthe header of Natural Language Generation since NLG is just one component of\ndialog systems (the others being Natural Language Understanding and Dialog\nManagement). However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), different\nsubfields of Natural Language Processing have converged on similar\nmethodologies for the production of natural language and the evaluation of\nautomatically generated text.",

Introducing the Muller's ratchet-like mechanism gives a\nnon-zero chance for any opinion to be removed from the system. We believe that\nin such a case, for any positive temperature, ultimately a consensus is\nreached. However, even for a moderate system size, the time to reach consensus\nis very long. In contrast, for the deterministic case (without social\ntemperature), the system may be frozen with clusters of actors having several\ndifferent opinions, or even reach the cycle limit (with blinking structures).",

The quantification of DZM is achieved by traversing\nimportant parameters of the system, specifically the total direct photon rate\nentering the aperture of the instrument, ranging from $1.85 \\times 10^6$ to\n$1.85 \\times 10^8$ photons per second, and the wavefront error drift rate,\nranging from $\\sigma_{drift}$ = 0.3 - 3 $nm/\\sqrt{iteration}$, injected via the\ndeformable mirror actuators.

Access to these cloud services is typically governed by Identity\nand Access Management systems, where user authentication often relies on\npasswords. While best practices dictate the implementation of multi-factor\nauthentication, it's a reality that many such users remain solely protected by\npasswords. This reliance on passwords creates a significant vulnerability, as\nthese credentials can be compromised through various means, including\nside-channel attacks. This paper exploits keyboard acoustic emanations to infer\ntyped natural language passphrases via unsupervised learning, necessitating no\nprevious training data. Whilst this work focuses on short passphrases, it is\nalso applicable to longer messages, such as confidential emails, where the\nmargin for error is much greater, than with passphrases, making the attack even\nmore effective in such a setting. Unlike traditional attacks that require\nphysical access to the target device, acoustic side-channel attacks can be\nexecuted within the vicinity, without the user's knowledge, offering a\nworthwhile avenue for malicious actors. Our findings replicate and extend\nprevious work, confirming that cross-correlation audio preprocessing\noutperforms methods like mel-frequency-cepstral coefficients and fast-fourier\ntransforms in keystroke clustering.

However, there have also\nbeen cases of non-detections in high-mass star-forming regions, leaving the\nrole and prevalence of disks around massive protostars still uncertain. We used\nhigh-resolution (0.2\") NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations\nto study the 1.3 mm continuum and molecular line emission of five massive dense\ncores in the Cygnus-X cloud complex. Four cores host 2000-au-scale rotating\nstructures previously identified as disk candidates in lower-resolution SMA\nobservations, while the remaining core with no evidence for a disk serves as a\ncomparison. With a resolution of 300 au, the 1.3 mm continuum emission reveals\nvarying levels of fragmentation in our sample, with fragment radii ranging from\n150 to 800 AU. In this work, we confirm the existence of two small, stable\ndisks in Keplerian-like rotation at scales of 500 au out of four previously\nidentified disk candidates from the SMA observations at coarser resolution. The\nlack of evidence for Keplerian disks in other disk candidates identified from\nthe SMA data suggests that rotational signatures observed at 2000 au scales do\nnot necessarily imply the presence of Keplerian disks at smaller scales.\nTherefore, higher-resolution and higher-sensitivity observations are essential\nto definitively identify Keplerian disks on smaller scales.",

Addressing the optimal sequencing of the jobs when\nequivalent failures across machines exist is a decision of particular relevance\nto the general scheduling problem. Such failures allow for unpredictable time\nconsumption and improper utilization of the machines. Therefore, it is of\nparticular relevance to address the problem with new modeling approaches\nconsidering the parallel and sequential components of the manufacturing process\nunder equivalent failure in the jobs at each machine.

Recent advancements in foundational\ndepth estimation deliver impressive results but further amplify the difficulty\nof deployment on ASICs.

To mitigate the\nperformance degradation, we introduce activation polishing and compensation\nalgorithm applied before and after activation quantization, as well as a weight\nreconstruction method for minimizing errors in weight quantization.\nFurthermore, we design a flexible and programmable hardware accelerator by\nsupporting kernel fusion and customized instruction programmability, enhancing\nthroughput and efficiency.

    "abstract": "In many practical reinforcement learning scenarios, feedback is provided only\nat the end of a long horizon, leading to sparse and delayed rewards. Existing\nreward redistribution methods typically assume that per-step rewards are\nindependent, thus overlooking interdependencies among state--action pairs. In\nthis paper, we propose a \\emph{Likelihood Reward Redistribution} (LRR)\nframework that addresses this issue by modeling each per-step reward with a\nparametric probability distribution whose parameters depend on the\nstate--action pair. By maximizing the likelihood of the observed episodic\nreturn via a leave-one-out (LOO) strategy that leverages the entire trajectory,\nour framework inherently introduces an uncertainty regularization term into the\nsurrogate objective. Moreover, we show that the conventional mean squared error\n(MSE) loss for reward redistribution emerges as a special case of our\nlikelihood framework when the uncertainty is fixed under the Gaussian\ndistribution. When integrated with an off-policy algorithm such as Soft\nActor-Critic, LRR yields dense and informative reward signals, resulting in\nsuperior sample efficiency and policy performance on Box-2d and MuJoCo\nbenchmarks.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces Q-learning with gradient target tracking, a novel\nreinforcement learning framework that provides a learned continuous target\nupdate mechanism as an alternative to the conventional hard update paradigm. In\nthe standard deep Q-network (DQN), the target network is a copy of the online\nnetwork's weights, held fixed for a number of iterations before being\nperiodically replaced via a hard update. While this stabilizes training by\nproviding consistent targets, it introduces a new challenge: the hard update\nperiod must be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance. To address this\nissue, we propose two gradient-based target update methods: DQN with asymmetric\ngradient target tracking (AGT2-DQN) and DQN with symmetric gradient target\ntracking (SGT2-DQN). These methods replace the conventional hard target updates\nwith continuous and structured updates using gradient descent, which\neffectively eliminates the need for manual tuning. We provide a theoretical\nanalysis proving the convergence of these methods in tabular settings.\nAdditionally, empirical evaluations demonstrate their advantages over standard\nDQN baselines, which suggest that gradient-based target updates can serve as an\neffective alternative to conventional target update mechanisms in Q-learning.",

Therefore, there is strong interest to use the PWFS without modulation,\nwhich can be enabled with nonlinear reconstructors.

However, many existing GeoFMs primarily focus on\noverhead remote sensing (RS) data while neglecting other data modalities such\nas ground-level imagery. A key challenge in multimodal GeoFM development is to\nexplicitly model geospatial relationships across modalities, which enables\ngeneralizability across tasks, spatial scales, and temporal contexts. To\naddress these limitations, we propose GAIR, a novel multimodal GeoFM\narchitecture integrating overhead RS data, street view (SV) imagery, and their\ngeolocation metadata. We utilize three factorized neural encoders to project an\nSV image, its geolocation, and an RS image into the embedding space. The SV\nimage needs to be located within the RS image's spatial footprint but does not\nneed to be at its geographic center. In order to geographically align the SV\nimage and RS image, we propose a novel implicit neural representations (INR)\nmodule that learns a continuous RS image representation and looks up the RS\nembedding at the SV image's geolocation. Next, these geographically aligned SV\nembedding, RS embedding, and location embedding are trained with contrastive\nlearning objectives from unlabeled data. We evaluate GAIR across 10 geospatial\ntasks spanning RS image-based, SV image-based, and location embedding-based\nbenchmarks.

First, we optimize the geometrical and material\nparameters of the proposed metatile, which is composed of small ceramic\nsubtiles connected by silicon joints, in order to reduce longitudinal and\nflexural wave propagation on tiled floors, which are responsible for noise\nvibrations in tiled environments. A bandgap is achieved that effectively\nsuppresses the transmission of impact noise through the periodic structural\nconfiguration. For flexural waves, the ceramic metatile exhibits a pronounced\nattenuation of wave transmission in the range of $500$-$1900$ Hz along the\n$[100]$ direction, and $500$-$1400$ Hz along the $[110]$ direction. For\nlongitudinal waves, a broad bandgap is observed, spanning from $400$ Hz to\n$1950$ Hz in both the $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions. Additionally, the\nbandgaps shift toward lower frequencies with increasing width of the subtiles\nand silicon joints, or with a decrease in the Young's modulus of the silicon.\nIn both experimental and numerical tests, it is demonstrated that the\nintegration of silicon joints inside the ceramic metatile improves the acoustic\ninsulation performance, as measured by the reduction of impact noise levels\nacross a wide range of low frequencies.

    "abstract": "Calibration of instrumental polarization is critical for measuring polarized\nradio emissions from astrophysical sources to extract the magnetic field\ninformation in astrophysical, heliospheric, and terrestrial plasmas. At meter\nwavelengths, calibration of radio polarimetric observations is particularly\nchallenging because of the scarcity of bright polarized sources due to\nsignificant Faraday depolarization. Here, we present a novel formalism for\npolarization calibration using an unpolarized sky model. The formalism is\nspecifically designed for wide-field, low-frequency instruments like the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA), the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), New Extension\nin Nan\\c{c}ay Upgrading LoFAR (NenuFAR), Owens Valley Radio Observatory - Long\nWavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), low-frequency telescope of the Square Kilometre\nArray Observatory (SKAO-low), etc. By leveraging the apparent polarization of\nthe unpolarized sky induced by the polarized primary beam of the radio\ntelescope, this method avoids dependence on bright polarized calibrators. It is\nalso immune to ionospheric Faraday rotation. The validation of the approach via\nMWA observations confirms the accuracy of the method. This formalism provides a\nrobust framework for low-frequency polarization calibration. It addresses the\nlongstanding calibration challenges and advances the field of low-frequency\npolarimetry by enabling polarization studies of astrophysical radio sources.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate for the first time the quasi-periodic\noscillations (QPOs) that arise as a result of halting the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton\n(BHL) accretion mechanism around a Kerr black hole. Unlike previous studies,\nwhich focused on shock cones or perturbed tori, we show that stopping BHL\naccretion leads to the formation of a new plasma structure. On this plasma\nstructure, spiral shock waves are observed to develop. These shock waves are\nfound to excite both low-frequency (LFQPOs) and high-frequency QPOs (HFQPOs).\nTwo key results emerge from our numerical simulations. First, LFQPOs arise only\nwhen the halted flow is supersonic, identifying for the first time the velocity\ndependence of their formation. Second, nonlinear couplings that produce $3:2$,\n$2:1$, and $1:2:3$ resonances appear exclusively for rapidly rotating black\nholes ($a/M = 0.9$), directly linking spin to resonance states. In addition, it\nis demonstrated that HFQPOs are strongly influenced by the black hole spin. The\ngenerated QPOs are observed to be excited through the modes induced by the\nblack hole spacetime curvature. The frequencies obtained from the numerical\nsimulations align with observations of $GRS1915+105$, $XTEJ1550-564$, and\n$REJ1034+396$, thereby bridging stellar-mass and supermassive black hole\nsystems within a unified framework.

It has been shown that the additional\ninteractions can reduce the scaling of perturbative crossings. In traditional\nannealing devices these couplings do not exist natively. In this work, we\ndevelop two gadgets to achieve this: a three-body gadget that requires a strong\n$ZZZ$ interaction; and a one-hot gadget that uses only local $X$ drives and\ntwo-body $ZZ$ interactions. The gadgets partition the Hilbert space to\neffectively generate a limited number of $XX$ interactions in the low-energy\nsubspace. We numerically verify that the one-hot gadget can mitigate a\nperturbative crossing on a toy problem.

This PN\nhas a complex morphology with multiple shells and contains a pair of structures\nwith a lower degree of ionization compared to the main nebular components.\nThese structures are known as low ionization structures (LISs), and their\norigin is still a mystery. With the capabilities provided by IFU spectroscopy,\nwe aim to gain a better understanding of the behavior of nebular properties in\nthe LISs. Data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) at the Very\nLarge Telescope (VLT) were used in order to perform a spatially resolved\nphysico-chemical analysis of NGC 3242 both in 2D, through the analysis of\nemission line maps, and in 1D, simulating long-slit spectroscopy, with\npseudo-slits. Through the deeper investigation of MUSE data, we detect new\nstructures perpendicular to the pair of LISs of NGC 3242, which are mainly seen\nin the light of [S III] and [N II]. In addition, two arc-like structures are\nrevealed. Moreover, an inner jet-like structure is found through its [Fe III]\nemission. The interaction of the jet with the rim may be related to the\nformation of knots and blobs. The higher value of Te, is estimated from the [S\nIII] diagnostic lines, followed by Te ([N II]), Te(H I) and finally Te (He I).\nIn all cases, Te is higher at the inner nebular structures. Regarding electron\ndensity, ne, is lower at the LISs, while an increase is observed at the nebular\nrim. Diagnostic diagrams confirm that NGC 3242 is a highly ionized nebula.\nMoreover, the MUSE data unveiled for the first time in this PN, the atomic line\n[C I] {\\lambda}8727, primarily emitted from the LISs. This finding suggests\nthat these structures may consist of a molecular core surrounded by neutral and\nionized gas",

Furthermore, in\ngeneral-domain tasks, even randomly retaining only 30% of tokens achieves\nperformance comparable to using the full set of visual tokens.

This\neffective mass, derived from the minimum neutrino mass, offers valuable\ninsights into the absolute neutrino mass scale. Using best-fit parameters from\nneutrino oscillation experiments, the minimum neutrino mass is determined from\nthe sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates, $\\Sigma = m_1 + m_2 + m_3,$\nwhich is represented by two narrow bands centered at approximately 0.06\neV/c$^2$ for the normal hierarchy (NH) and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for the inverted\nhierarchy (IH). Under these constraints, the minimum neutrino mass is found to\nbe 0.001186 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.002646 eV/c$^2$ for IH, thereby establishing\na potential absolute neutrino mass scale for both scenarios.

We further\ninvestigate their cosmological production in the early universe, highlighting\nhow measurements of $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ could serve as a low-energy probe of\nthe ultraviolet dynamics addressing the PQ quality problem.",

Our high sensitivity, high resolution, global very long baseline\ninterferometry observations of the jet in the radio galaxy 3C 84 enable us to\nstudy its inner morphology, which resembles a thread-like pattern. We find that\nthis pattern can be described by a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, consisting of\nfour instability modes. Our model favours a jet described by a Mach number of\n$M_\\textrm{j} = 5.0\\pm1.7$ and a sound speed of $\\alpha_\\textrm{j} =\n0.14\\pm0.06$.

    "abstract": "The processing of quantum information is limited by fundamental physical\nconstraints on how information can be encoded, transmitted, and extracted. In\nparticular, the non-orthogonality of quantum states limits their\ndistinguishability, and thermodynamic constraints, including the energetic cost\nof state preparation and quantum operations, further restrict the viability of\nrealistic information protocols. This work explores the impact of such\nconstraints on the preparation, evolution, and readout of quantum information.\nWe demonstrate that preparing the system for encoding and measurement affects\nthe distinguishability and purity of the resulting ensemble of states.\nFurthermore, we analyze a noisy communication channel and propose an optimal\nprotocol for encoding and decoding the transmitted information. For this\nrealistic protocol, we show that the maximum probability of successfully\nretrieving the information is equal to the maximum correlation that can be\nachieved between the system and the register. The protocol uses only Gibbs\nstates as free resources, ensuring minimal thermodynamic cost. Based on this,\nwe provide a thermodynamic interpretation of the Holevo information, which\nquantifies the capacity of the transmitted information and establishes a\nfundamental limit on its retrieval in thermodynamically constrained scenarios.",

Traditional\nsurvival models often fail to capture complex longitudinal biomarker patterns\nassociated with disease progression. We propose an ensemble survival analysis\nframework integrating multiple survival models to improve early prediction of\nclinical progression in initially cognitively normal individuals. We analyzed\nlongitudinal biomarker data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) cohort, including 721 participants, limiting analysis to up\nto three visits (baseline, 6-month follow-up, 12-month follow-up). Of these,\n142 (19.7%) experienced clinical progression to MCI or AD. Our approach\ncombined penalized Cox regression (LASSO, Elastic Net) with advanced survival\nmodels (Random Survival Forest, DeepSurv, XGBoost). Model predictions were\naggregated using ensemble averaging and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA).\nPredictive performance was assessed using Harrell's concordance index (C-index)\nand time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). The ensemble model achieved a\npeak C-index of 0.907 and an integrated time-dependent AUC of 0.904,\noutperforming baseline-only models (C-index 0.608). One follow-up visit after\nbaseline significantly improved prediction accuracy (48.1% C-index, 48.2% AUC\ngains), while adding a second follow-up provided only marginal gains (2.1%\nC-index, 2.7% AUC). Our ensemble survival framework effectively integrates\ndiverse survival models and aggregation techniques to enhance early prediction\nof preclinical AD progression. These findings highlight the importance of\nleveraging longitudinal biomarker data, particularly one follow-up visit, for\naccurate risk stratification and personalized intervention strategies.",

The plateau emerges as a flat extended intermediate step of the\nanomalous Hall hysteresis loop with a controllable step height with temperature\nand strain. The remarkable tunability of the plateau position is in contrast\nwith typical magnetic plateau associated with a field-induced metastable\nmagnetic structure, but indicates the existence of a hidden phase transition\nthat significantly alters the magnetic anisotropy energy without changing the\nmagnetic order. The symmetry analysis of the strain tuning suggests that the\nhidden phase preserves the rotational symmetry of the ab-plane.

This allows us to select descent directions\naround points where the function may fail to be differentiable and establish\nalgorithm convergence to a stationary point from any initial condition.

The colour distributions of GC\ncandidates in the two larger galaxies show hints of bimodality with peaks at\nIE-HE = 0.36 and 0.79 (IC 342) and IE-HE = 0.36 and 0.80 (NGC 2403),\ncorresponding to metallicities of [Fe/H]=-1.5 and [Fe/H]=-0.5, similar to those\nof the metal-poor and metal-rich GC subpopulations in the Milky Way. The\nluminosity functions of our GC candidates exhibit an excess of relatively faint\nobjects, relative to a canonical, approximately Gaussian GC luminosity function\n(GCLF). The excess objects may be similar to those previously identified in\nother galaxies. The specific frequency of classical old GCs in IC 342, as\ndetermined based on the brighter half of the GCLF, appears to be unusually low\nwith SN=0.2-0.3. The combined luminosity function of young and intermediate-age\nclusters in all three galaxies is consistent with a power-law distribution,\ndN/dL ~ L^(-2.3+/-0.1) and the total numbers of young clusters brighter than\nM(IE)=-8 in NGC 2403 and Holmberg II are comparable with those found in their\nLocal Group counterparts, that is, M33 and the Small Magellanic Cloud,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "Low-count positron emission tomography (LCPET) imaging can reduce patients'\nexposure to radiation but often suffers from increased image noise and reduced\nlesion detectability, necessitating effective denoising techniques. Diffusion\nmodels have shown promise in LCPET denoising for recovering degraded image\nquality. However, training such models requires large and diverse datasets,\nwhich are challenging to obtain in the medical domain. To address data scarcity\nand privacy concerns, we combine diffusion models with federated learning -- a\ndecentralized training approach where models are trained individually at\ndifferent sites, and their parameters are aggregated on a central server over\nmultiple iterations. The variation in scanner types and image noise levels\nwithin and across institutions poses additional challenges for federated\nlearning in LCPET denoising. In this study, we propose a novel noise-embedded\nfederated learning diffusion model (Fed-NDIF) to address these challenges,\nleveraging a multicenter dataset and varying count levels. Our approach\nincorporates liver normalized standard deviation (NSTD) noise embedding into a\n2.5D diffusion model and utilizes the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm to\naggregate locally trained models into a global model, which is subsequently\nfine-tuned on local datasets to optimize performance and obtain personalized\nmodels. Extensive validation on datasets from the University of Bern, Ruijin\nHospital in Shanghai, and Yale-New Haven Hospital demonstrates the superior\nperformance of our method in enhancing image quality and improving lesion\nquantification. The Fed-NDIF model shows significant improvements in PSNR,\nSSIM, and NMSE of the entire 3D volume, as well as enhanced lesion\ndetectability and quantification, compared to local diffusion models and\nfederated UNet-based models.",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable acceleration of robotic development through advanced\nsimulation technology, robotic applications are often subject to performance\nreductions in real-world deployment due to the inherent discrepancy between\nsimulation and reality, often referred to as the \"sim-to-real gap\". This gap\narises from factors like model inaccuracies, environmental variations, and\nunexpected disturbances. Similarly, model discrepancies caused by system\ndegradation over time or minor changes in the system's configuration also\nhinder the effectiveness of the developed methodologies. Effectively closing\nthese gaps is critical and remains an open challenge. This work proposes a\nlightweight conformal mapping framework to transfer control and planning\npolicies from an expert teacher to a degraded less capable learner. The method\nleverages Schwarz-Christoffel Mapping (SCM) to geometrically map teacher\ncontrol inputs into the learner's command space, ensuring maneuver consistency.\nTo demonstrate its generality, the framework is applied to two representative\ntypes of control and planning methods in a path-tracking task: 1) a discretized\nmotion primitives command transfer and 2) a continuous Model Predictive Control\n(MPC)-based command transfer. The proposed framework is validated through\nextensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in reducing the sim-to-real gap by closely transferring teacher\ncommands to the learner robot.",

We explore a\nbottom-up part-wise procedure undertaken by an RL agent to segment and\nreconstruct these 2D multipart objects. The environment's state is represented\nas a four-colour image, where different colours correspond to background, a\ntarget edge, a reconstruction line, and the overlap of both. At each step, the\nagent can transform the reconstruction line within a four-dimensional action\nspace or terminate the episode using a specific termination action. To\ninvestigate the impact of reward function formulations, we tested episodic and\nincremental rewards, as well as combined approaches. Empirical results\ndemonstrated that the latter yielded the most effective training performance.\nTo further enhance efficiency and stability, we introduce curriculum learning\nstrategies. First, an action-based curriculum was implemented, where the agent\nwas initially restricted to a reduced action space, being able to only perform\nthree of the five possible actions, before progressing to the full action\nspace. Second, we test a task-based curriculum, where the agent first solves a\nsimplified version of the problem before being presented with the full, more\ncomplex task. This second approach produced promising results, as the agent not\nonly successfully transitioned from learning the simplified task to mastering\nthe full task, but in doing so gained significant performance. This study\ndemonstrates the potential of an iterative RL wire-frame reconstruction in two\ndimensions.

Here we introduce AREPO-IDORT (Implicit Discrete Ordinates Radiation\nTransport), a scheme coupled to the explicit magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver\nin the 3D moving-mesh code AREPO. The discrete ordinates scheme means we\ndirectly solve for the specific intensities along discrete directions. We solve\nthe time-dependent relativistic radiation transport equation via an implicit\nJacobi-like iterative finite-volume solver, which overcomes the small radiation\ntime-steps needed by explicit methods. Compared to commonly-used moment-based\nmethods, e.g. flux-limited diffusion or M1 closure, this scheme has the\nadvantage of correctly capturing the direction of radiation in both\noptically-thick and thin regions. It is based on the scheme by Jiang 2021 for\nthe adaptive mesh refinement code ATHENA++, but we generalize the scheme to\nsupport (1) an unstructured moving-mesh, (2) local time-stepping, and (3)\ngeneral equations of state. We show various test problems that commonly-used\nmoment-based methods fail to reproduce accurately.

    "abstract": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to uncover the inner reasoning\nof machine learning models. In IoT systems, XAI improves the transparency of\nmodels processing sensor data from multiple heterogeneous devices, ensuring\nend-users understand and trust their outputs. Among the many applications, XAI\nhas also been applied to sensor-based Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)\nrecognition in smart homes. Existing approaches highlight which sensor events\nare most important for each predicted activity, using simple rules to convert\nthese events into natural language explanations for non-expert users. However,\nthese methods produce rigid explanations lacking natural language flexibility\nand are not scalable. With the recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), it\nis worth exploring whether they can enhance explanation generation, considering\ntheir proven knowledge of human activities. This paper investigates potential\napproaches to combine XAI and LLMs for sensor-based ADL recognition. We\nevaluate if LLMs can be used: a) as explainable zero-shot ADL recognition\nmodels, avoiding costly labeled data collection, and b) to automate the\ngeneration of explanations for existing data-driven XAI approaches when\ntraining data is available and the goal is higher recognition rates. Our\ncritical evaluation provides insights into the benefits and challenges of using\nLLMs for explainable ADL recognition.",

    "abstract": "The baryonic Tully Fisher relation (bTFR) provides an empirical connection\nbetween baryonic mass and dynamical mass (measured by the maximum rotation\nvelocity) for galaxies. Due to the impact of baryonic feedback in the shallower\npotential wells of dwarf galaxies, the bTFR is predicted to turn down at low\nmasses from the extrapolated power-law relation at high masses. The low-mass\nend of the bTFR is poorly constrained due to small samples and difficulty in\nconnecting the galaxy's gas kinematics to its dark matter halo. Simulations can\nhelp us understand this connection and interpret observations. We measure the\nbTFR with 75 dwarf galaxies from the Marvel-ous and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs\nhydrodynamic simulations. Our sample has M$_\\star = 10^6-10^9$ M$_\\odot$, and\nis mostly gas dominated. We compare five velocity methods:\nV$_\\mathrm{out,circ}$ (spatially resolved mass-enclosed), V$_\\mathrm{out,mid}$\n(spatially resolved midplane gravitational potential), and unresolved HI\nlinewidths at different percentages of the peak flux (W$_\\mathrm{10}$,\nW$_\\mathrm{20}$, and W$_\\mathrm{50}$). We find an intrinsic turndown in the\nbTFR for maximum halo speeds $\\lesssim 50$ km s$^{-1}$, or total baryonic mass\nM$_\\mathrm{bary}\\lesssim 10^{8.5}$ M$_\\odot$. We find that observing HI in\nlower-mass galaxies to the conventional surface density limit of 1 M$_\\odot$\npc$^{-2}$ is not enough to detect a turndown in the bTFR; none of the HI\nvelocity methods, spatially resolved or unresolved, recover the turndown, and\nwe find bTFR slopes consistent with observations of higher-mass galaxies.\nHowever, we predict that the turndown can be recovered by resolved rotation\ncurves if the HI limit is $\\lesssim 0.08$ M$_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, which is within\nthe sensitivity of current HI surveys like FEASTS and MHONGOOSE.",

In this paper, we study superadditivity\nof the operator spectrum in theories expanded about the semi-classical saddle\npoint that dominates correlators of large charge operators. We explore this in\ntwo contexts. The first is a model with two scalar fields that carry different\ncharges, at a non-trivial Wilson-Fisher fixed point. A careful analysis of the\nsemi-classics for this two field model demonstrates that 'quantum' violations\nof superadditivity (those not forbidden by the conjecture) persist in the large\ncharge regime. We then turn to study the general properties of CFTs at large\ncharge as bottom-up EFTs. By a trial and error procedure we come up with a\nseemingly consistent family of examples violating the conjecture. In so doing\nthe presence of a genuine dilaton field appears necessary. On the one hand our\nresult demonstrates that the superadditivity conjecture cannot be proven purely\non the basis of a bottom-up analysis. On the other hand, the need for a\ndilaton, with the corresponding infinite fine tuning, indicates the\nconjecture-violating EFTs are unlikely to be UV completable.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we question whether we have a reliable self-supervised point\ncloud model that can be used for diverse 3D tasks via simple linear probing,\neven with limited data and minimal computation. We find that existing 3D\nself-supervised learning approaches fall short when evaluated on representation\nquality through linear probing. We hypothesize that this is due to what we term\nthe \"geometric shortcut\", which causes representations to collapse to low-level\nspatial features. This challenge is unique to 3D and arises from the sparse\nnature of point cloud data. We address it through two key strategies: obscuring\nspatial information and enhancing the reliance on input features, ultimately\ncomposing a Sonata of 140k point clouds through self-distillation. Sonata is\nsimple and intuitive, yet its learned representations are strong and reliable:\nzero-shot visualizations demonstrate semantic grouping, alongside strong\nspatial reasoning through nearest-neighbor relationships. Sonata demonstrates\nexceptional parameter and data efficiency, tripling linear probing accuracy\n(from 21.8% to 72.5%) on ScanNet and nearly doubling performance with only 1%\nof the data compared to previous approaches. Full fine-tuning further advances\nSOTA across both 3D indoor and outdoor perception tasks.",

    "abstract": "Autoregressive visual generation models typically rely on tokenizers to\ncompress images into tokens that can be predicted sequentially. A fundamental\ndilemma exists in token representation: discrete tokens enable straightforward\nmodeling with standard cross-entropy loss, but suffer from information loss and\ntokenizer training instability; continuous tokens better preserve visual\ndetails, but require complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation\npipeline. In this paper, we propose TokenBridge, which bridges this gap by\nmaintaining the strong representation capacity of continuous tokens while\npreserving the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. To achieve this, we\ndecouple discretization from the tokenizer training process through\npost-training quantization that directly obtains discrete tokens from\ncontinuous representations. Specifically, we introduce a dimension-wise\nquantization strategy that independently discretizes each feature dimension,\npaired with a lightweight autoregressive prediction mechanism that efficiently\nmodel the resulting large token space. Extensive experiments show that our\napproach achieves reconstruction and generation quality on par with continuous\nmethods while using standard categorical prediction. This work demonstrates\nthat bridging discrete and continuous paradigms can effectively harness the\nstrengths of both approaches, providing a promising direction for high-quality\nvisual generation with simple autoregressive modeling.

However, existing methods exhibit\nlimited generalization capabilities across varied applications. While some\ncontemporary foundation models demonstrate potential, they are hindered by\ninsufficient cross-task adaptability and primarily process low-resolution\nimagery of restricted sizes, thus failing to fully exploit high-resolution data\nor leverage comprehensive large-scene semantics. Crucially, remote sensing\nimagery differs fundamentally from natural images, as key foreground targets\n(eg., maritime objects, artificial structures) often occupy minimal spatial\nproportions (~1%) and exhibit sparse distributions. Efficiently modeling\ncross-task generalizable knowledge from lengthy 2D tokens (~100,000) poses a\nsignificant challenge yet remains critical for remote sensing image\nunderstanding. Motivated by the selective attention mechanisms inherent to the\nhuman visual system, we propose DynamicVis, a dynamic visual perception\nfoundation model for remote sensing imagery. The framework integrates a novel\ndynamic region perception backbone based on the selective state space model,\nwhich strategically balances localized detail extraction with global contextual\nintegration, enabling computationally efficient encoding of large-scale data\nwhile maintaining architectural scalability.

In recent\ndays, with the tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs) --\nproprietary and open-source -- researchers have attempted to geolocalize images\nvia LMMs. However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for\nmore specialized downstream tasks, such as geolocalization, LMMs struggle. In\nthis work, we propose solving this problem by introducing a conversational\nmodel, GAEA, that provides information regarding the location of an image as\nthe user requires. No large-scale dataset enabling the training of such a model\nexists. Thus, we propose GAEA-1.4M, a comprehensive dataset comprising over\n800k images and approximately 1.4M question-answer pairs, constructed by\nleveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues. For\nquantitative evaluation, we propose a diverse benchmark, GAEA-Bench, comprising\n3.5k image-text pairs to evaluate conversational capabilities equipped with\ndiverse question types.

Despite achieving superior quality,\n4DGS typically requires substantial storage and suffers from slow rendering\nspeed. In this work, we delve into these issues and identify two key sources of\ntemporal redundancy.

Our analysis reveals emerging trends, including a shift toward more\nrealistic, challenging evaluations with continuously updated benchmarks. We\nalso identify critical gaps that future research must address-particularly in\nassessing cost-efficiency, safety, and robustness, and in developing\nfine-grained, and scalable evaluation methods. This survey maps the rapidly\nevolving landscape of agent evaluation, reveals the emerging trends in the\nfield, identifies current limitations, and proposes directions for future\nresearch.",

The first is the recent evidence from the DESI\nproject and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$\nis evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$<-1$ to a\npresent-day value~$>-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension,\ndescribing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to\nthat expected in the~$\\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically\nnatural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter\nconsists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark\nenergy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark\nmatter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits\na phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in\na slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall\ngrowth of density perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Lindahl equilibrium is a solution concept for allocating a fixed budget\nacross several divisible public goods. It always lies in the weak core, meaning\nthat the equilibrium allocation satisfies desirable stability and proportional\nfairness properties. We consider a model where agents have separable linear\nutility functions over the public goods, and the output assigns to each good an\namount of spending, summing to at most the available budget.\n  In the uncapped setting, each of the public goods can absorb any amount of\nfunding. In this case, it is known that Lindahl equilibrium is equivalent to\nmaximizing Nash social welfare, and this allocation can be computed by a\npublic-goods variant of the proportional response dynamics. We introduce a new\nconvex programming formulation for computing this solution and show that it is\nrelated to Nash welfare maximization through double duality and reformulation.\nWe then show that the proportional response dynamics is equivalent to running\nmirror descent on our new formulation. Our new formulation has similarities to\nShmyrev's convex program for Fisher market equilibrium.\n  In the capped setting, each public good has an upper bound on the amount of\nfunding it can receive, which is a type of constraint that appears in\nfractional committee selection and participatory budgeting. In this setting,\nexistence of Lindahl equilibrium was only known via fixed-point arguments. The\nexistence of an efficient algorithm computing one has been a long-standing open\nquestion. We prove that our new convex program continues to work when the cap\nconstraints are added, and its optimal solutions are Lindahl equilibria. Thus,\nwe establish that approximate Lindahl equilibrium can be efficiently computed.\nOur result also implies that approximately core-stable allocations can be\nefficiently computed for the class of separable piecewise-linear concave (SPLC)\nutilities.",

The imaginary time path\nintegral formalism of Feynman, in which inverse temperature is seen to be a\nWick rotation of time, allows one to write the equilibrium partition function\nof a quantum system in a form isomorphic with the path integral expression for\nthe dynamics. Therefore the self-consistent field theory equations which are\nsolutions to the equilibrium partition function are Wick rotated back into a\nset of dynamic equations, which are shown to give the formula for the quantum\nweak value.

    "abstract": "Benchmark Data Contamination (BDC)-the inclusion of benchmark testing samples\nin the training set-has raised increasing concerns in Large Language Model\n(LLM) evaluation, leading to falsely inflated performance estimates and\nundermining evaluation reliability. To address this, researchers have proposed\nvarious mitigation strategies to update existing benchmarks, including\nmodifying original questions or generating new ones based on them. However, a\nrigorous examination of the effectiveness of these mitigation strategies\nremains lacking. In this paper, we design a systematic and controlled pipeline\nalong with two novel metrics-fidelity and contamination resistance-to provide a\nfine-grained and comprehensive assessment of existing BDC mitigation\nstrategies. Previous assessment methods, such as accuracy drop and accuracy\nmatching, focus solely on aggregate accuracy, often leading to incomplete or\nmisleading conclusions. Our metrics address this limitation by emphasizing\nquestion-level evaluation result matching. Extensive experiments with 10 LLMs,\n5 benchmarks, 20 BDC mitigation strategies, and 2 contamination scenarios\nreveal that no existing strategy significantly improves resistance over the\nvanilla case (i.e., no benchmark update) across all benchmarks, and none\neffectively balances fidelity and contamination resistance. These findings\nunderscore the urgent need for designing more effective BDC mitigation\nstrategies. Our code repository is available at\nhttps://github.com/ASTRAL-Group/BDC_mitigation_assessment.",

    "abstract": "Video diffusion models (VDMs) facilitate the generation of high-quality\nvideos, with current research predominantly concentrated on scaling efforts\nduring training through improvements in data quality, computational resources,\nand model complexity. However, inference-time scaling has received less\nattention, with most approaches restricting models to a single generation\nattempt. Recent studies have uncovered the existence of \"golden noises\" that\ncan enhance video quality during generation. Building on this, we find that\nguiding the scaling inference-time search of VDMs to identify better noise\ncandidates not only evaluates the quality of the frames generated in the\ncurrent step but also preserves the high-level object features by referencing\nthe anchor frame from previous multi-chunks, thereby delivering long-term\nvalue. Our analysis reveals that diffusion models inherently possess flexible\nadjustments of computation by varying denoising steps, and even a one-step\ndenoising approach, when guided by a reward signal, yields significant\nlong-term benefits. Based on the observation, we proposeScalingNoise, a\nplug-and-play inference-time search strategy that identifies golden initial\nnoises for the diffusion sampling process to improve global content consistency\nand visual diversity. Specifically, we perform one-step denoising to convert\ninitial noises into a clip and subsequently evaluate its long-term value,\nleveraging a reward model anchored by previously generated content. Moreover,\nto preserve diversity, we sample candidates from a tilted noise distribution\nthat up-weights promising noises. In this way, ScalingNoise significantly\nreduces noise-induced errors, ensuring more coherent and spatiotemporally\nconsistent video generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed ScalingNoise effectively improves long video\ngeneration.",

To address\nthis, we propose a framework for scoring imprecise forecasts -- forecasts given\nas a set of beliefs. Despite existing impossibility results for deterministic\nscoring rules, we enable truthful elicitation by drawing connection to social\nchoice theory and introducing a two-way communication framework where DMs first\nshare their aggregation rules (e.g., averaging or min-max) used in downstream\ndecisions for resolving forecast ambiguity. This, in turn, helps forecasters\nresolve indecision during elicitation.

First we show that the\nlow frequency dispersion of phonons in AHC, despite the presence of Berry\ncurvature, resembles that of the zero field (rather than finite magnetic field)\nWigner crystal due to the commutation of translation generators. We explain how\nkey parameters of the phonon theory such as elastic constants and effective\nmass can be extracted from microscopic models, and apply them to two families\nof models: the recently introduced $\\lambda$-jellium model and a model of\nrhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG). In the $\\lambda$-jellium model, we\nexplore the energy landscape as crystal geometry shifts, revealing that AHC can\nbecome \"soft\" under certain conditions. This causes transitions in lattice\ngeometry, although the quantized Hall response remains unchanged. Surprisingly,\nthe Berry curvature seems to enhance the effective mass, leading to a reduction\nin phonon speed. For the AHC in RMG, we obtain estimates of phonon speed and\nshear stiffness. We also identify a previously overlooked \"kineo-elastic\" term\nin the phonon effective action that is present in the symmetry setting of RMG,\nand leads to dramatic differences in phonon speeds in opposite directions.

Similarly, a radial dependent\nmass bias, as in the case of masses inferred under the hydrostatic equilibrium\n(HE) hypothesis, can affect sparsity estimates.

To facilitate this task, we curate\nNuiScene43, a small but high-quality set of scenes, preprocessed for joint\ntraining. Notably, when trained on scenes of varying styles, our model can\nblend different environments, such as rural houses and city skyscrapers, within\nthe same scene, highlighting the potential of our curation process to leverage\nheterogeneous scenes for joint training.",

    "abstract": "In this work we unify two existing lines of work towards cache analysis for\nnon-LRU policies. To this end, we extend the notion of competitiveness to block\ncompetitiveness and systematically analyze the competitiveness and block\ncompetitiveness of FIFO and MRU relative to LRU for arbitrary associativities.\nWe show how competitiveness and block competitiveness can be exploited in\nstate-of-the-art WCET analysis based on the results of existing persistence\nanalyses for LRU. Unlike prior work, our approach is applicable to\nmicroarchitectures that exhibit timing anomalies. We experimentally evaluate\nthe precision and cost of our approach on benchmarks from TACLeBench.

    "abstract": "Efimov resonances in the three-body loss rate have been observed in ultracold\nheteronuclear gases near interspecies Feshbach resonances. However, the\nintraspecies scattering length $a_\\text{BB}$ has been assumed to have a\nnegligible effect on the overall Efimov scenario, namely, on the locations of\nthe Efimov resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ and, consequently, on the three-body\nparameter (3BP). The present Letter analyzes the influence of $a_\\text{BB}$ on\nthe Efimov resonance positions $a_{-}^{(n)}$, particularly the 3BP, in\nEfimov-unfavored systems. Using van der Waals interactions described by\nseparable $s$-wave potentials, the unitarity energy spectrum\n($|a_\\text{BX}|\\rightarrow\\infty$) and the Efimov resonance positions\n$a_{-}^{(n)}$ for $^{23}\\text{Na}_2^{40}\\text{K}$ are mapped out in\n$a_\\text{BB}$. It is found that both the magnitude and sign of $a_\\text{BB}$\ncan significantly impact the resonances $a_{-}^{(n)}$ in Efimov-unfavored\nsystems, with the 3BP taking an observable value when $a_\\text{BB}<0$.",

    "abstract": "Studies of iCVD kinetics often make assumptions about the iCVD vapor phase\nthat have been challenging to validate experimentally. We address this gap by\ninvestigating heat transfer and mixing in the iCVD reactor using in-situ gas\ncomposition sensing. Our work allows practitioners of iCVD to estimate the\ndegree of mixing and temperature profile in the vapor phase based on reactor\ndimensions and process variables such as chamber pressure. We begin by using\ndimensional analysis to simplify the parameter space governing heat transfer\nand mixing, identifying key dimensionless groups that capture the dominant\nphysics. We find that the degree of mixing in the reactor is primarily\ndetermined by the Peclet number (Pe), and heat transfer is primarily determined\nby the Knudsen number (Kn). Multiphysics simulations of the iCVD reactor\nprovide visualizations of non-ideal mixing and allow us to identify the\ncritical Pe above which the well-mixed assumption may begin to break down. To\nverify that the well-mixed assumption applies to iCVD at low Pe, we measured\nthe residence time distribution (RTD) for argon and isopropanol flowing at 1\nsccm, finding a close match to the well-mixed model. We used a Pirani pressure\ngauge for composition sensing to measure the RTD. We demonstrate the Pirani\ngauge to be a precise gas composition sensor, which is more modular and less\nexpensive than methods like in-situ infrared spectroscopy and mass\nspectrometry. We then address heat transfer by measuring thermal diffusion from\nthe filament at a range of pressures in argon and isopropanol. We quantified\nthe effects of non-ideal heat transfer at low pressures and identified a\ncritical Kn, above which heat transfer is independent of pressure. Measurement\nof thermally driven pressure changes in batch mode enables us to define and\nmodel an \"effective temperature\" for the reactor, matching the thermal\ndiffusion model.",

This means that for dwarf\ngalaxies of similar stellar mass, the GCs have a similar median extent;\nhowever, their distribution is different from the field stars of their host.\nAdditionally, low surface brightness and diffuse dwarf galaxies on average have\na higher $N_{\\rm GC}$ than high surface brightness and compact dwarf galaxies\nat any given stellar mass.

Here, we design and\ndemonstrate a backscatter device consisting of a flattened Luneburg lens\ncombined with a spatially-tunable dynamic metasurface. Using quasi-conformal\ntransformation optics (QCTO), we design a flattened, additively manufactured\nLuneburg lens that focuses incoming waves over a wide field-of-view onto its\nflattened focal plane. When a reflective surface is placed at the focal plane,\nthe flattened Luneburg lens retroreflects, enabling long-range backscatter\ncommunications over an extremely large field-of-view ($\\pm30\\degree$) and\nbandwidth. The dynamic metasurface is designed to modulated the reflected phase\nacross the S-band (2-4 GHz) with fine spatial control. Thus, when combined with\nthe flattened Luneburg lens, the device is able to modulate the retroreflected\nsignal to achieve backscatter communications. We experimentally demonstrate\nfull phase control of the backscattered signal across a range of incidence\nangles, spatial multiplexing, and secure communications against eavesdroppers\nby actively suppressing or randomizing signals in unwanted directions. The\nmetasurface-backed Luneburg lens device offers a low-power solution for\nlong-range wireless networks with advanced capabilities.",

Visual Language Action (VLA) models, pretrained on\nlarge-scale web datasets, have shown promise in decision-making tasks.

This enhancement improves the models' capabilities in\nworld knowledge, visual recognition, and spatial grounding in open-world\nenvironments.

Our\nexperiments demonstrate that post-training on non-trajectory tasks leads to a\nsignificant 40% improvement over the best agent baseline on a diverse set of\natomic tasks.

However, current QUBO-based Quantum\nSVM (QSVM) methods rely solely on binary optimal solutions, limiting their\nability to identify fuzzy boundaries in data. Additionally, the limited qubit\ncount in contemporary quantum devices constrains training on larger datasets.\nIn this paper, we propose a probabilistic quantum SVM training framework\nsuitable for Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs). By formulating the SVM training\nproblem as a QUBO model, we leverage CIMs' energy minimization capabilities and\nintroduce a Boltzmann distribution-based probabilistic approach to better\napproximate optimal SVM solutions, enhancing robustness. To address qubit\nlimitations, we employ batch processing and multi-batch ensemble strategies,\nenabling small-scale quantum devices to train SVMs on larger datasets and\nsupport multi-class classification tasks via a one-vs-one approach. Our method\nis validated through simulations and real-machine experiments on binary and\nmulti-class datasets. On the banknote binary classification dataset, our\nCIM-based QSVM, utilizing an energy-based probabilistic approach, achieved up\nto 20% higher accuracy compared to the original QSVM, while training up to\n$10^4$ times faster than simulated annealing methods. Compared with classical\nSVM, our approach either matched or reduced training time. On the IRIS\nthree-class dataset, our improved QSVM outperformed existing QSVM models in all\nkey metrics.

Using Lyra, we were able to train and run\nevery task in this study on two or fewer GPUs in under two hours, democratizing\naccess to biological sequence modeling at SOTA performance, with potential\napplications to many fields.",

However, their growing\nsize necessitates backbone extraction techniques aimed at reducing their size\nwhile retaining critical features. In practice, selecting, implementing, and\nevaluating the most suitable backbone extraction method may be challenging.\nThis paper introduces netbone, a Python package designed for assessing the\nperformance of backbone extraction techniques in weighted networks. Its\ncomparison framework is the standout feature of netbone. Indeed, the tool\nincorporates state-of-the-art backbone extraction techniques. Furthermore, it\nprovides a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics allowing users to evaluate\ndifferent backbones techniques. We illustrate the flexibility and effectiveness\nof netbone through the US air transportation network analysis. We compare the\nperformance of different backbone extraction techniques using the evaluation\nmetrics. We also show how users can integrate a new backbone extraction method\ninto the comparison framework. netbone is publicly available as an open-source\ntool, ensuring its accessibility to researchers and practitioners. Promoting\nstandardized evaluation practices contributes to the advancement of backbone\nextraction techniques and fosters reproducibility and comparability in research\nefforts.

    "abstract": "Efficient processing of long contexts has been a persistent pursuit in\nNatural Language Processing. With the growing number of long documents,\ndialogues, and other textual data, it is important to develop Long Context\nLanguage Models (LCLMs) that can process and analyze extensive inputs in an\neffective and efficient way. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey\non recent advances in long-context modeling for large language models. Our\nsurvey is structured around three key aspects: how to obtain effective and\nefficient LCLMs, how to train and deploy LCLMs efficiently, and how to evaluate\nand analyze LCLMs comprehensively. For the first aspect, we discuss data\nstrategies, architectural designs, and workflow approaches oriented with long\ncontext processing. For the second aspect, we provide a detailed examination of\nthe infrastructure required for LCLM training and inference. For the third\naspect, we present evaluation paradigms for long-context comprehension and\nlong-form generation, as well as behavioral analysis and mechanism\ninterpretability of LCLMs. Beyond these three key aspects, we thoroughly\nexplore the diverse application scenarios where existing LCLMs have been\ndeployed and outline promising future development directions.

However, we lack an understanding of how factors such as\nenvironmental demands, or the available sensory information simultaneously\ninfluence these control timescales. To address this, we present a unified\ndata-driven framework to quantify the control timescales by identifying how\nearly we can predict future actions from past inputs. We apply this framework\nacross tasks including walking and running, environmental contexts including\ntreadmill, overground, and varied terrains, and sensory input modalities\nincluding gaze fixations and body states. We find that deep neural network\narchitectures that effectively handle long-range dependencies, specifically\nGated Recurrent Units and Transformers, outperform other architectures and\nwidely used linear models when predicting future actions. Our framework reveals\nthe factors that influence locomotor foot placement control timescales. Across\nenvironmental contexts, we discover that humans rely more on fast timescale\ncontrol in more complex terrain. Across input modalities, we find a hierarchy\nof control timescales where gaze predicts foot placement before full-body\nstates, which predict before center-of-mass states. Our model also identifies\nmid-swing as a critical phase when the swing foot's state predicts its future\nplacement, with this timescale adapting across environments.

The primary modifications to the conventional\ndesign include spectrometer electrode geometries with small cross section\nexposed to the scattered photons, with blocked pathways for photoelectrons from\nthe electrodes to the detector, as well as the incorporation of optical\nbaffles. Compared to a conventional design optimized solely on the\nspectrometer's photoelectron momentum resolution, we have achieved the\nelimination of 99.9 \\% of the background noise without substantial compromise\nto the resolution. Note that most of the improvements were achieved without the\nnecessity of high-grade windows, reducing the sensitivity to window degradation\nby UV light. We give general guidelines on efficiently coping with the\nlong-standing experimental problem of electron background originating from\nscattered light by considering it already in the design stage of a new\nspectrometer.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive novel view synthesis\nperformance. While conventional methods require per-scene optimization, more\nrecently several feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate\npixel-aligned Gaussian representations with a learnable network, which are\ngeneralizable to different scenes. However, these methods simply combine\npixel-aligned Gaussians from multiple views as scene representations, thereby\nleading to artifacts and extra memory cost without fully capturing the\nrelations of Gaussians from different images. In this paper, we propose\nGaussian Graph Network (GGN) to generate efficient and generalizable Gaussian\nrepresentations. Specifically, we construct Gaussian Graphs to model the\nrelations of Gaussian groups from different views. To support message passing\nat Gaussian level, we reformulate the basic graph operations over Gaussian\nrepresentations, enabling each Gaussian to benefit from its connected Gaussian\ngroups with Gaussian feature fusion. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian pooling\nlayer to aggregate various Gaussian groups for efficient representations. We\nconduct experiments on the large-scale RealEstate10K and ACID datasets to\ndemonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method. Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods, our model uses fewer Gaussians and achieves better\nimage quality with higher rendering speed.",

For small-bandgap SWNTs, PCET-doping is sufficient to\nreach the maximum thermoelectric power factors, which are equal to those\nobtained by conventional methods. In contrast to other doping methods, the\nelectrical conductivity of PCET-doped SWNTs remains stable over at least 5 days\nin air.

Speedups ranging from 8x to\n1,000x over XFoil are demonstrated, after controlling for equivalent accuracy.\nNeuralFoil computes both global and local quantities (lift, drag, velocity\ndistribution, etc.) over a broad input space, including: an 18-dimensional\nspace of airfoil shapes, possibly including control deflections; a 360 degree\nrange of angles of attack; Reynolds numbers from $10^2$ to $10^{10}$; subsonic\nflows up to the transonic drag rise; and with varying turbulence parameters.\nResults match those of XFoil closely: the mean relative error of drag is 0.37%\non simple cases, and remains as low as 2.0% on a test dataset with numerous\npost-stall and transitional cases. NeuralFoil facilitates gradient-based design\noptimization, due to its $C^\\infty$-continuous solutions,\nautomatic-differentiation-compatibility, and bounded computational cost without\nnon-convergence issues.\n  NeuralFoil is a hybrid of physics-informed machine learning techniques and\nanalytical models. Here, physics information includes symmetries that are\nstructurally embedded into the model architecture, feature engineering using\ndomain knowledge, and guaranteed extrapolation to known limit cases. This work\nalso introduces a new approach for surrogate model uncertainty quantification\nthat enables robust design optimization.\n  This work discusses the methodology and performance of NeuralFoil with\nseveral case studies, including a practical airfoil design optimization study\nincluding both aerodynamic and non-aerodynamic constraints. Here, NeuralFoil\noptimization is able to produce airfoils nearly identical in performance and\nshape to expert-designed airfoils within seconds; these\ncomputationally-optimized airfoils provide a useful starting point for further\nexpert refinement.",

However, training models for high-resolution image generation remains\nchallenging, particularly when training data and computational resources are\nlimited. In this paper, we explore this practical problem from two key\nperspectives: data and parameter efficiency, and propose a set of key\nguidelines for ultra-resolution adaptation termed \\emph{URAE}. For data\nefficiency, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that synthetic data\ngenerated by some teacher models can significantly promote training\nconvergence. For parameter efficiency, we find that tuning minor components of\nthe weight matrices outperforms widely-used low-rank adapters when synthetic\ndata are unavailable, offering substantial performance gains while maintaining\nefficiency. Additionally, for models leveraging guidance distillation, such as\nFLUX, we show that disabling classifier-free guidance, \\textit{i.e.}, setting\nthe guidance scale to 1 during adaptation, is crucial for satisfactory\nperformance. Extensive experiments validate that URAE achieves comparable\n2K-generation performance to state-of-the-art closed-source models like FLUX1.1\n[Pro] Ultra with only 3K samples and 2K iterations, while setting new\nbenchmarks for 4K-resolution generation.

Fan et al. (2012) introduced a curve-free Bayesian\ndecision-theoretic design (CFBD), which leverages the assumption of a monotonic\ndose-toxicity relationship without directly modeling dose-toxicity curves. This\napproach has also been extended to drug combinations for determining the MTD\n(Lee et al., 2017). Although CFBD has demonstrated improved trial efficiency by\nusing fewer patients while maintaining high accuracy in identifying the MTD, it\nmay artificially inflate the effective sample sizes for the updated prior\ndistributions, particularly at the lowest and highest dose levels. This can\nlead to either overshooting or undershooting the target dose. In this paper, we\npropose a modification to CFBD's prior distribution updates that balances\neffective sample sizes across different doses. Simulation results show that\nwith the modified prior specification, CFBD achieves a more focused dose\nallocation at the MTD and offers more precise dose recommendations with fewer\npatients on average.

A crucial step toward successfully\nsolving an issue is creating a test case that accurately reproduces the issue.\nSuch a test case can guide the search for an appropriate patch and help\nvalidate whether the patch matches the issue's intent. However, existing\ntechniques for issue reproduction show only moderate success. This paper\npresents Issue2Test, an LLM-based technique for automatically generating a\nreproducing test case for a given issue report. Unlike automated regression\ntest generators, which aim at creating passing tests, our approach aims at a\ntest that fails, and that fails specifically for the reason described in the\nissue. To this end, Issue2Test performs three steps: (1) understand the issue\nand gather context (e.g., related files and project-specific guidelines)\nrelevant for reproducing it; (2) generate a candidate test case; and (3)\niteratively refine the test case based on compilation and runtime feedback\nuntil it fails and the failure aligns with the problem described in the issue.\nWe evaluate Issue2Test on the SWT-bench-lite dataset, where it successfully\nreproduces 30.4 of the issues, achieving a 40.1% relative improvement over the\nbest existing technique.

Across surgical tasks, xvr achieves\nsubmillimeter-accurate registration at intraoperative speeds, improving upon\nexisting methods by an order of magnitude. xvr is released as open-source\nsoftware freely available at https://github.com/eigenvivek/xvr.",

For each $k$, this induces a dominance\nrelation between dice, with $A[k]\\succ B[k]$ if $A$ is more likely than $B$ to\nwin after $k$ rolls, and vice versa. For certain classes of dice, the limiting\nbehavior of these relations is well-established in the literature, but the\ntransient behavior, the subject of this paper, is less well-understood.

While recent advancements have shown promising results in\ngenerating high-resolution 3D shapes, VDM still struggles with high-speed\ngeneration. Challenges exist because of difficulties not only in accelerating\ndiffusion sampling but also VAE decoding in VDM, areas under-explored in\nprevious works. To address these challenges, we present FlashVDM, a systematic\nframework for accelerating both VAE and DiT in VDM. For DiT, FlashVDM enables\nflexible diffusion sampling with as few as 5 inference steps and comparable\nquality, which is made possible by stabilizing consistency distillation with\nour newly introduced Progressive Flow Distillation. For VAE, we introduce a\nlightning vecset decoder equipped with Adaptive KV Selection, Hierarchical\nVolume Decoding, and Efficient Network Design. By exploiting the locality of\nthe vecset and the sparsity of shape surface in the volume, our decoder\ndrastically lowers FLOPs, minimizing the overall decoding overhead. We apply\nFlashVDM to Hunyuan3D-2 to obtain Hunyuan3D-2 Turbo. Through systematic\nevaluation, we show that our model significantly outperforms existing fast 3D\ngeneration methods, achieving comparable performance to the state-of-the-art\nwhile reducing inference time by over 45x for reconstruction and 32x for\ngeneration.

The\ndissipation of magnetic waves and direct electric currents are likely to be the\nmost significant processes for heating the corona, but a lively debate exists\non their relative roles. Here, we suggest that the two are often intrinsically\nlinked, since magnetic waves may trigger current dissipation, and impulsive\nreconnection can launch magnetic waves. We present a study of the first of\nthese processes by using a 2D physics-based numerical simulation using the\nAdaptive Mesh Refined (AMR) Versatile Advection Code (VAC). Magnetic waves such\nas fast magnetoacoustic waves are often observed to propagate in the\nlarge-scale corona and interact with local magnetic structures. The present\nnumerical simulations show how the propagation of magnetic disturbances towards\na null point or separator can lead to the accumulation of the electric\ncurrents. Lorentz forces can laterally push and vertically stretch the magnetic\nfields, forming a current sheet with a strong magnetic-field gradient. The\nmagnetic field lines then break and reconnect, and so contribute towards\ncoronal heating. Numerical results are presented that support these ideas and\nsupport the concept of a symbiosis between waves and reconnection in heating\nthe solar corona.",

    "abstract": "Unmixing is a fundamental process in hyperspectral image processing in which\nthe materials present in a mixed pixel are determined based on the spectra of\ncandidate materials and the pixel spectrum. Practical and general utility\nrequires a large spectral library with sample measurements covering the full\nvariation in each candidate material as well as a sufficiently varied\ncollection of potential materials. However, any spectral library with more\nspectra than bands will lead to an ill-posed inversion problem when using\nclassical least-squares regression-based unmixing methods. Moreover, for\nnumerical and dimensionality reasons, libraries with over 10 or 20 spectra\nbehave computationally as though they are ill-posed. In current practice,\nunmixing is often applied to imagery using manually-selected materials or image\nendmembers. General unmixing of a spectrum from an unknown material with a\nlarge spectral library requires some form of sparse regression; regression\nwhere only a small number of coefficients are nonzero. This requires a\ntrade-off between goodness-of-fit and model size. In this study we compare\nvariations of two sparse regression techniques, focusing on the relationship\nbetween structure and chemistry of materials and the accuracy of the various\nmodels for identifying the correct mixture of materials present. Specifically,\nwe examine LASSO regression and ElasticNet in contrast with variations of\niterative feature selection, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), and quadratic BMA\n(BMA-Q) -- incorporating LASSO regression and ElasticNet as their base model.\nTo evaluate the the effectiveness of these methods, we consider the molecular\ncomposition similarities and differences of substances selected in the models\ncompared to the ground truth.",

In turn, the demographic profile of\nPWH has shifted. Older persons comprise an ever-increasing percentage of PWH,\nwith this percentage expected to further increase in the coming years. This has\nprofound implications for HIV treatment and care, as significant resources are\nrequired not only to manage HIV itself, but associated age-related\ncomorbidities and health conditions that occur in aging PWH. Effective\nmanagement of these challenges in the coming years requires accurate modeling\nof the PWH age structure. In the present work, we introduce several novel\nmathematical approaches related to this problem. We present a workflow\ncombining a PDE model for the PWH population age structure, into which\npublicly-available HIV surveillance data is assimilated using the Ensemble\nKalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm. This procedure allows us to rigorously\nreconstruct the age-dependent mortality trends for PWH over the last several\ndecades. To project future trends, we introduce and analyze a novel variant of\nthe Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), nonnegative DMD. We show that nonnegative\nDMD provides physically-consistent projections of mortality and HIV diagnosis\nwhile remaining purely data-driven, and not requiring additional assumptions.\nWe then combine these elements to provide forecasts for future trends in PWDH\nmortality and demographic evolution in the coming years.",

    "abstract": "SQG describes the 2D active transport of a scalar field, such as temperature,\nwhich -- when properly rescaled -- shares the same physical dimension of\nlength/time as the advecting velocity field. This duality has motivated\nanalogies with 3D turbulence. In particular, the Kraichnan-Leith-Batchelor\nsimilarity theory predicts a Kolmogorov-type inertial range scaling $\\propto\n(\\varepsilon \\ell)^{1/3}$ for both scalar and velocity fields, and the presence\nof intermittency was pointed out by Sukhatme & Pierrehumbert ($Chaos$\n$\\boldsymbol{12}$, 439, 2002) in unforced settings. In this work, we refine\nthese analogies using simulations up to $16,384^2$ collocation points in a\nsteady-state regime dominated by the direct cascade of scalar variance. We show\nthat mixed structure functions, linking velocity increments with powers of\nscalar differences, exhibit clear scaling, revealing the role of anomalous\nfluxes of all the scalar moments. However, the usual (unmixed) structure\nfunctions do no follow any power-law scaling in any range of scales, neither\nfor the velocity nor for the scalar increments. This specific form of the\nintermittency phenomenon reflects the specific kinematic properties of SQG\nturbulence, involving the interplay between long-range interactions, structures\nand geometry. Revealing the multiscaling in single-field statistics requires to\nresort to generalised notions of scale invariance, such as extended\nself-similarity and specific form of refined self-similarity. Our findings\nemphasise the fundamental entanglement of scalar and velocity fields in SQG\nturbulence: They evolve hand in hand and any attempt to isolate them destroys\nscaling in its usual sense. This perspective sheds new lights on the\ndiscrepancies in spectra and structure functions, that have been repeatedly\nobserved in SQG numerics for the past 20 years.",

Thus, early and accurate\ndetection of metabolic brain network impairments is crucial for AD management.\nChief to identifying such impairments is FDG-PET data. Despite advancements,\nmost graph-based studies using FDG-PET data rely on group-level analysis or\nthresholding. Yet, group-level analysis can veil individual differences and\nthresholding may overlook weaker but biologically critical brain connections.\nAdditionally, machine learning-based AD prediction largely focuses on\nunivariate outcomes, such as disease status.

While it is known that learning\ndynamics converge to Nash equilibrium in potential games, the behavior of\ndynamics in many important classes of games that do not admit a potential is\npoorly understood. To measure how ''close'' a game is to being potential, we\nconsider a distance function, that we call ''potentialness'', and which relies\non a strategic decomposition of games introduced by Candogan et al. (2011). We\nintroduce a numerical framework enabling the computation of this metric, which\nwe use to calculate the degree of ''potentialness'' in generic matrix games, as\nwell as (non-generic) games that are important in economic applications, namely\nauctions and contests. Understanding learning in the latter games has become\nincreasingly important due to the wide-spread automation of bidding and pricing\nwith no-regret learning algorithms. We empirically show that potentialness\ndecreases and concentrates with an increasing number of agents or actions; in\naddition, potentialness turns out to be a good predictor for the existence of\npure Nash equilibria and the convergence of no-regret learning algorithms in\nmatrix games. In particular, we observe that potentialness is very low for\ncomplete-information models of the all-pay auction where no pure Nash\nequilibrium exists, and much higher for Tullock contests, first-, and\nsecond-price auctions, explaining the success of learning in the latter. In the\nincomplete-information version of the all-pay auction, a pure Bayes-Nash\nequilibrium exists and it can be learned with gradient-based algorithms.\nPotentialness nicely characterizes these differences to the\ncomplete-information version.",

However, despite the critical\nrole of 3D structural generation and understanding (3D GU) in AI for science,\nthese tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods\nremaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified\nframework that seamlessly integrates 3D GU tasks via autoregressive prediction.\nAt its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses\n3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It\nthen applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details,\ncapturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in\nmicroscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance\nefficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression\nstrategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a\nmasked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token\npositions, significantly boosting model performance. By combining these\nstrategies, Uni-3DAR successfully unifies diverse 3D GU tasks within a single\nautoregressive framework. Extensive experiments across multiple microscopic 3D\nGU tasks, including molecules, proteins, polymers, and crystals, validate its\neffectiveness and versatility. Notably, Uni-3DAR surpasses previous\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models by a substantial margin, achieving up to\n256\\% relative improvement while delivering inference speeds up to 21.8x\nfaster.

In this work, we employ a two-level system (qubit) as a\nprobe, which is coupled to a structured reservoir consisting of an ancilla\nqubit and a Markovian environment modeled as a thermal bath. By exploiting\nnon-Markovian dynamics, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of\ndifferent interaction types between the probe and ancilla for estimating\ncritical parameters, including temperature, ancilla frequency, and system-bath\ncoupling strength.

However, the performance of these interactions\nis contingent on the parameter under estimation and the operational regime. For\ninstance, certain interactions become prominent in the transient regime but\nexhibit diminished utility in the steady state, whereas others maintain their\neffectiveness even at equilibrium.

However,\ndue to the thousands of visual tokens from the video frames, key-value (KV)\ncache can significantly increase memory requirements, becoming a bottleneck for\ninference speed and memory usage. KV cache quantization is a widely used\napproach to address this problem. In this paper, we find that 2-bit KV\nquantization of VideoLLMs can hardly hurt the model performance, while the\nlimit of KV cache quantization in even lower bits has not been investigated. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce VidKV, a plug-and-play KV cache quantization\nmethod to compress the KV cache to lower than 2 bits. Specifically, (1) for\nkey, we propose a mixed-precision quantization strategy in the channel\ndimension, where we perform 2-bit quantization for anomalous channels and 1-bit\nquantization combined with FFT for normal channels; (2) for value, we implement\n1.58-bit quantization while selectively filtering semantically salient visual\ntokens for targeted preservation, for a better trade-off between precision and\nmodel performance. Importantly, our findings suggest that the value cache of\nVideoLLMs should be quantized in a per-channel fashion instead of the per-token\nfashion proposed by prior KV cache quantization works for LLMs. Empirically,\nextensive results with LLaVA-OV-7B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B on six benchmarks show\nthat VidKV effectively compresses the KV cache to 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit\nprecision with almost no performance drop compared to the FP16 counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) increasingly rely on Federated Learning (FL) to\nenhance perception models while preserving privacy. However, existing FL\nframeworks struggle to balance privacy, fairness, and robustness, leading to\nperformance disparities across demographic groups. Privacy-preserving\ntechniques like differential privacy mitigate data leakage risks but worsen\nfairness by restricting access to sensitive attributes needed for bias\ncorrection. This work explores the trade-off between privacy and fairness in\nFL-based object detection for AVs and introduces RESFL, an integrated solution\noptimizing both. RESFL incorporates adversarial privacy disentanglement and\nuncertainty-guided fairness-aware aggregation. The adversarial component uses a\ngradient reversal layer to remove sensitive attributes, reducing privacy risks\nwhile maintaining fairness. The uncertainty-aware aggregation employs an\nevidential neural network to weight client updates adaptively, prioritizing\ncontributions with lower fairness disparities and higher confidence. This\nensures robust and equitable FL model updates. We evaluate RESFL on the FACET\ndataset and CARLA simulator, assessing accuracy, fairness, privacy resilience,\nand robustness under varying conditions. RESFL improves detection accuracy,\nreduces fairness disparities, and lowers privacy attack success rates while\ndemonstrating superior robustness to adversarial conditions compared to other\napproaches.",

The existence of new fundamental constituents of matter beyond the SM is\nof great importance for our understanding of Nature. In this context, indirect\n(non-resonant) indications for new scalar bosons were found in the data from\nthe first run of the LHC, taken between 2010 and 2012 at CERN: an excess in the\ninvariant mass of muon-electron pairs, consistent with a new Higgs boson ($S$)\nwith a mass of $150\\pm5$ GeV. Other processes with multiple leptons in the\nfinal state, moderate missing energy, and possibly (bottom quark) jets exhibit\ndeviations from the SM predictions. These anomalies can be explained within a\nsimplified model in which a new heavy Higgs boson $H$ decays into two lighter\nHiggses $S$. This lighter Higgs $S$ subsequently decays to $W$ bosons, bottom\nquarks and has also an invisible decay mode.\n  Here, we demonstrate that using this model we can identify narrow excesses in\ndi-photon and $Z$-photon spectra around 152 GeV. By incorporating the latest\nmeasurements of di-photons in association with leptons, we obtain a combined\nglobal significance of $5.4\\sigma$. This represents the highest significance\never reported for an excess consistent with a narrow resonance beyond the SM\n(BSM) in high-energy proton-proton collision data at the LHC.

The initial conditions are\ncharacterized by four non-dimensional numbers describing the statistical\nproperties of random-phase multi-mode perturbations of an initial diffuse\ninterface. Based on high-fidelity data, a surrogate physics-informed neural\nnetwork is used to extrapolate the dynamics to very late times and unseen\ninitial conditions, beyond the reach of simulations. This enables uncertainty\nand global sensitivity analyses to be carried out, revealing the influence of\ninitial conditions in the late-time regime. While the results support the idea\nof a universal self-similar growth rate, the virtual time origin is found to be\nstrongly sensitive to the initial Reynolds, perturbation steepness and\nbandwidth numbers. An analytical model based on the phenomenology of\nRayleigh-Taylor mixing layers explains most of this dependency, and provide\naccurate predictions for the virtual time origin.

Its prompt and afterglow emissions place it between\nlong gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) and low-luminosity GRBs (LLGRBs). The event is\nfollowed by a fast optical transient (AT 2024gsa), initially exhibiting a\nthermal-like spectrum but later evolving into an unusually red peak at $\\sim\n3-5$ days, which is difficult to explain with thermal emission. Using our\ngeneralized analytic framework for jet propagation in a circumstellar material\n(CSM; Hamidani et al. 2025), we explore a scenario in which a conventional LGRB\njet is launched in a progenitor surrounded by a dense CSM. For a CSM of $\\sim\n0.03 M_\\odot$ extending to $\\sim 3\\times 10^{13}$ cm, we find that the jet is\nsignificantly weakened before breaking out, becoming \"barely failed\", an\nintermediate state between successful (LGRB) and completely failed (LLGRB)\njets. This scenario naturally explains EP240414a's multi-wavelength\nobservations, with the early thermal component produced by cocoon cooling\nemission, and the red peak explained by non-thermal afterglow emission from the\nmildly relativistic barely failed jet (and its inner-cocoon). Our work\ndemonstrates the important role of extended CSM in shaping GRB jets and\nillustrates how early multi-wavelength follow-up observations can reveal the\nphysically diverse nature of jet-driven transients.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation telescopes will bring groundbreaking discoveries but they\nwill also present new technological challenges. The Square Kilometre Array\nObservatory (SKAO) will be one of the most demanding scientific\ninfrastructures, with a projected data output of 700 PB per year to be\ndistributed to a network of SKA Regional Centres. Current tools are not fully\nsuited to manage such massive data volumes, therefore, new research is required\nto transform science archives from data providers into service providers. In\nthis paper we examine how a science archive can deliver advanced visualisation\ncapabilities for the SKA science archive. In particular, we have conducted a\nthorough exploration of existing visualisation software for astronomy and other\nfields to identify tools capable of addressing Big Data requirements. Using\nselected technologies, we have developed a prototype archive that provides\naccess to interactive visualisations of 3D radio data through web-based\ninterfaces, adhering to International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA)\nrecommendations to favour interoperability and Open Science practices. In\naddition, we discuss how current IVOA recommendations support these\nvisualisation capabilities and how they could be expanded. Our prototype\narchive includes a service to generate 3D models on the fly as a server\noperation, enabling remote visualisations in a flexible manner; for instance, a\nset of parameters can be used to customise the models and their visualisation.\nWe have used SKA precursor and pathfinder data to test its usability and\nscalability, concluding that remote visualisation is a viable solution for\nhandling high-volume data. However, our prototype is constrained by memory\nlimitations, requiring techniques to reduce memory usage.",

    "abstract": "In model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems, solving optimization\nproblems efficiently and with guarantees on worst-case computational complexity\nis critical to satisfy the real-time constraints in these applications. These\noptimization problems often take the form of mixed-integer linear programs\n(MILPs) or mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) that depend on system\nparameters. A common approach for solving such problems is the branch-and-bound\n(B&B) method. This paper extends existing complexity certification methods by\npresenting a unified complexity-certification framework for B&B-based MILP and\nMIQP solvers, specifically for the family of multi-parametric MILP and MIQP\nproblems that arise in, e.g., hybrid MPC applications. The framework provides\nguarantees on worst-case computational measures, including the maximum number\nof iterations or relaxations B&B algorithms require to reach optimality. It\nsystematically accounts for different branching and node selection strategies,\nas well as heuristics integrated into B&B, ensuring a comprehensive\ncertification framework. By offering theoretical guarantees and practical\ninsights for solver customization, the proposed framework enhances the\nreliability of B&B for real-time application. The usefulness of the proposed\nframework is demonstrated through numerical experiments on both random MILPs\nand MIQPs, as well as on MIQPs arising from a hybrid MPC problem.",

The WS$_{2}$ is supported on hBN and contains a section that is exposed\nto vacuum and another section that is encapsulated by a graphene contact. We\ndirectly observe the doping-induced semiconductor-metal transition and band gap\nrenormalization in the two sections of WS$_2$. Surprisingly, a larger band gap\nrenormalization is observed in the vacuum-exposed section than in the\ngraphene-encapsulated - and thus ostensibly better screened - section of the\nWS$_2$.

    "abstract": "This study pioneers the application of the Gai-Kapadia framework, originally\ndeveloped for interbank contagion, to global equity markets. It offers a novel\napproach to assess systemic risk and default cascades. Using a 20-asset network\n(13 Brazilian and 7 developed market assets) from 2015 to 2025, we construct\nexposure-based networks from price co-movements, applying thresholds theta =\n0.3 and theta = 0.5 to capture significant interconnections. Cascade dynamics\nare evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations (n = 1000) with shocks ranging\nfrom 10 to 50 percent, complemented by deterministic propagation analysis.\nResults show that high clustering among Brazilian assets (Ci approx 1.0) leads\nto localized contagion, with an average of 2.0 failed assets per simulation. In\ncontrast, developed markets with lower connectivity (Ci approx 0.2 to 0.4) show\nresilience, with zero failures beyond Brazil in all scenarios. Network\nvisualizations highlight structural vulnerabilities: deterministic cascades\nreach up to 20 assets at theta = 0.3, but only 3 to 4 at theta = 0.5. Risk\nmeasures such as VaR and CVaR at 95 percent confidence confirm higher tail\nrisks in emerging markets.

To this end, this paper reviews\nkey advancements across the MLLM pipeline, including distributed training,\ninference, fine-tuning, and deployment, while also identifying the\ncontributions, limitations, and future areas of improvement.

The upper critical field ($H_{\\rm{c2}}$) is an\nessential parameter for obtaining information on the pair-breaking mechanism,\ncoherence length $\\xi$, and pairing symmetry, all of which are crucial for\nunderstanding unconventional superconducting mechanisms. Here, we provide a\nbrief review of studies on $ H_{\\rm{c2}} $ in several representative series of\ncuprate, iron-based, and nickelate superconductors.

To help the\ninterpretation of future observations, we study here for the first time how the\nwater ice band depends on the observer's perspective and the location where\nspectra are measured within protoplanetary disks. Based on a standard\nprotoplanetary disk model around a T Tauri star, we used the radiative transfer\ncode MCFOST to extract water-ice spectra and to measure the depth and central\nwavelength of the water-ice band at different locations in the disk. Even in\nthe context of a spatially homogeneous ice mixture, the observed properties of\nwater-ice bands depend on the inclination of the system as well as on the\nlocation in the disk from which the spectra are extracted. In particular, the\nwavelength of the band minimum can change by up to 0.17 {\\mu}m comparable to\nthe difference expected between amorphous and crystalline ices, for instance.\nThis phenomenon stems from a balance between absorption and scattering and must\nbe taken into account in detailed modeling of spatially-resolved infrared\nspectroscopy of ices, including CO and CO2.",

PnP Langevin sampling algorithms offer a powerful\nframework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as\nwell as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and\nvisualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model\nparameter tuning. However, existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited\nfor low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor\nregularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity\nconstraints. To address these challenges, we propose two strategies for\nextending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated\nPnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson\nlikelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a\nRiemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the\nlikelihood without approximations.

Random\ntelegraph noise (RTN) is a type of noise that can reduce the performance of\nHCDs and other CMOS sensors. After finding and quantifying RTN in the recently\ndeveloped engineering grade Speedster-EXD550 HCDs, this form of noise has also\nbeen found in other X-ray HCDs. This paper aims to investigate its presence and\ncharacteristics in the relatively mature H2RG X-ray HCD and to compare it with\nthat of the Speedster-EXD550. We use archival data taken with an H2RG X-ray HCD\nat two different temperatures to determine the percentage of pixels that are\nbeing impacted by RTN. We identify RTN in 0.42% of pixels when the detector is\noperated at 140 K, while we are only able to identify RTN in 0.060% of pixels\nwhen the detector is operated at 160 K. We characterize RTN in two\nSpeedster-EXD550 detectors, identifying 5.1% of pixels with RTN in one detector\nand 7.1% in another, which is significantly more than the H2RG. These results\nverify the difference between two different HCDs and provide techniques that\ncan be applied to future hybrid CMOS detectors.",

We proposed an\nefficient transfer learning scheme from first-principles calculations to\nexperiments based on the chemistry-informed domain transformation, that\nintegrates the heterogeneous source and target domains by harnessing the\nunderlying physics and chemistry. The proposed method maps the computational\ndata from the simulation space (source domain) into the space of experimental\ndata (target domain). During this process, these qualitatively different\ndomains are efficiently integrated by a couple of prior knowledge of chemistry,\n(1) the statistical ensemble, and (2) the relationship between source and\ntarget quantities. As a proof-of-concept, we predict the catalyst activity for\nthe reverse water-gas shift reaction by using the abundant first-principles\ndata in addition to the experimental data. Through the demonstration, we\nconfirmed that the transfer learning model exhibits positive transfer in\naccuracy and data efficiency. In particular, a significantly high accuracy was\nachieved despite using a few (less than ten) target data in domain\ntransformation, whose accuracy is one order of magnitude smaller than that of a\nfull scratch model trained with over 100 target data.

Inspired by human learning\nprocesses, where mathematical proficiency develops through systematic exposure\nto interconnected concepts, we introduce MathFusion, a novel framework that\nenhances mathematical reasoning through cross-problem instruction synthesis.\nMathFusion implements this through three fusion strategies: (1) sequential\nfusion, which chains related problems to model solution dependencies; (2)\nparallel fusion, which combines analogous problems to reinforce conceptual\nunderstanding; and (3) conditional fusion, which creates context-aware\nselective problems to enhance reasoning flexibility. By applying these\nstrategies, we generate a new dataset, \\textbf{MathFusionQA}, followed by\nfine-tuning models (DeepSeekMath-7B, Mistral-7B, Llama3-8B) on it. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that MathFusion achieves substantial improvements in\nmathematical reasoning while maintaining high data efficiency, boosting\nperformance by 18.0 points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks while\nrequiring only 45K additional synthetic instructions, representing a\nsubstantial improvement over traditional single-instruction approaches.

    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of most scientific studies is to understand the underlying\ncausal mechanism between the involved variables. Structural causal models\n(SCMs) are widely used to represent such causal mechanisms. Given an SCM,\ncausal queries on all three levels of Pearl's causal hierarchy can be answered:\n$L_1$ observational, $L_2$ interventional, and $L_3$ counterfactual. An\nessential aspect of modeling the SCM is to model the dependency of each\nvariable on its causal parents. Traditionally this is done by parametric\nstatistical models, such as linear or logistic regression models. This allows\nto handle all kinds of data types and fit interpretable models but bears the\nrisk of introducing a bias. More recently neural causal models came up using\nneural networks (NNs) to model the causal relationships, allowing the\nestimation of nearly any underlying functional form without bias. However,\ncurrent neural causal models are generally restricted to continuous variables\nand do not yield an interpretable form of the causal relationships.\nTransformation models range from simple statistical regressions to complex\nnetworks and can handle continuous, ordinal, and binary data. Here, we propose\nto use TRAMs to model the functional relationships in SCMs allowing us to\nbridge the gap between interpretability and flexibility in causal modeling. We\ncall this method TRAM-DAG and assume currently that the underlying directed\nacyclic graph is known. For the fully observed case, we benchmark TRAM-DAGs\nagainst state-of-the-art statistical and NN-based causal models. We show that\nTRAM-DAGs are interpretable but also achieve equal or superior performance in\nqueries ranging from $L_1$ to $L_3$ in the causal hierarchy. For the continuous\ncase, TRAM-DAGs allow for counterfactual queries for three common causal\nstructures, including unobserved confounding.",

We find that SDSS J1257+5428 can be explained as a\npost-cataclysmic-variable system if (i) the progenitor of the extremely\nlow-mass WD was initially a solar-type star that evolved into a subgiant before\nthe onset of mass transfer and underwent hydrogen shell flashes after the mass\ntransfer stopped, (ii) the massive WD was highly or entirely rejuvenated during\nthe cataclysmic variable evolution, and (iii) magnetic braking was strong\nenough to make the evolution convergent. In this case, the torques due to\nmagnetic braking need to be stronger than those provided by the CARB model by a\nfactor of ${\\sim100}$. We conclude that SDSS J1257+5428 can be reasonably well\nexplained as having originated from a cataclysmic variable that hosted an\nevolved donor star and should no longer be regarded as paradoxical.

    "abstract": "An interior penalty DG method is proposed for the steady-state linear partial\ndifferential equations of nonnegative characteristic form, suitable for mixed\nsecond-order elliptic-parabolic and first-order hyperbolic equations. Due to\nthe different natures of the elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations. In\nthe new DG method, the averages, jumps and penalties are minimal, correctly and\nonly imposed on the diffusion-diffusion element boundaries, in addition to the\nwell-known upwind jumps associating with the advection velocity. For the\nadvection-dominated problem, the penalties can be further reduced only being\nimposed on the diffusion-dominated subset of the diffusion-diffusion element\nboundaries.This is based on the novel, crucial technique about the multiple\npartitions of the set of the interelement boundaries into a number of subsets\nwith respect to the diffusion and to the advection and on the consistency\nresult we have proven. The new DG method is the first DG method and the first\ntime that the continuity and discontinuity of the solution are correctly\nidentified and justified of the general steady-state linear partial\ndifferential equations of nonnegative characteristic form. The new DG method\nand its analysis are applied to the miscible displacement problem of vanishing\ndiffusion coefficient and of low regularity, dominating Darcy flow velocity\nwhich lives in $H(\\operatorname{div};\\Omega)\\cap \\prod_{j=1}^J (H^r(D_j))^d$\nfor $r<1$ other than the usual assumption $(W^{1,\\infty}(\\Omega))^d$.

    "abstract": "Autoregressive models have shown remarkable success in image generation by\nadapting sequential prediction techniques from language modeling. However,\napplying these approaches to images requires discretizing continuous pixel data\nthrough vector quantization methods like VQ-VAE. To alleviate the quantization\nerrors that existed in VQ-VAE, recent works tend to use larger codebooks.\nHowever, this will accordingly expand vocabulary size, complicating the\nautoregressive modeling task. This paper aims to find a way to enjoy the\nbenefits of large codebooks without making autoregressive modeling more\ndifficult. Through empirical investigation, we discover that tokens with\nsimilar codeword representations produce similar effects on the final generated\nimage, revealing significant redundancy in large codebooks. Based on this\ninsight, we propose to predict tokens from coarse to fine (CTF), realized by\nassigning the same coarse label for similar tokens. Our framework consists of\ntwo stages: (1) an autoregressive model that sequentially predicts coarse\nlabels for each token in the sequence, and (2) an auxiliary model that\nsimultaneously predicts fine-grained labels for all tokens conditioned on their\ncoarse labels. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate our method's superior\nperformance, achieving an average improvement of 59 points in Inception Score\ncompared to baselines.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces novel Bellman mappings (B-Maps) for value iteration\n(VI) in distributed reinforcement learning (DRL), where multiple agents operate\nover a network without a centralized fusion node. Each agent constructs its own\nnonparametric B-Map for VI while communicating only with direct neighbors to\nachieve consensus. These B-Maps operate on Q-functions represented in a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space, enabling a nonparametric formulation that\nallows for flexible, agent-specific basis function design. Unlike existing DRL\nmethods that restrict information exchange to Q-function estimates, the\nproposed framework also enables agents to share basis information in the form\nof covariance matrices, capturing additional structural details. A theoretical\nanalysis establishes linear convergence rates for both Q-function and\ncovariance-matrix estimates toward their consensus values. The optimal learning\nrates for consensus-based updates are dictated by the ratio of the smallest\npositive eigenvalue to the largest one of the network's Laplacian matrix.\nFurthermore, each nodal Q-function estimate is shown to lie very close to the\nfixed point of a centralized nonparametric B-Map, effectively allowing the\nproposed DRL design to approximate the performance of a centralized fusion\ncenter. Numerical experiments on two well-known control problems demonstrate\nthe superior performance of the proposed nonparametric B-Maps compared to prior\nmethods. Notably, the results reveal a counter-intuitive finding: although the\nproposed approach involves greater information exchange -- specifically through\nthe sharing of covariance matrices -- it achieves the desired performance with\nlower cumulative communication cost than existing DRL schemes, highlighting the\ncrucial role of basis information in accelerating the learning process.",

This problem is of interest to both applied and\nfundamental research, and has been investigated by many authors in various\naspects. Despite the important and impressive results obtained, a significant\npart of the process, namely the kinetics of processes leading to equilibrium\nstate, remained unexplored. In this article, we conduct a study of kinetic\nphenomena and focus our attention on the evolution of the vortex line density\n(VLD) L(t), the total length of the filament per unit volume. The initial\ndevelopment of VLD is due to random thermal fluctuations. The increase in the\nvortex line length L(t) can be obtained based on the famous Novikov-Furutsu\ntheorem, which shows that the growth rate of L(t) is proportional to a random\nforce correlator. As the length of the vortex filaments increases, the\ninteraction between the vortices becomes significant and affects the dynamics\nprocess. At this point, we turn to the phenomenological Feynman-Vinen theory,\nwhich offers various models for the evolution of the quantity L(t). Next we\nexamine the evolution of a vortex tangle as a combination of growth due to\nrandom thermal excitations and decay in the Feynman-Vinen theory.

Experiments\nshow CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a cross-dataset\ngeneralization effect. We then rethink and question whether explicit thinking\nin RFT is always necessary. Challenging the convention that explicit thinking\nis crucial for the success of RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, exploring RFT\nwithout thinking by introducing a simple equality accuracy reward. We evaluate\nNo-Thinking-RL on 6 diverse tasks across different model sizes and types.\nExperimental results reveal three key findings: 1). Visual perception tasks do\nnot require thinking during RFT, as No-Thinking-RL consistently outperforms or\nmatches Thinking-based RFT across model sizes. 2).} Models with limited\ncapabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making\nThinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL. 3). There are\ninconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some\nresponses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall\naccuracy. We hypothesize that explicit thinking before verifiable answers may\nhinder reward convergence and reduce performance. To test this hypothesis, we\npropose Think-After-Answer, which places thinking after the answer to mitigate\nthis effect for experimental verification. Lastly, we conduct a pilot study to\nexplore whether MLLMs can learn when to think during RFT, introducing an\nAdaptive-Thinking method.

This paper proposes MapGlue, a universal MRSI matching\nframework, and MapData, a large-scale multimodal dataset addressing these gaps.\nOur contributions are twofold. MapData, a globally diverse dataset spanning 233\nsampling points, offers original images (7,000x5,000 to 20,000x15,000 pixels).\nAfter rigorous cleaning, it provides 121,781 aligned electronic map-visible\nimage pairs (512x512 pixels) with hybrid manual-automated ground truth,\naddressing the scarcity of scalable multimodal benchmarks. MapGlue integrates\nsemantic context with a dual graph-guided mechanism to extract cross-modal\ninvariant features. This structure enables global-to-local interaction,\nenhancing descriptor robustness against modality-specific distortions.\nExtensive evaluations on MapData and five public datasets demonstrate MapGlue's\nsuperiority in matching accuracy under complex conditions, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "The disparity between the computational demands of deep learning and the\ncapabilities of compute hardware is expanding drastically. Although deep\nlearning achieves remarkable performance in countless tasks, its escalating\nrequirements for computational power and energy consumption surpass the\nsustainable limits of even specialized neural processing units, including the\nApple Neural Engine and NVIDIA TensorCores. This challenge is intensified by\nthe slowdown in CMOS scaling.\n  Analog computing presents a promising alternative, offering substantial\nimprovements in energy efficiency by directly manipulating physical quantities\nsuch as current, voltage, charge, or photons. However, it is inherently\nvulnerable to manufacturing variations, nonlinearities, and noise, leading to\ndegraded prediction accuracy. One of the most effective techniques for\nenhancing robustness, Noisy Training, introduces noise during the training\nphase to reinforce the model against disturbances encountered during inference.\nAlthough highly effective, its performance degrades in real-world environments\nwhere noise characteristics fluctuate due to external factors such as\ntemperature variations and temporal drift.\n  This study underscores the necessity of Noisy Training while revealing its\nfundamental limitations in the presence of dynamic noise. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Variance-Aware Noisy Training, a novel approach that\nmitigates performance degradation by incorporating noise schedules which\nemulate the evolving noise conditions encountered during inference. Our method\nsubstantially improves model robustness, without training overhead. We\ndemonstrate a significant increase in robustness, from 79.3\\% with conventional\nNoisy Training to 97.6\\% with Variance-Aware Noisy Training on CIFAR-10 and\nfrom 32.4\\% to 99.7\\% on Tiny ImageNet.",

One of the key contributors behind this\nenhanced energy efficiency in AxDNNs is the use of approximate multipliers.\nUnfortunately, the simulation of approximate multipliers does not usually scale\nwell on CPUs and GPUs. As a consequence, this slows down the overall simulation\nof AxDNNs aimed at identifying the appropriate approximate multipliers to\nachieve high energy efficiency with a minimum accuracy loss. To address this\nproblem, we present a novel XAI-Gen methodology, which leverages the analytical\nmodel of the emerging hardware accelerator (e.g., Google TPU v4) and\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to precisely identify the\nnon-critical layers for approximation and quickly discover the appropriate\napproximate multipliers for AxDNN layers.

However, previous studies have\nconsistently reported weak and ambiguous photoluminescence (PL), regardless of\nsynthesis method, raising questions about the intrinsic optoelectronic quality\nof this compound. In this work, we demonstrate strong, band-to-band-dominated\nPL at room temperature in high-quality BaZrS$_\\text{3}$ single crystals, with a\nPL quantum yield of $\\sim$0.005\\%. Despite the narrow, single-component PL\nemission band, time-resolved PL measurements reveal a carrier lifetime of\n$1.0\\pm0.2$ ns. To understand the origin of the strong PL and short carrier\nlifetime, we perform multiwavelength excitation and polarization-dependent\nRaman measurements, supported by first-principles lattice dynamics\ncalculations. We identify all 23 theoretically predicted Raman-active modes and\ntheir symmetries, providing a comprehensive reference for future studies. Our\nresults indicate that phonon-assisted carrier decay and nontrivial\nelectron-phonon interactions contribute to the short carrier lifetimes, as\nevidenced by Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Further studies on\ncompositional variations or partial cation/anion substitutions could mitigate\nelectron-phonon coupling and enhance carrier lifetimes.

As a result,\nthe cameras within those regions are less correlated, leading to a low average\ncontribution to the overall reconstruction. In this paper, we propose an\nocclusion-aware scene division strategy that clusters training cameras based on\ntheir positions and co-visibilities to acquire multiple regions. Cameras in\nsuch regions exhibit stronger correlations and a higher average contribution,\nfacilitating high-quality scene reconstruction. We further propose a\nregion-based rendering technique to accelerate large scene rendering, which\nculls Gaussians invisible to the region where the viewpoint is located. Such a\ntechnique significantly speeds up the rendering without compromising quality.\nExtensive experiments on multiple large scenes show that our method achieves\nsuperior reconstruction results with faster rendering speed compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art approaches.

In a conventional pathological section observation\nprocess, pathologists have to repeatedly switch from 10x objective to 20x\nobjective several times to localize and image the target region. Besides the\nswitching operations, repeated manual or electro-mechanical focusing is also\nvery time-consuming, affecting the total time for pathological diagnosis. In\naddition, It is usually necessary to remove the manually marked symbols on the\nstained pathology slides used for classification and management before\nobservation. Methods: In this paper, we utilize Fourier ptychographic\nmicroscopy (FPM) in the pathological diagnosis process to realize large\nspace-bandwidth product imaging, quantitative phase imaging, and digital\nrefocusing in the observation process without any mechanical operations, which\ncan therefore simplify the above-mentioned cumbersome diagnostic processes. We\nfirst verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method with\nseveral typical pathological sections. Then, instead of manually erasing, we\nalso prove that FP framework can digitally remove the artificial markers with\nits digital refocusing ability. Results: At last, we demonstrated pathologists\ncan achieve 100% diagnostic accuracy with FPM imaging results.

We simplify the input dataset, restrict the number of parameters to\nlearn and improve the gradient back-propagation within the model. We also\nintroduce novel optimizers specifically designed for discrete-valued weights.\nBased on conventional gradient computation, these optimizers provide discrete\nweights updates, enabling finer control and improving explainability of the\nlearning process. Through these changes, we consistently achieve improved code\nperformance, provided appropriately chosen hyper-parameters. To rigorously\nevaluate the performance of learned codes in the context of short to medium\nblock lengths, we propose a comprehensive code performance assessment\nframework. This framework enables a fair comparison between our learning\nmethodology and random search approaches, ensuring statistical significance in\nour results. The proposed model pave the way for a new approach to the\nefficient learning of linear block codes tailored to specific decoder\nstructures.",

    "abstract": "Very little is known on the Hilbert series of graded algebras $\\mathbb\nC[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\\ldots,g_r)$, $r>n$, $g_i$ generic form of degree $e_i$,\nin general. One instance when the series is known, is for $n+1$ forms in $n$\nvariables, \\cite{St}. Of course even less is known about Betti numbers. There\nare some general results on the Betti table by Pardue and Richert in\n\\cite{Pa-Ri,Pa-Ri1}, and by Diem in \\cite{Di}. Then there are results on Betti\nnumbers in the case $n+1$ relations in $n$ variables, described below, by\nMigliore and Mir\\`o-Roig in \\cite{Mi-Mi}, and more partial results in the\ngeneral case by the same authors in \\cite{Mi-Mi1}. In this paper we consider\nthe same case as in \\cite{Mi-Mi}, $n+1$ forms in $n$ variables. Our results can\nbe described as follows. We can determine all graded Betti numbers of $\\mathbb\nC[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\\ldots,g_{n+1})$, $g_i$ generic, at least if\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}\\deg(g_i)-n$ is even, often in more cases. Thus, given {\\em\nany} set $\\{ e_1,\\ldots,e_n\\}$, $e_i\\ge2$ for all $i$, such that\n$\\deg(g_i)=e_i$, $i=1,\\ldots,n$, we get many numbers $D_j$, so that we can\ndetermine all graded Betti numbers of $\\mathbb\nC[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]/(g_1,\\ldots,g_{n+1})$, $\\deg(g_i)=e_i$, $1\\le i\\le n$,\n$\\deg(g_{n+1})=D_j$. The main ingredients of the proof is a theorem by Pardue\nand Richert, \\cite{Pa-Ri,Pa-Ri1}, and later by Diem,\\cite{Di}, and a new short\nproof of a theorem on Hilbert series of artinian complete intersections by\nReid, Roberts, and Roitman, \\cite{R-R-R}. We also give examples of algebras\nwith many so called \"ghost terms\" in the minimal resolution.",

However, the fundamental reliance of self-attention layers on\npositional embedding versus query-key similarity during generation remains an\nintriguing question. We present the first mechanistic analysis of RoPE-based\nMMDiT models (e.g., FLUX), introducing an automated probing strategy that\ndisentangles positional information versus content dependencies by\nstrategically manipulating RoPE during generation.

These models rely on spatial\npriors to account for variation in raw relative risk or rate estimates. Spatial\npriors introduce some degree of smoothing, wherein, for any particular unit,\nempirical risk or incidence estimates are either adjusted towards a suitable\nmean or incorporate neighbor-based smoothing. While model explanation may be\nthe primary focus, the literature lacks a comparison of the amount of smoothing\nintroduced by different spatial priors. Additionally, there has been no\ninvestigation into how varying the parameters of these priors influences the\nresulting smoothing. This study examines seven commonly used spatial priors\nthrough both simulations and real data analyses. Using areal maps of peninsular\nSpain and England, we analyze smoothing effects using two datasets with\nassociated populations at risk. We propose empirical metrics to quantify the\nsmoothing achieved by each model and theoretical metrics to calibrate the\nexpected extent of smoothing as a function of model parameters.

In order to solve the above problems, we propose a noval complementary\nfeature compression interaction network (CFCI-Net), which realizes the\ncomplementary fusion and compression interaction of multi-modal feature\ninformation with an efficient mode fusion strategy.

Several researchers have\nattempted to study political bias in language models using evaluation suites\nbased on surveys, such as the Political Compass Test (PCT), often finding a\nparticular leaning favored by these models. However, there is some variation in\nthe exact prompting techniques, leading to diverging findings, and most\nresearch relies on constrained-answer settings to extract model responses.\nMoreover, the Political Compass Test is not a scientifically valid survey\ninstrument.

This paper introduces PolyTest,\na novel approach that enhances test generation by exploiting polyglot and\ntemperature-controlled diversity. PolyTest systematically leverages these\nproperties in two complementary ways: (1) Cross-lingual test generation, where\ntests are generated in multiple languages at zero temperature and then unified;\n(2) Diverse test sampling, where multiple test sets are generated within the\nsame language at a higher temperature before unification. A key insight is that\nLLMs can generate diverse yet contradicting tests -- same input, different\nexpected outputs -- across languages and generations.

    "abstract": "Pipe routing is a highly complex, time-consuming, and no-deterministic\npolynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem in aeroengine design. Despite extensive\nresearch efforts in optimizing constant-curvature pipe routing, the growing\ndemand for free-form pipes poses new challenges. Dynamic design environments\nand fuzzy layout rules further impact the optimization performance and\nefficiency. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a\nself-learning-based method (SLPR) for optimizing free-form pipe routing in\naeroengines. The SLPR is based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO)\nalgorithm and integrates a unified rule modeling framework for efficient\nobstacle detection and fuzzy rule modeling in continuous space. Additionally, a\npotential energy table is constructed to enable rapid queries of layout\ntendencies and interference. The agent within SLPR iteratively refines pipe\nrouting and accumulates the design knowledge through interaction with the\nenvironment. Once the design environment shifts, the agent can swiftly adapt by\nfine-tuning network parameters. Comparative tests reveal that SLPR ensures\nsmooth pipe routing through cubic non-uniform B-spline (NURBS) curves, avoiding\nredundant pipe segments found in constant-curvature pipe routing. Results in\nboth static and dynamic design environments demonstrate that SLPR outperforms\nthree representative baselines in terms of the pipe length reduction, the\nadherence to layout rules, the path complexity, and the computational\nefficiency. Furthermore, tests in dynamic environments indicate that SLPR\neliminates labor-intensive searches from scratch and even yields superior\nsolutions compared to the retrained model. These results highlight the\npractical value of SLPR for real-world pipe routing, meeting lightweight,\nprecision, and sustainability requirements of the modern aeroengine design.",

As such, energy management systems seek\nto decide the power dispatch in the best way possible. The objective is to\nminimize and balance operative costs (energy bills or asset degradation) with\nuser requirements (mobility, heating, etc.). Current energy management uses\nempirical battery ageing models outside of their specific fitting conditions,\nresulting in inaccuracies and poor performance. Moreover, the link to thermal\nsystems is also overlooked. This paper presents an ageing-aware day-ahead\nalgorithm for electrified buildings that incorporates physics-based battery\nageing models. The models distinguish between energy storage systems and make\nexplicit the trade-off between grid cost and battery degradation.

Moreover, it exploits\nthe differences between cathode chemistries improving grid costs by 25% when\nusing LFP cells, with respect to NMC cells.

Despite its popularity, scholars and\npoliticians alike have raised many concerns on the legitimacy and ethics of\nTikTok regarding its services, and its collected data. However, much of these\ndiscussions take the premise of user-generated content for granted, attributing\nthem to human expression without critically evaluating how the making of\non-platform content production have changed. With a grounded theory approach,\nin conjunction with a platform-aware walkthrough that pays special attention to\nthe material and immaterial premises of platform value generation, my findings\nsuggest that the intensification of datafication have proliferated from\nconsumption behaviours to the process of content production, whereas content\nproduction no longer solely produce media content. As platforms become the\nactive recruiter, mobiliser and co-producer of media production, I argue that\nit is no longer feasible to distinguish human and machine contribution in the\nways they are consumed to facilitate platform valorisation. I propose that the\ntechnical arrangements of TikTok, in relation to its users has fostered a\nnon-linear mode of platform cultural production capable of generating economic\nvalue through a system of machinic agency that incorporates human and machines\nin an indistinguishable manner. As content, the premises of platform\nvalorisation has become an inseparable effort of human-machines, I urge that\nthe relationship between technology and humans be reassessed as a system of\nmachinic agency that mutually shapes our mediated reality, rather than\nsingular, differentiable actors that contribute to platforms.",

Specifically, the effects\nof the electric field on the current and the diffusivities parallel and\northogonal to the electric fields are analyzed. It is argued that the nonlinear\neffects in the weak-field regime provide information about the nature of the\ndisorder. In contrast, the nonlinear effects in the high-field regime allow one\nto extract effective hopping distances. They are in close agreement with\ntypical nearest-neighbor length scales obtained from detailed structural\nanalysis and are hardly dependent on the salt content. Furthermore, from the\nstudy of the temperature dependence in the high-field regime, effective barrier\nheights can be determined, which in this regime decrease linearly with\nincreasing field. The disappearance of the effective barriers, estimated by\nlinear extrapolation, occurs close to the fields where the MD simulations start\nto be numerically unstable.

    "abstract": "Active learning has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the substantial\nannotation burden in 3D object detection tasks, spurring several initiatives in\noutdoor environments. However, its application in indoor environments remains\nunexplored. Compared to outdoor 3D datasets, indoor datasets face significant\nchallenges, including fewer training samples per class, a greater number of\nclasses, more severe class imbalance, and more diverse scene types and\nintra-class variances. This paper presents the first study on active learning\nfor indoor 3D object detection, where we propose a novel framework tailored for\nthis task. Our method incorporates two key criteria - uncertainty and diversity\n- to actively select the most ambiguous and informative unlabeled samples for\nannotation. The uncertainty criterion accounts for both inaccurate detections\nand undetected objects, ensuring that the most ambiguous samples are\nprioritized. Meanwhile, the diversity criterion is formulated as a joint\noptimization problem that maximizes the diversity of both object class\ndistributions and scene types, using a new Class-aware Adaptive Prototype (CAP)\nbank. The CAP bank dynamically allocates representative prototypes to each\nclass, helping to capture varying intra-class diversity across different\ncategories. We evaluate our method on SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2, where it\noutperforms baselines by a significant margin, achieving over 85% of\nfully-supervised performance with just 10% of the annotation budget.",

Under Kerr nonlinearity, the\nevent solitons emerge as fully localized entities in both spacetime and\nenergy-momentum domains, providing a tangible demonstration of the concept of\nevent in relativity.

However, before\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) dominated the conversation, another ambitious\nvision emerged -- one where AI-driven Software Agents autonomously served Web\nusers based on a structured, machine-interpretable Web. The Semantic Web aimed\nto transform the World Wide Web into an ecosystem where AI could reason,\nunderstand, and act. Between 2000 and 2010, this vision sparked a significant\nresearch boom, only to fade into obscurity as AI's mainstream narrative shifted\nelsewhere. Today, as LLMs edge toward autonomous execution, we revisit this\noverlooked wave.

Here we investigate the latter approach, auditing\nby testing whether the total number of mismatches in the full set of CVRs\nexceeds the minimum number of CVR errors required for the reported outcome to\nbe wrong (the \"CVR margin\"). This strategy makes it possible to audit more\nsocial choice functions and simplifies RLAs conceptually, which makes it easier\nto explain than some other RLA approaches. The cost is larger sample sizes.\n\"Mismatch-based RLAs\" only require a lower bound on the CVR margin, which for\nsome social choice functions is easier to calculate than the effect of\nparticular errors. When the population rate of mismatches is low and the lower\nbound on the CVR margin is close to the true CVR margin, the increase in sample\nsize is small.

In this paper, we focus on an application\nin numerical cognition, where a bump of activity in an attractor network is\nused as a spatial numerical representation. While existing neural networks can\nmaintain persistent states, to date, there is no unified framework for\ndynamically controlling spatial changes in neuronal activity in response to\nenvironmental changes. To address this, we couple a well known allostatic\nmicrocircuit, the Hammel model, with a ring attractor, resulting in a Spiking\nNeural Network architecture that can modulate the location of the bump as a\nfunction of some reference input. This localized activity in turn is used as a\nperceptual belief in a simulated subitization task a quick enumeration process\nwithout counting. We provide a general procedure to fine-tune the model and\ndemonstrate the successful control of the bump location.

    "abstract": "We propose and evaluate age of information (AoI)-aware multiple access\nmechanisms for the Internet of Things (IoT) in multi-relay two-hop networks.\nThe network considered comprises end devices (EDs) communicating with a set of\nrelays in ALOHA fashion, with new information packets to be potentially\ntransmitted every time slot. The relays, in turn, forward the collected packets\nto an access point (AP), the final destination of the information generated by\nthe EDs. More specifically, in this work we investigate the performance of four\nage-aware algorithms that prioritize older packets to be transmitted, namely\nmax-age matching (MAM), iterative max-age scheduling (IMAS), age-based delayed\nrequest (ABDR), and buffered ABDR (B-ABDR). The former two algorithms are\nadapted into the multi-relay setup from previous research, and achieve\nsatisfactory average AoI and average peak AoI performance, at the expense of a\nsignificant amount of information exchange between the relays and the AP. The\nlatter two algorithms are newly proposed to let relays decide which one(s) will\ntransmit in a given time slot, requiring less signaling than the former\nalgorithms. We provide an analytical formulation for the AoI lower bound\nperformance, compare the performance of all algorithms in this set-up, and show\nthat they approach the lower bound. The latter holds especially true for\nB-ABDR, which approaches the lower bound the most closely, tilting the scale in\nits favor, as it also requires far less signaling than MAM and IMAS.",

This work reviews SD and\nprovides a perspective on future directions for this approach. We outline the\nmathematical foundations, the method's strengths and weaknesses, and the\ncomputational challenges that need to be overcome to work with SD effectively.\nWe also discuss recent advancements that improve the algorithm's efficiency,\nincluding the use of iterative solvers and matrix-free approaches. In addition,\nwe highlight the limitations of making stronger, albeit more cost-effective\napproximations to studying hydrodynamic interactions in dense suspensions than\nmade in SD, such as the two-body Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) approximation. To\novercome these issues, we propose a hybrid framework that replaces SD's full\nmany-body computations with a neural network trained on SD data.

While supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) has been the predominant approach to enhance MLLM\ncapabilities in task-specific optimization, it often falls short in fostering\ncrucial generalized reasoning abilities. Although reinforcement learning (RL)\nholds great promise in overcoming these limitations, it encounters two\nsignificant challenges: (1) its generalized capacities in multimodal tasks\nremain largely unexplored, and (2) its training constraints, including the\nconstant Kullback-Leibler divergence or the clamp strategy, often result in\nsuboptimal bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we propose OThink-MR1, an\nadvanced MLLM equipped with profound comprehension and reasoning capabilities\nacross multimodal tasks. Specifically, we introduce Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy (GRPO-D), which markedly\nenhances reinforcement learning (RL) performance. For Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct,\nGRPO-D achieves a relative improvement of more than 5.72% over SFT and more\nthan 13.59% over GRPO in same-task evaluation on two adapted datasets.\nFurthermore, GRPO-D demonstrates remarkable cross-task generalization\ncapabilities, with an average relative improvement of more than 61.63% over SFT\nin cross-task evaluation.

In this paper, we propose a data ingestion\ndesign pattern for big data in cloud architecture, incorporating both\nincremental and full refresh techniques. Our approach leverages a flexible,\nmetadata-driven framework to enhance feasibility and flexibility. This allows\nfor easy changes to the ingestion type, schema modifications, table additions,\nand the integration of new data sources, all with minimal effort from data\nengineers.

To address this, we propose Disentangled and\nInterpretable Multimodal Attention Fusion (DIMAF), a multimodal framework that\nseparates the intra- and inter-modal interactions within an attention-based\nfusion mechanism to learn distinct modality-specific and modality-shared\nrepresentations. We introduce a loss based on Distance Correlation to promote\ndisentanglement between these representations and integrate Shapley additive\nexplanations to assess their relative contributions to survival prediction. We\nevaluate DIMAF on four public cancer survival datasets, achieving a relative\naverage improvement of 1.85% in performance and 23.7% in disentanglement\ncompared to current state-of-the-art multimodal models. Beyond improved\nperformance, our interpretable framework enables a deeper exploration of the\nunderlying interactions between and within modalities in cancer biology.",

However,\ntraining models for detecting multiple landmarks simultaneously often\nencounters the \"seesaw phenomenon\", where improvements in detecting certain\nlandmarks lead to declines in detecting others. Yet, training a separate model\nfor each landmark increases memory usage and computational overhead. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel approach based on the belief that\n\"landmarks are distinct\" by training models with pseudo-labels and template\ndata updated continuously during the training process, where each model is\ndedicated to detecting a single landmark to achieve high accuracy. Furthermore,\ngrounded on the belief that \"landmarks are also alike\", we introduce an\nadapter-based fusion model, combining shared weights with landmark-specific\nweights, to efficiently share model parameters while allowing flexible\nadaptation to individual landmarks.

Experimental\nresults on publicly available medical image datasets demonstrate that the\nsingle-landmark models significantly outperform traditional multi-point joint\ntraining models in detecting individual landmarks.

These systems often\nrequire clear and detailed images for precise object detection and recognition.\nHowever, images captured by visual measurement tools frequently suffer from\ndegradation, including blurring and loss of detail, which can impede\nmeasurement accuracy.As a potential remedy, we in this paper propose a\nSemantic-Guided Global-Local Collaborative Network (SGGLC-Net) for lightweight\nSISR. Our SGGLC-Net leverages semantic priors extracted from a pre-trained\nmodel to guide the super-resolution process, enhancing image detail quality\neffectively. Specifically,we propose a Semantic Guidance Module that seamlessly\nintegrates the semantic priors into the super-resolution network, enabling the\nnetwork to more adeptly capture and utilize semantic priors, thereby enhancing\nimage details. To further explore both local and non-local interactions for\nimproved detail rendition,we propose a Global-Local Collaborative Module, which\nfeatures three Global and Local Detail Enhancement Modules, as well as a Hybrid\nAttention Mechanism to work together to efficiently learn more useful features.\nOur extensive experiments show that SGGLC-Net achieves competitive PSNR and\nSSIM values across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating higher\nperformance with the multi-adds reduction of 12.81G compared to\nstate-of-the-art lightweight super-resolution approaches.

Large\nfoundation models offer considerable flexibility, yet the cost of fine-tuning\nthese models remains a significant barrier. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n(PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), efficiently update model\nweights with low-rank matrices but may suffer from underfitting when the chosen\nrank is insufficient to capture domain-specific nuances. Conversely, full-rank\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) based methods provide comprehensive updates\nby modifying all singular values, yet they often lack flexibility and exhibit\nvariable performance across datasets.

However, this\nmethod systematically excludes people of color and those without access to\nhealthcare and results in a selected sample that is not representative of the\ntarget population. We therefore propose the use of a predictive model based on\ncognitive test scores to enroll cognitively normal yet high risk participants\nin a hypothetical clinical trial. Cognitive test scores are a widely accessible\ntool, so their use in enrollment would be less likely to exclude marginalized\npopulations than biomarkers (such as imaging), which are overwhelmingly\navailable to exclusively high-income patients. We developed a novel\nlongitudinal factor model to predict AD conversion within a 3-year window based\non data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Through simulation,\nwe demonstrate that our predictive model provides substantial improvements in\nstatistical power and required sample size in hypothetical clinical trials\nacross a range of drug effects compared to other methods of subject selection.",

Furthermore,\nthe limited size of the training datasets also contributes to the insufficient\ntraining of the IUR model. To address the first issue, we propose a multi-task\nlearning framework EO-IUR (Editing Operation-guided Incomplete Utterance\nRewriting) that introduces the editing operation labels generated by sequence\nlabeling module to guide generation model to focus on critical tokens.\nFurthermore, we introduce a token-level heterogeneous graph to represent\ndialogues. To address the second issue, we propose a two-dimensional utterance\naugmentation strategy, namely editing operation-based incomplete utterance\naugmentation and LLM-based historical utterance augmentation. The experimental\nresults on three datasets demonstrate that our EO-IUR outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both open-domain and task-oriented\ndialogue.

However, the visual content is not equally\ncontributed to user instructions, existing strategies (\\eg, average pool)\ninevitably lead to the loss of potentially useful information. To tackle this,\nwe propose the Hybrid-level Instruction Injection Strategy for Conditional\nToken Compression in MLLMs (HICom), utilizing the instruction as a condition to\nguide the compression from both local and global levels. This encourages the\ncompression to retain the maximum amount of user-focused information while\nreducing visual tokens to minimize computational burden. Specifically, the\ninstruction condition is injected into the grouped visual tokens at the local\nlevel and the learnable tokens at the global level, and we conduct the\nattention mechanism to complete the conditional compression. From the\nhybrid-level compression, the instruction-relevant visual parts are highlighted\nwhile the temporal-spatial structure is also preserved for easier understanding\nof LLMs. To further unleash the potential of HICom, we introduce a new\nconditional pre-training stage with our proposed dataset HICom-248K.\nExperiments show that our HICom can obtain distinguished video understanding\nability with fewer tokens, increasing the performance by 2.43\\% average on\nthree multiple-choice QA benchmarks and saving 78.8\\% tokens compared with the\nSOTA method.

This\nhighlights the need for an emulation framework that can faithfully emulate the\ncharacteristics of the cloud-edge continuum.

    "abstract": "We study 2D spin and orbital systems, in a classical limit, in a regime where\ntheir coupling is so strong that orbital fluctuations are able to change sign\nof spin-exchange. Our aim is to understand how different phases in the orbital\nsector determine the ordering in the spin sector. The existence of intermediate\nvortex crystal (VC) phases, beside the canonical Kosterlitz and Thouless (KT)\nphases is now a well-established fact. Recently, we found [Phys. Rev. Research\n6, 043154] that such a phase can explain phase diagram of FeSe. Motivated by\nthis, here we develop a Renormalization Group (RG) method which can capture the\nformation of the VC phase. We achieve it by incorporating orbital vortex-vortex\ninteractions through space-dependent incommensurability. Simultaneously, we\nincorporate the coupling with the spin sector for both short- and long-range\ninteractions. We then derive a phase diagram including the effects of\nlong-range interactions and spin-orbit coupling. The presence of the\nintermediate VC phase in the orbital sector changes the scaling of long-range\nspin-spin interactions, making them relevant under specific conditions. We thus\nfind that the regular arrangement of orbital vortices can induce a long-range\norder in the 2D spin system.",

Moreover, GraspCoT presents a unified multimodal LLM\narchitecture, which encodes multi-view observations of 3D scenes into 3D-aware\nvisual tokens, and then jointly embeds these visual tokens with CoT-derived\ntextual tokens within LLMs to generate grasp pose predictions.

    "abstract": "Computer interfaces are advancing towards using multi-modalities to enable\nbetter human-computer interactions. The use of automatic emotion recognition\n(AER) can make the interactions natural and meaningful thereby enhancing the\nuser experience. Though speech is the most direct and intuitive modality for\nAER, it is not reliable because it can be intentionally faked by humans. On the\nother hand, physiological modalities like EEG, are more reliable and impossible\nto fake. However, use of EEG is infeasible for realistic scenarios usage\nbecause of the need for specialized recording setup. In this paper, one of our\nprimary aims is to ride on the reliability of the EEG modality to facilitate\nrobust AER on the speech modality. Our approach uses both the modalities during\ntraining to reliably identify emotion at the time of inference, even in the\nabsence of the more reliable EEG modality. We propose, a two-step joint\nmulti-modal learning approach (JMML) that exploits both the intra- and inter-\nmodal characteristics to construct emotion embeddings that enrich the\nperformance of AER. In the first step, using JEC-SSL, intra-modal learning is\ndone independently on the individual modalities. This is followed by an\ninter-modal learning using the proposed extended variant of deep canonically\ncorrelated cross-modal autoencoder (E-DCC-CAE). The approach learns the joint\nproperties of both the modalities by mapping them into a common representation\nspace, such that the modalities are maximally correlated. These emotion\nembeddings, hold properties of both the modalities there by enhancing the\nperformance of ML classifier used for AER. Experimental results show the\nefficacy of the proposed approach. To best of our knowledge, this is the first\nattempt to combine speech and EEG with joint multi-modal learning approach for\nreliable AER.",

Specifically, given a distribution of\ntasks, we can, in polynomial time, i) verify whether the distribution is\nnon-wasteful and ii) turn it into an equivalent non-wasteful distribution.\nMoreover, we investigate several fixed-parameter tractable and polynomial-time\nalgorithms and paint a complete picture of the (parameterized) complexity of\nfinding fair and efficient distributions of tasks with respect to both the\nstructure of the topology and natural restrictions of the input. Finally, we\nhighlight how our findings shed light on computational aspects of other\nwell-studied fairness notions, such as envy-freeness and its relaxations.",

The purpose of the present investigation is to compare\nthe properties of static solutions of the Einstein-Dirac system with static\nsolutions of the Einstein,-Vlasov system as the number of fermions increases,\nthat is, for $2\\leq\\kappa \\leq 180$. Since the Einstein-Vlasov system is a\nfully classical physical model, whereas the Einstein-Dirac system is\nsemiclassical and thus has a quantum signature, this framework provides an\nexcellent opportunity to study the transition from quantum to classical\nbehaviour. It turns out that even for a comparatively small number of\nparticles, the features of the solutions are remarkably similar. For both\nsystems, we find highly relativistic solutions having a multi-peak structure\nwith strikingly similar characteristics. We also investigate the maximum\ncompactness ratio $\\sup 2m/r$ of the solutions. The solutions of both systems\nshare the fundamental properties regarding the maximum compactness ratio and\nobey the inequality derived in \\cite{A2}. Furthermore, we investigate the sign\nof the pressure components of solutions of the Einstein-Dirac system. For small\nvalues of $\\kappa$, there are regions where the radial pressure is negative.\nThese regions disappear as $\\kappa$ increases.

    "abstract": "Reliable causal effect estimation from observational data requires adjustment\nfor confounding and sufficient overlap in covariate distributions between\ntreatment groups. However, in high-dimensional settings, lack of overlap often\ninflates the variance and weakens the robustness of inverse propensity score\nweighting (IPW) based estimators. Although many approaches that rely on\ncovariate adjustment have been proposed to mitigate these issues, we instead\nshift the focus to the outcome space. In this paper, we introduce the Augmented\nMarginal outcome density Ratio (AMR) estimator, an outcome-informed weighting\nmethod that naturally filters out irrelevant information, alleviates practical\npositivity violations and outperforms standard augmented IPW and covariate\nadjustment-based methods in terms of both efficiency and robustness.\nAdditionally, by eliminating the need for strong a priori assumptions, our\npost-hoc calibration framework is also effective in settings with\nhigh-dimensional covariates. We present experimental results on synthetic data,\nthe NHANES dataset and text applications, demonstrating the robustness of AMR\nand its superior performance under weak overlap and high-dimensional\ncovariates.",

This work presents a\nhuman-robot interface developed to help people with upper limbs impairments,\nsuch as those affected by stroke injuries, in activities of everyday life. The\nproposed interface leverages on a visual servoing guidance component, which\nutilizes an inexpensive but effective laser emitter device. By projecting the\nlaser on a surface within the workspace of the robot, the user is able to guide\nthe robotic manipulator to desired locations, to reach, grasp and manipulate\nobjects. Considering the targeted users, the laser emitter is worn on the head,\nenabling to intuitively control the robot motions with head movements that\npoint the laser in the environment, which projection is detected with a neural\nnetwork based perception module. The interface implements two control\nmodalities: the first allows the user to select specific locations directly,\ncommanding the robot to reach those points; the second employs a paper keyboard\nwith buttons that can be virtually pressed by pointing the laser at them. These\nbuttons enable a more direct control of the Cartesian velocity of the\nend-effector and provides additional functionalities such as commanding the\naction of the gripper. The proposed interface is evaluated in a series of\nmanipulation tasks involving a 6DOF assistive robot manipulator equipped with\n1DOF beak-like gripper.

In\nthis work, we revisit its multi-band photometry and spectroscopy, {gathering\nall publicly available observational data for this source}, to investigate the\nnature of its progenitor and power source. {We use an innovative time analysis\nmethod based on Gaussian Process, leveraging its ability to model both noise\nand periodic components in unevenly sampled data without requiring regular\nsampling.} We detect significant periodic modulations in the post-peak light\ncurve, with a characteristic timescale of $\\sim$8.4 days. These modulations are\nalso seen in the $H_{\\alpha}$ line velocity, suggesting a structured\ncircumstellar medium (CSM) shaped by binary interaction. We model the light\ncurve with semi-analytical prescriptions (MOSFiT), including CSM and central\nengine components, and derive an ejecta mass of $\\sim$2.2--2.4~$M_\\odot$,\nexplosion energy of $\\sim$3.4$\\times$10$^{51}$~erg, and a $^{56}$Ni mass of\n$\\sim$0.11~$M_\\odot$. The colour evolution indicates an additional energy\ninjection, consistent with either prolonged breakout or delayed central\npowering. While the data are compatible with a weak magnetar contribution, the\noverall evidence favours a binary progenitor system, with non-conservative mass\ntransfer shaping the observed CSM.

GC mass correlates with light-element\nvariations, supporting earlier photometric studies. We investigated iron\ndifferences among 1P stars, confirming their presence in 19 GCs, and finding a\nspread consistent with prediction based on photometry. Notably, in eight of\nthem we detected a correlation between [Fe/H] and the position in\niron-sensitive photometric diagrams. More massive GCs display larger lithium\ndepletion among 2P stars, which is consistent with zero at smaller masses.\nNotably, some 2P stars with the most extreme chemical differences compared to\n1P stars still show Li comparable to 1P, suggesting that the 1P polluters have\nproduced some amount of this element.

However, extending these capabilities to video tasks remains\nchallenging due to limited labeled video data and high training costs. Recent\nvideo prompting methods attempt to adapt CLIP for video tasks by introducing\nlearnable prompts, but they typically rely on a single static prompt for all\nvideo sequences, overlooking the diverse temporal dynamics and spatial\nvariations that exist across frames. This limitation significantly hinders the\nmodel's ability to capture essential temporal information for effective video\nunderstanding. To address this, we propose an integrated Spatial-TempOral\ndynamic Prompting (STOP) model which consists of two complementary modules, the\nintra-frame spatial prompting and inter-frame temporal prompting. Our\nintra-frame spatial prompts are designed to adaptively highlight discriminative\nregions within each frame by leveraging intra-frame attention and temporal\nvariation, allowing the model to focus on areas with substantial temporal\ndynamics and capture fine-grained spatial details. Additionally, to highlight\nthe varying importance of frames for video understanding, we further introduce\ninter-frame temporal prompts, dynamically inserting prompts between frames with\nhigh temporal variance as measured by frame similarity. This enables the model\nto prioritize key frames and enhances its capacity to understand temporal\ndependencies across sequences. Extensive experiments on various video\nbenchmarks demonstrate that STOP consistently achieves superior performance\nagainst state-of-the-art methods.

Leveraging this flexibility requires interoperability among\nstakeholders, including Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution\nSystem Operators (DSOs). However, data privacy concerns among stakeholders\npresent significant challenges for utilizing this flexibility effectively. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based method in\nwhich the technical constraints of the DSs are represented by ML models trained\nexclusively on non-sensitive data. Using these models, the TSO can solve the\noptimal power flow (OPF) problem and directly determine the dispatch of\nflexibility-providing units (FPUs), in our case, distributed generators (DGs),\nin a single round of communication. To achieve this, we introduce a novel\nneural network (NN) architecture specifically designed to efficiently represent\nthe feasible region of the DSs, ensuring computational effectiveness.\nFurthermore, we incorporate various PQ charts rather than idealized ones,\ndemonstrating that the proposed method is adaptable to a wide range of FPU\ncharacteristics.

In this work, we address two key challenges towards this objective.\nFirst, we introduce a new algorithm for directly solving the constrained\nminimization problem yielding $T_{S}[n]$ for periodic densities -- a class of\ndensities that, in spite of its central importance for materials science, has\nreceived limited attention in the literature. Second, we present a numerical\nprocedure that allows us to calculate the functional derivative of $T_{S}[n]$\nwith respect to the density at constant electron number, also known as the\nKohn-Sham potential $V_{S}[n](\\rv)$. Lastly, the algorithm is augmented with a\nsubroutine that computes the ``derivative discontinuity\", i.e., the spatially\nuniform jump in $V_{S}[n](\\rv)$ which occurs upon increasing or decreasing the\ntotal number of electrons. This feature allows us to distinguish between\n``insulating\" and ``conducting\" densities for non interacting electrons. The\ncode integrates key methodological innovations, such as the use of an adaptive\nbasis set (``equidensity orbitals\") for wave function expansion and the QR\ndecomposition to accelerate the implementation of the orthogonality constraint.\nNotably, we derive a closed-form expression for the Pauli potential in one\ndimension, expressed solely in terms of the input density, without relying on\nKohn-Sham eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. We validate this method on\none-dimensional periodic densities, achieving results within ``chemical\naccuracy\".",

This paper\nintroduces a metadata model to support semantic annotation and profiling of\nmultidimensional data. Defined as an RDF vocabulary, the model provides a\nflexible and extensible graph representation for metadata at source and\nattribute levels, aligning dimensions and measures to a reference Knowledge\nGraph and summarizing value distributions in profiles. An evaluation of the\nexecution time for profile generation is also proposed, across data sources\nwith different cardinalities.",

    "abstract": "The cycle space $\\mathcal{C}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined as the linear\nspace spanned by all cycles in $G$. For an integer $k\\ge 3$, let $\\mathcal{C}_k\n(G)$ denote the subspace of $\\mathcal{C}(G)$ generated by the cycles of length\nexactly $k$. A graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is called Hamilton-generated if\n$\\mathcal{C}_n (G) = \\mathcal{C}(G)$, meaning every cycle in $G$ is a symmetric\ndifference of some Hamilton cycles of $G$. %A necessary condition for this\nproperty is that $n$ must be odd. Heinig (European J. Combin., 2014) showed\nthat for any $\\sigma >0$ and sufficiently large odd $n$, every $n$-vertex graph\nwith minimum degree $(1+ \\sigma)n/2$ is Hamilton-generated. He further posed\nthe question that whether the minimum degree requirement could be lowered to\nthe Dirac threshold $n/2$. Recent progress by Christoph, Nenadov, and\nPetrova~(arXiv:2402.01447) reduced the minimum degree condition to $n/2 + C$\nfor some large constant $C$. In this paper, we resolve Heinig's problem\ncompletely by proving that for sufficiently large odd $n$, every\nHamilton-connected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with minimum degree at least\n$(n-1)/2$ is Hamilton-generated. Moreover, this result is tight for the minimum\ndegree and the Hamilton-connected condition. The proof relies on the\nparity-switcher technique introduced by Christoph, et al in their recent work,\nas well as a classification lemma that strengthens a previous result by\nKrivelevich, Lee, and Sudakov~(Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 2014).",

Unlike previous\nmobile agents that utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as generators to\ndirectly generate actions at each step, V-Droid employs LLMs as verifiers to\nevaluate candidate actions before making final decisions. To realize this novel\nparadigm, we introduce a comprehensive framework for constructing\nverifier-driven mobile agents: the discretized action space construction\ncoupled with the prefilling-only workflow to accelerate the verification\nprocess, the pair-wise progress preference training to significantly enhance\nthe verifier's decision-making capabilities, and the scalable human-agent joint\nannotation scheme to efficiently collect the necessary data at scale.\n  V-Droid obtains a substantial task success rate across several public mobile\ntask automation benchmarks: 59.5% on AndroidWorld, 38.3% on AndroidLab, and 49%\non MobileAgentBench, surpassing existing agents by 5.2%, 2.1%, and 9%,\nrespectively. Furthermore, V-Droid achieves a remarkably low latency of 4.3s\nper step, which is 6.1X faster compared with existing mobile agents.

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) users often encounter interruptions, posing challenges\nto maintaining real-world awareness during immersive experiences. The\nPassthrough feature in VR headsets allows users to view their physical\nsurroundings without removing the headset. However, when interruptions come\nfrom the rear, users need to turn their heads to see the real world, which can\nlead to negative experiences in VR. Study 1, conducted through semi-structured\ninterviews involving 13 participants, found that users are less likely to use\nPassthrough for rear interruptions due to large head-turning movements, which\ncause inconvenience, increase the risk of motion sickness, and reduce the\nexperience. Building on these findings, we introduced three Passthrough\ntechniques in Study 2 for displaying the rear view in front of the user: Full\nRear Passthrough + Pause (FRPP), Rear Passthrough Window (RPW), and Rear\nPassthrough AR (RPAR). Compared to the Baseline method that requires\nhead-turning, all three systems reduced physical and temporal demands,\nalleviated disorientation caused by motion sickness, and provided a better user\nexperience for managing rear interruptions. Among these, FRPP and RPAR were the\nmost preferred. These findings provide valuable insights for future VR design,\nemphasizing the need for solutions that effectively manage rear interruptions\nwhile maintaining user comfort and experience.",

Despite\nvarious reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10\nconcentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits\nset by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may\nexhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions\nbetween PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in\nPM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the\nspatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an\napproach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal\nneighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence\nstructures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal\nneighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in\n2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables\nexhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value\ndistributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a\ntraditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an\nalternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of\nextreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme\nvalue analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas\nto effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data\nwhile simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including\nspatio-temporal dependencies among covariates.

In response to this\nchallenge, membranes with tuned pores morphology and surface chemistry with\nbiomimetic 3D pine-like structures with improved affinity to water\n(desalination) and/or hazardous VOC (VOC removal) were developed and studied\nsystematically. By implementing VIPS-PVDF membranes and a green modifier of\n1-adamantanamine for the first time, membranes with a revolutionary network\narchitecture were generated. The modifier was introduced either physically to\nthe polymeric matrix or chemically through covalent attachment onto the surface\nand inside the porous structure. As a result, membranes that defy wetting under\nextreme hydrostatic pressures (>11.5 bar) were produced while preserving\nunparalleled vapor transport efficiency. The 1-adamantanamine promotes\ntransport and enhances the affinity to the VOC, ensuring excellent membrane\nperformance at different applications of the MD process.

However, current\nstate-of-the-art speculative decoding approaches have three key limitations:\nhandling requests with varying difficulty using homogeneous SSMs, lack of\nrobust support for batch processing, and insufficient holistic optimization for\nboth speculation and verification phases. In this paper, we introduce SPIN, an\nefficient LLM inference serving system based on speculative decoding, designed\nto address these challenges through three main innovations. First, SPIN\nimproves token speculation by using multiple heterogeneous SSMs, with a\nlearning-based algorithm for SSM selection that operates without prior\nknowledge of request difficulty. Second, SPIN employs a request decomposition\nmethod to minimize batching overhead during LLM verification. Finally, SPIN\norchestrates speculation and verification phases by pipelining their executions\non GPUs to achieve further acceleration. Experimental results demonstrate that\nSPIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a\nperformance increase of approximately 2.28X.",

Extensive experiments across four endoscopic datasets demonstrate that\nEndo3DAC significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while\nrequiring fewer trainable parameters.

To address semantic-level\nfeature corruption, we bind each point feature to its superclass, preventing\nthe misprediction of things classes into visually dissimilar categories.\nAdditionally, to enhance robustness against local corruption caused by adverse\nweather, we define each LiDAR beam as a local region and propose a\nregularization term that aligns the clean data with its corrupted counterpart\nin feature space. NTN achieves state-of-the-art performance with a +2.6 mIoU\ngain on the SemanticKITTI-to-SemanticSTF benchmark and +7.9 mIoU on the\nSemanticPOSS-to-SemanticSTF benchmark. Notably, NTN achieves a +4.8 and +7.9\nmIoU improvement on \"things\" classes, respectively, highlighting its\neffectiveness.",

We further analyze the EPR\ncorrelations of these entangled resources, revealing that the photon-subtracted\nsqueezed state exhibits stronger EPR correlations than the original two-mode\nsqueezed vacuum state and the two-mode photon-added squeezed state.

Direct N-body simulation of Pop III clusters implies the\npossible formation and merger of intermediate-mass binary black holes (IMBBHs).\nThe gravitational wave signals could be detected by space-borne gravitational\nwave detectors like TianQin. Aims. This study evaluates the potential of\nTianQin in detecting IMBBHs from Pop III star clusters, focusing on key factors\nsuch as the detection horizon, detection number, and Fisher uncertainty.\nMethods. A Monte Carlo simulation is employed to derive IMBBH sources,\nutilizing the IMRPhenomD waveform model to simulate catalogs of observable\nIMBBH mergers. The mass and redshift distributions are derived from direct\nN-body simulations of IMBBHs in Population III star clusters. Detection numbers\nare determined by calculating the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of the simulated\nsignals and applying thresholds for detection. Fisher uncertainty is obtained\nthrough Fisher information matrix analysis. Results. The findings suggest that\nTianQin could achieve detection numbers within 5 years ranging from 1 in the\nmost pessimistic scenario to 253 in the most optimistic scenario.

Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since\nadapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision\nsupervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent\nchallenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and\nthe predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's\nlatent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid\nimage reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the\ndetail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while\npreventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the\ninherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and\nself-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU.\nIt not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained\ntexture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss.

Unfortunately, the magnetogram archives used\nby SATIRE-S to recover irradiance variations are also relatively short-lived\nand have short mutual overlapping periods, making it difficult to evaluate\ntheir consistency. We improve SATIRE-S total solar irradiance (TSI)\nreconstruction by firstly incorporating magnetograms from the Mt Wilson\nObservatory as well as unsigned magnetograms reconstructed from Meudon, Rome,\nand San Fernando Ca II K data, and secondly, by re-analysing all periods of\noverlaps between the various archives. Our combined daily irradiance\nreconstruction from all eight input archives returns an excellent agreement\nwith direct measurements of irradiance, in particular we find a correlation\ncoefficient of 0.98 when comparing to TSIS1/TIM (Total and Spectral Solar\nIrradiance Sensor Total Irradiance Monitor) data. The minimum-to-minimum TSI\ndifference between 1976 and 2019 is -0.2$\\pm0.17$~Wm$^{-2}$, while the TSI\ndifference between the 1986 and 2019 minima is statistically insignificant\n(-0.06$\\pm0.13$~Wm$^{-2}$). Our analysis also sheds light on the trend shown by\nthe TSI over the so-called ACRIM gap, disfavouring a hypothesised increasing\ntrend in TSI in that period. By including more direct and indirect magnetogram\ntime series, we have made the TSI reconstructed by SATIRE-S more robust and\naccurate.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing human-object interactions (HOI) from single images is\nfundamental in computer vision. Existing methods are primarily trained and\ntested on indoor scenes due to the lack of 3D data, particularly constrained by\nthe object variety, making it challenging to generalize to real-world scenes\nwith a wide range of objects. The limitations of previous 3D HOI datasets were\nprimarily due to the difficulty in acquiring 3D object assets. However, with\nthe development of 3D reconstruction from single images, recently it has become\npossible to reconstruct various objects from 2D HOI images. We therefore\npropose a pipeline for annotating fine-grained 3D humans, objects, and their\ninteractions from single images. We annotated 2.5k+ 3D HOI assets from existing\n2D HOI datasets and built the first open-vocabulary in-the-wild 3D HOI dataset\nOpen3DHOI, to serve as a future test set. Moreover, we design a novel\nGaussian-HOI optimizer, which efficiently reconstructs the spatial interactions\nbetween humans and objects while learning the contact regions. Besides the 3D\nHOI reconstruction, we also propose several new tasks for 3D HOI understanding\nto pave the way for future work.

Network analysis has emerged as a valuable approach in this\ncontext.\n  In this paper, we present WeirdFlows, a top-down search pipeline for\ndetecting potentially fraudulent transactions and non-compliant agents. In a\ntransaction network, fraud attempts are often based on complex transaction\npatterns that change over time to avoid detection. The WeirdFlows pipeline\nrequires neither an a priori set of patterns nor a training set.

The results, corroborated by ISP AFC\nexperts, highlight its effectiveness in identifying suspicious transactions and\nactors, particularly in the context of the economic sanctions imposed in the EU\nafter February 2022.

As data-driven\nlearning is intractable to comprehensively encapsulate diverse ranges of\nlayouts and open spaces, we propose teaching machines to identify relational\ncommonalities in 3D spaces. Instead of focusing on point-wise or object-wise\nrepresentations, we introduce 3D scene analogies, which are smooth maps between\n3D scene regions that align spatial relationships. Unlike well-studied single\ninstance-level maps, these scene-level maps smoothly link large scene regions,\npotentially enabling unique applications in trajectory transfer in AR/VR, long\ndemonstration transfer for imitation learning, and context-aware object\nrearrangement. To find 3D scene analogies, we propose neural contextual scene\nmaps, which extract descriptor fields summarizing semantic and geometric\ncontexts, and holistically align them in a coarse-to-fine manner for map\nestimation. This approach reduces reliance on individual feature points, making\nit robust to input noise or shape variations. Experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in identifying scene analogies and transferring\ntrajectories or object placements in diverse indoor scenes, indicating its\npotential for robotics and AR/VR applications.

The\neffectiveness of the built-in replay buffer, which acts as an \"internal\ndemonstrator\", is twofold: it accelerates learning and allows the algorithm to\nadapt to different tasks.

Previous research has primarily followed\ntwo approaches: one focuses on tackling specific subtasks of HDSA in isolation,\nsuch as table detection or reading order prediction, while the other adopts a\nunified framework that uses multiple branches or modules, each designed to\naddress a distinct task. In this work, we propose a unified relation prediction\napproach for HDSA, called UniHDSA, which treats various HDSA sub-tasks as\nrelation prediction problems and consolidates relation prediction labels into a\nunified label space. This allows a single relation prediction module to handle\nmultiple tasks simultaneously, whether at a page-level or document-level\nstructure analysis.

Utilizing on-policy samples, generated directly by the\npolicy model, typically results in better performance due to its distribution\nconsistency with the model compared to off-policy samples. This paper\nidentifies the quality of candidate preference samples as another critical\nfactor. While the quality of on-policy data is inherently constrained by the\ncapabilities of the policy model, off-policy data, which can be derived from\ndiverse sources, offers greater potential for quality despite experiencing\ndistribution shifts.

In this paper, we propose InCo-DPO, an\nefficient method for synthesizing preference data by integrating on-policy and\noff-policy data, allowing dynamic adjustments to balance distribution shifts\nand data quality, thus finding an optimal trade-off. Consequently, InCo-DPO\novercomes the limitations of distribution shifts in off-policy data and the\nquality constraints of on-policy data.

Furthermore, we prove\nthe finite-time global convergence of continuous-time QHD for non-smooth\nnon-convex problems under mild conditions (i.e., locally Lipschitz). In\naddition, we propose discrete-time QHD, a fully digitized implementation of QHD\nvia operator splitting (i.e., product formula).

First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features\nby applying an attention operation across all tokens. Second, they use the\nstandard Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which causes the text tokens to\noveremphasize certain types of tokens depending on their sequential orders.

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers and has a high\nmortality rate. Due to limited medical resources, developing machine learning\nmodels for gastric cancer recognition provides an efficient solution for\nmedical institutions. However, such models typically require large sample sizes\nfor training and testing, which can challenge patient privacy. Federated\nlearning offers an effective alternative by enabling model training across\nmultiple institutions without sharing sensitive patient data. This paper\naddresses the limited sample size of publicly available gastric cancer data\nwith a modified data processing method. This paper introduces FedSAF, a novel\nfederated learning algorithm designed to improve the performance of existing\nmethods, particularly in non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID)\ndata scenarios. FedSAF incorporates attention-based message passing and the\nFisher Information Matrix to enhance model accuracy, while a model splitting\nfunction reduces computation and transmission costs. Hyperparameter tuning and\nablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of this new algorithm, showing\nimprovements in test accuracy on gastric cancer datasets, with FedSAF\noutperforming existing federated learning methods like FedAMP, FedAvg, and\nFedProx. The framework's robustness and generalization ability were further\nvalidated across additional datasets (SEED, BOT, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10),\nachieving high performance in diverse environments.",

However, most existing methods address only a single type of\ndegradation (e.g., blur, noise, or haze) at a time, limiting their real-world\napplicability where multiple degradations often occur simultaneously. In this\npaper, we propose UniCoRN, a unified image restoration approach capable of\nhandling multiple degradation types simultaneously using a multi-head diffusion\nmodel. Specifically, we uncover the potential of low-level visual cues\nextracted from images in guiding a controllable diffusion model for real-world\nimage restoration and we design a multi-head control network adaptable via a\nmixture-of-experts strategy. We train our model without any prior assumption of\nspecific degradations, through a smartly designed curriculum learning recipe.\nAdditionally, we also introduce MetaRestore, a metalens imaging benchmark\ncontaining images with multiple degradations and artifacts. Extensive\nevaluations on several challenging datasets, including our benchmark,\ndemonstrate that our method achieves significant performance gains and can\nrobustly restore images with severe degradations.

This enables nuanced, region-grounded reasoning for both\nface-manipulated and fully synthetic content, and supports fine-grained queries\nsuch as \"Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?\"- capabilities beyond\npretrained MLLMs alone. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets\ndemonstrate that TruthLens sets a new benchmark in both forensic\ninterpretability and detection accuracy, generalizing to seen and unseen\nmanipulations alike.

Theories of charge\ntransport and heterogeneous electron transfer reveal that bioinspired electron\nbifurcation is possible in tailored semiconductor electrochemical junctions:\nthree-way n-p-electrolyte junctions.

The second way is through Kodaira-Spencer theory which gives a twisted\ncohomology argument to argue that $\\operatorname{dim}\n\\mathcal{M}\\left(\\mathbb{T} P^1, G\\right)=\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathfrak{g})$\nand we demonstrate their equivalence for the case of $SU(N)$. We show that we\ncan glue together several $\\mathbb{TP}^1$ to obtain $\\operatorname{dim}\n\\mathcal{M}\\left(\\Sigma_g, G\\right)=(g-1)\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathfrak{g})$\nthrough a foliated refinement of the Atiyah-Segal axioms. We leave several open\nquestions such as potential connections to JT gravity and anisotropic conformal\nfield theory.",

    "abstract": "We propose VideoRFSplat, a direct text-to-3D model leveraging a video\ngeneration model to generate realistic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for\nunbounded real-world scenes. To generate diverse camera poses and unbounded\nspatial extent of real-world scenes, while ensuring generalization to arbitrary\ntext prompts, previous methods fine-tune 2D generative models to jointly model\ncamera poses and multi-view images. However, these methods suffer from\ninstability when extending 2D generative models to joint modeling due to the\nmodality gap, which necessitates additional models to stabilize training and\ninference. In this work, we propose an architecture and a sampling strategy to\njointly model multi-view images and camera poses when fine-tuning a video\ngeneration model. Our core idea is a dual-stream architecture that attaches a\ndedicated pose generation model alongside a pre-trained video generation model\nvia communication blocks, generating multi-view images and camera poses through\nseparate streams. This design reduces interference between the pose and image\nmodalities. Additionally, we propose an asynchronous sampling strategy that\ndenoises camera poses faster than multi-view images, allowing rapidly denoised\nposes to condition multi-view generation, reducing mutual ambiguity and\nenhancing cross-modal consistency. Trained on multiple large-scale real-world\ndatasets (RealEstate10K, MVImgNet, DL3DV-10K, ACID), VideoRFSplat outperforms\nexisting text-to-3D direct generation methods that heavily depend on post-hoc\nrefinement via score distillation sampling, achieving superior results without\nsuch refinement.",

In many of these cases,\none needs to consider a collection of graphs, rather than a single network.\nThis could be a collection of distinct but related graphs, such as different\nprotein structures or graphs resulting from dynamic processes on the same\nnetwork. Examples of the latter include the evolution of social networks,\ncommunity-induced graphs, or ego-nets around various nodes. A significant\nchallenge commonly encountered is the absence of ground-truth labels for graphs\nor nodes, necessitating the use of unsupervised techniques to analyze such\nsystems. Moreover, even when ground-truth labels are available, many existing\ngraph machine learning methods depend on complex deep learning models,\ncomplicating model explainability and interpretability.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed\nmachine learning, enabling collaborative model training without sharing local\ndata, thereby preserving privacy and enhancing security. However, data\nheterogeneity resulting from differences across user behaviors, preferences,\nand device characteristics poses a significant challenge for federated\nlearning. Most previous works overlook the adjustment of aggregation weights,\nrelying solely on dataset size for weight assignment, which often leads to\nunstable convergence and reduced model performance. Recently, several studies\nhave sought to refine aggregation strategies by incorporating dataset\ncharacteristics and model alignment. However, adaptively adjusting aggregation\nweights while ensuring data security-without requiring additional proxy\ndata-remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Federated\nlearning with Adaptive Weight Aggregation (FedAWA), a novel method that\nadaptively adjusts aggregation weights based on client vectors during the\nlearning process. The client vector captures the direction of model updates,\nreflecting local data variations, and is used to optimize the aggregation\nweight without requiring additional datasets or violating privacy. By assigning\nhigher aggregation weights to local models whose updates align closely with the\nglobal optimization direction, FedAWA enhances the stability and generalization\nof the global model. Extensive experiments under diverse scenarios demonstrate\nthe superiority of our method, providing a promising solution to the challenges\nof data heterogeneity in federated learning.",

However, coordinating the\ntasks and motions of multiple robots is challenging due to issues, e.g., system\nuncertainty, task efficiency, algorithm scalability, and safety concerns. To\naddress these challenges, this paper studies multi-robot coordination and\nproposes APEX-MR, an asynchronous planning and execution framework designed to\nsafely and efficiently coordinate multiple robots to achieve cooperative\nassembly, e.g., LEGO assembly. In particular, APEX-MR provides a systematic\napproach to post-process multi-robot tasks and motion plans to enable robust\nasynchronous execution under uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that\nAPEX-MR can significantly speed up the execution time of many long-horizon LEGO\nassembly tasks by 48% compared to sequential planning and 36% compared to\nsynchronous planning on average. To further demonstrate performance, we deploy\nAPEX-MR in a dual-arm system to perform physical LEGO assembly. To our\nknowledge, this is the first robotic system capable of performing customized\nLEGO assembly using commercial LEGO bricks. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the dual-arm system, with APEX-MR, can safely coordinate robot\nmotions, efficiently collaborate, and construct complex LEGO structures.

Capturing dynamic scenes with handheld\nmonocular cameras, for instance, typically involves simultaneous movement of\nboth the camera and objects within a single exposure.

    "abstract": "Inspired by natural cooling processes, dissipation has become a promising\napproach for preparing low-energy states of quantum systems. However, the\npotential of dissipative protocols remains unclear beyond certain commuting\nHamiltonians. This work provides significant analytical and numerical insights\ninto the power of dissipation for preparing the ground state of non-commuting\nHamiltonians. For quasi-free dissipative dynamics, including certain 1D spin\nsystems with boundary dissipation, our results reveal a new connection between\nthe mixing time in trace distance and the spectral properties of a\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian, leading to an explicit and sharp bound on the mixing\ntime that scales polynomially with system size. For more general spin systems,\nwe develop a tensor network-based algorithm for constructing the Lindblad jump\noperator and for simulating the dynamics. Using this algorithm, we demonstrate\nnumerically that dissipative ground state preparation protocols can achieve\nrapid mixing for certain 1D local Hamiltonians under bulk dissipation, with a\nmixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. We then prove the\nrapid mixing result for certain weakly interacting spin and fermionic systems\nin arbitrary dimensions, extending recent results for high-temperature quantum\nGibbs samplers to the zero-temperature regime. Our theoretical approaches are\napplicable to systems with singular stationary states, and are thus expected to\nhave applications beyond the specific systems considered in this study.",

Modern AI systems such as\nLLMs are expanding into sensitive social contexts where fairness concerns\nbecome especially crucial. Since LLMs develop decision-making patterns by\ntraining on massive datasets of human-generated content, they naturally encode\nand perpetuate societal biases. While modifying training datasets and\nalgorithms is expensive and requires significant resources; post-processing\ntechniques-such as selectively deactivating neurons and attention heads in\npre-trained LLMs-can provide feasible and effective approaches to improve\nfairness. However, identifying the optimal subset of parameters to prune\npresents a combinatorial challenge within LLMs' immense parameter space,\nrequiring solutions that efficiently balance competing objectives across the\nfrontiers of model fairness and utility.\n  To address the computational challenges, we explore a search-based program\nrepair approach via randomized simulated annealing. Given the prohibitive\nevaluation costs in billion-parameter LLMs, we develop surrogate deep neural\nnetworks that efficiently model the relationship between attention head states\n(active/inactive) and their corresponding fairness/utility metrics. This allows\nus to perform optimization over the surrogate models and efficiently identify\noptimal subsets of attention heads for selective pruning rather than directly\nsearching through the LLM parameter space. This paper introduces Attention\nPruning, a fairness-aware surrogate simulated annealing approach to prune\nattention heads in LLMs that disproportionately contribute to bias while\nminimally impacting overall model utility.

Rapid innovation in observing technology, combined with the base\nbuilt by galaxy catalogs and atlases dating back centuries, sparked an\nexplosion of new observational programs driven by efforts to understand the\ndifferent processes driving galaxy evolution. This review aims to answer the\nfollowing science questions: (1) how have galaxy surveys evolved in the past 20\nyears, and how have traditional observational programs been affected by the\nrise of large panoramic surveys, (2) can the term \"nearby\" be quantified in the\ncontext of galaxy surveys, and (3) how complete is the coverage of the nearby\nuniverse and what areas hold the largest opportunity for future work? We define\na galaxy survey as a systematically obtained data set which aims to\ncharacterize a set of astronomical objects. Galaxy surveys can further be\nsubdivided based on the methods used to select the objects to observe, the\nproperties of the survey samples (e.g. distance or morphology), or the\nobserving strategies used. We focus on \\textit{pointed} nearby galaxy surveys,\nwhich we define as surveys which observe a specific sample of target galaxies.\nThrough a study of 43 nearby galaxy surveys, we find no standardized\nquantitative definition for \"nearby\" with surveys covering a wide range of\ndistances. We observe that since 2003, traditional targeted galaxy surveys have\nundergone a dramatic evolution, transitioning from large, statistical surveys\nto small, ultra-specific projects which complement the rise of large high\nresolution panoramic surveys. While wavelength regimes observable from the\nground (such as radio or optical wavelengths) host numerous surveys, the\nlargest opportunity for future work is within the less covered space-based\nwavelength regimes (especially ultraviolet and X-ray).",

    "abstract": "The evolution of programming languages from low-level assembly to high-level\nabstractions demonstrates a fundamental principle: by constraining how\nprogrammers express computation and enriching semantic information at the\nlanguage level, we can make previously undecidable program properties tractable\nfor optimization. Building on the insight of this undecidability-lessening\neffect, we introduce Object-Spatial Programming (OSP), a novel programming\nmodel that extends Object-Oriented Programming by introducing\ntopologically-aware class constructs called archetypes. OSP fundamentally\ninverts the traditional relationship between data and computation, enabling\ncomputation to move to data through four specialized archetypes: object\nclasses, node classes (discrete data locations), edge classes (first-class\nrelationships), and walker classes (mobile computational entities). By making\ntopological relationships and traversal patterns explicit at the language\nlevel, OSP transforms previously opaque program behaviors into observable,\noptimizable patterns. This semantic enhancement enables runtime systems to make\ninformed decisions about data locality, parallel execution, and distribution\nstrategies based on explicit topology, while providing programmers with\nintuitive abstractions for modeling complex systems where connection topology\nis central to the computational model. The paradigm addresses fundamental\nlimitations in traditional programming models when representing agent-based\nsystems, social networks, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state\nmachines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems, demonstrating\nhow thoughtful abstraction design can simultaneously enhance programmer\nexpressiveness and enable sophisticated system-level optimizations across the\ncomputing stack.",

However, most existing models still struggle to maintain 3D\nconsistency, temporal coherence, and motion accuracy. A key reason for these\nshortcomings is the limited representation ability of commonly used control\nsignals(e.g., landmarks, depth maps, etc.). In addition, the lack of diversity\nin identity and pose variations in public datasets further hinders progress in\nthis area. In this paper, we analyze the shortcomings of current control\nsignals and introduce a novel control signal representation that is\noptimizable, dense, expressive, and 3D consistent. Our method embeds a\nlearnable neural Gaussian onto a parametric head surface, which greatly\nenhances the consistency and expressiveness of diffusion-based head models.\nRegarding the dataset, we synthesize a large-scale dataset with multiple poses\nand identities. In addition, we use real/synthetic labels to effectively\ndistinguish real and synthetic data, minimizing the impact of imperfections in\nsynthetic data on the generated head images. Extensive experiments show that\nour model outperforms existing methods in terms of realism, expressiveness, and\n3D consistency.

The spectral analysis of Swift/BAT and Fermi/GBM\nreveals a soft prompt spectrum with a low-energy photon index of $-1.18$ and a\npeak energy of 33 keV, and the isotropic energy is $1.4\\times10^{52}~{\\rm\nerg}$. The prompt emission of GRB 250101A aligns with Type II GRBs in the Amati\nrelation. Meanwhile, our analysis indicates that GRB 250101A is an X-ray-rich\nor X-ray-dominated GRB, with intrinsic properties suggesting that it is\nrelatively softer than most classical GRBs. Optical observation with Mephisto,\nbeginning 197 s post-trigger, shows a single power-law decay in $uvgriz$ bands,\nwith $F_{\\nu,\\mathrm{obs}} \\propto t^{-0.76} \\nu^{-1.21}$.

In this paper, we propose a federated\nlearning algorithm, which is called FedCET, to ensure accurate convergence even\nunder heterogeneous distributions of data across clients. Inspired by the\ndistributed optimization algorithm NIDS, we use learning rates to weight\ninformation received from local clients to eliminate the ''client-drift''. We\nprove that under appropriate learning rates, FedCET can ensure linear\nconvergence to the exact solution.

In\nDFENet, two frequency selectors are employed, each selecting a set of frequency\ncomponents for processing along separate paths. One path focuses on generating\nmissing information through detail refinement in spatial domain, while the\nother aims at suppressing undesirable frequencies with the guidance of CFA\nimages in frequency domain. Multi-level frequency supervision with a stagewise\ntraining strategy is employed to further improve the reconstruction\nperformance.

    "abstract": "The key challenge in multispectral radiation thermometry is accurately\nmeasuring emissivity. Traditional constrained optimization methods often fail\nto meet practical requirements in terms of precision, efficiency, and noise\nresistance. However, the continuous advancement of neural networks in data\nprocessing offers a potential solution to this issue. This paper presents a\nmultispectral radiation thermometry algorithm that combines Transformer, LSTM\n(Long Short-Term Memory), and SVM (Support Vector Machine) to mitigate the\nimpact of emissivity, thereby enhancing accuracy and noise resistance. In\nsimulations, compared to the BP neural network algorithm, GIM-LSTM, and\nTransformer-LSTM algorithms, the Transformer-LSTM-SVM algorithm demonstrates an\nimprovement in accuracy of 1.23%, 0.46% and 0.13%, respectively, without noise.\nWhen 5% random noise is added, the accuracy increases by 1.39%, 0.51%, and\n0.38%, respectively. Finally, experiments confirmed that the maximum\ntemperature error using this method is less than 1%, indicating that the\nalgorithm offers high accuracy, fast processing speed, and robust noise\nresistance. These characteristics make it well-suited for real-time\nhigh-temperature measurements with multi-wavelength thermometry equipment.",

There are two perspectives\nof input data widely used in DTI prediction: Intrinsic data represents how\ndrugs or targets are constructed, and extrinsic data represents how drugs or\ntargets are related to other biological entities. However, any of the two\nperspectives of input data can be scarce for some drugs or targets, especially\nfor those unpopular or newly discovered.

Our key idea is to use Donaldson-Sun theory on\nlocal Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the\ntheory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.\n  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertion -- namely,\nthe existence of a canonical (local) torus action -- assuming that the\nDonaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular\n(hyper)Kahler metrics. Conversely, our results can be also used to study local\nbehaviour of such metrics around the germ. For instance, we show that such\nsingular hyperKahler metric around isolated singularity is close to a metric\ncone in a polynomial order, and satisfies $r=1$ i.e., has a good canonical\n(local) $\\mathbb{C}^*$-action, as the complexification of the cone metric\nrescaling.

Our training method simultaneously improves\ngrammatical correctness and fidelity to game concepts by introducing both\ngrammar rewards and concept rewards. Furthermore, we adopt a two-stage training\nstrategy where Reinforcement Learning (RL) is applied following Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms baseline methods using SFT alone. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/tsunehiko/rlgdg",

Semiconductors with the opposite electronic configuration, namely an\nantibonding VBM and a bonding CBM, are here termed ``anti-gap semiconductors\".\nThey have been theoretically proposed to exhibit excellent optoelectronic\nproperties because of their strong tolerance to defects. However, no anti-gap\nsemiconductors have been identified so far, despite a known list of\nsemiconductors with an antibonding VBM. Here, we use high-throughput\ncomputation to identify over 100 anti-gap semiconductors. From this group, we\nanalyze the transition metal dichalcogenide MX$_2$ (M=Hf, Zr; X=S, Se) family\nin detail. In addition to verifying their defect tolerance for both electrons\nand holes using first-principles simulations, we also discovered that\nphotoexcitation of charge carriers can lead to significant lattice stiffening\nand increased thermal conductivity in anti-gap semiconductors, which can be\npotentially used as photo-driven thermal switches. Our work analyzes the\nformation of the anti-gap electronic structure and showcases their unusual\nphotoinduced lattice dynamics that can have a potential impact on their\nphotophysical applications.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work is to develop an approach that enables Unmanned Aerial\nSystem (UAS) to efficiently learn to navigate in large-scale urban environments\nand transfer their acquired expertise to novel environments. To achieve this,\nwe propose a meta-curriculum training scheme. First, meta-training allows the\nagent to learn a master policy to generalize across tasks. The resulting model\nis then fine-tuned on the downstream tasks. We organize the training curriculum\nin a hierarchical manner such that the agent is guided from coarse to fine\ntowards the target task. In addition, we introduce Incremental Self-Adaptive\nReinforcement learning (ISAR), an algorithm that combines the ideas of\nincremental learning and meta-reinforcement learning (MRL). In contrast to\ntraditional reinforcement learning (RL), which focuses on acquiring a policy\nfor a specific task, MRL aims to learn a policy with fast transfer ability to\nnovel tasks. However, the MRL training process is time consuming, whereas our\nproposed ISAR algorithm achieves faster convergence than the conventional MRL\nalgorithm. We evaluate the proposed methodologies in simulated environments and\ndemonstrate that using this training philosophy in conjunction with the ISAR\nalgorithm significantly improves the convergence speed for navigation in\nlarge-scale cities and the adaptation proficiency in novel environments.",

Although some venues have banned LLM-assisted reviewing,\nenforcement remains difficult as existing detection tools cannot reliably\ndistinguish between fully generated reviews and those merely polished with AI\nassistance. In this work, we address the challenge of detecting LLM-generated\nreviews. We consider the approach of performing indirect prompt injection via\nthe paper's PDF, prompting the LLM to embed a covert watermark in the generated\nreview, and subsequently testing for presence of the watermark in the review.\nWe identify and address several pitfalls in na\\\"ive implementations of this\napproach. Our primary contribution is a rigorous watermarking and detection\nframework that offers strong statistical guarantees. Specifically, we introduce\nwatermarking schemes and hypothesis tests that control the family-wise error\nrate across multiple reviews, achieving higher statistical power than standard\ncorrections such as Bonferroni, while making no assumptions about the nature of\nhuman-written reviews. We explore multiple indirect prompt injection\nstrategies--including font-based embedding and obfuscated prompts--and evaluate\ntheir effectiveness under various reviewer defense scenarios. Our experiments\nfind high success rates in watermark embedding across various LLMs. We also\nempirically find that our approach is resilient to common reviewer defenses,\nand that the bounds on error rates in our statistical tests hold in practice.\nIn contrast, we find that Bonferroni-style corrections are too conservative to\nbe useful in this setting.",

This type of reward function can potentially obtain\na policy that achieves the goal, but the process by which the goal is reached\nis not evaluated. However, process to reach a destination is important for\nautomated driving, such as keeping velocity, avoiding risk, retaining distance\nfrom other cars, keeping comfortable for passengers. Therefore, the reward\nfunction designed by the proposed scheme is suited for automated driving by\nevaluating driving process. The effects of the proposed scheme are demonstrated\non simulated circuit driving and highway cruising. Asynchronous Advantage\nActor-Critic is used, and models are trained under some situations for\ngeneralization. The result shows that appropriate driving positions are\nobtained, such as traveling on the inside of corners, and rapid deceleration to\nturn along sharp curves. In highway cruising, the ego vehicle becomes able to\nchange lane in an environment where there are other vehicles with suitable\ndeceleration to avoid catching up to a front vehicle, and acceleration so that\na rear vehicle does not catch up to the ego vehicle.",

This is due to the need to: (a) reach statistical\nsteadiness by physically advecting errors in the initial field sufficiently far\ndownstream, and (b) gather a sufficient sample of fluctuating flow data to\nestimate time-averaged quantities of interest. We present a machine\nlearning-based initialization method that aims to reduce the cost of transient\nsolve by providing more accurate initial fields. Through a case study in\nautomotive aerodynamics on a 17M-cell unsteady incompressible RANS simulation,\nwe evaluate three proposed ML-based initialization strategies against existing\nmethods. Here, we demonstrate 50% reductions in time-to-convergence compared to\ntraditional uniform and potential flow-based initializations. Two ML-based\ninitialization strategies are recommended for general use: (1) a hybrid method\ncombining ML predictions with potential flow solutions, and (2) an approach\nintegrating ML predictions with uniform flow. Both strategies enable CFD\nsolvers to achieve convergence times comparable to computationally-expensive\nsteady RANS initializations, while requiring far less wall-clock time to\ncompute the initialization field. Notably, these improvements are achieved\nusing an ML model trained on a different dataset of diverse automotive\ngeometries, demonstrating generalization capabilities relevant to specific\nindustrial application areas. Because this Hybrid-ML workflow only modifies the\ninputs to an existing CFD solver, rather than modifying the solver itself, it\ncan be applied to existing CFD workflows with relatively minimal changes; this\nprovides a practical approach to accelerating industrial CFD simulations using\nexisting ML surrogate models.",

    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable, security and\nsafety evaluation are crucial. While current red teaming approaches have made\nstrides in assessing LLM vulnerabilities, they often rely heavily on human\ninput and lack comprehensive coverage of emerging attack vectors. This paper\nintroduces AutoRedTeamer, a novel framework for fully automated, end-to-end red\nteaming against LLMs. AutoRedTeamer combines a multi-agent architecture with a\nmemory-guided attack selection mechanism to enable continuous discovery and\nintegration of new attack vectors. The dual-agent framework consists of a red\nteaming agent that can operate from high-level risk categories alone to\ngenerate and execute test cases and a strategy proposer agent that autonomously\ndiscovers and implements new attacks by analyzing recent research. This modular\ndesign allows AutoRedTeamer to adapt to emerging threats while maintaining\nstrong performance on existing attack vectors. We demonstrate AutoRedTeamer's\neffectiveness across diverse evaluation settings, achieving 20% higher attack\nsuccess rates on HarmBench against Llama-3.1-70B while reducing computational\ncosts by 46% compared to existing approaches. AutoRedTeamer also matches the\ndiversity of human-curated benchmarks in generating test cases, providing a\ncomprehensive, scalable, and continuously evolving framework for evaluating the\nsecurity of AI systems.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution yield maps for manually harvested crops are impractical to\ngenerate on commercial scales because yield monitors are available only for\nmechanical harvesters. However, precision crop management relies on accurately\ndetermining spatial and temporal yield variability. This study presents the\ndevelopment of an integrated system for precision yield estimation and mapping\nfor manually harvested strawberries. Conventional strawberry picking carts were\ninstrumented with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU), and load cells to record real-time geo-tagged harvest\ndata and cart motion. Extensive data were collected in two strawberry fields in\nCalifornia, USA, during a harvest season. To address the inconsistencies and\nerrors caused by the sensors and the manual harvesting process, a robust data\nprocessing pipeline was developed by integrating supervised deep learning\nmodels with unsupervised algorithms. The pipeline was used to estimate the\nyield distribution and generate yield maps for season-long harvests at the\ndesired grid resolution. The estimated yield distributions were used to\ncalculate two metrics: the total mass harvested over specific row segments and\nthe total mass of trays harvested. The metrics were compared to ground truth\nand achieved accuracies of 90.48% and 94.05%, respectively. Additionally, the\naccuracy of the estimated yield based on the number of trays harvested per cart\nfor season-long harvest was better than 94%. It showed a strong correlation\n(Pearson r = 0.99) with the actual number of counted trays in both fields. The\nproposed system provides a scalable and practical solution for specialty crops,\nassisting in efficient yield estimation and mapping, field management, and\nlabor management for sustainable crop production.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing prevalence of chiplet systems in high-performance\ncomputing applications, the number of design options has increased\ndramatically. Instead of chips defaulting to a single die design, now there are\noptions for 2.5D and 3D stacking along with a plethora of choices regarding\nconfigurations and processes. For chiplet-based designs, high-impact decisions\nsuch as those regarding the number of chiplets, the design partitions, the\ninterconnect types, and other factors must be made early in the development\nprocess. In this work, we describe an open-source tool, CATCH, that can be used\nto guide these early design choices. We also present case studies showing some\nof the insights we can draw by using this tool. We look at case studies on\noptimal chip size, defect density, test cost, IO types, assembly processes, and\nsubstrates.",
