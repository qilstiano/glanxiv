    "abstract": "For the SPT-type Hall thrusters, the magnetic structure with magnetic\nconductive columns leads inherent to azimuthally inhomogeneous magnetic\nconfigurations. This azimuthal magnetic inhomogeneity may impact electron\nazimuthal closed-drift motion and cross-field transport characteristics. This\nstudy systematically investigates the effects of azimuthal magnetic field\ngradient on high frequency azimuthal instability and associated anomalous\nelectron transport through 2D radial-azimuthal Particle-in-Cell (PIC)\nsimulations. The results reveal dual mechanisms of magnetic inhomogeneity on\nelectron cyclotron drift instability (ECDI) characteristics: (1) The azimuthal\ndrift velocity distribution becomes modulated by the magnetic field\ninhomogeneity, with increased average drift velocity enhancing ECDI intensity\nunder stronger inhomogeneity; (2) Simultaneously, the ECDI wavenumber spectrum\nbroadens with elevated magnetic inhomogeneity, reducing discrete ECDI spectral\npeaks. Under the dual influence of magnetic field inhomogeneity, when the\ninhomogeneity level is below 5%, the ECDI saturation amplitude and electron\ncross field mobility remains largely unchanged. However, a notable reduction of\n13.4% in ECDI saturation intensity and a 15.7% decrease in electron mobility\nare observed when magnetic field inhomogeneity reaches 10%.",

    "abstract": "The traditional model specification of stepped-wedge cluster-randomized\ntrials assumes a homogeneous treatment effect across time while adjusting for\nfixed-time effects. However, when treatment effects vary over time, the\nconstant effect estimator may be biased. In the general setting of\nstepped-wedge cluster-randomized trials with multiple interventions, we derive\nthe expected value of the constant effect estimator when the true treatment\neffects depend on exposure time periods. Applying this result to concurrent and\nfactorial stepped wedge designs, we show that the estimator represents a\nweighted average of exposure-time-specific treatment effects, with weights that\nare not necessarily uniform across exposure periods. Extensive simulation\nstudies reveal that ignoring time heterogeneity can result in biased estimates\nand poor coverage of the average treatment effect. In this study, we examine\ntwo models designed to accommodate multiple interventions with time-varying\ntreatment effects: (1) a time-varying fixed treatment effect model, which\nallows treatment effects to vary by exposure time but remain fixed for each\ntime point, and (2) a random treatment effect model, where the time-varying\ntreatment effects are modeled as random deviations from an overall mean. In the\nsimulations considered in this study, concurrent designs generally achieve\nhigher power than factorial designs under a time-varying fixed treatment effect\nmodel, though the differences are modest. Finally, we apply the constant effect\nmodel and both time-varying treatment effect models to data from the\nPrognosticating Outcomes and Nudging Decisions in the Electronic Health Record\n(PONDER) trial.

    "abstract": "As cyber threats continue to evolve, securing edge networks has become\nincreasingly challenging due to their distributed nature and resource\nlimitations. Many AI-driven threat detection systems rely on complex deep\nlearning models, which, despite their high accuracy, suffer from two major\ndrawbacks: lack of interpretability and high computational cost. Black-box AI\nmodels make it difficult for security analysts to understand the reasoning\nbehind their predictions, limiting their practical deployment. Moreover,\nconventional deep learning techniques demand significant computational\nresources, rendering them unsuitable for edge devices with limited processing\npower. To address these issues, this study introduces an Explainable and\nLightweight AI (ELAI) framework designed for real-time cyber threat detection\nin edge networks. Our approach integrates interpretable machine learning\nalgorithms with optimized lightweight deep learning techniques, ensuring both\ntransparency and computational efficiency. The proposed system leverages\ndecision trees, attention-based deep learning, and federated learning to\nenhance detection accuracy while maintaining explainability. We evaluate ELAI\nusing benchmark cybersecurity datasets, such as CICIDS and UNSW-NB15, assessing\nits performance across diverse cyberattack scenarios. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high detection rates with\nminimal false positives, all while significantly reducing computational demands\ncompared to traditional deep learning methods. The key contributions of this\nwork include: (1) a novel interpretable AI-based cybersecurity model tailored\nfor edge computing environments, (2) an optimized lightweight deep learning\napproach for real-time cyber threat detection, and (3) a comprehensive analysis\nof explainability techniques in AI-driven cybersecurity applications.",

One dominant approach is to evaluate whether human-derived\nmeasures are predicted by a model's output: that is, the end-product of a\nforward pass. However, recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have\nbegun to reveal the internal processes that give rise to model outputs, raising\nthe question of whether models might use human-like processing strategies.\nHere, we investigate the relationship between real-time processing in humans\nand layer-time dynamics of computation in Transformers, testing 20 open-source\nmodels in 6 domains. We first explore whether forward passes show mechanistic\nsignatures of competitor interference, taking high-level inspiration from\ncognitive theories. We find that models indeed appear to initially favor a\ncompeting incorrect answer in the cases where we would expect decision conflict\nin humans. We then systematically test whether forward-pass dynamics predict\nsignatures of processing in humans, above and beyond properties of the model's\noutput probability distribution. We find that dynamic measures improve\nprediction of human processing measures relative to static final-layer\nmeasures. Moreover, across our experiments, larger models do not always show\nmore human-like processing patterns.

This note aims to make the connection between\nstabilizer circuits and Boolean linear algebra even more explicit. To do this,\nwe extend the stabilizer tableau formalism to include stabilizer tableau\ndescriptions of arbitrary stabilizer operations (Clifford channels). Finding\nthe tableau corresponding to the composition of two channels becomes a linear\nalgebra problem. Any stabilizer circuit rewrites to a diagram with stabilizer\ntableaux on vertices, contracting an edge means to take the composition of\nchannels, to compute the result of the circuit means to fully contract the\ndiagram. Thus, simulating stabilizer circuits reduces to a sequence of Gaussian\neliminations.

We give three representative application examples: Tuning\nhyper-parameters in machine learning; choosing the parameters in an approximate\ndynamic programming (ADP) controller; and adjusting the parameters in an\noptimization based financial trading engine via back-testing, i.e., simulation\non historical data. While differentiating through convex optimization problems\nis not new, CVXPYgen is the first tool that generates custom C code for the\ntask, and increases the computation speed by about an order of magnitude in\nmost applications, compared to CVXPYlayers, a general-purpose tool for\ndifferentiating through convex optimization problems.",

VideoPASTA trains\nmodels to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully crafted\nadversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or\ncross-frame relationships. With only 7,020 preference pairs and Direct\nPreference Optimization, VideoPASTA enables models to learn robust\nrepresentations that capture fine-grained spatial details and long-range\ntemporal dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VideoPASTA is model agnostic\nand significantly improves performance, for example, achieving gains of up to\n3.8% on LongVideoBench, 4.1% on VideoMME, and 4.0% on MVBench, when applied to\nvarious state-of-the-art Video-LLMs. These results demonstrate that targeted\nalignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications,\neffectively addresses core video-language challenges.

Specifically, through a series of\nalterations to the underlying constraints and objective, the QCQP associated\nwith a given design problem is gradually transformed so that it becomes\nstrongly dual. Once equivalence between primal and dual programs is achieved, a\nmaterial geometry is inferred from the solution of the modified QCQP.

An exploratory implementation of the framework, presented in a partner\nmanuscript, is found to achieve dramatic improvements for the exemplary\nphotonic design task of enhancing the amount of power extracted from a dipole\nsource near the boundary of a structured material region -- roughly an order of\nmagnitude compared to randomly initialized adjoint-based topology optimization\nfor areas surpassing $10~\\lambda^{2}$.",

Results indicate that kBERT achieves the highest\ncoherence (Cv = 0.53) and distinct topic separation (IRBOavg = 1.00),\noutperforming all other models in short-text healthcare feedback analysis. Our\nfindings emphasize the importance of embedding-based techniques for topic\nidentification and highlight the need for context-aware models in healthcare\nanalytics.",

To handle both shocks\nand material interfaces, a positivity-preserving ENO-type scheme is coupled\nwith multi-phase interface regularization terms. The positivity-preserving\nlimiter is conservative and is applied locally for minimal degradation of the\nbaseline ENO-type scheme. The interface regularization terms are extended from\nthe conservative diffuse interface (CDI) model to accommodate multi-phase,\nmulti-component flows. The ENO-type scheme is designed to be consistent with\nthe thermodynamic equilibrium assumptions of the four-equation multi-phase\nmodel, naturally enforcing the interface equilibrium condition - preventing\noscillations in pressure, velocity, and temperature around isothermal material\ninterfaces - without requiring additional equations for volume fraction or\nmixture equation of state parameters, as is commonly done for the five-equation\nmodel. Additionally, non-dilute species diffusion models are extended to the\nmulti-phase, multi-component setting. We show that this consistent framework is\nequally applicable for regimes ranging from single-phase to multi-phase\nmulti-component flows.

Using a grid of general\ncirculation models (GCMs) with varying irradiation temperature (1500 K - 4000\nK) and prescriptions of cloud formation, we simulate 3D ingress/egress and\nmorning/evening-limb transmission spectra. We aim to assess the impact that\nclouds, 3D temperature structure, and non-uniform distribution of gases have on\nthe observed spectra, and how these inhomogeneities can be identified. A second\ngoal is to assess the relative merits of two separate methods (ingress/egress\nv.s. morning/evening-limb spectroscopy) for isolating atmospheric asymmetries.\nFrom our models, it is evident that an east-west temperature difference is the\nleading order effect for producing ingress/egress or morning/evening-limb\nspectral differences. We additionally find that clouds contribute strongly to\nthe observed limb asymmetry at moderate irradiation temperatures in our grid\n($\\sim 2000 \\mathrm{K} < T_{\\mathrm{irr}} < 3500 \\mathrm{K}). At lower\ntemperatures clouds equally dominate the optical depth on both limbs, while at\nhigher temperatures the entire terminator region remains cloud-free.

In such a setting,\nwe consider the largely open question of efficiently computing a suitably\ndefined {\\em quasi}-Nash equilibrium (QNE) via a single-step gradient-response\nframework. First, under a suitably defined quadratic growth property, we prove\nthat the stochastic synchronous gradient-response ({\\bf SSGR}) scheme and its\nasynchronous counterpart ({\\bf SAGR}) are characterized by almost sure\nconvergence to a QNE and a sublinear rate guarantee. Notably, when a\npotentiality requirement is overlaid under a somewhat stronger\npseudomonotonicity condition, this claim can be made for NE, rather than QNE.\nSecond, under a weak sharpness property, we show that the deterministic\nsynchronous variant displays a {\\em linear} rate of convergence sufficiently\nclose to a QNE by leveraging a geometric decay in steplengths. This suggests\nthe development of a two-stage scheme with global non-asymptotic sublinear\nrates and a local linear rate.

    "abstract": "Consider the following discrete evacuation model. The evacuation terrain is\nmodeled by a simple graph $G=(V,E)$ whose certain vertices $X\\subseteq V$ are\ncalled \\emph{exits}. Initially, each vertex is either \\emph{empty} or\n\\emph{occupied} by an agent. We assume that each vertex has a unique \\emph{id}\n(and therefore the agents do have unique ids), each agent has finite but\narbitrarily large memory, and the graph is initially stored in the memory of\neach agent. In other words, the agents do know the topology of the network\nalong with the locations of the exits, but they do not know the initial\npositions nor the quantity of other agents. The time is divided into\n\\emph{steps}; in each step any pair of agents present at vertices at a distance\nof at most two can exchange an arbitrary number of messages, and then each\nagent can either make a move or stay put. The agents should make moves in a\ncollision-free manner, i.e., no two agents can be located at the same vertex in\nthe same step. At the end of each step, any agent located at an exit\n\\emph{evacuates}, i.e., it is removed from the graph. The goal is to provide an\nalgorithm to the agents (referred to as an evacuation strategy) that ensures\nthe evacuation of all agents and minimizes the number of steps.\n  This work provides an algorithmic framework that allows constructing valid\nevacuation strategies for arbitrary input graphs. Specifically, we focus on the\nproperties of the input graphs that lead to evacuation strategies with constant\ncompetitive ratios. In particular, we describe an application of the above\nframework that gives an asymptotically optimal evacuation for grids (and by\nextension hexagonal or triangular grids as well).",

    "abstract": "While long context support of large language models has extended their\nabilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes\ncrucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely\nadopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by\nevicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores\nas proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of\nattention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the\ninformation about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this\npaper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of\ncached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction\nerror due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and\nvalue vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of\nattention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as\na meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We\nshow that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based\nmethods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the\nimportance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.",

    "abstract": "Environmental crisis remains a global challenge that affects public health\nand environmental quality. Despite extensive research, accurately forecasting\nenvironmental change trends to inform targeted policies and assess prediction\nefficiency remains elusive. Conventional methods for multivariate time series\n(MTS) analysis often fail to capture the complex dynamics of environmental\nchange. To address this, we introduce an innovative meta-learning MTS model,\nMMformer with Adaptive Transferable Multi-head Attention (ATMA), which combines\nself-attention and meta-learning for enhanced MTS forecasting. Specifically,\nMMformer is used to model and predict the time series of seven air quality\nindicators across 331 cities in China from January 2018 to June 2021 and the\ntime series of precipitation and temperature at 2415 monitoring sites during\nthe summer (276 days) from 2012 to 2014, validating the network's ability to\nperform and forecast MTS data successfully. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat in these datasets, the MMformer model reaching SOTA outperforms\niTransformer, Transformer, and the widely used traditional time series\nprediction algorithm SARIMAX in the prediction of MTS, reducing by 50\\% in MSE,\n20\\% in MAE as compared to others in air quality datasets, reducing by 20\\% in\nMAPE except SARIMAX. Compared with Transformer and SARIMAX in the climate\ndatasets, MSE, MAE, and MAPE are decreased by 30\\%, and there is an improvement\ncompared to iTransformer. This approach represents a significant advance in our\nability to forecast and respond to dynamic environmental quality challenges in\ndiverse urban and rural environments. Its predictive capabilities provide\nvaluable public health and environmental quality information, informing\ntargeted interventions.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the relationship between solar coronal holes and open-field\nregions using three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations\ncombined with remote-sensing observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory\n(SDO). Our numerical simulations reveal that magnetically open regions in the\ncorona can exhibit brightness comparable to quiet regions, challenging the\nconventional view that open-field regions are inherently dark coronal holes. We\nfind that the coronal brightness is primarily determined by the total energy\ninput from photospheric magnetic activities, such as the small-scale dynamo,\nrather than differences in dissipative processes within the corona. Using\nsynthesized EUV intensity maps, we show that brightness thresholds commonly\nused to identify coronal holes may overlook open-field regions, especially at\nlower spatial resolutions. Observational analysis utilizing SDO/HMI and AIA\nsynoptic maps supports our simulation results, demonstrating that magnetic\nfield extrapolation techniques, such as the Potential Field Source Surface\n(PFSS) model, are sensitive to the chosen parameters, including the source\nsurface height. We suggest that discrepancies in estimates of open magnetic\nflux (the ``open flux problem'') arise both from the modeling assumptions in\ncoronal magnetic field extrapolation and systematic biases in solar surface\nmagnetic field observations. Our findings indicate the need for reconsidering\ncriteria used to identify coronal holes as indicators of open-field regions to\nbetter characterize the solar open magnetic flux.",

One such example is\nthe Dark SRF experiment, which utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF)\ncavities with quality factors of $Q\\sim10^{10}$. Microscopic deformations of\nthe cavity lead to stochastic jittering of its resonant frequency with\namplitude 20 times its linewidth. Naively, one may expect this to lead to a\nlarge suppression in accumulated power. In this work, we study in detail the\neffects of frequency instability on high-quality resonant systems, utilizing\nthe Dark SRF experiment as a case study. We show that the timescale of\njittering is crucial to determining its effect on power accumulation. Namely,\nwhen the resonant frequency varies sufficiently quickly, the system accumulates\npower as if there were no jittering at all. This implies that the sensitivity\nof a jittering resonator is comparable to that of a stable resonator. In the\ncase of Dark SRF, we find that jittering only induces a $\\sim 10\\%$ loss in\npower.

To cope with these issues, we first\npropose simple approximations in estimating the swapping outcome between two\nentanglement distributions that can run in constant time, thereby providing an\nefficient approach for evaluating and comparing different swapping orders,\nallowing us to solve the problem exactly for small paths. Second, as the number\nof possible orders grows exponentially with the number of repeaters in the\npath, we develop an efficient heuristic based on the greedy selection of nodes\nto sequentially perform swaps according to their swapping scores, defined as\nthe expected number of entanglements resulting from their swaps. The scores are\nlocal but dynamic in the sense that they depend not just on the entanglement\ndistributions available on the path but also on prior swapping decisions.\nFinally, we illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model\nand approach through extensive experimentation conducted using a general\nquantum network simulator.",

We present ALMA observations of\nthe Herbig Ae disk HD 100453 that uncover a rich reservoir of COMs sublimating\nfrom the dust cavity edge. In addition to CH3OH, we detect 13CH3OH for the\nfirst time in a Class II disk, revealing a factor of three enhancement of 13C\nin the disk large organics. A tentative detection of CH2DOH is also reported,\nresulting in a D/H of 1-2%, which is consistent with the expected deuterium\nenhancement from the low temperature CH3OH formation in molecular clouds and\nwith the deuteration of CH3OH measured in comets. The detection of\nmethyl-formate (CH3OCHO), at only a few percent level of CH3OH is an order of\nmagnitude lower compared to claims towards other organic-rich Herbig Ae disks\nbut is more in line with organic abundance patterns towards the earlier stages\nof star formation. Together these data provide multiple lines of evidence that\ndisks, and therefore the planet and comet-forming materials, contain inherited\ninterstellar ices and perhaps the strongest evidence to date that much of the\ninterstellar organic ice composition survives the early stages of planet\nformation.",

This paper presents a\ngeneralized, reconfigurable on-chip training and inference architecture for\nHDC, utilizing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) based\ncontent-addressable memory (SOT-CAM). The proposed SOT-CAM array integrates\nstorage and computation, enabling in-memory execution of key HDC operations:\nbinding (bitwise multiplication), permutation (bit shfiting), and efficient\nsimilarity search. Furthermore, a novel bit drop method-based permutation\nbacked by holographic information representation of HDC is proposed which\nreplaces conventional permutation execution in hardware resulting in a 6x\nlatency improvement, and an HDC-specific adder reduces energy and area by 1.51X\nand 1.43x, respectively. To mitigate the parasitic effect of interconnects in\nthe similarity search, a four-stage voltage scaling scheme has been proposed to\nensure an accurate representation of the Hamming distance.

The\nX-ray reflection features are strongly influenced by the accretion-inversion\nphenomenon expected in SMBH binaries, which results in a wide range of\nionization conditions in the two mini-disks.

Specifically, vehicles send and\nreceive sensor perceptions to/from other vehicles to extend perception beyond\ntheir own sensing range. However, transmitting large volumes of data can be\nchallenging for current V2X communication technologies, so data compression\nrepresents a crucial solution to reduce the message size and link congestion.\nIn this paper, we present a statistical characterization of automotive data,\nfocusing on LiDAR sensors.

The number of such regions - which we call \"causal pieces\" - is a\nmeasure of the approximation capabilities of SNNs.

Moreover, we find that feedforward SNNs with purely positive\nweights exhibit a surprisingly high number of causal pieces, allowing them to\nachieve competitive performance levels on benchmark tasks.

Among the various tasks, virtual\ntry-on and multimodal fashion image editing -- which utilizes diverse input\nmodalities such as text, garment sketches, and body poses -- have become a key\narea of research. Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such\ngenerative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, most\nexisting virtual try-on methods rely on having a specific garment input, which\nis often impractical in real-world scenarios where users may only provide\ntextual specifications. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce\nFashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG), a novel method that\nenables the customization of fashion items based on user preferences provided\nin textual form. Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input\nspecifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes\nfrom the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion\ntechniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual\nembedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless\nintegration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental\nresults on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms\nexisting methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing\nfine-grained visual details from retrieved garments.

It serves as a key precursor to complex sulfur-bearing\norganics, and has been proposed to play a significant role in the origin of\nlife. Although models and observations both suggest H2S to be present in ices\nin non-negligible amounts, its sublimation dynamics remain poorly constrained.\nIn this work, we present a comprehensive experimental characterization of the\nsublimation behavior of H2S ice under astrophysically-relevant conditions. The\nsublimation behavior of H2S was monitored with a quadrupole mass spectrometer\n(QMS) during temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments. These\nexperiments are used to determine binding energies and entrapment efficiencies\nof H2S, which are then employed to estimate its snowline positions in a\nprotoplanetary disk midplane. We derive mean binding energies of 3159\\pm46 K\nfor pure H2S ice and 3392\\pm56 K for submonolayer H2S desorbing from a compact\namorphous solid water (cASW) surface. These values correspond to sublimation\ntemperatures of around 64 K and 69 K in the disk midplane, placing its\nsublimation fronts at radii just interior to the CO2 snowline. We also\ninvestigate the entrapment of H2S in water ice and find it to be highly\nefficient, with ~75-85% of H2S remaining trapped past its sublimation\ntemperature for H2O:H2S mixing ratios of ~5-17:1. We discuss potential\nmechanisms behind this efficient entrapment. Our findings imply that, in\nprotoplanetary disks, H2S will mostly be retained in the ice phase until water\ncrystallizes, at radii near the water snowline, if it forms mixed into water\nice. This has significant implications for the possibility of H2S being\nincorporated into icy planetesimals and its potential delivery to terrestrial\nplanets, which we discuss in detail.",

    "abstract": "Supernova (SN) 2014C is a rare transitional event that exploded as a\nhydrogen-poor, helium-rich Type Ib SN and subsequently interacted with a\nhydrogen-rich circumstellar medium (CSM) a few months post-explosion. This\nunique interacting object provides an opportunity to probe the mass-loss\nhistory of a stripped-envelope SN progenitor. Using the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST), we observed SN 2014C with the Mid-Infrared Instrument Medium\nResolution Spectrometer at 3477 days post-explosion (rest frame), and the\nNear-Infrared Spectrograph Integral Field Unit at 3568 days post-explosion,\ncovering 1.7 to 25 $\\mu$m. The bolometric luminosity indicates that the SN is\nstill interacting with the same CSM that was observed with the Spitzer Space\nTelescope 40--1920 days post-explosion. JWST spectra and near-contemporaneous\noptical and near-infrared spectra show strong [Ne II] 12.831 $\\mu$m, He 1.083\n$\\mu$m, H$\\alpha$, and forbidden oxygen ([O I] $\\lambda$$\\lambda$6300, 6364, [O\nII] $\\lambda$$\\lambda$7319, 7330, and [O III] $\\lambda$$\\lambda$4959, 5007)\nemission lines with asymmetric profiles, suggesting a highly asymmetric CSM.\nThe mid-IR continuum can be explained by ~$0.036 \\ M_\\odot$ of carbonaceous\ndust at ~300 K and ~0.043 $M_\\odot$ of silicate dust at ~200 K. The observed\ndust mass has increased tenfold since the last Spitzer observation 4 yr ago,\nwith evidence suggesting that new grains have condensed in the cold dense shell\nbetween the forward and reverse shocks. This dust mass places SN 2014C among\nthe dustiest SNe in the mid-IR and supports the emerging observational trend\nthat SN explosions produce enough dust to explain the observed dust mass at\nhigh redshifts.",

In this work, we present a\ncomparative analysis of optical colour and brightness variability for two\n$\\mathrm{log(L_{Bol})}-z$ matched samples, consisting of 2095 Narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies and a control sample consisting of 2380 Broad-line\nSeyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies. Using over six years of r-band and g-band light\ncurves from the ZTF Data Release 22 (DR22), we characterize flux variability,\nfractional flux variability, and amplitude of temporal variability for each\nsource in the samples. Our results indicate that BLSy1 galaxies exhibit\nsignificantly stronger variability compared to NLSy1s. To probe colour\nvariability, we utilize quasi-simultaneous light curves, with half-hour epoch\ndifferences between $\\mathrm{g}$- and $\\mathrm{r}$-band measurements. We\nevaluated the colour index using both flux-flux space analysis and linear\nregression in magnitude-magnitude space. We find that large majorities of these\nsources -- 74% of NLSy1 and 79% of BLSy1 -- exhibit a clear\n``bluer-when-brighter'' (BWB) trend, although part of this effect may arise\nfrom contamination by the non-varying, predominantly redder flux of the host\ngalaxy. Furthermore, rest-frame structure function analysis reveals that BLSy1\ngalaxies are $1.44 \\pm 0.06$ times more variable than NLSy1s. These results can\nprovide valuable insights into the variability properties of AGN subclasses and\ntheir underlying physical drivers.",

Answering\nthis question is especially challenging for weakly collisional, magnetized\nplasmas, where macroscopic gradients influence the plasma's microphysical\nstructure. In this paper, we introduce thermodynamic forcing, a new method for\nsystematically modeling how macroscopic gradients in magnetized or unmagnetized\nplasmas shape the distribution functions of constituent particles. In this\nmethod, we propose to apply an anomalous force to those particles inducing the\nanisotropy that would naturally emerge due to macroscopic gradients in weakly\ncollisional plasmas. We implement thermodynamic forcing in particle-in-cell\n(TF-PIC) simulations using a modified Vay particle pusher and validate it\nagainst analytic solutions of the equations of motion. We then carry out a\nseries of simulations of electron-proton plasmas with periodic boundary\nconditions using TF-PIC. First, we confirm that the properties of two\nelectron-scale kinetic instabilities -- one driven by a temperature gradient\nand the other by pressure anisotropy -- are consistent with previous results.\nThen, we demonstrate that in the presence of multiple macroscopic gradients,\nthe saturated state can differ significantly from current expectations.

    "abstract": "Low-density ($\\rho < 0.1 \\rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$) hot Saturns are expected to\nquickly ($<100$ Myr) lose their atmospheres due to stellar irradiation,\nexplaining their rarity. HAT-P-67 b seems to be an exception, with $\\rho < 0.09\n\\rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$ and maintaining its atmosphere to well after 1 Gyr. We present\na photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of HAT-P-67 b to determine how it\navoided mass loss. HAT-P-67 b orbits a $V=10.1$ evolved F-type star in a 4.81\nday orbit. We present new radial velocity observations of the system from the\nNEID spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m Telescope from a follow-up campaign robust\nto stellar activity. We characterize the activity using photometry and activity\nindicators, revealing a stellar rotation period ($5.40\\pm0.09$ d) near HAT-P-67\nb's orbital period. We mitigate the stellar activity using a constrained\nquasi-periodic Gaussian process through a joint fit of archival ground-based\nphotometry, TESS photometry, and our NEID observations, obtaining a planetary\nmass of $M_p = 0.45 \\pm 0.15~M_{\\rm J}$. Combined with a radius measurement of\n$R_p=2.140 \\pm 0.025~R_{\\rm J}$, this yields a density of $\\rho_p =\n0.061^{+0.020}_{-0.021} \\rm{~g~cm^{-3}}$, making HAT-P-67 b the second\nlowest-density hot giant known to date. We find the recent evolution of the\nhost star caused mass loss for HAT-P-67 b to only recently occur. The planet\nwill be tidally disrupted/engulfed in $\\sim 150-500$ Myr, shortly after losing\nits atmosphere. With rapid atmospheric mass loss, a large, helium leading tail,\nand upcoming observations with the Hubble Space Telescope, HAT-P-67 b is an\nexceptional target for future studies, for which an updated mass measurement\nprovides important context.",

We identify six key types of contextual features to report\nand justify in audit cards: auditor identity, evaluation scope, methodology,\nresource access, process integrity, and review mechanisms. Through analysis of\nexisting evaluation reports, we find significant variation in reporting\npractices, with most reports omitting crucial contextual information such as\nauditors' backgrounds, conflicts of interest, and the level and type of access\nto models. We also find that most existing regulations and frameworks lack\nguidance on rigorous reporting. In response to these shortcomings, we argue\nthat audit cards can provide a structured format for reporting key claims\nalongside their justifications, enhancing transparency, facilitating proper\ninterpretation, and establishing trust in reporting.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently\ndemonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks.\nSimilar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies,\nRLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring\nnovel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In\nthis study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically\nprobing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various\nmodel families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning\nbenchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric.\nSurprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit\nfundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform\ntheir base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher\npass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the\nobserved reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model.\nTreating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that\nsix popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in\nleveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that\ndistillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and\ngenuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings\nsuggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to\nelicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for\nimproved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn\nagent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.",

Central to the method are novel Euler-like identities\nthat rigorously unify trigonometric, hyperbolic, and algebraic substitutions\nwhile preserving domain consistency. These transformations reduce complex\nintegrands to rational or polynomial-like forms, bypassing ad hoc substitutions\nand memorization of standard formulas. Demonstrations include integrals\nresistant to standard Computer Algebra Systems (CAS), such as those mixing\ninverse trigonometric functions, and comparisons with classical Euler\nsubstitutions reveal that the latter emerge as special cases within the USM\nframework. Crucially, the USM extends beyond Euler substitutions by\nsystematically handling diverse forms -- including quadratic radicals with\nlinear shifts, inverse trigonometric integrands, and mixed-function\ncompositions -- under a single principle. The method enhances computational\nefficiency, clarifies domain-specific sign choices, and serves as a robust\neducational and practical tool, offering a unified alternative to historically\ndisjointed techniques in integral calculus.",

The game proceeds in rounds, where each round first\nconsists of the cops' turn, followed by the robber's turn. In the cops' turn,\nevery cop can choose to either stay on the same vertex or move to an adjacent\nvertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. The robber is considered to be\ncaptured if, at any point in time, there is some cop on the same vertex as the\nrobber. A natural question in this game concerns the cop-number of a graph --\nthe minimum number of cops needed to capture the robber. It has long been known\nthat graphs embeddable (without crossings) on surfaces of bounded genus have\nbounded cop-number. In contrast, the class of 1-planar graphs -- graphs that\ncan be drawn on the plane with at most one crossing per edge -- does not have\nbounded cop-number. This paper initiates an investigation into how distance\nbetween crossing pairs of edges influences a graph's cop number. In particular,\nwe look at Distance $d$ Cops and Robbers, a variant of the classical game,\nwhere the robber is considered to be captured if there is a cop within distance\n$d$ of the robber. Let $c_d(G)$ denote the minimum number of cops required in\nthe graph $G$ to capture a robber within distance $d$. We look at various\nclasses of graphs, such as 1-plane graphs, $k$-plane graphs (graphs where each\nedge is crossed at most $k$ times), and even general graph drawings, and show\nthat if every crossing pair of edges can be connected by a path of small\nlength, then $c_d(G)$ is bounded, for small values of $d$.",

We\nshow that DGGs can also incorporate biophysical forces between graph-connected\nobjects at a finer time scale, with specialized DGG kinetic rules obeying\nbiophysical constraints of Galilean invariance, conservation of momentum, and\ndissipation of conserved global energy. We use graph-local energy functions for\ncytoskeleton networks interacting with membranes, and derive DGG rules from the\nspecialization of dissipative stochastic dynamics to a mutually exclusive and\nexhaustive collection of graph-local neighborhood types for the rule left hand\nsides. Dissipative rules comprise a stochastic version of gradient descent\ndynamics. Thermal noise rules use a Gaussian approximation of each position\ncoordinate to sample jitter-like displacements. We designed and implemented DGG\ngrammar sub-models including actin network growth, non-equilibrium statistical\nmechanics, and filament-membrane mechanical interaction to regulate the\nre-writing of graph objects. From a biological perspective, we observe\nregulatory effects of three actin-binding proteins on the membrane size and\nfind evidence supporting mechanisms of membrane growth.",

It is available across all major platforms\nand often integrated into other applications. Due to its ubiquity, even\nmarginal improvements to the terminal have the potential to make massive\nimprovements to productivity on a global scale. We believe that evolutionary\nimprovements to the terminal, in its current incarnation as windowed terminal\nemulator, are possible and that developing a thorough understanding of issues\nthat current terminal users face is fundamental to knowing how the terminal\nshould evolve. In order to develop that understanding we have mined Unix and\nLinux Stack Exchange using a fully-reproducible method which was able to\nextract and categorize 91.0% of 1,489 terminal-related questions (from the full\nset of nearly 240,000 questions) without manual intervention.\n  We present an analysis, to our knowledge the first of its kind, of windowed\nterminal-related questions posted over a 15-year period and viewed, in\naggregate, approximately 40 million times. As expected, given its longevity, we\nfind the terminal's many features being applied across a wide variety of use\ncases. We find evidence that the terminal, as windowed terminal emulator, has\nneither fully adapted to its now current graphical environment nor completely\nuntangled itself from features more suited to incarnations in previous\nenvironments. We also find evidence of areas where we believe the terminal\ncould be extended along with other areas where it could be simplified.\nSurprisingly, while many current efforts to improve the terminal include\nimproving the terminal's social and collaborative aspects, we find little\nevidence of this as a prominent pain point.",

    "abstract": "Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but\noften produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods.\nDirectly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky\nmotions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety\nand robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness\nor strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial.\nHowever, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging\nto generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper\nintroduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability\n(DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to\nenhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable\nformulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly\nintegrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. DiffOG refines\naction trajectories to be smoother and more constraint-compliant while\nmaintaining alignment with the original demonstration distribution, thus\navoiding degradation in policy performance. We evaluated DiffOG across 11\nsimulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG\nsignificantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while\nhaving minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory\nprocessing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based\ntrajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance\ncompared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.

Furthermore, while many GAN models currently\noperate on a single generator discriminator learning approach, optimizing\ntarget data distribution is more effectively achievable through a single\ngenerator multi-discriminator learning scheme. Hence, this study introduces a\nnovel GAN model named Collective Learning Mechanism-based Optimal Transport GAN\n(CLOT-GAN) model, incorporating multiple discriminators, including the Deep\nConvolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model, Vision Transformer (ViT), and\nconformer. The objective of integrating various discriminators lies in their\nability to comprehend the formant distribution of mel-spectrograms, facilitated\nby a collective learning mechanism. Simultaneously, the inclusion of Optimal\nTransport (OT) loss aims to precisely bridge the gap between the source and\ntarget data distribution, employing the principles of OT theory.

The argument proceeds by\nidentifying four recurring mistakes within statistical fairness. One conflates\nfairness with equality, which confines thinking to similars being treated\nsimilarly. The second and third errors derive from a perspectival ethical view\nwhich functions by negating others and their viewpoints. The final mistake\nconstrains fairness to work within predefined social groups instead of allowing\nunconstrained fairness to subsequently define group composition. From the\nnature of these misconceptions, the larger argument follows. Because the errors\nare integral to how statistical fairness works, attempting to resolve the\ndifficulties only deepens them. Consequently, the errors cannot be corrected\nwithout undermining the larger project, and statistical fairness collapses from\nwithin. While the collapse ends a failure in ethics, it also provokes distinct\npossibilities for fairness, data, and algorithms.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nunpaired point cloud completion framework, namely the Reference-guided\nCompletion (RefComp) framework, which attains strong performance in both the\nclass-aware and class-agnostic training settings. The RefComp framework\ntransforms the unpaired completion problem into a shape translation problem,\nwhich is solved in the latent feature space of the partial point clouds.

In particular, the two mentioned properties\ncorrespond to matrix mortality and ergodicity, which ask whether there exists a\nproduct of the input matrices that is equal to, respectively, the zero matrix\nand a matrix with a column of strictly positive entries only. The case where\nthe input automaton is strongly connected (that is, the corresponding set of\nnonnegative matrices is irreducible) frequently appears in applications and\noften admits better properties than the general case. In this paper, we address\nthe existence of such properties from the computational complexity point of\nview, and develop a versatile technique to show that several NL-complete\nproblems remain NL-complete in the strongly connected case. In particular, we\nshow that deciding if a binary total DFA is synchronising is NL-complete even\nif it is promised to be strongly connected, and that deciding completeness of a\nbinary unambiguous NFA with very limited nondeterminism is NL-complete under\nthe same promise.",

Our model incorporates a t-distributed\nlatent variable to address overdispersion and outliers, improving robustness\ncompared to conventional models such as the beta-binomial,\nbinomial-logit-normal, and standard binomial models. Notably, our approach\nmodels the median of the response variable, presenting a more convenient and\ninterpretable measure of central tendency, which is available in closed form.\nFor comparability between all models, we also make predictions based on the\nmean proportion; however, this involves an integration step for the\nt-distributed nuisance parameter. While limited literature specifically\naddresses outliers in mixed models for bounded count data, this research fills\nthat gap. The practical utility of the model is demonstrated using a\nlongitudinal medication adherence dataset, where patient behavior often results\nin abrupt changes and outliers within individual trajectories. A simulation\nstudy demonstrates the binomial-logit-t model's strong performance, with\ncomparison statistics favoring it among the four evaluated models.

In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack\nbased on adaptive optimization mechanism of black-box large language models\n(BadApex), which leverages a black-box LLM to generate poisoned text through a\nrefined prompt. Specifically, an Adaptive Optimization Mechanism is designed to\nrefine an initial prompt iteratively using the generation and modification\nagents. The generation agent generates the poisoned text based on the initial\nprompt. Then the modification agent evaluates the quality of the poisoned text\nand refines a new prompt. After several iterations of the above process, the\nrefined prompt is used to generate poisoned texts through LLMs. We conduct\nextensive experiments on three dataset with six backdoor attacks and two\ndefenses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that BadApex significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art attacks. It improves prompt adaptability, semantic\nconsistency, and text quality.

LLMs have a tendency to\nmemorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training\ndata, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this\nhappens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding\nthe undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been\nforgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning\noffers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of\nthe trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks\nforgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this\nwork, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers\nformal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from\nscratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on\ntextual data protected using {\\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later\nenables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated\nwith the chosen {\\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning\nachieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM\nretraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning\n-- but at approximately half the unlearning cost.

TPL\nrecommender systems have been studied, offering a promising solution to address\nthis issue. They typically rely on collaborative filtering (CF) that exploits a\ntwo-dimensional project-library matrix (user-item in general context of\nrecommendation) when making recommendations. We have noticed that CF-based\napproaches often encounter two challenges: (i) a tendency to recommend popular\nitems more frequently, making them even more dominant, a phenomenon known as\npopularity bias, and (ii) difficulty in generating recommendations for new\nusers or items due to limited user-item interactions, commonly referred to as\nthe cold-start problem. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based approach to address popularity bias and the cold-start problem in\nTPL recommendation. Our method comprises three key components. First, we\nutilize a graph convolution network (GCN)-based embedding model to learn user\npreferences and user-item interactions, allowing us to capture complex\nrelationships within interaction subgraphs and effectively represent new\nuser/item embeddings. Second, we introduce an aggregation operator to generate\na representative embedding from user and item embeddings, which is then used to\nmodel cold-start users. Finally, we adopt a model-based RL framework for TPL\nrecommendation, where popularity bias is mitigated through a carefully designed\nreward function and a rarity-based replay buffer partitioning strategy.

    "abstract": "Converting peptide sequences into useful representations for downstream\nanalysis is a common step in computational modeling and cheminformatics.\nFurthermore, peptide drugs (e.g., Semaglutide, Degarelix) often take advantage\nof the diverse chemistries found in noncanonical amino acids (NCAAs), altered\nstereochemistry, and backbone modifications. Despite there being several\nchemoinformatics toolkits, none are tailored to the task of converting a\nmodified peptide from an amino acid representation to the chemical string\nnomenclature Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES), often used\nin chemical modeling. Here we present p2smi, a Python toolkit with CLI,\ndesigned to facilitate the conversion of peptide sequences into chemical SMILES\nstrings. By supporting both cyclic and linear peptides, including those with\nNCAAs, p2smi enables researchers to generate accurate SMILES strings for\ndrug-like peptides, reducing the overhead for computational modeling and\ncheminformatics analyses. The toolkit also offers functionalities for chemical\nmodification, synthesis feasibility evaluation, and calculation of molecular\nproperties such as hydrophobicity, topological polar surface area, molecular\nweight, and adherence to Lipinski's rules for drug-likeness.",

    "abstract": "Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for\nenabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven\napproaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and\nsystem trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially\nimportant for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal\nloads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear\nor misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to\ndegradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and\nremaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a\nphysics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts\ninternal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this\nmesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode\ninteractions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an\nequivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction\nforces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware\niterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture\ninfluence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller\nbearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling\nelements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler\nGraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting\nloads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering\nstable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation.\nAchieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining\ncomparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital\ntwins, design, and maintenance.",

In the metal-poor stars, the abundance of $^{22}$Ne is\nlimited by the metallicity, so that the contribution of $^{22}$Ne($\\alpha$,\nn)$^{25}$Mg reaction on the s-process is weaker. Conversely, the\n$^{17}$O($\\alpha$, n)$^{20}$Ne reaction is more evident in more metal-poor\nstars due to the most abundant $^{16}$O in all metallicities. In this work, we\ncalculate the evolution of four metal-poor models ($Z=10^{-3}$) for the\nZero-Age Main-Sequence (ZAMS) masses of $M ({\\rm ZAMS})=$ 15, 20, 25, and 30\nM$_{\\odot}$ to investigate the effect of reaction rates on the ws-process.

The yields of the s-process isotope with updated reaction\nrates are compared with the results using default reaction rates from JINA\nREACLIB.

Updating these\nnew reaction rates would increase the production of ws-process isotopes by tens\nof times.

    "abstract": "Data Availability Sampling (DAS), a central component of Ethereum's roadmap,\nenables clients to verify data availability without requiring any single client\nto download the entire dataset. DAS operates by having clients randomly\nretrieve individual symbols of erasure-encoded data from a peer-to-peer\nnetwork. While the cryptographic and encoding aspects of DAS have recently\nundergone formal analysis, the peer-to-peer networking layer remains\nunderexplored, with a lack of security definitions and efficient, provably\nsecure constructions. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a novel\ndistributed data structure that can serve as the networking layer for DAS,\nwhich we call robust distributed arrays. That is, we rigorously define a\nrobustness property of a distributed data structure in an open permissionless\nnetwork, that mimics a collection of arrays. Then, we give a simple and\nefficient construction and formally prove its robustness. Notably, every\nindividual node is required to store only small portions of the data, and\naccessing array positions incurs minimal latency. The robustness of our\nconstruction relies solely on the presence of a minimal absolute number of\nhonest nodes in the network. In particular, we avoid any honest majority\nassumption. Beyond DAS, we anticipate that robust distributed arrays can have\nwider applications in distributed systems.",

This aligns with prior work showing that\nICL is mediated by task vectors. We further demonstrate that these task vectors\nare well approximated by a sparse sum of SAE latents, including these\ntask-execution features. To explore the ICL mechanism, we adapt the sparse\nfeature circuits methodology of Marks et al.

    "abstract": "Childhood vaccination is a cornerstone of public health, yet disparities in\nvaccination coverage persist across England. These disparities are shaped by\ncomplex interactions among various factors, including geographic, demographic,\nsocioeconomic, and cultural (GDSC) factors. Previous studies mostly rely on\ncross-sectional data and traditional statistical approaches that assess\nindividual or limited sets of variables in isolation. Such methods may fall\nshort in capturing the dynamic and multivariate nature of vaccine uptake. In\nthis paper, we conducted a longitudinal machine learning analysis of childhood\nvaccination coverage across 150 districts in England from 2021 to 2024. Using\nvaccination data from NHS records, we applied hierarchical clustering to group\ndistricts by vaccination coverage into low- and high-coverage clusters. A\nCatBoost classifier was then trained to predict districts' vaccination clusters\nusing their GDSC data. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method\nwas used to interpret the predictors' importance. The classifier achieved high\naccuracies of 92.1, 90.6, and 86.3 in predicting districts' vaccination\nclusters for the years 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024, respectively. SHAP\nrevealed that geographic, cultural, and demographic variables, particularly\nrurality, English language proficiency, the percentage of foreign-born\nresidents, and ethnic composition, were the most influential predictors of\nvaccination coverage, whereas socioeconomic variables, such as deprivation and\nemployment, consistently showed lower importance, especially in 2023-2024.\nSurprisingly, rural districts were significantly more likely to have higher\nvaccination rates. Additionally, districts with lower vaccination coverage had\nhigher populations whose first language was not English, who were born outside\nthe UK, or who were from ethnic minority groups.",

We have established the first JAX-based\nblock-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, called JAX-AMR, and\nthen developed a fully-differentiable solver for compressible reacting flows,\nnamed JANC. JANC is implemented in Python and features automatic\ndifferentiation capabilities, enabling an efficient integration of the solver\nwith machine learning. Furthermore, benefited by multiple acceleration features\nsuch as XLA-powered JIT compilation, GPU/TPU computing, parallel computing, and\nAMR, the computational efficiency of JANC has been significantly improved. In a\ncomparative test of a two-dimensional detonation tube case, the computational\ncost of the JANC core solver, running on a single A100 GPU, was reduced to 1%\nof that of OpenFOAM, which was parallelized across 384 CPU cores. When the AMR\nmethod is enabled for both solvers, JANC's computational cost can be reduced to\n1-2% of that of OpenFOAM. The core solver of JANC has also been tested for\nparallel computation on a 4-card A100 setup, demonstrating its convenient and\nefficient parallel computing capability. JANC also shows strong compatibility\nwith machine learning by combining adjoint optimization to make the whole\ndynamic trajectory efficiently differentiable.

    "abstract": "Traditional covert communication often relies on the knowledge of the\nwarden's channel state information, which is inherently challenging to obtain\ndue to the non-cooperative nature and potential mobility of the warden. The\nintegration of sensing and communication technology provides a promising\nsolution by enabling the legitimate transmitter to sense and track the warden,\nthereby enhancing transmission covertness. In this paper, we develop a\nframework for sensing-then-beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(RIS)-empowered integrated sensing and covert communication (ISCC) systems,\nwhere the transmitter (Alice) estimates and tracks the mobile aerial warden's\nchannel using sensing echo signals while simultaneously sending covert\ninformation to multiple legitimate users (Bobs) with the assistance of RIS,\nunder the surveillance of the warden (Willie). Considering channel estimation\nerrors, we formulate a robust non-convex optimization problem that jointly\ndesigns the communication beamformers, the sensing signal covariance matrix at\nAlice, and the phase shifts at the RIS to maximize the covert sum rate of Bobs\nwhile satisfying the constraints related to covert communication, sensing,\ntransmitter power, and the unit modulus of the RIS elements. To solve this\ncomplex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm using alternating\noptimization, successive convex approximation, S-procedure, sequential rank-one\nconstraint relaxation, and semidefinite relaxation techniques. Numerical\nresults confirm the convergence of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its\neffectiveness in tracking the warden's channel while ensuring robust covert\ntransmission. Furthermore, the results highlight the advantages of using RIS to\nenhance the covert transmission rate compared to baseline schemes, and also\nillustrate the intricate trade-off between communication and sensing in ISCC\nsystems.",

Consequently, advanced vision models surpass such devices'\nprocessing and storage capabilities, requiring offloading of such tasks to the\ncloud. However, remote areas often rely on LPWANs technology with limited\nbandwidth, high packet loss rates, and extremely low duty cycles, which makes\nfast offloading for time-sensitive inference challenging. Today's approaches,\nwhich are deployable on weak devices, generate a non-progressive bit stream,\nand therefore, their decoding quality suffers strongly when data is only\npartially available on the cloud at a deadline due to limited bandwidth or\npacket losses.\n  In this paper, we introduce LimitNet, a progressive, content-aware image\ncompression model designed for extremely weak devices and networks. LimitNet's\nlightweight progressive encoder prioritizes critical data during transmission\nbased on the content of the image, which gives the cloud the opportunity to run\ninference even with partial data availability.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that LimitNet, on average, compared to SOTA,\nachieves 14.01 p.p.

While large language models (LLMs) have achieved\nremarkable success in generating coherent and contextually rich text, their\nreliance on static training data and susceptibility to hallucinations limit\ntheir effectiveness at response forecasting in dynamic social media\nenvironments. SCRAG overcomes these challenges by integrating LLMs with a\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique rooted in social computing.\nSpecifically, our framework retrieves (i) historical responses from the target\ncommunity to capture their ideological, semantic, and emotional makeup, and\n(ii) external knowledge from sources such as news articles to inject\ntime-sensitive context. This information is then jointly used to forecast the\nresponses of the target community to new posts or narratives. Extensive\nexperiments across six scenarios on the X platform (formerly Twitter), tested\nwith various embedding models and LLMs, demonstrate over 10% improvements on\naverage in key evaluation metrics.

The new proof indicates that the\npair-wise independence condition is not necessary for proving the binary linear\ncode ensemble to achieve the capacity of the BIOS channel. The Bernoulli\nparity-check~(BPC) codes, which fall within the framework of the systematic BGM\ncodes with parity-check bits known at the decoder can also be proved to achieve\nthe capacity. The presented framework also reveals a new mechanism pertained to\nthe systematic linear codes that the systematic bits and the corresponding\nparity-check bits play different roles. Precisely, the noisy systematic bits\nare used to limit the list size of candidate codewords, while the noisy\nparity-check bits are used to select from the list the maximum likelihood\ncodeword. For systematic BGM codes with finite length, we derive the lower\nbounds on the BER and FER, which can be used to predict the error floors.\nNumerical results show that the systematic BGM codes match well with the\nderived error floors. The performance in water-fall region can be improved with\napproaches in statistical physics and the error floors can be significantly\nimproved by implementing the concatenated codes with the systematic BGM codes\nas the inner codes.",

In\nthis model, regions are made of inter-connected excitatory and inhibitory pools\nof neurons, but are long-range connected only via excitatory pools (mutual\nexcitation). We thus extend this model by generalizing connectivity, and we\nanalyse how connectivity affects the behaviour of this model.\n  Focusing on the simplest paradigm made of a Control area and a Target area,\nwe explore four typical kinds of connectivity: mutual excitation, Target\ninhibition by Control, Control inhibition by Target, and mutual inhibition. For\nthis, we build an analytical sensitivity framework, nesting up sensitivities of\nisolated pools, of isolated regions, and of the full system. We show that\ninhibitory control can emerge only in Target inhibition by Control and mutual\ninhibition connectivities.\n  We next offer an analysis of how the model sensitivities depends on\nconnectivity structure, depending on a parameter controling the strength of the\nself-inhibition within Target region. Finally, we illustrate the effect of\nconnectivity structure upon control effectivity in response to an external\nforcing in the Control area.\n  Beyond the case explored here, our methodology to build analytical\nsensitivities by nesting up levels (pool, region, system) lays the groundwork\nfor expressing nested sensitivities for more complex network configurations,\neither for this model or any other one.",

Unlike conventional\nflexible-antenna systems, pinching antennas offer the advantage of creating\nline-of-sight links by enabling antennas to be activated on the waveguide at a\nlocation close to the user. This paper investigates a typical two-user\nnon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink scenario, where multiple\npinching antennas are activated on a single dielectric waveguide to assist NOMA\ntransmission. We formulate the problem of maximizing the data rate of one user\nsubject to the quality-of-service requirement of the other user by jointly\noptimizing the antenna locations and power allocation coefficients. The\nformulated problem is nonconvex and difficult to solve due to the impact of\nantenna locations on large-scale path loss and two types of phase shifts,\nnamely in-waveguide phase shifts and free space propagation phase shifts. To\nthis end, we propose an iterative algorithm based on block coordinate descent\nand successive convex approximation techniques. Moreover, we consider the\nspecial case with a single pinching antenna, which is a simplified version of\nthe multi-antenna case. Although the formulated problem is still nonconvex, by\nusing the inherent features of the formulated problem, we derive the global\noptimal solution in closed-form, which offers important insights on the\nperformance of pinching-antenna systems.

Thus, color perception is a phenomenon inherently\nlinked to an experimental environment (the visual scene) and an observing\napparatus (the human visual system). This is clearly reminiscent of the\nconceptual foundation of both relativity and quantum mechanics, where the link\nis between a physical system and the measuring instruments.

    "abstract": "This work aligns deep learning (DL) with human reasoning capabilities and\nneeds to enable more efficient, interpretable, and robust image classification.\nWe approach this from three perspectives: explainability, causality, and\nbiological vision. Introduction and background open this work before diving\ninto operative chapters. First, we assess neural networks' visualization\ntechniques for medical images and validate an explainable-by-design method for\nbreast mass classification. A comprehensive review at the intersection of XAI\nand causality follows, where we introduce a general scaffold to organize past\nand future research, laying the groundwork for our second perspective. In the\ncausality direction, we propose novel modules that exploit feature\nco-occurrence in medical images, leading to more effective and explainable\npredictions. We further introduce CROCODILE, a general framework that\nintegrates causal concepts, contrastive learning, feature disentanglement, and\nprior knowledge to enhance generalization. Lastly, we explore biological\nvision, examining how humans recognize objects, and propose CoCoReco, a\nconnectivity-inspired network with context-aware attention mechanisms. Overall,\nour key findings include: (i) simple activation maximization lacks insight for\nmedical imaging DL models; (ii) prototypical-part learning is effective and\nradiologically aligned; (iii) XAI and causal ML are deeply connected; (iv) weak\ncausal signals can be leveraged without a priori information to improve\nperformance and interpretability; (v) our framework generalizes across medical\ndomains and out-of-distribution data; (vi) incorporating biological circuit\nmotifs improves human-aligned recognition. This work contributes toward\nhuman-aligned DL and highlights pathways to bridge the gap between research and\nclinical adoption, with implications for improved trust, diagnostic accuracy,\nand safe deployment.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Machine Learning ML agents have been increasingly used in decision-making\nacross a wide range of tasks and environments. These ML agents are typically\ndesigned to balance multiple objectives when making choices. Understanding how\ntheir decision-making processes align with or diverge from human reasoning is\nessential. Human agents often encounter hard choices, that is, situations where\noptions are incommensurable; neither option is preferred, yet the agent is not\nindifferent between them. In such cases, human agents can identify hard choices\nand resolve them through deliberation. In contrast, current ML agents, due to\nfundamental limitations in Multi-Objective Optimisation or MOO methods, cannot\nidentify hard choices, let alone resolve them. Neither Scalarised Optimisation\nnor Pareto Optimisation, the two principal MOO approaches, can capture\nincommensurability. This limitation generates three distinct alignment\nproblems: the alienness of ML decision-making behaviour from a human\nperspective; the unreliability of preference-based alignment strategies for\nhard choices; and the blockage of alignment strategies pursuing multiple\nobjectives. Evaluating two potential technical solutions, I recommend an\nensemble solution that appears most promising for enabling ML agents to\nidentify hard choices and mitigate alignment problems. However, no known\ntechnique allows ML agents to resolve hard choices through deliberation, as\nthey cannot autonomously change their goals. This underscores the\ndistinctiveness of human agency and urges ML researchers to reconceptualise\nmachine autonomy and develop frameworks and methods that can better address\nthis fundamental gap.",

By\ntreating Crystal Plasticity (CP) in an Eulerian framework, rather than\ntraditional Lagrangian approaches, we overcome the significant challenges\nassociated with lattice distortion, enabling accurate simulations of material\nbehavior under large deformations. This Eulerian perspective allows us to track\nthe evolution of crystallographic orientations directly in the spatial domain,\nproviding crucial insights into texture development. The CP models employed\nhere capture the microstructural evolution in both mono- and polycrystalline\nmaterials, with particular emphasis on velocity gradient driven processes. Our\nlinear stability analysis strategy, while applicable to general CP\nformulations, is demonstrated using a simplified rigid-(visco)-plastic 2-D\nmodel with three slip systems. This approach successfully predicts the lattice\norientation attractors for very large strains (exceeding 50$\\%$) by analyzing\nhow different slip systems interact under applied loads. Three numerical\nsimulations illustrate the theory's effectiveness: polycrystal deformation\nunder homogeneous velocity gradient loading, void evolution in a monocrystal\nunder non-homogeneous loading, and slip band formation during uni-axial\ntraction. High-resolution CP simulations, enhanced through re-meshing\ntechniques, further validate our findings on how initial crystallographic\norientations, deformation mechanisms, and loading conditions affect the\nevolution of orientation attractors and ultimate crystal texture.",

One challenge in Markovian lifts is that the resulting\nMarkovian system has multiple time scales ranging from infinitely small to\ninfinitely large; therefore, a numerical method that consistently deals with\nthem is required.

The parallel and anti-parallel flocking states vanish upon\nreducing the size of one group, and the system transitions to a single-species\nflock of the majority species. At sufficiently low noise (or high density), the\nminority species can exhibit collective behavior, anti-aligning with the liquid\nstate of the majority species. Unequal self-propulsion speeds of the two\nspecies strongly encourage anti-parallel flocking over parallel flocking.\nHowever, when activity landscapes with region-dependent motilities are\nintroduced, parallel flocking is retained if the faster region is given more\nspace, highlighting the role of environmental constraints. Under noise\nheterogeneity, the colder species (subjected to lower noise) attain higher band\nvelocity compared to the hotter one, temporarily disrupting any parallel\nflocking, which is subsequently restored.

    "abstract": "Group recommendation aims to provide personalized item suggestions to a group\nof users by reflecting their collective preferences. A fundamental challenge in\nthis task is deriving a consensus that adequately represents the diverse\ninterests of individual group members. Despite advancements made by deep\nlearning-based models, existing approaches still struggle in two main areas:\n(1) Capturing consensus in small-group settings, which are more prevalent in\nreal-world applications, and (2) Balancing individual preferences with overall\ngroup performance, particularly in hypergraph-based methods that tend to\nemphasize group accuracy at the expense of personalization. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a Consensus-aware Contrastive Learning for Group\nRecommendation (CoCoRec) that models group consensus through contrastive\nlearning. CoCoRec utilizes a transformer encoder to jointly learn user and\ngroup representations, enabling richer modeling of intra-group dynamics.\nAdditionally, the contrastive objective helps reduce overfitting from\nhigh-frequency user interactions, leading to more robust and representative\ngroup embeddings. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets show that\nCoCoRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both individual\nand group recommendation scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of\nconsensus-aware contrastive learning in group recommendation tasks.",

To address these\nlimitations, we conduct an empirical study to understand how LLMs interpret\nambiguous or incomplete text prompts in the context of visualization authoring,\nand the conditions making LLMs misinterpret user intent. Informed by the\nfindings, we introduce visual prompts as a complementary input modality to text\nprompts, which help clarify user intent and improve LLMs' interpretation\nabilities. To explore the potential of multimodal prompting in visualization\nauthoring, we design VisPilot, which enables users to easily create\nvisualizations using multimodal prompts, including text, sketches, and direct\nmanipulations on existing visualizations. Through two case studies and a\ncontrolled user study, we demonstrate that VisPilot provides a more intuitive\nway to create visualizations without affecting the overall task efficiency\ncompared to text-only prompting approaches.

This paper proposes Gaussian\nsplatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and\nmakes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS\nmodel which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic\nview from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image\nuploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual\nenvironments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further\nproposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to\nupload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO\nproblem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm.\nExperiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication\nenergy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with\nAPO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise\nratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).",

Our analysis reveals\nthat transformer-based VLMs exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns across\ntasks: text recognition deteriorates most severely under blur and snow\ncorruptions, while object reasoning shows higher sensitivity to corruptions\nsuch as frost and impulse noise. We connect these observations to the\nfrequency-domain characteristics of different corruptions, revealing how\ntransformers' inherent bias toward low-frequency processing explains their\ndifferential robustness patterns. Our findings provide valuable insights for\ndeveloping more corruption-robust vision-language models for real-world\napplications.",

However, the inherent low\nresolution of thermal sensors leads to insufficient details and blurred\nboundaries. Super-resolution (SR) offers a promising solution to address this\nissue, while most existing SR methods are designed for fixed-scale SR. They are\ncomputationally expensive and inflexible in practical applications. To address\nabove issues, this work proposes a novel any-scale thermal SR method (AnyTSR)\nfor UAV within a single model. Specifically, a new image encoder is proposed to\nexplicitly assign specific feature code to enable more accurate and flexible\nrepresentation. Additionally, by effectively embedding coordinate offset\ninformation into the local feature ensemble, an innovative any-scale upsampler\nis proposed to better understand spatial relationships and reduce artifacts.\nMoreover, a novel dataset (UAV-TSR), covering both land and water scenes, is\nconstructed for thermal SR tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all\nscaling factors as well as generates more accurate and detailed high-resolution\nimages.

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that numerous intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs)\nmay wander undetected across the Universe, emitting little radiation. These\nIMBHs largely preserve their birth masses, offering critical insights into the\nformation of heavy black hole seeds and the dynamical processes driving their\nevolution. We propose that such IMBHs could produce detectable microlensing\neffects on quasars. Their Einstein radii, comparable to the scale of quasar\nbroad-line regions, magnify radiation from the accretion disk and broad\nemission lines, making these quasars outliers in flux scaling relations.\nMeanwhile, the microlensing causes long-term, quasi-linear variability that is\ndistinguishable from the stochastic variability of quasars through its coherent\nmulti-wavelength behavior. We develop a matched-filtering technique that\neffectively separates the long-term lensing signal from the intrinsic quasar\nvariability, with sensitivity tripling each time the observational time span\ndoubles. Moreover, as IMBHs are often surrounded by dense star clusters, their\ncombined gravitational field produces substantial extended, concentric\ncaustics. These caustics induce significant variability in optical,\nultraviolet, and X-ray bands over decade timescales, alongside\nhour-to-day-scale flux fluctuations in broad emission lines. We predict a\nsubstantial number of detectable events in the upcoming surveys by the Vera C.\nRubin Observatory, considering recent IMBH mass density estimates. Even in the\nabsence of positive detections, searches for these microlensing signals will\nplace meaningful constraints on the cosmological mass density of IMBHs,\nadvancing our understanding of their role in cosmic evolution.",

The observations were made to\ncharacterize the structure, temperature and mass of the disk through the\nthermal emission of the dust heated by the central star. Another goal was also\nto constrain the size distribution of the grains. The data were reduced and\ncalibrated using the JWST pipeline. The analysis was based on a\nforward-modeling of the images using a multiparameter radiative transfer model\ncoupled to an optical code for coronagraphy processing. The disk is clearly\ndetected at both wavelengths. The slight asymmetry is geometrically consistent\nwith the asymmetry observed in the near-IR, but it is inconsistent the\nbrightness distribution. The observed structure is well reproduced with a model\nof a disk (or belt) with a critical radius 70 au, a mildly inward-increasing\ndensity (index 2) and a steeper decrease outward (index -6). This indication of\na filled disk inside the critical radius is inconsistent with sculpting from an\ninner massive planet. The size distribution of the grains that cause the mid-IR\nemission is well constrained by the flux ratio at the two wavelengths : 0.45 10\nmic and 0.65 10 mic for silicate and graphite grains, respectively. The minimum\nsize is consistent with predictions of blowout through radiative pressure. We\nderive a mass of the dust that causes the mid-IR emission of 3.3 5.0 E3 Mearth.\nWhen the larger grains (up to 1 cm) that cause the millimeter emission are\nincluded, we extrapolate this mass to 0.10 0.16 Mearth. We point out to that\nthis is fully consistent with ALMA observations of the disk in terms of dust\nmass and of its millimeter flux.

    "abstract": "This study presents a numerical investigation of a 3D micropolar\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) blood flow through stenosis, with and without the\neffects of micromagnetorotation (MMR). MMR refers to the magnetic torque caused\nby the misalignment of the magnetization of magnetic particles in the fluid\nwith the magnetic field, which affects the internal rotation (microrotation) of\nthese particles. Blood can be modeled as a micropolar fluid with magnetic\nparticles due to the magnetization of erythrocytes. In this manner, this study\nanalyzes important flow features, i.e., streamlines, vorticity, velocity, and\nmicrorotation, under varying stenosis (50%, 80%), hematocrit levels (25%, 45%),\nand magnetic fields (1T, 3T, 8T), using two newly developed transient OpenFOAM\nsolvers epotMicropolarFoam and epotMMRFoam. Results indicate that micropolar\neffects become more pronounced at severe stenosis due to the significant\nreduction in artery size. Furthermore, when MMR is disregarded (i.e., when\nblood is modeled as a classical MHD micropolar fluid without magnetic\nparticles), the magnetic field does not significantly alter blood flow,\nregardless of its intensity, due to the minimal impact of the Lorentz force on\nblood. Conversely, MMR substantially affects blood flow, particularly at higher\nhematocrit levels and severe stenoses, leading to reductions of up to 30% in\nvelocity and vorticity and up to 99.9% in microrotation. Simultaneously, any\nvortices or disturbances are dampened. These findings underscore the critical\nrole of MMR (which was ignored so far) in altering flow behavior in stenosed\narteries, suggesting that it should be considered in future MHD micropolar\nblood flow studies.",

    "abstract": "Niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) has garnered attention due to the coexistence\nof superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) down to the monolayer\nlimit. However, realistic modeling of CDWs-accounting for effects such as layer\nnumber, twist angle, and strain-remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost\nof first-principles methods. To address this, we develop machine learning\ninteratomic potentials (MLIPs), based on the Allegro architecture-an\nE(3)-equivariant model -- specifically tailored to capture subtle CDW effects\nin NbSe$_2$. These MLIPs enable efficient exploration of commensurate and\nincommensurate CDW phases, as well as the dimensional dependence of the\ntransition temperature, evaluated using the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic\nApproximation (SSCHA). Our findings reveal a strong sensitivity of CDWs to\nstacking and layer number, and a slight suppression of the transition\ntemperature with increasing thickness. This work opens new possibilities for\nstudying and tuning CDWs in NbSe$_2$ and other 2D systems, with implications\nfor electron-phonon coupling, superconductivity, and advanced materials design.",

By dynamically adjusting the positions of dielectric\nparticles, namely pinching antennas (PAs), along the waveguides, PASS\nintroduces a novel concept of pinching beamforming to enhance the performance\nof physical layer security. A fundamental PASS-enabled secure communication\nsystem is considered with one legitimate user and one eavesdropper. Both\nsingle-waveguide and multiple-waveguide scenarios are studied. 1) For the\nsingle-waveguide scenario, the secrecy rate (SR) maximization is formulated to\noptimize the pinching beamforming. A PA-wise successive tuning (PAST) algorithm\nis proposed, which ensures constructive signal superposition at the legitimate\nuser while inducing a destructive legitimate signal at the eavesdropper. 2) For\nthe multiple-waveguide scenario, artificial noise (AN) is employed to further\nimprove secrecy performance. A pair of practical transmission architectures are\ndeveloped: waveguide division (WD) and waveguide multiplexing (WM). The key\ndifference lies in whether each waveguide carries a single type of signal or a\nmixture of signals with baseband beamforming. For the SR maximization problem\nunder the WD case, a two-stage algorithm is developed, where the pinching\nbeamforming is designed with the PAST algorithm and the baseband power\nallocation among AN and legitimate signals is solved using successive convex\napproximation (SCA). For the WM case, an alternating optimization algorithm is\ndeveloped, where the baseband beamforming is optimized with SCA and the\npinching beamforming is designed employing particle swarm optimization.",

The optimization objective is to minimize the number of\nrounds.\n  Following up on several recent works, we investigate the structurally\nparameterized complexity of Telephone Broadcast.

Motivated by this (severe)\nhardness, we study several other parameterizations of the problem and obtain\nFPT algorithms parameterized by vertex integrity (generalizing a recent FPT\nalgorithm parameterized by vertex cover by Fomin, Fraigniaud, and Golovach [TCS\n2024]) and by distance to clique, as well as FPT approximation algorithms\nparameterized by clique-cover and cluster vertex deletion. Furthermore, we\nobtain structural results that relate the length of the optimal broadcast\nprotocol of a graph $G$ with its pathwidth and tree-depth. By presenting a\nsubstantial improvement over the best previously known bound for pathwidth\n(Aminian, Kamali, Seyed-Javadi, and Sumedha [arXiv 2025]) we exponentially\nimprove the approximation ratio achievable in polynomial time on graphs of\nbounded pathwidth from $\\mathcal{O}(4^\\mathrm{pw})$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{pw})$.",

The object is located at $z=0.4389$ and is a type 2\nAGN according to optical spectroscopy (SDSS, confirmed by DESI). We combine\nradio-to-X-ray data, including near-simultaneous ART-XC and Swift/XRT\nobservations conducted in June 2023. During these follow-up observations, the\nsource was found in a significantly fainter but still very luminous state\n($L_{\\rm X}=1.0^{+0.8}_{-0.3} \\times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, absorption\ncorrected, 2--10 keV) compared to its discovery during the all-sky survey\n($L_{\\rm X}=6^{+6}_{-3}\\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$), which indicates\nsignificant intrinsic variability on a rest-frame time scale of $\\sim 1$ year.\nThe radio data show a complex morphology with a core and two extended radio\nlobes, indicating a giant FRII radio galaxy. From multi-wavelength photometry\nand the black hole-bulge relation we infer a bolometric luminosity of $\\sim\n6\\times10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and a black hole mass of\n$\\sim1.4\\times10^{9}\\,M_\\odot$, implying accretion at $\\sim30$\\% of the\nEddington limit.

In this regard, researchers have\nintroduced prompt patterns, structured templates intended to guide users in\nformulating their requests. However, the influence of prompt patterns on code\nquality has yet to be thoroughly investigated.

As the\nconversations for recommender systems usually contain limited contextual\ninformation, many existing conversational recommender systems incorporate\nexternal sources to enrich the contextual information. However, how to combine\ndifferent types of contextual information is still a challenge. In this paper,\nwe propose a multi-type context-aware conversational recommender system, called\nMCCRS, effectively fusing multi-type contextual information via\nmixture-of-experts to improve conversational recommender systems. MCCRS\nincorporates both structured information and unstructured information,\nincluding the structured knowledge graph, unstructured conversation history,\nand unstructured item reviews. It consists of several experts, with each expert\nspecialized in a particular domain (i.e., one specific contextual information).\nMultiple experts are then coordinated by a ChairBot to generate the final\nresults. Our proposed MCCRS model takes advantage of different contextual\ninformation and the specialization of different experts followed by a ChairBot\nbreaks the model bottleneck on a single contextual information. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our proposed MCCRS method achieves significantly\nhigher performance compared to existing baselines.",

The CDAW center's GOES data in the energy\nchannel >10 MeV (Major SEPs; solar proton events) with flux >= 10 pfu was used\nfor our investigation. For the associated activities, we have analyzed the data\nfrom space born satellites namely: SOHO/LASCO and SDO/AIA. We found a moderate\ncorrelation (55 %) between SXR flux and sunspot area i.e., active regions with\nlarger sunspot areas generally generate larger flares. We found that most of\nthe SEPs are originated from the magnetically complex active regions i.e., hale\nclass beta-gamma-delta and beta. Very few events were associated with unipolar\nactive regions. Stronger GOES X-ray is linked to more impulsive events, as\nevidenced by the negative correlation (-0.40) between X-ray flux and SEP\nduration. In the active region beta-gamma-delta, the highest average SEP\nintensity (2051 pfu) was detected. In the data set used, only 10 % SEPs are\nfound impulsive in nature, while the remaining 90 % are gradual in nature. All\nthe impulsive events had SEP intensity less than 100 pfu and most of the CMEs\nassociated with these events were decelerated CMEs. We discovered that the\nmajority of faster CMEs are linked to the most complex magnetic active regions.\nThis indicates that high speed CMEs are produced by magnetically complex active\nregions. We discovered that 58 SEP events in our data set are linked to\naccelerated CMEs, while 82 are linked to decelerated CMEs. The highest average\nCME width is found corresponding to magnetically most complex active regions\nbeta-delta, gamma-delta, alpha-gamma-delta and beta-gamma-delta, which shows\nthat large CMEs are the consequences of magnetically complex active regions.",

    "abstract": "Direct numerical simulations of a uniform flow past a fixed spherical droplet\nare performed to determine the parameter range within which the axisymmetric\nflow becomes unstable. The problem is governed by three dimensionless\nparameters: the drop-to-fluid dynamic viscosity ratio, $\\mu^\\ast$, and the\nexternal and internal Reynolds numbers, $\\Rey^e$ and $\\Rey^i$, which are\ndefined using the kinematic viscosities of the external and internal fluids,\nrespectively. The present study confirms the existence of a regime at\nlow-to-moderate viscosity ratio where the axisymmetric flow breaks down due to\nan internal flow instability. In the initial stages of this bifurcation, the\nexternal flow remains axisymmetric, while the asymmetry is generated and grows\nonly inside the droplet. As the disturbance propagates outward, the entire flow\nfirst transits to a biplanar symmetric flow, characterised by two pairs of\ncounter-rotating streamwise vortices in the wake. A detailed examination of the\nflow field reveals that the vorticity on the internal side of the droplet\ninterface is driving the flow instability. Specifically, the bifurcation sets\nin once the maximum internal vorticity exceeds a critical value that decreases\nwith increasing $\\Rey^i$. For sufficiently large $\\Rey^i$, internal flow\nbifurcation may occur at viscosity ratios of $\\mu^\\ast = O(10)$, an order of\nmagnitude higher than previously reported values. Finally, we demonstrate that\nthe internal flow bifurcation in the configuration of a fixed droplet in a\nuniform fluid stream is closely related to the first path instability\nexperienced by a buoyant, deformable droplet of low-to-moderate $\\mu^\\ast$\nfreely rising in a stagnant liquid.",

    "abstract": "Cancer detection and prognosis relies heavily on medical imaging,\nparticularly CT and PET scans. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown promise\nin tumor segmentation by fusing information from these modalities. However, a\ncritical bottleneck exists: the dependency on CT-PET data concurrently for\ntraining and inference, posing a challenge due to the limited availability of\nPET scans. Hence, there is a clear need for a flexible and efficient framework\nthat can be trained with the widely available CT scans and can be still adapted\nfor PET scans when they become available. In this work, we propose a\nparameter-efficient multi-modal adaptation (PEMMA) framework for lightweight\nupgrading of a transformer-based segmentation model trained only on CT scans\nsuch that it can be efficiently adapted for use with PET scans when they become\navailable. This framework is further extended to perform prognosis task\nmaintaining the same efficient cross-modal fine-tuning approach. The proposed\napproach is tested with two well-known segementation backbones, namely UNETR\nand Swin UNETR. Our approach offers two main advantages. Firstly, we leverage\nthe inherent modularity of the transformer architecture and perform low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) as well as decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) of the\nattention weights to achieve parameter-efficient adaptation. Secondly, by\nminimizing cross-modal entanglement, PEMMA allows updates using only one\nmodality without causing catastrophic forgetting in the other. Our method\nachieves comparable performance to early fusion, but with only 8% of the\ntrainable parameters, and demonstrates a significant +28% Dice score\nimprovement on PET scans when trained with a single modality. Furthermore, in\nprognosis, our method improves the concordance index by +10% when adapting a\nCT-pretrained model to include PET scans, and by +23% when adapting for both\nPET and EHR data.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in dialogue policy planning have emphasized optimizing\nsystem agent policies to achieve predefined goals, focusing on strategy design,\ntrajectory acquisition, and efficient training paradigms. However, these\napproaches often overlook the critical role of user characteristics, which are\nessential in real-world scenarios like conversational search and\nrecommendation, where interactions must adapt to individual user traits such as\npersonality, preferences, and goals. To address this gap, we first conduct a\ncomprehensive study utilizing task-specific user personas to systematically\nassess dialogue policy planning under diverse user behaviors. By leveraging\nrealistic user profiles for different tasks, our study reveals significant\nlimitations in existing approaches, highlighting the need for user-tailored\ndialogue policy planning. Building on this foundation, we present the\nUser-Tailored Dialogue Policy Planning (UDP) framework, which incorporates an\nIntrinsic User World Model to model user traits and feedback. UDP operates in\nthree stages: (1) User Persona Portraying, using a diffusion model to\ndynamically infer user profiles; (2) User Feedback Anticipating, leveraging a\nBrownian Bridge-inspired anticipator to predict user reactions; and (3)\nUser-Tailored Policy Planning, integrating these insights to optimize response\nstrategies. To ensure robust performance, we further propose an active learning\napproach that prioritizes challenging user personas during training.\nComprehensive experiments on benchmarks, including collaborative and\nnon-collaborative settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of UDP in learning\nuser-specific dialogue strategies.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of motion planning in dynamic environments by\nextending the concept of Velocity Obstacle and Nonlinear Velocity Obstacle to\nAcceleration Obstacle AO and Nonlinear Acceleration Obstacle NAO. Similarly to\nVO and NLVO, the AO and NAO represent the set of colliding constant\naccelerations of the maneuvering robot with obstacles moving along linear and\nnonlinear trajectories, respectively. Contrary to prior works, we derive\nanalytically the exact boundaries of AO and NAO. To enhance an intuitive\nunderstanding of these representations, we first derive the AO in several\nsteps: first extending the VO to the Basic Acceleration Obstacle BAO that\nconsists of the set of constant accelerations of the robot that would collide\nwith an obstacle moving at constant accelerations, while assuming zero initial\nvelocities of the robot and obstacle. This is then extended to the AO while\nassuming arbitrary initial velocities of the robot and obstacle. And finally,\nwe derive the NAO that in addition to the prior assumptions, accounts for\nobstacles moving along arbitrary trajectories. The introduction of NAO allows\nthe generation of safe avoidance maneuvers that directly account for the\nrobot's second-order dynamics, with acceleration as its control input. The AO\nand NAO are demonstrated in several examples of selecting avoidance maneuvers\nin challenging road traffic. It is shown that the use of NAO drastically\nreduces the adjustment rate of the maneuvering robot's acceleration while\nmoving in complex road traffic scenarios. The presented approach enables\nreactive and efficient navigation for multiple robots, with potential\napplication for autonomous vehicles operating in complex dynamic environments.",

However, the existing MMKGs are\nsignificantly fewer than required, and their construction faces numerous\nchallenges, particularly in ensuring the selection of high-quality,\ncontextually relevant images for knowledge graph enrichment. To address these\nchallenges, we present a framework for constructing MMKGs from conventional\nKGs. Furthermore, to generate higher-quality images that are more relevant to\nthe context in the given knowledge graph, we designed a neighbor selection\nmethod called Visualizable Structural Neighbor Selection (VSNS). This method\nconsists of two modules: Visualizable Neighbor Selection (VNS) and Structural\nNeighbor Selection (SNS). The VNS module filters relations that are difficult\nto visualize, while the SNS module selects neighbors that most effectively\ncapture the structural characteristics of the entity. To evaluate the quality\nof the generated images, we performed qualitative and quantitative evaluations\non two datasets, MKG-Y and DB15K. The experimental results indicate that using\nthe VSNS method to select neighbors results in higher-quality images that are\nmore relevant to the knowledge graph.",

In this work, we empirically\nreveal an important characteristic of LRM behaviors that placing external CoTs\ngenerated by smaller models between the thinking token (\\texttt{<think>} and\n\\texttt{</think>}) can effectively manipulate the model to generate fewer\nthoughts. Building on this finding, we propose a simple yet efficient pipeline,\n\\Method, to enable LRMs to bypass unnecessary intermediate steps, thereby\nsignificantly reducing computational costs. We conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate the utility and efficiency of \\Method. For instance, when applied to\nQwQ-32B on the LiveBench/Code dataset, \\Method keeps the original performance\nwhile reducing output token counts by approximately 30\\%, with minimal overhead\nintroduced by the CoT generator. Furthermore, we identify two suboptimal modes,\nblindly following flawed external thoughts and unnecessary rethinking, and show\nthat simple mitigations, such as difficulty-aware fallbacks, can further\nimprove performance.

The comparison shows there is\nan excellent agreement between theoretical and numerical calculations for their\nvalid zones (in terms of the thermodynamic temperature) as suggested by\nexperiments. It implies that there may be a transition temperature at which the\ntwo relations correspond to each other. We derive a relation to calculate it.\nThen, we generalize the Rosenfield relation for configurational thermodynamic\nentropy like quantity(TELQ) and time-dependent Shanon information entropy. At\nthe same time, using a description with a fictitious Hamiltonian, we show that\ntime-dependent configurational Shanon information entropy for a thermodynamic\nsystem (of Brownian particles) which is characterized by the absolute\ntemperature, can not be recognized as thermodynamic entropy. At best, it can be\nidentified as a thermodynamic entropy-like quantity. Furthermore, the\ndescription based on the fictitious Hamiltonian may lead to the conclusion that\nthe correspondence between the Shanon information entropy and thermodynamic\nentropy is not a singular feature at equilibrium. It may be a continuation of\nthe correspondence between the information entropy and the thermodynamic\nentropy-like quantity.

To leverage\ncomplementary temporal, textual, and visual information, this paper has\nproposed PV-VLM, a multimodal forecasting framework that integrates temporal,\ntextual, and visual information by three modules. The Time-Aware Module\nemployed a PatchTST-inspired Transformer to capture both local and global\ndependencies in PV power time series.

Additionally, the Vision-Aware Module utilizes a\npretrained vision-language model to extract high-level semantic features from\nsky images, emphasizing cloud motion and irradiance fluctuations. The proposed\nPV-VLM is evaluated using data from a 30-kW rooftop array at Stanford\nUniversity and through a transfer study on PV systems at the University of\nWollongong in Australia. Comparative experiments reveal an average RMSE\nreduction of approximately 5% and a MAE improvement of nearly 6%, while the\ntransfer study shows average RMSE and MAE reductions of about 7% and 9.5%,\nrespectively.

As an effective way to model language, image, video, and\nother modalities, the use of LLMs for end-to-end extraction of structured\nvisual representations, such as scene graphs, remains underexplored. It\nrequires the model to accurately produce a set of objects and relationship\ntriplets, rather than generating text token by token. To achieve this, we\nintroduce R1-SGG, a multimodal LLM (M-LLM) initially trained via supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on the scene graph dataset and subsequently refined using\nreinforcement learning to enhance its ability to generate scene graphs in an\nend-to-end manner. The SFT follows a conventional prompt-response paradigm,\nwhile RL requires the design of effective reward signals. We design a set of\ngraph-centric rewards, including three recall-based variants -- Hard Recall,\nHard Recall+Relax, and Soft Recall -- which evaluate semantic and spatial\nalignment between predictions and ground truth at the object and relation\nlevels. A format consistency reward further ensures that outputs follow the\nexpected structural schema.

    "abstract": "Question Answering (QA) tasks, which involve extracting answers from a given\ncontext, are relatively straightforward for modern Large Language Models (LLMs)\nwhen the context is short. However, long contexts pose challenges due to the\nquadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. This challenge is\ncompounded in Indic languages, which are often low-resource. This study\nexplores context-shortening techniques, including Open Information Extraction\n(OIE), coreference resolution, Answer Paragraph Selection (APS), and their\ncombinations, to improve QA performance. Compared to the baseline of\nunshortened (long) contexts, our experiments on four Indic languages (Hindi,\nTamil, Telugu, and Urdu) demonstrate that context-shortening techniques yield\nan average improvement of 4\\% in semantic scores and 47\\% in token-level scores\nwhen evaluated on three popular LLMs without fine-tuning. Furthermore, with\nfine-tuning, we achieve an average increase of 2\\% in both semantic and\ntoken-level scores. Additionally, context-shortening reduces computational\noverhead. Explainability techniques like LIME and SHAP reveal that when the APS\nmodel confidently identifies the paragraph containing the answer, nearly all\ntokens within the selected text receive high relevance scores. However, the\nstudy also highlights the limitations of LLM-based QA systems in addressing\nnon-factoid questions, particularly those requiring reasoning or debate.\nMoreover, verbalizing OIE-generated triples does not enhance system\nperformance. These findings emphasize the potential of context-shortening\ntechniques to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM-based QA systems,\nespecially for low-resource languages.

Existing tracking\nparadigms can be broadly categorized into global- and local-based methods.\nGlobal-based trackers, such as SiamDT, achieve high accuracy by scanning the\nentire field of view but suffer from excessive computational overhead, limiting\nreal-world deployment. In contrast, local-based methods, including OSTrack and\nROMTrack, efficiently restrict the search region but struggle when targets\nundergo significant displacements due to abrupt camera motion. Through\npreliminary experiments, it is evident that a local tracker, when paired with\nadaptive search region adjustment, can significantly enhance tracking accuracy,\nnarrowing the gap between local and global trackers. To address this challenge,\nwe propose FocusTrack, a novel framework that dynamically refines the search\nregion and strengthens feature representations, achieving an optimal balance\nbetween computational efficiency and tracking accuracy. Specifically, our\nSearch Region Adjustment (SRA) strategy estimates the target presence\nprobability and adaptively adjusts the field of view, ensuring the target\nremains within focus. Furthermore, to counteract feature degradation caused by\nvarying search regions, the Attention-to-Mask (ATM) module is proposed. This\nmodule integrates hierarchical information, enriching the target\nrepresentations with fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat FocusTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, obtaining 67.7% AUC on\nAntiUAV and 62.8% AUC on AntiUAV410, outperforming the baseline tracker by 8.5%\nand 9.1% AUC, respectively.

Partial molar quantities are defined through\nthe use of the Euler theorem for homogeneous functions. These properties have\nbeen in use for a long time, despite the fact that they do not give an\nintuitive picture of the properties they are to represent. For instance, the\npartial molar volume of a given component in a mixture is the change in the\ntotal volume with a change in composition, hence it represents the derivative\nof a volume. The molar volume is a measurable property in the laboratory, and\nas such a body of thermodynamics, but the derived partial molar volume is not a\ndirect measure of the physical volume occupied by the added component. On the\nother hand, the physical volume can be computed using e.g. molecular dynamics\nsimulations by Voronoi tesselation. We shall call this volume the specific\nvolume. To bridge the partial molar volume and the specific volume, we define a\nsingle new thermodynamic variable - the co-molar volume - thus bringing the\nlatter into thermodynamics.

However, when processing complex geometric structures in\npoint clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture\nlocal geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and\nhigh model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies\nKolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate\ntheir efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a\nGeometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the\nmodel's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature\nProcessing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and\nglobal context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and\noverall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the\nGlobal Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive\nfield gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric\ninformation of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and\ncomputational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the\nPointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while\nmaintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN\noutperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,\nand ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning\ntask.

In this\npaper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro,\nChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their\ncapacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks\n(RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel\nperformance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F),\nexplainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the\ngenerated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these\nfeatures. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can\nachieve comparable or even superior translation performance compared with the\nclosed-source models requiring costly hardware setup and not accessible to all\nusers.",

This study evaluates the precision in\ncosmological parameters estimation derived from this signal via HI 21cm signal,\nthat observed by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, with spectral\nresolutions of 0.001 Hz and 0.002 Hz over an observational period of $\\Delta T\n= 0.5$ year, utilizing two established techniques: the canonical redshift drift\nand the differential redshift drift method.

The results reveal that both the two\nmethods impose highly precise constraints on cosmological parameters, with\naccuracy reaching the level of millimeter per second (mm/s) or better.

They are in particular used in the Baade-Wesselink\n(BW) method of distance determination of Cepheids. However, the impact of the\nSBCR on the BW distance of Cepheids is about 8%, depending on the choice of\nSBCR considered in the literature. We aim to calibrate a precise SBCR dedicated\nto Cepheids using the best quality interferometric measurements available as\nwell as different photometric bands, including the Gaia bands. We selected\ninterferometric and photometric data in the literature for seven Cepheids\ncovering different pulsation periods. From the phased photometry in the\ndifferent bands (VJHKG$\\mathrm{G_{BP}G_{RP}}$) corrected from extinction and\nthe interferometric limb-darkened angular diameters, we calculated the SBCR\nassociated with each combination of colours. We first find that the seven\nCepheids have consistent SBCRs as long as the two magnitudes considered are not\ntoo close in wavelengths. For the SBCR ($\\mathrm{F_{V},V-K}$): $\\mathrm{F_{V} =\n-0.1336_{\\pm 0.0009}(V-K)_{0}+3.9572_{\\pm 0.0015}}$, we obtain a root mean\nsquare (RMS) of 0.0040 mag, which is three times lower than the latest estimate\nfrom 2004. Also, for the first time, we present an SBCR dedicated to Cepheids\nbased on Gaia bands only: $\\mathrm{F_{G_{BP}} = -0.3001_{\\pm\n0.0030}(G_{BP}-G_{RP})_{0}+3.9977_{\\pm 0.0029}}$, with an excellent RMS of\n0.0061 mag. However, using theoretical models, we show that this SBCR is highly\nsensitive to metallicity.

    "abstract": "The demand for lightweight models in image classification tasks under\nresource-constrained environments necessitates a balance between computational\nefficiency and robust feature representation. Traditional attention mechanisms,\ndespite their strong feature modeling capability, often struggle with high\ncomputational complexity and structural rigidity, limiting their applicability\nin scenarios with limited computational resources (e.g., edge devices or\nreal-time systems). To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Aggregation\nModule (MAAM), a lightweight attention architecture integrated with the\nMindSpore framework. MAAM employs three parallel agent branches with\nindependently parameterized operations to extract heterogeneous features,\nadaptively fused via learnable scalar weights, and refined through a\nconvolutional compression layer. Leveraging MindSpore's dynamic computational\ngraph and operator fusion, MAAM achieves 87.0% accuracy on the CIFAR-10\ndataset, significantly outperforming conventional CNN (58.3%) and MLP (49.6%)\nmodels, while improving training efficiency by 30%. Ablation studies confirm\nthe critical role of agent attention (accuracy drops to 32.0% if removed) and\ncompression modules (25.5% if omitted), validating their necessity for\nmaintaining discriminative feature learning. The framework's hardware\nacceleration capabilities and minimal memory footprint further demonstrate its\npracticality, offering a deployable solution for image classification in\nresource-constrained scenarios without compromising accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are expected to play\nimportant role for future intelligent aerial systems due to their great\npotential to cooperatively accomplish complicated missions effectively.\nHowever, there are important challenges to be addressed to enable their\nefficient operation: the large-scale nature of swarms usually leads to\nexcessive spectrum consumption, and ultra-low cost requirements for individual\nUAVs renders it necessary to develop more cost-effective communication modules.\nIn addition, the densely located swarm UAVs require high resolution for\nlocalization and sensing. To address the above challenges and simultaneously\nachieve spectrum and energy-efficient communication and accurate sensing, we\ninvestigate low-altitude UAV swarm with integrated super-resolution sensing and\nsymbiotic communication technology. Specifically, one leading UAV may act as a\nprimary transmitter (PT) to transmit communication signals to the base station\n(BS), and the remaining nearby UAVs in the swarm act as passive backscatter\ndevices (BDs), which can modulate their information by efficiently\nbackscattering the radio frequency (RF) signals from the PT without consuming\nextra spectrum or power. In addition, to achieve efficient three-dimensional\n(3D) super-resolution sensing for the densely located UAV swarm, 3D sparse\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology and super-resolution signal\nprocessing algorithms are further exploited, where both L-shaped nested array\n(LNA) and planar nested arrays (PNA) are considered at the BS. To evaluate the\ncommunication and sensing performance for the UAV-symbiotic radio (SR) system,\nthe achievable rates of UAV swarm are derived and the beam patterns of sparse\nLNA, PNA and the benchmarking compact uniform planar array (UPA) are compared.",

This approach allows a principled\ncombination of learning and forgetting that ensures that critical knowledge is\npreserved while unused or outdated information is gradually released. Unlike\nstandard Bayesian approaches -- which risk becoming overly constrained, and\npopular continual-learning methods that rely on explicit task boundaries, MESU\nseamlessly adapts to streaming data. It further provides reliable epistemic\nuncertainty estimates, allowing out-of-distribution detection, the only\ncomputational cost being to sample the weights multiple times to provide proper\noutput statistics. Experiments on image-classification benchmarks demonstrate\nthat MESU mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while maintaining plasticity for\nnew tasks. When training 200 sequential permuted MNIST tasks, MESU outperforms\nestablished continual learning techniques in terms of accuracy, capability to\nlearn additional tasks, and out-of-distribution data detection. Additionally,\ndue to its non-reliance on task boundaries, MESU outperforms conventional\nlearning techniques on the incremental training of CIFAR-100 tasks consistently\nin a wide range of scenarios.

Yet, they can\nonly simulate a single adverse weather with a single physical model, and the\nfidelity of the generated data is quite limited. This paper presents\nWeatherGen, the first unified diverse-weather LiDAR data diffusion generation\nframework, significantly improving fidelity. Specifically, we first design a\nmap-based data producer, which can provide a vast amount of high-quality\ndiverse-weather data for training purposes.

The spider mamba models the feature interactions by scanning the\nLiDAR beam circle or central ray, excellently maintaining the physical\nstructure of the LiDAR data.

Secondly, LLM inference instances within a heterogeneous cluster\npossess varying processing capacities, leading to different processing speeds\nfor handling inference requests. Evaluating these capacities and designing a\nrequest scheduling algorithm that fully maximizes the potential of each\ninstance is challenging. In this paper, we propose a high-throughput inference\nservice system on heterogeneous clusters. First, the deployment configuration\nis optimized by modeling the resource amount and expected throughput and using\nthe exhaustive search method. Second, a novel mechanism is proposed to schedule\nrequests among instances, which fully considers the different processing\ncapabilities of various instances. Extensive experiments show that the proposed\nscheduler improves throughput by 122.5% and 33.6% on two heterogeneous\nclusters, respectively.",

An improved\neight-directional 2D Snake-Selective Scan mechanism and a dynamic weighting\nstrategy enhance the perception of complex vascular topologies. 3) The MREF\nmodule enhances boundary precision through multi-scale edge feature\naggregation, suppressing noise while emphasizing critical vessel structures\nacross scales.

    "abstract": "Android applications (apps) integrate reusable and well-tested third-party\nlibraries (TPLs) to enhance functionality and shorten development cycles.\nHowever, recent research reveals that TPLs have become the largest attack\nsurface for Android apps, where the use of insecure TPLs can compromise both\ndeveloper and user interests. To mitigate such threats, researchers have\nproposed various tools to detect TPLs used by apps, supporting further security\nanalyses such as vulnerable TPLs identification. Although existing tools\nachieve notable library-level TPL detection performance in the presence of\nobfuscation, they struggle with version-level TPL detection due to a lack of\nsensitivity to differences between versions. This limitation results in a high\nversion-level false positive rate, significantly increasing the manual workload\nfor security analysts. To resolve this issue, we propose SAD, a TPL detection\ntool with high version-level detection performance. SAD generates a candidate\napp class list for each TPL class based on the feature of nodes in class\ndependency graphs (CDGs). It then identifies the unique corresponding app class\nfor each TPL class by performing class matching based on the similarity of\ntheir class summaries. Finally, SAD identifies TPL versions by evaluating the\nstructural similarity of the sub-graph formed by matched classes within the\nCDGs of the TPL and the app. Extensive evaluation on three datasets\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of SAD and its components. SAD achieves F1\nscores of 97.64% and 84.82% for library-level and version-level detection on\nobfuscated apps, respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art tools. The\nversion-level false positives reported by the best tool is 1.61 times that of\nSAD. We further evaluate the degree to which TPLs identified by detection tools\ncorrespond to actual TPL classes.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we continue our previous investigation about energy\nminimization in the flow of fluids through tubes and networks of interconnected\ntubes of various geometries. We will show that the principle of energy\nminimization holds independent of the geometry of the tubes and networks of\nsuch interconnected tubes and independent of the type of fluid in such\ngeometries where in this regard we consider generalized Newtonian fluids. We\nconsider in this investigation the flow of Newtonian fluids through tubes and\nnetworks of interconnected tubes of elliptical, rectangular, equilateral\ntriangular and concentric circular annular cross sectional geometries. We also\nconsider a combination of geometric factor with a fluid type factor by showing\nthat the principle of energy minimization holds in the flow of some\nnon-Newtonian fluids (namely power law, Ellis and Ree-Eyring fluids) through\ntubes and networks of interconnected tubes of elliptical cross sections. The\nrelevance of this study extends beyond tubes and networks of fluid flow to\ninclude for instance porous media and electrical networks.",

    "abstract": "Accurate simulation of deformation processes at the atomic scale is critical\nfor predicting the mechanical response of materials and particularly the\ncalculation of directional flow stresses. This work presents a method for\napplying arbitrary deformation paths in LAMMPS while adhering to its convention\nthat supercell periodic vectors a, b are aligned such that a coincides with the\nx-axis and b lies in the (x,y) plane. This method is particularly relevant for\nmaterials with low crystal symmetry and also for exploring non uniaxial\ndeformations. The first step of the method consists in generating the\nsimulation frame tensor's time evolution upon any deformation, which may\ninitially violate LAMMPS alignment constraints. This constraint is then\novercome by the application of a rigid body rotation to realign the tensor with\nLAMMPS's convention, ensuring valid periodic boundary conditions. The resulting\nlengths and tilt factors from the rotated tensor are expressed analytically\nusing third-order polynomials and applied to the simulation cell using the fix\ndeform command. The present approach versatility is validated with the\ncalculation of directional flow stresses for various materials upon constant\nvolume shear, tension and compression, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nsimulations involving complex deformation scenarios and diverse crystal\nstructures.

    "abstract": "The ability to train intelligent autonomous agents (such as mobile robots) on\nmultiple tasks is crucial for adapting to dynamic real-world environments.\nHowever, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods only excel in\nsingle-task settings, and still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks\ndue to task interference. Moreover, real-world environments also demand the\nagents to have data stream processing capabilities. Toward this, a\nstate-of-the-art work employs Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve\nmulti-task learning by exploiting temporal information in data stream, while\nenabling lowpower/energy event-based operations. However, it relies on fixed\ncontext/task-switching intervals during its training, hence limiting the\nscalability and effectiveness of multi-task learning. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SwitchMT, a novel adaptive task-switching methodology\nfor RL-based multi-task learning in autonomous agents. Specifically, SwitchMT\nemploys the following key ideas: (1) a Deep Spiking Q-Network with active\ndendrites and dueling structure, that utilizes task-specific context signals to\ncreate specialized sub-networks; and (2) an adaptive task-switching policy that\nleverages both rewards and internal dynamics of the network parameters.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SwitchMT achieves superior performance in\nmulti-task learning compared to state-of-the-art methods. It achieves\ncompetitive scores in multiple Atari games (i.e., Pong: -8.8, Breakout: 5.6,\nand Enduro: 355.2) compared to the state-of-the-art, showing its better\ngeneralized learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of\nour SwitchMT methodology in addressing task interference while enabling\nmulti-task learning automation through adaptive task switching, thereby paving\nthe way for more efficient generalist agents with scalable multi-task learning\ncapabilities.",

Recent methods have adopt 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) to produce 3D scenes due to its efficient training process.\nHowever, these methodologies may generate incomplete 3D scenes or blurred\nmultiviews. This is because of (1) inaccurate 3DGS point initialization and (2)\nthe tendency of 3DGS to flatten 3D Gaussians with the sparse-view input. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel framework EG-Gaussian, which utilizes\nepipolar geometry and graph networks for 3D scene reconstruction. Initially, we\nintegrate epipolar geometry into the 3DGS initialization phase to enhance\ninitial 3DGS point construction. Then, we specifically design a graph learning\nmodule to refine 3DGS spatial features, in which we incorporate both spatial\ncoordinates and angular relationships among neighboring points. Experiments on\nindoor and outdoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to 3DGS-based methods.",

    "abstract": "Community detection plays a crucial role in understanding the structural\norganization of complex networks. Previous methods, particularly those from\nstatistical physics, primarily focus on the analysis of mesoscopic network\nstructures and often struggle to integrate fine-grained node similarities. To\naddress this limitation, we propose a low-complexity framework that integrates\nmachine learning to embed micro-level node-pair similarities into mesoscopic\ncommunity structures. By leveraging ensemble learning models, our approach\nenhances both structural coherence and detection accuracy. Experimental\nevaluations on artificial and real-world networks demonstrate that our\nframework consistently outperforms conventional methods, achieving higher\nmodularity and improved accuracy in NMI and ARI. Notably, when ground-truth\nlabels are available, our approach yields the most accurate detection results,\neffectively recovering real-world community structures while minimizing\nmisclassifications. To further explain our framework's performance, we analyze\nthe correlation between node-pair similarity and evaluation metrics. The\nresults reveal a strong and statistically significant correlation, underscoring\nthe critical role of node-pair similarity in enhancing detection accuracy.\nOverall, our findings highlight the synergy between machine learning and\nstatistical physics, demonstrating how machine learning techniques can enhance\nnetwork analysis and uncover complex structural patterns.",

    "abstract": "To reduce the time and computational costs of inference of large language\nmodels, there has been interest in parameter-efficient low-rank early-exit\ncasting of transformer hidden-representations to final-representations. Such\nlow-rank short-cutting has been shown to outperform identity shortcuts at early\nmodel stages while offering parameter-efficiency in shortcut jumps. However,\ncurrent low-rank methods maintain a separate early-exit shortcut jump to\nfinal-representations for each transformer intermediate block-level during\ninference. In this work, we propose selection of a single One-Jump-Fits-All\n(OJFA) low-rank shortcut that offers over a 30x reduction in shortcut parameter\ncosts during inference. We show that despite this extreme reduction, our OJFA\nchoice largely matches the performance of maintaining multiple shortcut jumps\nduring inference and offers stable precision from all transformer block-levels\nfor GPT2-XL, Phi3-Mini and Llama2-7B transformer models.",

    "abstract": "With the rapid advancements in quantum computing, traditional cryptographic\nschemes like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)\nare becoming vulnerable, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant\nalgorithms. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has\ninitiated a standardization process for PQC algorithms, and several candidates,\nincluding CRYSTALS-Kyber and McEliece, have reached the final stages. This\npaper first provides a comprehensive analysis of the hardware complexity of\npost-quantum cryptography (PQC) in embedded systems, categorizing PQC\nalgorithms into families based on their underlying mathematical problems:\nlattice-based, code-based, hash-based and multivariate / isogeny-based schemes.\nEach family presents distinct computational, memory, and energy profiles,\nmaking them suitable for different use cases. To address these challenges, this\npaper discusses optimization strategies such as pipelining, parallelization,\nand high-level synthesis (HLS), which can improve the performance and energy\nefficiency of PQC implementations. Finally, a detailed complexity analysis of\nCRYSTALS-Kyber and McEliece, comparing their key generation, encryption, and\ndecryption processes in terms of computational complexity, has been conducted.",

    "abstract": "Music generation aims to create music segments that align with human\naesthetics based on diverse conditional information. Despite advancements in\ngenerating music from specific textual descriptions (e.g., style, genre,\ninstruments), the practical application is still hindered by ordinary users'\nlimited expertise or time to write accurate prompts. To bridge this application\ngap, this paper introduces MusFlow, a novel multimodal music generation model\nusing Conditional Flow Matching. We employ multiple Multi-Layer Perceptrons\n(MLPs) to align multimodal conditional information into the audio's CLAP\nembedding space. Conditional flow matching is trained to reconstruct the\ncompressed Mel-spectrogram in the pretrained VAE latent space guided by aligned\nfeature embedding. MusFlow can generate music from images, story texts, and\nmusic captions. To collect data for model training, inspired by multi-agent\ncollaboration, we construct an intelligent data annotation workflow centered\naround a fine-tuned Qwen2-VL model. Using this workflow, we build a new\nmultimodal music dataset, MMusSet, with each sample containing a quadruple of\nimage, story text, music caption, and music piece. We conduct four sets of\nexperiments: image-to-music, story-to-music, caption-to-music, and multimodal\nmusic generation. Experimental results demonstrate that MusFlow can generate\nhigh-quality music pieces whether the input conditions are unimodal or\nmultimodal. We hope this work can advance the application of music generation\nin multimedia field, making music creation more accessible.

In this paper, we\npresent and evaluate a target propagation-based method for RNNs, which uses\nlocal updates and seeks to reduce the said instabilities. Having stable RNN\nmodels increases their practical use in a wide range of fields such as natural\nlanguage processing, time-series forecasting, anomaly detection, control\nsystems, and robotics.\n  The proposed solution uses local representation alignment (LRA). We\nthoroughly analyze the performance of this method, experiment with\nnormalization and different local error functions, and invalidate certain\nassumptions about the behavior of this type of learning. Namely, we demonstrate\nthat despite the decomposition of the network into sub-graphs, the model still\nsuffers from vanishing gradients. We also show that gradient clipping as\nproposed in LRA has little to no effect on network performance. This results in\nan LRA RNN model that is very difficult to train due to vanishing gradients. We\naddress this by introducing gradient regularization in the direction of the\nupdate and demonstrate that this modification promotes gradient flow and\nmeaningfully impacts convergence. We compare and discuss the performance of the\nalgorithm, and we show that the regularized LRA RNN considerably outperforms\nthe unregularized version on three landmark tasks: temporal order, 3-bit\ntemporal order, and random permutation.",

Evaluating\nthese non-transparent systems is computationally expensive, as fixed budgets\nlimit the number of possible observations. Therefore, achieving stable and\nsample-efficient optimization for these systems has become a critical\nchallenge. This work presents a novel Bayesian optimization framework (TPE-AS)\nthat improves search stability and efficiency for black-box portfolio models\nunder these limited observation budgets. Standard Bayesian optimization, which\nsolely maximizes expected return, can yield erratic search trajectories and\nmisalign the surrogate model with the true objective, thereby wasting the\nlimited evaluation budget. To mitigate these issues, we propose a weighted\nLagrangian estimator that leverages an adaptive schedule and importance\nsampling. This estimator dynamically balances exploration and exploitation by\nincorporating both the maximization of model performance and the minimization\nof the variance of model observations. It guides the search from broad,\nperformance-seeking exploration towards stable and desirable regions as the\noptimization progresses. Extensive experiments and ablation studies, which\nestablish our proposed method as the primary approach and other configurations\nas baselines, demonstrate its effectiveness across four backtest settings with\nthree distinct black-box portfolio management models.",

Experimental\nresults using FTSE 100 stock data demonstrate that CMTF achieves superior\nperformance in price direction classification compared to classical and deep\nlearning baselines. These findings suggest that our framework is an effective\nand scalable solution for real-world cross-modal financial forecasting tasks.",

    "abstract": "Instrumental variables are a popular tool to infer causal effects under\nunobserved confounding, but choosing suitable instruments is challenging in\npractice. We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that\naddresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental\nvariables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends\nprevious work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates\nnon-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than\nexisting methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to\nupdate models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this\nmodel selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model\nuncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and\nprovides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulation experiments,\ngIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

This study compared four statistical methods for estimating the\nprevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and associated factors,\nwhile correcting for misclassification. The methods were: (1) Standard Logistic\nRegression with external correction using known sensitivity and specificity;\n(2) the Liu et al. model, which jointly estimates FP and FN rates; (3) Bayesian\nLogistic Regression with external correction; and (4) a Bayesian model with\ninternal correction using informative priors on diagnostic accuracy. Data came\nfrom 11,452 participants in a voluntary screening campaign for HIV, syphilis,\nand hepatitis B (2020-2024). Prevalence estimates and regression coefficients\nwere compared across models using relative changes from crude estimates,\nconfidence interval (CI) width, and coefficient variability. The Liu model\nproduced higher prevalence estimates but had wider CIs and convergence issues\nin low-prevalence settings. The Bayesian model with internal correction gave\nintermediate estimates with the narrowest CIs and more stable intercepts,\nsuggesting improved baseline prevalence estimation. Informative or weakly\ninformative priors helped regularize estimates, especially in small-sample or\nrare-event contexts. Accounting for misclassification influenced both\nprevalence and covariate associations.

Bugs in these parsers can introduce critical\nvulnerabilities, including memory corruption, information leakage, and\ndenial-of-service attacks. An intuitive way to assess parser correctness is to\ncompare the implementation with its official protocol standard. However, this\ncomparison is challenging because protocol standards are typically written in\nnatural language, whereas implementations are in source code. Existing methods\nlike model checking, fuzzing, and differential testing have been used to find\nparsing bugs, but they either require significant manual effort or ignore the\nprotocol standards, limiting their ability to detect semantic violations. To\nenable more automated validation of parser implementations against protocol\nstandards, we propose PARVAL, a multi-agent framework built on large language\nmodels (LLMs). PARVAL leverages the capabilities of LLMs to understand both\nnatural language and code. It transforms both protocol standards and their\nimplementations into a unified intermediate representation, referred to as\nformat specifications, and performs a differential comparison to uncover\ninconsistencies. We evaluate PARVAL on the Bidirectional Forwarding Detection\n(BFD) protocol.

We introduce two complex scalar fields: one responsible\nfor forming the Q-ball, and the other for spontaneously breaking the $U(1)$\nsymmetry, allowing us to clearly separate the formation and symmetry-breaking\nphases. Using numerical simulations in a spherically symmetric system, we find\nthat the evolution of Q-balls depends sensitively on the structure of the\ninteraction between the two fields and the magnitude of symmetry breaking.\nDepending on parameters, Q-balls can completely decay, evaporate into smaller,\nstable Q-balls, or transition into oscillons/I-balls. In particular, we find\nthat stable, localized remnants often survive the evolution over long\ntimescales, especially when the symmetry-breaking scale is small. These results\ndemonstrate that, even though spontaneous $U(1)$ breaking can lead to\nsignificant energy and charge loss from Q-balls, stable localized objects with\nreduced or no charge can frequently survive and potentially contribute to\ncosmological relics.",

Such an operator $D$ is hypoelliptic if, for any smooth function $f$, the\nsolutions $u$ of the equation $Du=f$ are also smooth. A more refined notion,\nthat of maximal hypoelliptic operators, extends this property in terms of\nSobolev regularity, offering a parallel in sub-Riemannian geometry to elliptic\noperators. In 1979, Helffer and Nourrigat proposed a conjecture characterizing\nmaximal hypoellipticity, generalizing the main regularity theorem for elliptic\noperators. This conjecture has recently been confirmed using tools from\nnon-commutative geometry. A central element of this work is a natural\ngeneralisation in sub-Riemannian geometry, introduced by Mohsen, of the Connes\ntangent groupoid, in which appear all the tangent cones, key ingredients in the\nwork of Helffer and Nourrigat.

However, the existing methods cannot perfectly handle\nthe EUI datasets (with continuously changing distance and significant\nresolution differences).

Results: Our framework SolarZip achieved\nup to 800x reduction for Full Sun Imager (FSI) data and 500x for High\nResolution Imager (HRI$_{\\text{EUV}}$) data. It significantly outperformed both\ntraditional and advanced algorithms, achieving 3-50x higher compression ratios\nthan traditional algorithms, surpassing the second-best algorithm by up to 30%.\nSimulation experiments verified that SolarZip can reduce data transmission time\nby up to 270x while ensuring the preservation of scientific usability.\nConclusions: The SolarZip framework significantly enhances solar observational\ndata compression efficiency while preserving scientific usability by\ndynamically selecting optimal compression methods based on observational\nscenarios and user requirements.

Instruction-guided image\nediting with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing\nfailures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort\nto trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results,\nwhich is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image\n(T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability,\nand evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address\nthis, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using\nbackground consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without\nsupervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent\nEvaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects\nreliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion\ntimesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying\nonly the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency\nscore, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while\npreserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into\ninstruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language\nModels (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results\nwhen seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces\ncomputational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while\nimproving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40\npercent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external\nsupervision or training.",

Although SR has achieved great success in\npredicting future user interests, existing SR methods still fail to fully\nexploit system exposure data. Most methods only model items that have been\ninteracted with, while the large volume of exposed but non-interacted items is\noverlooked. Even methods that consider the whole system exposure typically\ntrain the recommender using only the logged historical system exposure, without\nexploring unseen user interests.\n  In this paper, we propose counterfactual augmentation over system exposure\nfor sequential recommendation (CaseRec). To better model historical system\nexposure, CaseRec introduces reinforcement learning to account for different\nexposure rewards. CaseRec uses a decision transformer-based sequential model to\ntake an exposure sequence as input and assigns different rewards according to\nthe user feedback. To further explore unseen user interests, CaseRec proposes\nto perform counterfactual augmentation, where exposed original items are\nreplaced with counterfactual items. Then, a transformer-based user simulator is\nproposed to predict the user feedback reward for the augmented items.\nAugmentation, together with the user simulator, constructs counterfactual\nexposure sequences to uncover new user interests. Finally, CaseRec jointly uses\nthe logged exposure sequences with the counterfactual exposure sequences to\ntrain a decision transformer-based sequential model for generating\nrecommendation. Experiments on three real-world benchmarks show the\neffectiveness of CaseRec. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ZiqiZhao1/CaseRec.",

    "abstract": "The idea of augmented or hybrid intelligence offers a compelling vision for\ncombining human and AI capabilities, especially in tasks where human wisdom,\nexpertise, or common sense are essential. Unfortunately, human reasoning can be\nflawed and shortsighted, resulting in adverse individual impacts or even\nlong-term societal consequences. While strong efforts are being made to develop\nand optimize the AI aspect of hybrid reasoning, the real urgency lies in\nfostering wiser and more intelligent human participation. Tools that enhance\ncritical thinking, ingenuity, expertise, and even wisdom could be essential in\naddressing the challenges of our emerging future. This paper proposes the\ndevelopment of generative AI-based tools that enhance both the human ability to\nreflect upon a problem as well as the ability to explore the technical aspects\nof it. A high-level model is also described for integrating AI and human\ncapabilities in a way that centralizes human participation and control.",

This study\npresents novel machine learning-based solutions for NASA's hyperspectral\nmissions, including EMIT and PACE, tackling high-fidelity retrievals of\nphytoplankton absorption coefficient and chlorophyll a from their hyperspectral\nremote sensing reflectance. Given that a single Rrs spectrum may correspond to\nvaried combinations of inherent optical properties and associated\nconcentrations, the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used as a backbone in this\nstudy to handle such multi-distribution prediction problems. We first time\ntailor the VAE model with innovative designs to achieve hyperspectral\nretrievals of aphy and of Chl-a from hyperspectral Rrs in optically complex\nestuarine-coastal waters. Validation with extensive experimental observation\ndemonstrates superior performance of the VAE models with high precision and low\nbias. The in-depth analysis of VAE's advanced model structures and learning\ndesigns highlights the improvement and advantages of VAE-based solutions over\nthe mixture density network (MDN) approach, particularly on high-dimensional\ndata, such as PACE.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models are a promising tool for automated vulnerability\ndetection, thanks to their success in code generation and repair. However,\ndespite widespread adoption, a critical question remains: Are LLMs truly\neffective at detecting real-world vulnerabilities? Current evaluations, which\noften assess models on isolated functions or files, ignore the broader\nexecution and data-flow context essential for understanding vulnerabilities.\nThis oversight leads to two types of misleading outcomes: incorrect conclusions\nand flawed rationales, collectively undermining the reliability of prior\nassessments. Therefore, in this paper, we challenge three widely held community\nbeliefs: that LLMs are (i) unreliable, (ii) insensitive to code patches, and\n(iii) performance-plateaued across model scales. We argue that these beliefs\nare artifacts of context-deprived evaluations. To address this, we propose\nCORRECT (Context-Rich Reasoning Evaluation of Code with Trust), a new\nevaluation framework that systematically incorporates contextual information\ninto LLM-based vulnerability detection. We construct a context-rich dataset of\n2,000 vulnerable-patched program pairs spanning 99 CWEs and evaluate 13 LLMs\nacross four model families. Our framework elicits both binary predictions and\nnatural-language rationales, which are further validated using LLM-as-a-judge\ntechniques. Our findings overturn existing misconceptions. When provided with\nsufficient context, SOTA LLMs achieve significantly improved performance (e.g.,\n0.7 F1-score on key CWEs), with 0.8 precision. We show that most false\npositives stem from reasoning errors rather than misclassification, and that\nwhile model and test-time scaling improve performance, they introduce\ndiminishing returns and trade-offs in recall. Finally, we uncover new flaws in\ncurrent LLM-based detection systems, such as limited generalization and\noverthinking biases.",

Current methods primarily address symptoms of\nnon-IID by applying incremental adjustments to Federated Averaging (FedAvg),\nrather than directly resolving its inherent design limitations. Consequently,\nperformance significantly deteriorates under highly heterogeneous conditions,\nas the fundamental issue of imbalanced exposure to diverse class and feature\ndistributions remains unresolved. This paper introduces Stratify, a novel FL\nframework designed to systematically manage class and feature distributions\nthroughout training, effectively tackling the root cause of non-IID challenges.\nInspired by classical stratified sampling, our approach employs a Stratified\nLabel Schedule (SLS) to ensure balanced exposure across labels, significantly\nreducing bias and variance in aggregated gradients. Complementing SLS, we\npropose a label-aware client selection strategy, restricting participation\nexclusively to clients possessing data relevant to scheduled labels.\nAdditionally, Stratify incorporates a fine-grained, high-frequency update\nscheme, accelerating convergence and further mitigating data heterogeneity. To\nuphold privacy, we implement a secure client selection protocol leveraging\nhomomorphic encryption, enabling precise global label statistics without\ndisclosing sensitive client information. Extensive evaluations on MNIST,\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, COVTYPE, PACS, and Digits-DG demonstrate\nthat Stratify attains performance comparable to IID baselines, accelerates\nconvergence, and reduces client-side computation compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods, underscoring its practical effectiveness in realistic federated\nlearning scenarios.",

Therefore, we propose a new\nfew-shot temporal action localization method by Chain-of-Thought textual\nreasoning to improve localization performance. Specifically, we design a novel\nfew-shot learning framework that leverages textual semantic information to\nenhance the model's ability to capture action commonalities and variations,\nwhich includes a semantic-aware text-visual alignment module designed to align\nthe query and support videos at different levels. Meanwhile, to better express\nthe temporal dependencies and causal relationships between actions at the\ntextual level to assist action localization, we design a Chain of Thought\n(CoT)-like reasoning method that progressively guides the Vision Language Model\n(VLM) and Large Language Model (LLM) to generate CoT-like text descriptions for\nvideos. The generated texts can capture more variance of action than visual\nfeatures. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available\nActivityNet1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets.

Unlike retinal\nganglion cells (RGCs) in the human eye, however, which integrate signals from\nmultiple photoreceptors within a receptive field to extract spatio-temporal\nfeatures, conventional event cameras do not leverage local spatial context when\ndeciding which events to fire. Moreover, the eye contains around 20 different\nkinds of RGCs operating in parallel, each attuned to different features or\nconditions.

We apply the\nhybrid spherical-planar wave model (HSPWM) as the channel model owing to the\nstructual feature of the modular array, and propose a 3-D localization\nalgorithm with relatively high accuracy and low complexity. Specifically, we\nfirst distinguish the visible sub-arrays (SAs) located in the VR and estimate\nthe angles-of-arrival (AoAs) from each UE to typical visible SAs with the\nlargest receive power via compressed sensing (CS) method. In addition, we apply\nthe weighted least square (WLS) method to obtain a coarse 3-D position\nestimation of each UE according to the AoA estimations. Then, we estimate the\nAoAs of the other SAs with a reduced dictionary (RD)-CS-based method for lower\ncomputational complexity, and utilize all the efficient AoA estimations to\nderive a fine position estimation. Simulation results indicate that the\nproposed positioning framework based on modular XL-array can achieve\nsatisfactory accuracy with evident reduction in complexity.

In this study, we evaluate 10 different machine learning models and\nneural networks [1] based on Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R^2 values for\ntheir ability to predict one of these systems, the multi-pendulum. We begin by\ngenerating synthetic data representing the angles of the pendulum over time\nusing the Runge Kutta Method for solving 4th Order Differential Equations\n(ODE-RK4) [2]. At first, we used the single-step sliding window approach,\npredicting the 50st step after training for steps 0-49 and so forth. However,\nto more accurately cover chaotic motion and behavior in these systems, we\ntransitioned to a time-step based approach. Here, we trained the model/network\non many initial angles and tested it on a completely new set of initial angles,\nor 'in-between' to capture chaotic motion to its fullest extent. We also\nevaluated the stability of the system using Lyapunov exponents. We concluded\nthat for a double pendulum, the best model was the Long Short Term Memory\nNetwork (LSTM)[3] for the sliding window and time step approaches in both\nfriction and frictionless scenarios.

Since GW parameter\nestimation depends critically on waveform template accuracy, improved source\nmodeling and waveform construction are essential for tighter constraints on\nparity-violating gravity. This work explores the dynamics and gravitational\nradiation from the binary black hole systems with orbital eccentricity and spin\nprecession.

Our motivation is to develop some existence\nresults for biharmonic-Kirchhoff systems and biharmonic systems in the\nEuclidean setting, which are the continuous models, to the corresponding\nsystems in the locally finite graph setting, which are the discrete models. We\nmainly focus on the existence of infinitely many solutions for a\nbiharmonic-Kirchhoff system on a locally finite graph. The method is\nvariational and the main tool is the symmetric mountain pass theorem. We obtain\nthat the system has infinitely many solutions when the nonlinear term admits\nthe super-$4$ linear growth, and we also present the corresponding results to\nthe biharmonic system. We also find that the results in the locally finite\ngraph setting are better than that in the Euclidean setting, which caused by\nthe better embedding theorem in the locally finite graph.",

    "abstract": "Many objects are represented as high-dimensional vectors nowadays. In this\nsetting, the relevance between two objects (vectors) is usually evaluated by\ntheir inner product. Recently, item-centric searches, which search for users\nrelevant to query items, have received attention and find important\napplications, such as product promotion and market analysis. To support these\napplications, this paper considers reverse $k$-ranks queries. Given a query\nvector $\\mathbf{q}$, $k$, a set $\\mathbf{U}$ of user vectors, and a set\n$\\mathbf{P}$ of item vectors, this query retrieves the $k$ user vectors\n$\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbf{U}$ with the highest\n$r(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{P})$, where\n$r(\\mathbf{q},\\mathbf{u},\\mathbf{P})$ shows the rank of $\\mathbf{q}$ for\n$\\mathbf{u}$ among $\\mathbf{P}$. Because efficiently computing the exact answer\nfor this query is difficult in high dimensions, we address the problem of\napproximate reverse $k$-ranks queries.

Given an item vector (i.e., query), it retrieves all user\nvectors such that their $k$-MIPS results contain the item vector. Consider the\ncardinality of a reverse $k$-MIPS result. A large cardinality means that the\nitem is potentially popular, because it is included in the $k$-MIPS results of\nmany users. This mining is important in recommender systems, market analysis,\nand new item development. Motivated by this, we formulate a new problem. In\nthis problem, the score of each item is defined as the cardinality of its\nreverse $k$-MIPS result, and the $N$ items with the highest score are\nretrieved. A straightforward approach is to compute the scores of all items,\nbut this is clearly prohibitive for large numbers of users and items. We remove\nthis inefficiency issue and propose a fast algorithm for this problem.

    "abstract": "Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and\npoint transformations to extend the one-dimensional SCLC from planar gaps to\nmore complicated geometries. However, introducing a magnetic field orthogonal\nto the diode's electric field complicates these calculations due to changes in\nthe electron trajectory. This paper extends a recent study that applied\nvariational calculus to determine the SCLC for a cylindrical crossed-field\ndiode to derive an equation that is valid for any orthogonal coordinate system.\nWe then derive equations for the SCLC for crossed-field gaps in spherical,\ntip-to-tip, and tip-to-plane geometries that can be solved numerically. These\ncalculations exhibit a discontinuity at the Hull cutoff magnetic field $B_H$\ncorresponding to the transition to magnetic insulation as observed analytically\nfor a planar geometry. The ratio of the crossed-field SCLC to the nonmagnetic\nSCLC becomes essentially independent of geometry when we fix $\\delta = D/D_M >\n0.6$, where $D$ is the canonical gap distance accounting for geometric effects\non electric potential and $D_M$ is the effective gap distance that accounts for\nmagnetic field and geometry. The solutions for these geometries overlap as\n$\\delta \\to 1$ since the geometric corrections for electric potential and\nmagnetic field match. This indicates the possibility of more generally\naccounting for the combination of geometric and magnetic effects when\ncalculating $B_H$ and SCLC.",

This design ensures that the restored image remains both\ngeometrically accurate and visually faithful while preventing the accumulation\nof incorrect estimations. The circular restoration process involves both\nforward and inverse mapping. To ensure the bijectivity of the estimated\nnon-rigid deformations, computational quasi-conformal geometry theories are\nleveraged to regularize the mapping, enforcing its homeomorphic properties.\nThis guarantees a well-defined transformation that preserves structural\nintegrity and prevents unwanted artifacts. Furthermore, tight-frame blocks are\nintegrated to encode distortion-sensitive features for precise recovery. To\nvalidate the performance of our approach, we conduct evaluations on various\nsynthetic and real-world captured images.

We demonstrate two equivalent formulations for MFI in this specific S\nalpha S-to-S alpha S setting.

The second uses an\nintegral expectation E_gv[u(x,0) (pF_v(x) - pF_s(x))] involving the difference\nbetween Fisher scores (pF_v, pF_s) and a specific MMSE-related score function\nu(x,0) derived from the interpolation dynamics.

However, in\nreal-world autonomous driving scenarios, cameras and LiDAR are subject to\nvarious faults, which can probably significantly impact the decision-making and\nbehaviors of ADSs. Existing MSF testing approaches only discovered corner cases\nthat the MSF-based perception cannot accurately detected by MSF-based\nperception, while lacking research on how sensor faults affect the system-level\nbehaviors of ADSs.\n  To address this gap, we conduct the first exploration of the fault tolerance\nof MSF perception-based ADS for sensor faults. In this paper, we systematically\nand comprehensively build fault models for cameras and LiDAR in AVs and inject\nthem into the MSF perception-based ADS to test its behaviors in test scenarios.\nTo effectively and efficiently explore the parameter spaces of sensor fault\nmodels, we design a feedback-guided differential fuzzer to discover the safety\nviolations of MSF perception-based ADS caused by the injected sensor faults.

We analyzed 24 macro- and micronutrients, C-reactive protein (CRP),\nand the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) in 26,409 NHANES\nparticipants (2,120 with cancer).

We present\na comprehensive analysis comparing the two most common techniques for\nmitigating this spectral bias: Fourier feature encodings (FFE) and multigrid\nparametric encodings (MPE). FFEs are seen as the standard for low dimensional\nmappings, but MPEs often outperform them and learn representations with higher\nresolution and finer detail. FFE's roots in the Fourier transform, make it\nsusceptible to aliasing if pushed too far, while MPEs, which use a learned grid\nstructure, have no such limitation. To understand the difference in\nperformance, we use the neural tangent kernel (NTK) to evaluate these encodings\nthrough the lens of an analogous kernel regression. By finding a lower bound on\nthe smallest eigenvalue of the NTK, we prove that MPEs improve a network's\nperformance through the structure of their grid and not their learnable\nembedding. This mechanism is fundamentally different from FFEs, which rely\nsolely on their embedding space to improve performance. Results are empirically\nvalidated on a 2D image regression task using images taken from 100 synonym\nsets of ImageNet and 3D implicit surface regression on objects from the\nStanford graphics dataset. Using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and\nmultiscale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) to evaluate how well fine details\nare learned, we show that the MPE increases the minimum eigenvalue by 8 orders\nof magnitude over the baseline and 2 orders of magnitude over the FFE.

Recent studies have\nshown that orthogonal LoRA tuning effectively mitigates forgetting. However,\nthis work unveils that under orthogonal LoRA tuning, the critical parameters\nfor pre-tasks still change notably after learning post-tasks. To address this\nproblem, we directly propose freezing the most critical parameter matrices in\nthe Vision Transformer (ViT) for pre-tasks before learning post-tasks. In\naddition, building on orthogonal LoRA tuning, we propose orthogonal LoRA\ncomposition (LoRAC) based on QR decomposition, which may further enhance the\nplasticity of our method. Elaborate ablation studies and extensive comparisons\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our results indicate that\nour method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several well-known\ncontinual learning benchmarks.

Developing a task-specific\nmodel for every cytology application is impractical and non-cytology-specific\nfoundation models struggle to generalize to tasks in this domain where the\nemphasis is on cell morphology. To address these challenges, we introduce\nCytoFM, the first cytology self-supervised foundation model.

By incorporating VBGs into repeater-based architectures, we\ndemonstrate that the inter-repeater spacing can be substantially extended,\nresulting in fewer required nodes and significantly reducing hardware and\noperational complexity.

Third-generation repeaters benefit from\nimproved link transmission success, which is crucial for quantum error\ncorrection. In contrast, second-generation repeaters exhibit a more nuanced\nresponse; although transmission loss is reduced, their performance remains\nprimarily limited by logical gate errors rather than channel loss. These\nfindings highlight that while all repeater generations benefit from reduced\nphoton loss, the magnitude of improvement depends critically on the underlying\nerror mechanisms.

A key open question is whether their faint appearance arises from\nintrinsic properties or stochastic events in their formation histories. We aim\nto trace the formation histories of LSBGs to assess whether their evolutionary\npaths differ from those of high-surface brightness galaxies (HSBGs), and to\nidentify the key physical drivers behind these differences. We present a fast\nand efficient method to estimate stellar surface brightness densities in\nhydro-dynamical simulations and a statistically robust exploration of over 150\nproperties in the reference run \\textsc{Ref-L0100N1504} of the \\texttt{EAGLE}\nsimulation. To minimise biases, we carefully match the stellar and halo mass\ndistributions of the selected LSB and HSB samples. At $z=0$, LSBGs are\ntypically extended, rotation-supported systems with lower stellar densities,\nolder stellar populations, reduced star formation activity, and higher specific\nstellar angular momenta $j_*$ than their HSBG counterparts. They also exhibit\nlarger radii of maximum circular velocity ($R_{\\mathrm{Vmax}}$). We identify\nkey transition redshifts that mark the divergence of LSBG and HSBG properties:\n$j_*$ diverges at $z\\sim5-7$ and $R_{\\mathrm{Vmax}}$ at $z\\sim2-3$. Star\nformation activity and large-scale environment seem to play only a minimal role\nin the development of LSB features. LSBGs follow mass-dependent evolutionary\npathways, where early rapid formation and later slowdowns, combined with their\ndistinct structural properties, influence their response to external factors\nlike mergers and gas accretion. Their LSB nature emerges from intrinsic\ndynamical and structural factors rather than environmental influences, with\nangular momentum as a key driver of divergence at high redshifts.",

    "abstract": "Ground beetles are a highly sensitive and speciose biological indicator,\nmaking them vital for monitoring biodiversity. However, they are currently an\nunderutilized resource due to the manual effort required by taxonomic experts\nto perform challenging species differentiations based on subtle morphological\ndifferences, precluding widespread applications. In this paper, we evaluate 12\nvision models on taxonomic classification across four diverse, long-tailed\ndatasets spanning over 230 genera and 1769 species, with images ranging from\ncontrolled laboratory settings to challenging field-collected (in-situ)\nphotographs. We further explore taxonomic classification in two important\nreal-world contexts: sample efficiency and domain adaptation. Our results show\nthat the Vision and Language Transformer combined with an MLP head is the best\nperforming model, with 97% accuracy at genus and 94% at species level. Sample\nefficiency analysis shows that we can reduce train data requirements by up to\n50% with minimal compromise in performance. The domain adaptation experiments\nreveal significant challenges when transferring models from lab to in-situ\nimages, highlighting a critical domain gap. Overall, our study lays a\nfoundation for large-scale automated taxonomic classification of beetles, and\nbeyond that, advances sample-efficient learning and cross-domain adaptation for\ndiverse long-tailed ecological datasets.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by their success in solving challenging inverse problems in computer\nvision, implicit neural representations (INRs) have been recently proposed for\nreconstruction in low-dose/sparse-view X-ray computed tomography (CT). An INR\nrepresents a CT image as a small-scale neural network that takes spatial\ncoordinates as inputs and outputs attenuation values. Fitting an INR to\nsinogram data is similar to classical model-based iterative reconstruction\nmethods. However, training INRs with losses and gradient-based algorithms can\nbe prohibitively slow, taking many thousands of iterations to converge. This\npaper investigates strategies to accelerate the optimization of INRs for CT\nreconstruction.

    "abstract": "In order to be widely applicable, speech-driven 3D head avatars must\narticulate their lips in accordance with speech, while also conveying the\nappropriate emotions with dynamically changing facial expressions. The key\nproblem is that deterministic models produce high-quality lip-sync but without\nrich expressions, whereas stochastic models generate diverse expressions but\nwith lower lip-sync quality. To get the best of both, we seek a stochastic\nmodel with accurate lip-sync. To that end, we develop a new approach based on\nthe following observation: if a method generates realistic 3D lip motions, it\nshould be possible to infer the spoken audio from the lip motion. The inferred\nspeech should match the original input audio, and erroneous predictions create\na novel supervision signal for training 3D talking head avatars with accurate\nlip-sync. To demonstrate this effect, we propose THUNDER (Talking Heads Under\nNeural Differentiable Elocution Reconstruction), a 3D talking head avatar\nframework that introduces a novel supervision mechanism via differentiable\nsound production. First, we train a novel mesh-to-speech model that regresses\naudio from facial animation. Then, we incorporate this model into a\ndiffusion-based talking avatar framework. During training, the mesh-to-speech\nmodel takes the generated animation and produces a sound that is compared to\nthe input speech, creating a differentiable analysis-by-audio-synthesis\nsupervision loop. Our extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments\ndemonstrate that THUNDER significantly improves the quality of the lip-sync of\ntalking head avatars while still allowing for generation of diverse,\nhigh-quality, expressive facial animations.

In this paper, we target the System-Level Cache (SLC) of Apple\nM-series SoCs, which is exclusive to higher-level CPU caches. We address the\nchallenges of the exclusiveness and propose a suite of SLC-cache occupancy\nattacks, the first of its kind, where an adversary can monitor GPU and other\nCPU cluster activities from their own CPU cluster. We first discover the\nstructure of SLC in Apple M1 SOC and various policies pertaining to access and\nsharing through reverse engineering.

The other attack is a fine-grained pixel stealing\nattack, which precisely monitors the GPU memory usage for rendering different\npixels, through the SLC occupancy channel. Third, we introduce a novel screen\ncapturing attack which works beyond webpages, with the monitoring granularity\nof 57 rows of pixels (there are 1600 rows for the screen). This significantly\nexpands the attack surface, allowing the adversary to retrieve any screen\ndisplay, posing a substantial new threat to system security.

Large-amplitude inversions of the solar wind's interplanetary\nmagnetic field have long been documented; however, observations from the Parker\nSolar Probe (PSP) mission have renewed interest in this phenomenon as such\nfeatures, often termed switchbacks, may constrain both the sources of the solar\nwind as well as in-situ nonlinear dynamics and turbulent heating. Aims. We aim\nto show that magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind are consistent with\nAlfv\\'enic fluctuations that naturally form switchback inversions in the\nmagnetic field through expansion effects. Methods. We examine PSP observations\nof the evolution of a single stream of solar wind in a radial scan from PSP's\ntenth perihelion encounter from approximately 15-50 solar radii. We study the\ngrowth and radial scaling of normalized fluctuation amplitudes in the magnetic\nfield, $\\delta B/B$, within the framework of spherical polarization. We compare\nheating rates computed via outer-scale decay from consideration of wave-action\nto proton heating rates empirically observed through considering adiabatic\nexpansion. Results. We find that the magnetic field fluctuations are largely\nspherically polarized and that the normalized amplitudes of the magnetic field,\n$\\delta B/B$, increases with amplitude. The growth of the magnetic field\namplitude leads to switchback inversions in the magnetic field. While the\namplitudes do not grow as fast as predicted by the conservation of wave action,\nthe deviation from the expected scaling yields an effective heating rate, which\nis close to the empirically observed proton heating rate. Conclusions. The\nobserved scaling of fluctuation amplitudes is largely consistent with a picture\nof expanding Alfv\\'en waves that seed turbulence leading to dissipation. The\nexpansion of the waves leads to the growth of wave-amplitudes, resulting in the\nformation of switchbacks.",

Analysis of the GKP code is complicated by the fact that\nfinite-energy code states leak out of the ideal GKP code space and are not\northogonal. We analyze a variant of the GKP stabilizer measurement circuit\nusing damped, approximate GKP states that virtually project onto the ideal GKP\ncode space between rounds of error correction even when finite-energy GKP\nstates are used. This allows us to identify logical maps between projectors;\nhowever, due to finite-energy effects, these maps fail to resolve completely\npositive, trace-preserving channels on the logical code space. We present two\nsolutions to this problem based on channel twirling the damping operator. The\nfirst twirls over the full stabilizer group motivated by standard binning (SB)\ndecoding that converts small amounts of damping into Gaussian random noise. The\nsecond twirls over a set of representative Pauli shifts that keeps the energy\nin the code finite and allow for arbitrary decoding. This approach is not\nlimited to small damping, can be applied when logical GKP unitaries or other\nsources of CV noise are present, and allows us to study general decoding, which\ncan be optimized to the noise in the circuit. Focusing on damping, we compare\ndecoding strategies tailored to different levels of effective squeezing. While\nour results indicate that SB decoding is suboptimal for finite-energy GKP\nstates, the advantage of optimized decoding over SB decoding shrinks as the\nenergy in the code increases, and moreover the performance of both strategies\nconverges to that of the stabilizer-twirled logical channel. These studies\nprovide stronger arguments for commonplace procedures in the analysis of GKP\nerror correction:(i) using stochastically shifted GKP states in place of\ncoherently damped ones, and(ii) the use of SB decoding.",
