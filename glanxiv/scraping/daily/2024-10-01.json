Explicit\nformulas are derived under the MBD using subcopulas to introduce dependence\nmeasures for interactions of all orders, not just pairwise. A Bayesian\ninference approach is also applied to estimate the parameters of the MBD,\noffering practical tools for parameter estimation and dependence analysis in\nreal-world applications. The results obtained contribute to the application of\nsubcopulas of multivariate binary data, with real data examples.",

    "abstract": "Recently, guided waves-based techniques have garnered increased attention\nfrom researchers in the field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) for damage\ndetection and quantification. Extracting features that are sensitive to changes\nin structural conditions has become a critical step. Guided waves, being one of\nthe most widely used techniques, are highly responsive to structural changes\ncaused by various types of damage. However, due to disturbances from\nenvironmental and operational conditions (EOCs) and waveforms reflected from\nboundaries and damage in complex systems, manually extracting features related\nto the system state is challenging. To address this, various neural networks,\ncapable of automatically deriving features, have been developed and applied to\nsystem identification tasks. Among these, Convolutional Autoencoders (CAEs)\nhave proven effective as damage detectors, projecting data efficiently into a\nlatent space. However, existing CAE-based models for damage diagnosis often\noverlook the influence of EOCs, which can significantly impact model\nperformance. In this work, a scheme that provides accurate damage level\nclassification while estimating EOCs, such as loading conditions, making the\nmodel adaptable to varying external factors is introduced. By restructuring and\ncombining the CAE with feedforward neural networks (FFNNs), the proposed scheme\nalso enables signal reconstruction, a potentially valuable feature when data is\nlimited. The method has been validated on an aluminum plate with various damage\nlevels under different loading conditions, achieving near-perfect state\nclassification and low-error signal reconstruction. The framework has also been\ntested on incomplete datasets to verify its robustness.",

We study the behavior of V745 Sco at radio wavelengths\n(0.6-37,GHz), covering both its 1989 and 2014 eruptions and informed by\noptical, X-ray, and $\\gamma$-ray data. The radio light curves are\nsynchrotron-dominated. Surprisingly, compared to expectations for synchrotron\nemission from explosive transients such as radio supernovae, the light curves\nspanning 0.6-37 GHz all peak around the same time ($\\sim$18-26 days after\neruption) and with similar flux densities (5-9 mJy).We model the synchrotron\nlight curves as interaction of the nova ejecta with the red giant wind, but\nfind that simple spherically symmetric models with wind-like circumstellar\nmaterial (CSM) cannot explain the radio light curve. Instead, we conclude that\nthe shock suddenly breaks out of a dense CSM absorbing screen around 20 days\nafter eruption, and then expands into a relatively low density wind\n($\\dot{M}_{out} \\approx 10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for $v_w = 10$\nkm s$^{-1}$) out to $\\sim$1 year post-eruption.

The outer lower-density CSM would not be\nvisible in typical radio observations of Type Ia supernovae: V745 Sco cannot be\nruled out as a Type Ia progenitor based on CSM constraints alone.Complementary\nconstraints from the free-free radio optical depth and the synchrotron\nluminosity imply the shock is efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons\nand amplifying magnetic fields, with $\\epsilon_e$ and $\\epsilon_B \\approx\n0.01-0.1$.",

Moreover, the performance, and efficiency of the trained ML models on\nsynthetic images is compared with ML models trained on real imagery and mixed\nimagery. Findings proved the effectiveness of the synthetic data for fire\ndetection, while the performance improves as the test dataset covers a broader\nspectrum of real fires. Our findings illustrates that when synthetic imagery\nand real imagery is utilized in a mixed training set the resulting ML model\noutperforms models trained on real imagery as well as models trained on\nsynthetic imagery for detection of a broad spectrum of fires.

In contrast, solar coronal jets, which are long (~50,000 km), narrow\n(less than about 10,000 km), transient (~10--20 min) plasma spires with bright\nbases and that are seen in soft X-rays and EUV, occur much more frequently,\nlikely several hundred times per day independent of large-scale solar activity\nlevel. Recent studies indicate that coronal jets are small-scale versions of\nlarge-scale eruptions, often produced by eruption of a small-scale\n\"miniflament,\" that results in a \"miniflare\" analogous to a larger typical\nsolar flare, and that sometimes produces a CME analogue (a \"narrow CME\" or\n\"white-light jet\"). Under the assumption that jets are small-scale eruptions,\ntheir higher occurrence frequency and faster build-up evolution reveals perhaps\nfundamental aspects of all eruptions that are not as easy to discern in the\nmore-complex magnetic environment and the slower build up to the larger\neruptions.

These formulae reproduce well the results of earlier exact\nanalytic calculations valid for ultra-relativistic shocks and also hold for\n$\\gamma<10$ and for \"off-axis\" propagation (deviating from the\nultra-relativistic results by approximately an order of magnitude). Our results\nwill improve parameter estimation accuracy from future observations of\nsynchrotron emission produced by collisionless shocks driven by the\nrelativistic ejected material from compact objects mergers and jetted tidal\ndisruption events.

    "abstract": "Graphene possesses a unique combination of physical properties including high\ncarrier mobility and high current density it can sustain. In contrast to bulk\nmetals, graphene does not completely screen the external electrostatic field.\nIn this work, we consider the possibility of utilizing these properties for\nbuilding devices for high-density electric energy storage. We consider a\nthree-plate parallel plate capacitor where the middle plate is made of graphene\nand negatively charged. The electric forces of attraction acting on the\nelectrons on the middle plate are compensated as the electric fields on both\nsides of the plate are not screened. However, it brings the system to an\nunstable equilibrium state. To make system stable, we consider fast\noscillations similar to ones in Kapitza pendulum. AC electric current through\nthe middle graphene plane creates a magnetic field. In turn, Lorentz force\nsqueezes moving electrons towards the center of the middle plane. We present\nthe results of numerical modeling showing the effect of AC electric current on\nelectron movement. According to the estimates, the pseudopotential produced by\nthe AC current may exceed 60 eV at room temperature. Such a large value of the\npseudopotential is due to the high mobility and large current density in\ngraphene. The electric field intensity between the edge plates and the middle\nplate may exceed the breakdown value for a conventional double-plate\nparallel-plate capacitors leading to the increase in the electric energy\nstorage. The electric breakdown of the graphene capacitor is limited by the\nmechanical strength of the side plates. It may be possible to enhance the\nvolume electric energy density above the gasoline 34 MJ/L. We also describe\npossible experiments to validate this idea.",

Traditional machine learning and deep learning models have achieved\nnotable success in this domain but often lack interpretability which is a\ncrucial requirement in clinical settings. In this study, we explore the use of\nneuro-symbolic methods, specifically Logical Neural Networks (LNNs), to develop\nexplainable models for diagnosis prediction. Essentially, we design and\nimplement LNN-based models that integrate domain-specific knowledge through\nlogical rules with learnable thresholds. Our models, particularly\n$M_{\\text{multi-pathway}}$ and $M_{\\text{comprehensive}}$, demonstrate superior\nperformance over traditional models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, and\nRandom Forest, achieving higher accuracy (up to 80.52\\%) and AUROC scores (up\nto 0.8457) in the case study of diabetes prediction. The learned weights and\nthresholds within the LNN models provide direct insights into feature\ncontributions, enhancing interpretability without compromising predictive\npower. These findings highlight the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches in\nbridging the gap between accuracy and explainability in healthcare AI\napplications. By offering transparent and adaptable diagnostic models, our work\ncontributes to the advancement of precision medicine and supports the\ndevelopment of equitable healthcare solutions.

We\nattack this problem by building an agent that we call \\textbf{\\ours} that is\nable to make its own visual instruction book. By disassembling an unseen\nassembly and periodically saving images of it, the agent is able to create a\nset of instructions so that it has the information necessary to rebuild it.\nThese instructions form an explicit memory that allows the model to reason\nabout the assembly process one step at a time, avoiding the need for long-term\nimplicit memory. This in turn allows us to train on much larger LEGO assemblies\nthan has been possible in the past. To demonstrate the power of this model, we\nrelease a new dataset of procedurally built LEGO vehicles that contain an\naverage of 31 bricks each and require over one hundred steps to disassemble and\nreassemble.

Most\nexisting autonomy systems heavily rely on active sensing, e.g., LiDAR, RADAR,\nand Time-of-Flight sensors, or use (stereo) visible light imaging sensors,\ne.g., color cameras, to perceive environment geometry and semantics. In\nscenarios where fully passive perception is required and lighting conditions\nare degraded to an extent that visible light cameras fail to perceive, most\ndownstream mobility tasks such as obstacle avoidance become impossible. To\naddress such a challenge, this paper presents a Multi-Modal Passive Perception\ndataset, M2P2, to enable off-road mobility in low-light to no-light conditions.\nWe design a multi-modal sensor suite including thermal, event, and stereo RGB\ncameras, GPS, two Inertia Measurement Units (IMUs), as well as a\nhigh-resolution LiDAR for ground truth, with a novel multi-sensor calibration\nprocedure that can efficiently transform multi-modal perceptual streams into a\ncommon coordinate system.

It is a common belief that the predictive power of networks\nleveraging softmax arises from \"circuits\" which sharply perform certain kinds\nof computations consistently across many diverse inputs. However, for these\ncircuits to be robust, they would need to generalise well to arbitrary valid\ninputs. In this paper, we dispel this myth: even for tasks as simple as finding\nthe maximum key, any learned circuitry must disperse as the number of items\ngrows at test time. We attribute this to a fundamental limitation of the\nsoftmax function to robustly approximate sharp functions with increasing\nproblem size, prove this phenomenon theoretically, and propose adaptive\ntemperature as an ad-hoc technique for improving the sharpness of softmax at\ninference time.",

FMBench\nhas the following key features: 1: It includes four demographic attributes:\nrace, ethnicity, language, and gender, across two tasks, VQA and RG, under\nzero-shot settings. 2: Our VQA task is free-form, enhancing real-world\napplicability and mitigating the biases associated with predefined choices. 3:\nWe utilize both lexical metrics and LLM-based metrics, aligned with clinical\nevaluations, to assess models not only for linguistic accuracy but also from a\nclinical perspective. Furthermore, we introduce a new metric, Fairness-Aware\nPerformance (FAP), to evaluate how fairly MLLMs perform across various\ndemographic attributes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance and fairness of\neight state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs, including both general and medical\nMLLMs, ranging from 7B to 26B parameters on the proposed benchmark. We aim for\nFMBench to assist the research community in refining model evaluation and\ndriving future advancements in the field. All data and code will be released\nupon acceptance.",

This monograph aims to provide a reasonably self-contained modern\nintroduction to survival analysis. We focus on predicting time-to-event\noutcomes at the individual data point level with the help of neural networks.\nOur goal is to provide the reader with a working understanding of precisely\nwhat the basic time-to-event prediction problem is, how it differs from\nstandard regression and classification, and how key \"design patterns\" have been\nused time after time to derive new time-to-event prediction models, from\nclassical methods like the Cox proportional hazards model to modern deep\nlearning approaches such as deep kernel Kaplan-Meier estimators and neural\nordinary differential equation models. We further delve into two extensions of\nthe basic time-to-event prediction setup: predicting which of several critical\nevents will happen first along with the time until this earliest event happens\n(the competing risks setting), and predicting time-to-event outcomes given a\ntime series that grows in length over time (the dynamic setting). We conclude\nwith a discussion of a variety of topics such as fairness, causal reasoning,\ninterpretability, and statistical guarantees.

Our CC-WSI-Net\nintegrates a content- and color-consistency supervisor, ensuring consistency\nacross tiles and facilitating the generation of seamless synthetic WSIs while\nensuring Sox10 immunohistochemistry accuracy in melanocyte detection. We\nvalidate our method through extensive image-quality analyses, objective\ndetection assessments, and a subjective survey with pathologists.

    "abstract": "Centipede-like robots offer an effective and robust solution to navigation\nover complex terrain with minimal sensing. However, when climbing over\nobstacles, such multi-legged robots often elevate their center-of-mass into\nunstable configurations, where even moderate terrain uncertainty can cause\ntipping over. Robust mechanisms for such elongate multi-legged robots to\nself-right remain unstudied. Here, we developed a comparative biological and\nrobophysical approach to investigate self-righting strategies. We first\nreleased \\textit{S. polymorpha} upside down from a 10 cm height and recorded\ntheir self-righting behaviors using top and side view high-speed cameras. Using\nkinematic analysis, we hypothesize that these behaviors can be prescribed by\ntwo traveling waves superimposed in the body lateral and vertical planes,\nrespectively. We tested our hypothesis on an elongate robot with static\n(non-actuated) limbs, and we successfully reconstructed these self-righting\nbehaviors. We further evaluated how wave parameters affect self-righting\neffectiveness. We identified two key wave parameters: the spatial frequency,\nwhich characterizes the sequence of body-rolling, and the wave amplitude, which\ncharacterizes body curvature. By empirically obtaining a behavior diagram of\nspatial frequency and amplitude, we identify effective and versatile\nself-righting strategies for general elongate multi-legged robots, which\ngreatly enhances these robots' mobility and robustness in practical\napplications such as agricultural terrain inspection and search-and-rescue.",

    "abstract": "As the uses of augmented reality (AR) become more complex and widely\navailable, AR applications will increasingly incorporate intelligent features\nthat require developers to understand the user's behavior and surrounding\nenvironment (e.g. an intelligent assistant). Such applications rely on video\ncaptured by an AR headset, which often contains disjointed camera movement with\na limited field of view that cannot capture the full scope of what the user\nsees at any given time. Moreover, standard methods of visualizing object\ndetection model outputs are limited to capturing objects within a single frame\nand timestep, and therefore fail to capture the temporal and spatial context\nthat is often necessary for various domain applications. We propose ARPOV, an\ninteractive visual analytics tool for analyzing object detection model outputs\ntailored to video captured by an AR headset that maximizes user understanding\nof model performance. The proposed tool leverages panorama stitching to expand\nthe view of the environment while automatically filtering undesirable frames,\nand includes interactive features that facilitate object detection model\ndebugging. ARPOV was designed as part of a collaboration between visualization\nresearchers and machine learning and AR experts; we validate our design choices\nthrough interviews with 5 domain experts.",

By leveraging similar morphologies and\ncontrol strategies, their robotic counterparts also demonstrate effective\nterrestrial locomotion. However, the success of these multi-legged robots is\nlargely limited to forward locomotion; steering is substantially less studied,\nin part because of the difficulty in coordinating a high degree-of-freedom\nrobot to follow predictable, planar trajectories. To resolve these challenges,\nwe take inspiration from control schemes based on geometric mechanics(GM) in\nelongate system's locomotion through highly damped environments. We model the\nelongate, multi-legged system as a ``terrestrial swimmer\" in highly frictional\nenvironments and implement steering schemes derived from low-order templates of\nelongate, limbless systems. We identify an effective turning strategy by\nsuperimposing two traveling waves of lateral body undulation and further\nexplore variations of the ``turning wave\" to enable a spectrum of arc-following\nsteering primitives. We test our hypothesized modulation scheme on a\nrobophysical model and validate steering trajectories against theoretically\npredicted displacements. We then apply our control framework to Ground Control\nRobotics' elongate multi-legged robot, Major Tom, using these motion primitives\nto construct planar motion and in closed-loop control on different terrains.\nOur work creates a systematic framework for controlling these highly mobile\ndevices in the plane using a low-order model based on sequences of body shape\nchanges.",

The least\nnumber of colors needed for a strong edge-coloring of a graph is the strong\nchromatic index. We consider the list version of the coloring and prove that\nthe list strong chromatic index of graphs with maximum degree 3 is at most 10.\nThis bound is tight and improves the previous bound of 11 colors.\n  We also consider the question whether the strong chromatic index and the list\nstrong chromatic index always coincide. We answer it in negative by presenting\nan infinite family of graphs for which the two invariants differ. For the\nspecial case of the Petersen graph, we show that its list strong chromatic\nindex equals 7, while its strong chromatic index is 5. Up to our best\nknowledge, this is the first known edge-coloring for which there are graphs\nwith distinct values of the chromatic index and its list version.\n  In relation to the above, we also initiate the study of the list version of\nthe normal edge-coloring. A normal edge-coloring of a cubic graph is a proper\nedge-coloring, in which every edge is adjacent to edges colored with 4 colors\nor to edges colored with 2 colors. It is conjectured that 5 colors suffice for\na normal edge-coloring of any bridgeless cubic graph which is equivalent to the\nPetersen Coloring Conjecture.\n  Similarly to strong edge-coloring, list normal edge-coloring is much more\nrestrictive and consequently for many graphs the list normal chromatic index is\ngreater than the normal chromatic index. We show that there are cubic graphs\nwith list normal chromatic index at least $9$, there are bridgeless cubic\ngraphs with its value at least 8, and there are cyclically 4-edge-connected\ncubic graphs with value at least 7.",

However, these robots have limited\ncapability to climb over obstacles with sizes comparable to their heights. We\nhypothesize that such limitations stem from the two-wave template that we used\nto prescribe the multi-legged locomotion. Seeking effective alternative waves\nfor obstacle-climbing, we designed a five-segment robot with static\n(non-actuated) legs, where each cable-driven joint has a rotational\ndegree-of-freedom (DoF) in the sagittal plane (vertical wave) and a linear DoF\n(peristaltic wave). We tested robot locomotion performance on a flat terrain\nand a rugose terrain. While the benefit of peristalsis on flat-ground\nlocomotion is marginal, the inclusion of a peristaltic wave substantially\nimproves the locomotion performance in rugose terrains: it not only enables\nobstacle-climbing capabilities with obstacles having a similar height as the\nrobot, but it also significantly improves the traversing capabilities of the\nrobot in such terrains.

To tackle control issues, we employ\na model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) to stabilize the USV along a\ndesired trajectory.

    "abstract": "Efficient scheduling is crucial for interactive Large Language Model (LLM)\napplications, where low request completion time directly impacts user\nengagement. Size-based scheduling algorithms like Shortest Remaining Process\nTime (SRPT) aim to reduce average request completion time by leveraging known\nor estimated request sizes and allowing preemption by incoming jobs with\nshorter service times. However, two main challenges arise when applying\nsize-based scheduling to LLM systems. First, accurately predicting output\nlengths from prompts is challenging and often resource-intensive, making it\nimpractical for many systems. As a result, the state-of-the-art LLM systems\ndefault to first-come, first-served scheduling, which can lead to head-of-line\nblocking and reduced system efficiency. Second, preemption introduces extra\nmemory overhead to LLM systems as they must maintain intermediate states for\nunfinished (preempted) requests. In this paper, we propose TRAIL, a method to\nobtain output predictions from the target LLM itself. After generating each\noutput token, we recycle the embedding of its internal structure as input for a\nlightweight classifier that predicts the remaining length for each running\nrequest. Using these predictions, we propose a prediction-based SRPT variant\nwith limited preemption designed to account for memory overhead in LLM systems.\nThis variant allows preemption early in request execution when memory\nconsumption is low but restricts preemption as requests approach completion to\noptimize resource utilization. On the theoretical side, we derive a closed-form\nformula for this SRPT variant in an M/G/1 queue model, which demonstrates its\npotential value. In our system, we implement this preemption policy alongside\nour embedding-based prediction method.",

In contrast, dynamic tasks\nsuch as soccer require the robot to run towards the ball, decelerate to an\noptimal approach to dribble, and eventually kick a goal - a continuum of smooth\nmotion. To this end, we propose Preferenced Oracle Guided Multi-mode Policies\n(OGMP) to learn a single policy mastering all the required modes and preferred\nsequence of transitions to solve uni-object loco-manipulation tasks. We design\nhybrid automatons as oracles to generate references with continuous dynamics\nand discrete mode jumps to perform a guided policy optimization through bounded\nexploration. To enforce learning a desired sequence of mode transitions, we\npresent a task-agnostic preference reward that enhances performance. The\nproposed approach demonstrates successful loco-manipulation for tasks like\nsoccer and moving boxes omnidirectionally through whole-body control. In\nsoccer, a single policy learns to optimally reach the ball, transition to\ncontact-rich dribbling, and execute successful goal kicks and ball stops.\nLeveraging the oracle's abstraction, we solve each loco-manipulation task on\nrobots with varying morphologies, including HECTOR V1, Berkeley Humanoid,\nUnitree G1, and H1, using the same reward definition and weights.",

We first use the YouTube Data API\nto collect metadata of desired videos on select search keywords and use Google\nVideo Intelligence API to analyze texts, frames and objects data. Then we\nannotate the YouTube video materials on medical information, video\nunderstandability and overall recommendation. We develop a bidirectional long\nshort-term memory (BiLSTM) model to identify medical terms in videos and build\nthree classifiers to group videos based on the levels of encoded medical\ninformation and video understandability, and whether the videos are recommended\nor not. Our study provides healthcare stakeholders with guidelines and a\nscalable approach for generating new educational video content to enhance\nmanagement of a vast number of health conditions.",

They can have\nmillions of points, making subsequent downstream tasks such as compression and\nstreaming computationally expensive. PC sampling (selecting a subset of points)\ncan be used to reduce complexity. Existing PC sampling algorithms focus on\npreserving geometry features and often do not scale to handle large PCs. In\nthis work, we develop scalable graph-based sampling algorithms for PC color\nattributes, assuming the full geometry is available. Our sampling algorithms\nare optimized for a signal reconstruction method that minimizes the graph\nLaplacian quadratic form. We first develop a global sampling algorithm that can\nbe applied to PCs with millions of points by exploiting sparsity and sampling\nrate adaptive parameter selection. Further, we propose a block-based sampling\nstrategy where each block is sampled independently. We show that sampling the\ncorresponding sub-graphs with optimally chosen self-loop weights (node weights)\nwill produce a sampling set that approximates the results of global sampling\nwhile reducing complexity by an order of magnitude. Our empirical results on\ntwo large PC datasets show that our algorithms outperform the existing fast PC\nsubsampling techniques (uniform and geometry feature preserving random\nsampling) by 2dB. Our algorithm is up to 50 times faster than existing graph\nsignal sampling algorithms while providing better reconstruction accuracy.\nFinally, we illustrate the efficacy of PC attribute sampling within a\ncompression scenario, showing that pre-compression sampling of PC attributes\ncan lower the bitrate by 11% while having minimal effect on reconstruction.",

Doing so allows us to show that, for $\\beta\n\\geq 2$, the charges (for the most part) pair into neutral dipoles of very\nsmall size as $\\lambda \\to 0$. This complements the prior work of Lebl\\'e,\nZeitouni, and the second author, which proved that this does not happen for\n$\\beta < 2$, thereby implying a transition at $\\beta = 2$ from free charges to\ndipole pairs. Moreover, we obtain an estimate on the size of linear statistics.\n  The description in terms of dipoles is made via a decomposition into\nnearest-neighbor graphs of the point configurations, \\`a la Gunson-Panta.

    "abstract": "Chains of co-Buechi automata (COCOA) have recently been introduced as a new\ncanonical representation of omega-regular languages. The co-Buechi automata in\na chain assign to each omega-word its natural color, which depends only on the\nlanguage itself and not on its automaton representation. The automata in such a\nchain can be minimized in polynomial time and are good-for-games, making the\nrepresentation attractive for verification and reactive synthesis applications.\nHowever, since in such applications, a specification is usually given in linear\ntemporal logic (LTL), to make COCOA useful, the specification first has to be\ntranslated into such a chain of automata. Currently, the only known translation\nprocedure involves a detour through deterministic parity automata (LTL to DPW\nto COCOA), where the first step neglects the natural colors and requires\nintricate constructions by Safra or Esparza et al. This observation raises the\nquestion whether, by leveraging the definition of the natural color of words,\nthese complex constructions can be avoided, leading to a more direct\ntranslation from LTL to COCOA.\n  This paper presents a surprisingly simple yet optimal translation from LTL to\nCOCOA. Our procedure relies on standard operations on weak alternating\nautomata, Miyano-Hayashi's breakpoint construction, an augmented subset\nconstruction, and simple graph algorithms. With weak alternating automata as a\nstarting point, the procedure can also handle specifications in linear dynamic\nlogic.",

In this\npaper, we introduce a novel test set and metrics designed to complete the\ncurrent standard evaluation of VSSL models by testing them in scenarios where\nnone of the objects in the image corresponds to the audio input, i.e. a\nnegative audio. We consider three types of negative audio: silence, noise and\noffscreen.

Additionally, we provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of the range of maximum values in the estimated\naudio-visual similarity maps, in both positive and negative audio cases, and\nshow that most of the models are not discriminative enough, making them unfit\nto choose a universal threshold appropriate to perform sound localization\nwithout any a priori information of the sounding object, that is, object size\nand visibility.",

In the present work we present an overview of the approximations\nmade against PLWE derived from this and subsequent works, along with several\nnew attacks which refine those by Elias et al. exploiting the order of the\ntrace of roots over finite extensions of the finite field under the three\nscenarios laid out by Elias et al., allowing to generalize the setting in which\nthe attacks can be carried out.",

The effects of burst duty cycle (DC) and blowing ratio, alongside power\nrequirements, are examined in relation to SJA-induced vortical structures and\naerodynamic performance. Results show that increasing the DC or blowing ratio\ncan achieve the threshold momentum coefficient required for flow reattachment.\nWhile both DC and blowing ratios impact control efficacy, achieving a specific\nmomentum coefficient generally corresponds to a consistent lift coefficient,\nregardless of the individual parameter values. Substantial lift improvements\nare observed at DCs as low as 5%, indicating that brief, high-momentum\nperturbations to the flow are sufficient for reattachment, resulting in\nsignificant power savings. However, analysis of the flow dynamics reveals that\nlow-DC control strategies result in unsteady, phase-dependent flow behavior due\nto the induced vortices' rapid dissipation and inconsistent evolution. Higher\nDCs produce stronger, more persistent vortices that remain closer to the\nairfoil surface, leading to a more stable and effective control strategy. The\nstudy also highlights the challenge of achieving full spanwise control across\nthe finite-span array, as even high-power strategies could not achieve a\ncontrol length greater than 40% of the array's span. Additionally, a strong\ncorrelation between the lift coefficient and the suction peak pressure\ncoefficient is observed, indicating that single-point measurements suffice for\nrapid assessment of control effectiveness.",

In prior work, we assumed that the neural network has access to the\nfull matter distribution. In this work, we apply our method to halos.

While the traditional mass-binned halo\nanalysis is optimal in practice without further halo properties on AbacusPNG,\nour novel formalism easily allows to include additional halo properties such as\nthe halo concentration, which can improve $f_{NL}$ constraints by a factor of a\nfew.

However, the upper limit of the embedded\ncluster sample is less than 1000 M$_{\\odot}$, and only a few ATLASGAL clumps\nhave a mass higher than 3000 M$_{\\odot}$. Thus, the currently observed clumps\ncannot be the \"direct\" precursors of the currently observed open clusters. If\nthe Milky Way has a burst-like and time-dependent star formation history, the\ncurrently observed open clusters with old ages and high masses may come from\nmassive clumps in the past. There is also a very real possibility that these\nopen clusters originate from post-gas expulsion coalescence of multiple\nembedded clusters. We compared the separation of open clusters and the typical\nsize of molecular clouds, and find that most molecular clouds may only form one\nopen cluster, which supports the scenario of post-gas expulsion coalescence.\nFurther study is necessary to distinguish between the different scenarios.",

The PRB-0002, a new plastic\nscintillation detector (PSD) part of the Hyperscint RP-200 dosimetric platform\nfrom Medscint, can potentially facilitate small field measurements. In this\nwork our objective is twofold: first we perform a detailed characterization of\nthe field output correction factors of the PRB-0002 over a wide range of field\nsizes; second we demonstrate how this PSD can be used to determine the field\noutput correction factors for other small field detectors. Uncertainties were\ncarefully considered and a detailed uncertainty budget is provided. EGSnrc\nMonte Carlo simulations were conducted to determine the impact of detector\ncomposition, surrounding materials, dose averaging within the sensitive volume\nas well as ionization quenching. From these simulations, the field output\ncorrection factors of this PSD were determined. Then, by experimental\ncomparisons, field output correction factors for 2 solid state detectors and 3\nsmall volume ion chambers were. With PRB-0002, the material composition was\nfound to be balanced with the ionization quenching making the field output\ncorrection factor near unity. For fields between 0.6 $\\times$ 0.6 and 30\n$\\times$ 30~cm$^2$, the field output correction factors of the PRB-0002 were\nbetween 1.002 and 0.999 with a total uncertainty of 0.5 %. Analysis of the\nuncertainty budget showed that an overall uncertainty of 0.59% can be achieved\nfor a 1 $\\times$ 1~cm$^2$ using PRB-0002. We conclude that PRB-0002 is a\nnear-ideal detector for small field dosimetry. Furthermore, it can be used to\nexperimentally determine the field output correction factors of other\ndosimeters with great accuracy.",

In the special case where all objects are boxes (also\nknown as hyperrectangles) this is known as Klee's measure problem. The\nstate-of-the-art algorithm [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] for union volume estimation\nand Klee's measure problem in constant dimension $d$ computes a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation with constant success probability by using a\ntotal of $O(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ queries of the form (i) ask for the volume of\n$O_i$, (ii) sample a point uniformly at random from $O_i$, and (iii) query\nwhether a given point is contained in $O_i$.\n  We show that if one can only interact with the objects via the aforementioned\nthree queries, the query complexity of [Karp, Luby, Madras '89] is indeed\noptimal, i.e., $\\Omega(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ queries are necessary. Our lower bound\nalready holds for estimating the union of equiponderous axis-aligned polygons\nin $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and even if the algorithm is allowed to inspect the\ncoordinates of the points sampled from the polygons, and still holds when a\ncontainment query can ask containment of an arbitrary (not sampled) point.\n  Guided by the insights of the lower bound, we provide a more efficient\napproximation algorithm for Klee's measure problem improving the\n$O(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ time to $O((n+\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2}) \\cdot\n\\log^{O(d)}n)$. We achieve this improvement by exploiting the geometry of\nKlee's measure problem in various ways: (1) Since we have access to the boxes'\ncoordinates, we can split the boxes into classes of boxes of similar shape. (2)\nWithin each class, we show how to sample from the union of all boxes, by using\northogonal range searching.

The\nstandard approach to addressing this problem involves a reduction to bandit\nconvex optimization with memory. In the bandit setting, constructing a gradient\nestimator with low variance is challenging due to the memory structure and\nnon-quadratic loss functions.\n  In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Our main\ncontribution is an algorithm that achieves an $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ optimal\nregret for bandit non-stochastic control with strongly-convex and smooth cost\nfunctions in the presence of adversarial perturbations, improving the\npreviously known $\\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound from (Cassel and Koren,\n2020.

However, they often struggle to capture\nhigh-frequency textures due to limited model capacity. To address these\nlimitations, we adopt a simple yet efficient post-processing framework --\nunlike previous studies that focus solely on end-to-end training -- guided by\nour theoretical insights. Specifically, leveraging the \\textit{Lipschitz\nContinuity Theory} of neural networks, we prove a crucial noise tolerance\nproperty for the Vector Quantized AutoEncoder (VQ-AE), and establish the\nexistence of a Noise Robustness Upper Bound (NRoUB). This insight reveals that\nwe can efficiently obtain an identity-specific denoiser by training an\nidentity-specific neural discrete representation, without requiring an extra\nnetwork. Based on this theoretical foundation, we propose a plug-and-play\nSpace-Optimized VQ-AE (SOVQAE) with enhanced NRoUB to achieve\ntemporally-consistent denoising. For practical deployment, we further introduce\na cascade pipeline combining a pretrained Wav2Lip model with SOVQAE to perform\nID-specific THG. Our experiments demonstrate that this pipeline achieves\n\\textit{state-of-the-art} performance in video quality and robustness for\nout-of-distribution lip synchronization, surpassing existing identity-specific\nTHG methods. In addition, the pipeline requires only a couple of consumer GPU\nhours and runs in real time, which is both efficient and practical for industry\napplications.",

This generates a natural\ntrade-off, where complex models generally have higher skills but are harder to\nexplain and thus trust. Interpretability is particularly important in the\nclimate community, where we aim at gaining a physical understanding of the\nunderlying phenomena. Even more so when the prediction concerns extreme weather\nevents with high impact on society. In this paper, we perform probabilistic\nforecasts of extreme heatwaves over France, using a hierarchy of increasingly\ncomplex ML models, which allows us to find the best compromise between accuracy\nand interpretability. More precisely, we use models that range from a global\nGaussian Approximation (GA) to deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with\nthe intermediate steps of a simple Intrinsically Interpretable Neural Network\n(IINN) and a model using the Scattering Transform (ScatNet). Our findings\nreveal that CNNs provide higher accuracy, but their black-box nature severely\nlimits interpretability, even when using state-of-the-art Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) tools. In contrast, ScatNet achieves similar\nperformance to CNNs while providing greater transparency, identifying key\nscales and patterns in the data that drive predictions. This study underscores\nthe potential of interpretability in ML models for climate science,\ndemonstrating that simpler models can rival the performance of their more\ncomplex counterparts, all the while being much easier to understand.

Two main approaches\nhave emerged: the forward approach, which learns a mapping from input to its\nvalue, thereby acting as a proxy to guide optimization, and the inverse\napproach, which learns a mapping from value to input for conditional\ngeneration. (a) Although proxy-free~(classifier-free) diffusion shows promise\nin robustly modeling the inverse mapping, it lacks explicit guidance from\nproxies, essential for generating high-performance samples beyond the training\ndistribution. Therefore, we propose \\textit{proxy-enhanced sampling} which\nutilizes the explicit guidance from a trained proxy to bolster proxy-free\ndiffusion with enhanced sampling control. (b) Yet, the trained proxy is\nsusceptible to out-of-distribution issues. To address this, we devise the\nmodule \\textit{diffusion-based proxy refinement}, which seamlessly integrates\ninsights from proxy-free diffusion back into the proxy for refinement.

    "abstract": "Chaotic dynamics, commonly seen in weather systems and fluid turbulence, are\ncharacterized by their sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes accurate\nprediction challenging. Despite its sensitivity to initial perturbations, many\nchaotic systems observe dissipative behaviors and ergodicity. Therefore,\nrecently various approaches have been proposed to develop data-driven models\npreserving invariant statistics over long horizons. Although these methods have\nshown empirical success in reducing instances of unbounded trajectory\ngeneration, many of the models are still prone to generating unbounded\ntrajectories, leading to invalid statistics evaluation. In this paper, we\npropose a novel neural network architecture that simultaneously learns a\ndissipative dynamics emulator that guarantees to generate bounded trajectories\nand an energy-like function that governs the dissipative behavior. More\nspecifically, by leveraging control-theoretic ideas, we derive algebraic\nconditions based on the learned energy-like function that ensure asymptotic\nconvergence to an invariant level set. Using these algebraic conditions, our\nproposed model enforces dissipativity through a ReLU projection layer, which\nprovides formal trajectory boundedness guarantees. Furthermore, the invariant\nlevel set provides an outer estimate for the strange attractor, which is known\nto be very difficult to characterize due to its complex geometry. We\ndemonstrate the capability of our model in producing bounded long-horizon\ntrajectory forecasts and characterizing the attractor for chaotic dynamical\nsystems including Lorenz 96 and a truncated Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.",

This is particularly relevant for\napplications where the number of predictors is (much) larger than the number of\nobservations and the underlying structure -- whether sparse or dense -- is\nunknown. We achieve this by using ridge-type estimates for variable screening\nand random projection to incorporate information about the response-predictor\nrelationship when performing dimensionality reduction. We demonstrate that a\nridge estimator with a small penalty is effective for random projection and\nscreening, but the penalty value must be carefully selected. Unlike in linear\nregression, where penalties approaching zero work well, this approach leads to\noverfitting in non-Gaussian families. Instead, we recommend a data-driven\nmethod for penalty selection. This data-driven random projection improves\nprediction performance over conventional random projections, even surpassing\nbenchmarks like elastic net. Furthermore, an ensemble of multiple such random\nprojections combined with probabilistic variable screening delivers the best\naggregated results in prediction and variable ranking across varying sparsity\nlevels in simulations at a rather low computational cost.

As a\npurely observational science, astrophysics has much to gain by exploiting these\nnew methods. The supermassive black hole (SMBH)--galaxy interaction has long\nbeen constrained by observed scaling relations, that is low-scatter\ncorrelations between variables such as SMBH mass and the central velocity\ndispersion of stars in a host galaxy's bulge. This study, using advanced causal\ndiscovery techniques and an up-to-date dataset, reveals a causal link between\ngalaxy properties and dynamically-measured SMBH masses. We apply a score-based\nBayesian framework to compute the exact conditional probabilities of every\ncausal structure that could possibly describe our galaxy sample. With the exact\nposterior distribution, we determine the most likely causal structures and\nnotice a probable causal reversal when separating galaxies by morphology. In\nelliptical galaxies, bulge properties (built from major mergers) tend to\ninfluence SMBH growth, while in spiral galaxies, SMBHs are seen to affect host\ngalaxy properties, potentially through feedback in gas-rich environments. For\nspiral galaxies, SMBHs progressively quench star formation, whereas in\nelliptical galaxies, quenching is complete, and the causal connection has\nreversed.

We then\ncompare characteristic mass assembly look-back times. The distributions of mass\nassembly look-back times in ST-SFH galaxies are statistically different for\nsinglets and groups. These differences are only found in LT-SFH galaxies when\nstudying these distributions in stellar mass bins. Our results indicate that\nthe large-scale environment is related to a delay in mass assembly of up to\n$\\sim$2 Gyr, while this delay is $<$1 Gyr in the case of local environment. The\neffect of both kinds of environment is more significant in less massive\ngalaxies, and in LT-SFHs. Our results are consistent with galaxies in groups\nassembling their stellar mass earlier than singlets, especially in voids and\nlower mass galaxies. Local environment plays a relevant role in stellar mass\nassembly times, although we find that large-scale structures also cause a delay\nin mass assembly, more so in the case of cluster galaxies.",

    "abstract": "We study the generation of the baryon asymmetry in Composite Higgs models\nwith partial compositeness of the Standard Model (SM) fermions and heavy\nright-handed neutrinos, developing for the first time a complete picture of\nleptogenesis in that setup. The asymmetry is induced by the out of equilibrium\ndecays of the heavy right-handed neutrinos into a plasma of the nearly\nconformal field theory (CFT), i.e. the deconfined phase of the Composite Higgs\ndynamics. This exotic mechanism, which we call Conformal Leptogenesis, admits a\nreliable description in terms of a set of ``Boltzmann equations'' whose\ncoefficients can be expressed in terms of correlation functions of the CFT. The\nasymmetry thus generated is subsequently affected by the supercooling resulting\nfrom the confining phase transition of the strong Higgs sector as well as by\nthe washout induced by the resonances formed after the transition.\nNevertheless, a qualitative description of the latter effects suggests that\nconformal leptogenesis can successfully reproduce the observed baryon asymmetry\nin a wide region of parameter space. A distinctive signature of our scenarios\nis a sizable compositeness for all the generations of SM neutrinos, which is\ncurrently consistent with all constraints but may be within reach of future\ncolliders.",

    "abstract": "Accretion disks around both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes are\nlikely often warped. Whenever a disk is warped, its scale height varies with\nazimuth. Sufficiently strong warps cause extreme compressions of the scale\nheight, which fluid parcels \"bounce\" off of twice per orbit to high latitudes.\nIn this paper, we study the dynamics of such strong warps using two methods:\n(i) the nearly analytic \"ring theory\" of Fairbairn & Ogilvie (2021a), which we\ngeneralize to the Kerr metric; and (ii) 3D general-relativistic hydrodynamic\nsimulations of tori (\"rings\") around black holes, using the H-AMR code. We\ninitialize a ring with a warp and study the subsequent evolution on tens of\norbital periods. The simulations agree excellently with the ring theory until\nthe warp amplitude, $\\psi$, reaches a critical value $\\psi_{\\rm c}$. When\n$\\psi>\\psi_{\\rm c}$, the rings enter the bouncing regime. We analytically\nderive (and numerically validate) that $\\psi_{\\rm c}\\approx (r/r_{\\rm\ng})^{-1/2}$ in the non-Keplerian regime, where $r_{\\rm g}=GM/c^2$ is the\ngravitational radius and $M$ is the mass of the central object. Whenever the\nscale height bounces, the vertical velocity becomes supersonic, which leads to\na \"nozzle shock\" as the gas collides at the scale height minima. Nozzle shocks\ndamp the warp within $\\approx10-20$ orbits in the simulations; but, that\ndamping is not captured by the ring theory. Nozzle shock dissipation leads to\ninflow timescales that are 1-2 orders of magnitude shorter than unwarped\n$\\alpha$ disks which may result in rapid variability, such as in changing-look\nactive galactic nuclei or in the soft state of X-ray binaries. We also propose\nthat steady disks with strong enough warps may self-regulate to have amplitudes\nnear $\\psi_{\\rm c}$.",

Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals,\nwhich increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local\nHilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing\noff-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach\n(TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital\nextensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex\nstructure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier\nmulti-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a\nfully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first\ninvestigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then\nbenchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX\nresults.

Peculiar velocities,\ngravitational lensing, and other light-cone projection effects modify the\nobserved redshifts, fluxes, and sky positions of distant light sources. We\ndetermine which of these effects leave a detectable imprint on several 2-point\nclustering statistics extracted from the EWSS on large scales. We generate 140\nmock galaxy catalogues with the survey geometry and selection function of the\nEWSS and make use of the LIGER method to account for a variable number of\nrelativistic RSD to linear order in the cosmological perturbations. We estimate\ndifferent 2-point clustering statistics from the mocks and use the\nlikelihood-ratio test to calculate the statistical significance with which the\nEWSS could reject the null hypothesis that certain relativistic projection\neffects can be neglected in the theoretical models. We find that the combined\neffects of lensing magnification and convergence imprint characteristic\nsignatures on several clustering observables. Their S/N ranges between 2.5 and\n6 (depending on the adopted summary statistic) for the highest-redshift\ngalaxies in the EWSS. The corresponding feature due to the peculiar velocity of\nthe Sun is measured with a S/N of order one or two. The $P_{\\ell}(k)$ from the\ncatalogues that include all relativistic effects reject the null hypothesis\nthat RSD are only generated by the variation of the peculiar velocity along the\nline of sight with a significance of 2.9 standard deviations. As a byproduct of\nour study, we demonstrate that the mixing-matrix formalism to model\nfinite-volume effects in the $P_{\\ell}(k)$ can be robustly applied to surveys\nmade of several disconnected patches. Our results indicate that relativistic\nRSD, the contribution from weak gravitational lensing in particular, cannot be\ndisregarded when modelling 2-point clustering statistics extracted from the\nEWSS.",

    "abstract": "Modern cosmological surveys probe the Universe deep into the nonlinear\nregime, where massive neutrinos suppress cosmic structure. Traditional\ncosmological analyses, which use the 2-point correlation function to extract\ninformation, are no longer optimal in the nonlinear regime, and there is thus\nmuch interest in extracting beyond-2-point information to improve constraints\non neutrino mass. Quantifying and interpreting the beyond-2-point information\nis thus a pressing task. We study the field-level information in weak lensing\nconvergence maps using convolution neural networks. We find that the network\nperformance increases as higher source redshifts and smaller scales are\nconsidered -- investigating up to a source redshift of 2.5 and $\\ell_{\\rm\nmax}\\simeq10^4$ -- verifying that massive neutrinos leave a distinct effect on\nweak lensing. However, the performance of the network significantly drops after\nscaling out the 2-point information from the maps, implying that most of the\nfield-level information can be found in the 2-point correlation function alone.\nWe quantify these findings in terms of the likelihood ratio and also use\nIntegrated Gradient saliency maps to interpret which parts of the map the\nnetwork is learning the most from. We find that, in the absence of noise, the\nnetwork extracts a similar amount of information from the most overdense and\nunderdense regions. However, upon adding noise, the information in underdense\nregions is distorted as noise disproportionately washes out void-like\nstructures.",

Recently, there has been growing interest\nin utilizing CGM devices in clinical studies involving healthy and diabetes\npopulations. However, efficiently exploiting the high temporal resolution of\nCGM profiles remains a significant challenge. Numerous indices -- such as\ntime-in-range metrics and glucose variability measures -- have been proposed,\nbut evidence suggests these metrics overlook critical aspects of glucose\ndynamic homeostasis.

While recent advances in\npre-trained models provide a solid foundation for DIL, learning new concepts\noften results in the catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge.\nSpecifically, sequential model updates can overwrite both the representation\nand the classifier with knowledge from the latest domain. Thus, it is crucial\nto develop a representation and corresponding classifier that accommodate all\nseen domains throughout the learning process. To this end, we propose DUal\nConsolidaTion (Duct) to unify and consolidate historical knowledge at both the\nrepresentation and classifier levels. By merging the backbone of different\nstages, we create a representation space suitable for multiple domains\nincrementally. The merged representation serves as a balanced intermediary that\ncaptures task-specific features from all seen domains. Additionally, to address\nthe mismatch between consolidated embeddings and the classifier, we introduce\nan extra classifier consolidation process. Leveraging class-wise semantic\ninformation, we estimate the classifier weights of old domains within the\nlatest embedding space. By merging historical and estimated classifiers, we\nalign them with the consolidated embedding space, facilitating incremental\nclassification.

We consider both the mixed case of a\ntensor with $D$ inputs and $D$ outputs, and the case where there is a\nfactorization between the inputs and outputs, called pure, which includes the\nrandom tensor models extensively studied in the physics literature.\n  The finite size and asymptotic moments are defined using correlations of\ncertain invariant polynomials encoded by $D$-tuples of permutations, up to\nrelabeling equivalence. Finite size free cumulants associated to the\nexpectations of these invariants are defined through invertible finite size\nmoment-cumulants formulas.\n  Two important cases are considered asymptotically: pure random tensors that\nscale like a complex Gaussian, and mixed random tensors that scale like a\nWishart tensor. In both cases, we derive a notion of tensorial free cumulants\nassociated to first order invariants, through moment-cumulant formulas\ninvolving summations over non-crossing permutations. The pure and mixed cases\ninvolve the same combinatorics, but differ by the invariants that define the\ndistribution at first order. In both cases, the tensorial free-cumulants of a\nsum of two independent tensors are shown to be additive. A preliminary\ndiscussion of higher orders is provided.\n  Tensor freeness is then defined as the vanishing of mixed first order\ntensorial free cumulants. The equivalent formulation at the level of asymptotic\nmoments is derived in the pure and mixed cases, and we provide an algebraic\nconstruction of tensorial probability spaces, which generalize non-commutative\nprobability spaces: random tensors converge in distribution to elements of\nthese spaces, and tensor freeness of random variables corresponds to tensor\nfreeness of the subspaces they generate.",

In this work, we find that a floating point multiplier can be\napproximated by one integer adder with high precision. We propose the\nlinear-complexity multiplication L-Mul algorithm that approximates floating\npoint number multiplication with integer addition operations. The new algorithm\ncosts significantly less computation resource than 8-bit floating point\nmultiplication but achieves higher precision. Compared to 8-bit floating point\nmultiplications, the proposed method achieves higher precision but consumes\nsignificantly less bit-level computation. Since multiplying floating point\nnumbers requires substantially higher energy compared to integer addition\noperations, applying the L-Mul operation in tensor processing hardware can\npotentially reduce 95% energy cost by element-wise floating point tensor\nmultiplications and 80% energy cost of dot products. We calculated the\ntheoretical error expectation of L-Mul, and evaluated the algorithm on a wide\nrange of textual, visual, and symbolic tasks, including natural language\nunderstanding, structural reasoning, mathematics, and commonsense question\nanswering. Our numerical analysis experiments agree with the theoretical error\nestimation, which indicates that L-Mul with 4-bit mantissa achieves comparable\nprecision as float8_e4m3 multiplications, and L-Mul with 3-bit mantissa\noutperforms float8_e5m2. Evaluation results on popular benchmarks show that\ndirectly applying L-Mul to the attention mechanism is almost lossless. We\nfurther show that replacing all floating point multiplications with 3-bit\nmantissa L-Mul in a transformer model achieves equivalent precision as using\nfloat8_e4m3 as accumulation precision in both fine-tuning and inference.",

Our approach focuses on generating high-quality\ntraining datasets for the alignment task by producing mixed-type negative\ncaptions derived from positive ones. Critically, we address the distribution\nimbalance between positive and negative captions to ensure that the alignment\nmodel does not depend solely on textual information but also considers the\nassociated images for predicting alignment accurately. By creating this\nenhanced training data, we fine-tune an existing leading visual-language model\nto boost its capability in understanding alignment.

Quantum simulation platforms, e.g., ultracold atoms in optical lattices\nor tweezer arrays, provide a powerful tool to investigate the interplay between\nspin and charge motion in microscopic detail. Here, in a new twist, we\ndisentangle the role of particle statistics from the physics of strong\ncorrelations by exploring the strong coupling limit of doped \\emph{bosonic}\nquantum magnets, specifically the antiferromagnetic (AFM) bosonic $t-J$ model.\nUsing large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we\nmap out the phase diagram on the 2D square lattice at finite doping. In the\nlow-doping regime, bosonic holes form partially-filled stripes, akin to those\nobserved in high-$T_c$ cuprates. As doping increases, a transition occurs to a\npartially-polarized ferromagnetic (FM) phase, driven by the motion of mobile\nbosonic charge carriers forming Nagaoka polarons. At high doping or large\n$t/J$, the system evolves into a fully-polarized ferromagnet. These findings\nshed new light on the role of particle statistics in strongly correlated\nmany-body systems, revealing connections to stripe formation and the physics of\nkinetic (i.e., Nagaoka-type) ferromagnetism.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we demonstrate how to enhance the validity of causal inference\nwith unstructured high-dimensional treatments like texts, by leveraging the\npower of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Specifically, we propose\nto use a deep generative model such as large language models (LLMs) to\nefficiently generate treatments and use their internal representation for\nsubsequent causal effect estimation. We show that the knowledge of this true\ninternal representation helps disentangle the treatment features of interest,\nsuch as specific sentiments and certain topics, from other possibly unknown\nconfounding features. Unlike existing methods, the proposed GenAI-Powered\nInference (GPI) methodology eliminates the need to learn causal representation\nfrom the data, and hence produces more accurate and efficient estimates. We\nformally establish the conditions required for the nonparametric identification\nof the average treatment effect, propose an estimation strategy that avoids the\nviolation of the overlap assumption, and derive the asymptotic properties of\nthe proposed estimator through the application of double machine learning.\nFinally, using an instrumental variables approach, we extend the proposed GPI\nmethodology to the settings in which the treatment feature is based on human\nperception. The GPI is also applicable to text reuse where an LLM is used to\nregenerate existing texts. We conduct simulation and empirical studies, using\nthe generated text data from an open-source LLM, Llama~3, to illustrate the\nadvantages of our estimator over state-of-the-art causal representation\nlearning algorithms.",

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce One-Shot Style Adaptation (OSSA), a novel unsupervised\ndomain adaptation method for object detection that utilizes a single, unlabeled\ntarget image to approximate the target domain style. Specifically, OSSA\ngenerates diverse target styles by perturbing the style statistics derived from\na single target image and then applies these styles to a labeled source dataset\nat the feature level using Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN). Extensive\nexperiments show that OSSA establishes a new state-of-the-art among one-shot\ndomain adaptation methods by a significant margin, and in some cases, even\noutperforms strong baselines that use thousands of unlabeled target images. By\napplying OSSA in various scenarios, including weather, simulated-to-real\n(sim2real), and visual-to-thermal adaptations, our study explores the\noverarching significance of the style gap in these contexts.

However, these\napproaches are often constrained by a small and fixed number of input views,\nlimiting their ability to capture diverse viewpoints and, even worse, leading\nto suboptimal generation results if the synthesized views are of poor quality.\nTo address these limitations, we propose Flex3D, a novel two-stage framework\ncapable of leveraging an arbitrary number of high-quality input views. The\nfirst stage consists of a candidate view generation and curation pipeline. We\nemploy a fine-tuned multi-view image diffusion model and a video diffusion\nmodel to generate a pool of candidate views, enabling a rich representation of\nthe target 3D object. Subsequently, a view selection pipeline filters these\nviews based on quality and consistency, ensuring that only the high-quality and\nreliable views are used for reconstruction. In the second stage, the curated\nviews are fed into a Flexible Reconstruction Model (FlexRM), built upon a\ntransformer architecture that can effectively process an arbitrary number of\ninputs. FlemRM directly outputs 3D Gaussian points leveraging a tri-plane\nrepresentation, enabling efficient and detailed 3D generation.

    "abstract": "An exciting recent development for deep-tissue imaging with cellular\nresolution is three-photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM) with excitation at\nlong wavelengths (1300 and 1700 nm). In the last few years, long-wavelength 3PM\nhas driven rapid progress in deep-tissue imaging beyond the depth limit of\ntwo-photon microscopy, with impacts in neuroscience, immunology, and cancer\nbiology. However, wide adoption of 3PM faces challenges. Three-photon\nexcitation (3PE) is naturally weaker than two-photon excitation, which places a\npremium on ultrashort pulses with high peak power. The inefficiency,\ncomplexity, and cost of current sources of these pulses present major barriers\nto the use of 3PM in typical biomedical research labs. Here, we describe a\nfiber-based source of femtosecond pulses with multi-megawatt peak power,\ntunable from 850 nm to 1700 nm. Compressed pulses from a fiber amplifier at\n1030~nm are launched into an antiresonant hollow-core fiber filled with argon.\nBy varying only the gas pressure, pulses with hundreds of nanojoules of energy\nand sub-100 fs duration are obtained at wavelengths between 850 and 1700 nm.\nThis approach is a new route to an efficient, robust, and potentially low-cost\nsource for multiphoton deep-tissue imaging. In particular, 960-nJ and 50-fs\npulses are generated at 1300 nm with a conversion efficiency of 10\\%. The\nnearly 20-MW peak power is an order of magnitude higher than the previous best\nfrom femtosecond fiber source at 1300~nm. As an example of the capabilities of\nthe source, these pulses are used to image structure and neuronal activity in\nmouse brain as deep as 1.1 mm below the dura.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLI) is an important technique for studying\ncellular environments and molecular interactions, but its real-time application\nis limited by slow data acquisition, which requires capturing large\ntime-resolved images and complex post-processing using iterative fitting\nalgorithms. Deep learning (DL) models enable real-time inference, but can be\ncomputationally demanding due to complex architectures and large matrix\noperations. This makes DL models ill-suited for direct implementation on\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based camera hardware. Model compression\nis thus crucial for practical deployment for real-time inference generation. In\nthis work, we focus on compressing recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are\nwell-suited for FLI time-series data processing, to enable deployment on\nresource-constrained FPGA boards. We perform an empirical evaluation of various\ncompression techniques, including weight reduction, knowledge distillation\n(KD), post-training quantization (PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT),\nto reduce model size and computational load while preserving inference\naccuracy. Our compressed RNN model, Seq2SeqLite, achieves a balance between\ncomputational efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly at 8-bit\nprecision. By applying KD, the model parameter size was reduced by 98\\% while\nretaining performance, making it suitable for concurrent real-time FLI analysis\non FPGA during data capture.

More specifically, a focus\nis made on scenarios in which the receiver simultaneously receives radar echoes\nfrom the environment, and communication signals from other joint radar and\ncommunication transceivers. First, the phase-coded frequency modulated\ncontinuous wave waveform designed for integrated sensing and communication is\npresented. Then, simple structures in which interference cancellation is only\napplied at the radar or communication function are proposed, relying on the\ninformation gathered at the other function. The detection probability and bit\nerror rate improvements are analysed numerically w.r.t. different system\nparameters, such as the communication constellation, or the number of\ntransmitted pulses. The introduction of error correcting codes is also\nconsidered. Next, iterative interference cancellation structures are\ninvestigated. Thanks to multiple interference cancellation layers, both the\nradar and communication performance are improved, and the robustness of the\nsystem to any scenario is enhanced. This is shown numerically through the\nanalysis of the performance achieved by simple and iterative structures, which\nare compared for different radar echo to communication signal power ratio.\nFinally, a dynamic automotive scenario is considered. Leveraging on previous\nradar measurements, the parameters of the radar echo are inferred, and it is\nreconstructed beforehand, enabling to remove the first radar processing block.\nThe complexity of the iterative structures is thus reduced, at the price of a\nslight performance reduction. A dynamic automotive scenario is considered,\nhighlighting the impact of the tracking of the next vehicle ahead on the\nsystem.",

We provide two surprisingly simple constructions, and our perfect\nsamplers run in polynomial time both in expectation and with high probability.\n  An overwhelming amount of efficient approximate sampling algorithms are based\non Markov chains.

Additionally, new light states can present a rich\nphenomenology and are attracting increasing attention due to recent\nexperimental capabilities to probe dark sectors with feeble interactions.

Our approach uses a\nTransformer-based subgraph encoding module only; we introduce connection-biased\nattention and entity role embeddings into the subgraph encoding module to\neliminate the need for an expensive and time-consuming path encoding module.\nEvaluations on standard inductive KG completion benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our \\textbf{C}onnection-\\textbf{B}iased \\textbf{Li}nk \\textbf{P}rediction\n(CBLiP) model has superior performance to models that do not use path\ninformation. Compared to models that utilize path information, CBLiP shows\ncompetitive or superior performance while being faster. Additionally, to show\nthat the effectiveness of connection-biased attention and entity role\nembeddings also holds in the transductive setting, we compare CBLiP's\nperformance on the relation prediction task in the transductive setting.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the applications of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph\nConvolutional Networks (GCNs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in\nblockchain technology. As the complexity and adoption of blockchain networks\ncontinue to grow, traditional analytical methods are proving inadequate in\ncapturing the intricate relationships and dynamic behaviors of decentralized\nsystems. To address these limitations, deep learning models such as GNNs, GCNs,\nand CNNs offer robust solutions by leveraging the unique graph-based and\ntemporal structures inherent in blockchain architectures. GNNs and GCNs, in\nparticular, excel in modeling the relational data of blockchain nodes and\ntransactions, making them ideal for applications such as fraud detection,\ntransaction verification, and smart contract analysis. Meanwhile, CNNs can be\nadapted to analyze blockchain data when represented as structured matrices,\nrevealing hidden temporal and spatial patterns in transaction flows. This paper\nexplores how these models enhance the efficiency, security, and scalability of\nboth linear blockchains and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based systems,\nproviding a comprehensive overview of their strengths and future research\ndirections. By integrating advanced neural network techniques, we aim to\ndemonstrate the potential of these models in revolutionizing blockchain\nanalytics, paving the way for more sophisticated decentralized applications and\nimproved network performance.",

Existing methods, such as Masked Autoencoders (MAE) or\nautoregressive (AR) pretraining, primarily focus on single-type network\narchitectures. In contrast, pretraining strategies for hybrid architectures\nmust be effective for both Mamba and Transformer components. Based on this, we\npropose Masked Autoregressive Pretraining (MAP) to pretrain a hybrid\nMamba-Transformer vision backbone network. This strategy combines the strengths\nof both MAE and Autoregressive pretraining, improving the performance of Mamba\nand Transformer modules within a unified paradigm. Experimental results show\nthat the hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network pretrained with MAP\nsignificantly outperforms other pretraining strategies, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance.

This sorting\nyields a variant of Timber that supports an early stopping criterion, designed\nto make poisoning attacks more efficient and feasible on larger datasets. We\nalso discuss an extension of Timber to traditional random forest models, which\nis valuable since decision trees are typically combined into ensembles to\nimprove their predictive power. Our experimental evaluation on public datasets\ndemonstrates that our attacks outperform existing baselines in terms of\neffectiveness, efficiency, or both. Moreover, we show that two representative\ndefenses can mitigate the effect of our attacks, but fail to effectively thwart\nthem.",

Results from head-on impacts are often\nthen extended to study oblique impacts with angle corrections or used as\ninitial conditions for other calculations, for example, the evolution of\nejected debris. In this study, we conduct a detailed investigation of the\nthermodynamic and energy budget evolution of high-energy head-on giant impacts,\nentering the catastrophic impacts regime, for target masses between 0.001 and\n12 M$_{\\oplus}$. We demonstrate the complex interplay of gravitational forces,\nshock dynamics, and thermodynamic processing in head-on impacts at high energy.\nOur study illustrates that frequent interactions of core material with the\nliquid side of the vapour curve could have cumulative effects on the\npost-collision remnants, leading to fragmentary disintegration occurring at\nlower impact energy. This results in the mass of the largest remnant diverging\nsignificantly from previously developed scaling laws. These findings suggest\ntwo key considerations: 1) head-on planetary collisions for different target\nmasses do not behave similarly, so caution is needed when applying scaling laws\nacross a broad parameter space; 2) an accurate model of the liquid-vapour phase\nboundary is essential for modeling giant impacts.

Film thicknesses\nranging from submonolayer to multilayer regimes are analyzed using UV (UPS) and\nX ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For the monolayer regime, there is\nstrong indication of face on orientation, with both of the molecules sulfur\natoms bonding to the metal surfaces. Here, on Ag and Au(100) the sulfur atoms\nlose some or all of their intrinsic charges due to a charge transfer with the\nsubstrate, while on Cu(100) a strong metal sulfur bond forms. The interaction\nbetween the substrate and the molecules can also be seen in the intensity and\nwidth of the highest occupied molecular orbital features in UPS. Upon\nmultilayer deposition, a gradual lowering in ionization energy is observed,\nlikely due to the formation of antiparallel dimers followed by an increased\ncharge carrier delocalization due to the formation of an extended molecular\naggregate for thicker layers. Interestingly, on Cu(100) the aggregated phase is\nalready observed for much lower deposition, showing the importance of\nsubstrate-molecule interaction on the subsequent film growth.

Low framerates at low bitrates reduce compression\nartifacts and decrease decoding energy. We propose a novel method,\nDecoding-complexity aware Framerate Prediction (DECODRA), which employs a\nVariable Framerate Pareto-front approach to predict an optimized framerate that\nminimizes decoding energy under quality degradation constraints. DECODRA\ndynamically adjusts the framerate based on current bitrate and spatial\nresolution, balancing trade-offs between framerate, perceptual quality, and\ndecoding complexity. Extensive experimentation with the Inter-4K dataset\ndemonstrates DECODRA's effectiveness, yielding an average decoding energy\nreduction of up to 13.45%, with minimal VMAF reduction of 0.33 points at a\nlow-quality degradation threshold, compared to the default 60 fps encoding.\nEven at an aggressive threshold, DECODRA achieves significant energy savings of\n13.45% while only reducing VMAF by 2.11 points. In this way, DECODRA extends\nmobile device battery life and reduces the energy footprint of streaming\nservices by providing a more energy-efficient video streaming pipeline.",

In this paper, we explore two interesting research questions regarding\nthe PGM-Index: (a) \\emph{Why are PGM-Indexes theoretically effective?} and (b)\n\\emph{Why do PGM-Indexes underperform in practice?} For question~(a), we first\nprove that, for a set of $N$ sorted keys, the PGM-Index can, with high\nprobability, achieve a lookup time of $O(\\log\\log N)$ while using $O(N)$ space.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the \\textbf{tightest bound} for learned\nindexes to date.

However,\nthe utilization of cutting-edge OAOTs produced through surface nanopatterning\ntechniques has set the upper limit for coherent SAW frequencies below 100 GHz,\nconstrained by factors such as the quality and pitch of the surface\nnanopattern, not to mention the electronic bandwidth limitations of the IDTs.\nIn this context, unconventional optically-controlled nano-transducers based on\ncleaved superlattices (SLs) are here presented as an alternative solution. To\ndemonstrate their viability, we conducted proof-of-concept experiments using\nultrafast lasers in a pump-probe configuration on SLs made of alternating\nAlxGa1-xAs and AlyGa1-yAs layers with approximately 70 nm periodicity and\ncleaved along their growth direction to produce a periodic nanostructured\nsurface.

The\nnew FEX based method, denoted FEX-PG to indicate the addition of the parameter\ngrouping (PG) step to the algorithm, provides both high accuracy and\ninterpretable numerical solutions, with the outcome being an explicit equation\nthat facilitates intuitive understanding of the underlying solution structures.\nThese features are often absent in traditional methods, such as finite element\nmethods (FEM) and finite difference methods, as well as in deep learning-based\napproaches.

An analysis of MAVEN data, combined with\nobservation-based simulations, reveals that the bulk of O+ ions would be in\nresonance with ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves when the latter were present.\nThis interaction then results in significant particle energization, thus\nenhancing ion escaping.

To address\nthis shortcoming, recent advancements in mixture of expert (MoE) models,\nspeculative decoding, and early exit strategies leverage the insight that\ncomputational demands can vary significantly based on the complexity and nature\nof the input. However, identifying optimal routing patterns for dynamic\nexecution remains an open challenge, limiting the full potential of these\nadaptive methods. To address this need, we study adaptive computation in LLMs\nmore systematically. We propose a novel framework that integrates smaller\nauxiliary modules within each Feed-Forward Network layer of the LLM. This\ndesign enables dynamic routing of tokens based on task complexity: tokens can\nbe processed by either the small or big modules at each layer, or even bypass\ncertain layers entirely. This allows us to introduce a novel notion of a\ntoken's difficulty, defined by its potential to benefit from additional\ncomputational resources. Importantly, by employing oracles to identify optimal\npatterns of adaptive computations, we gain valuable insights into the internal\nworkings of LLMs and the routing processes in a simplified heterogeneous MoE\nsetup. We show that trained routers operate differently from oracles and often\nyield suboptimal solutions. Notably, activating a large module in just one\nlayer outperforms models that use large modules across all layers, underscoring\nthe gap between practical implementations of routing in MoE models and\ntheoretical optima for adaptive computation.",

One of\nthe simplest and theoretically well-motivated plausible candidates to explain\nthe observed behavior of $w(z)$, is scalar-field quintessence. Here, we\nconsider a class of models known as $\\alpha$-attractor, which describe in a\nsingle framework both inflation and the late-time acceleration of the Universe.\nUsing the recent DESI data, in conjunction with other cosmological\nobservations, we place stringent constraints on $\\alpha$-attractor models and\ncompare them to the $\\Lambda$CDM model.

We also highlight an interesting connection between\nthe $\\alpha$-attractor models and the stochastic gravitational wave background,\nwhere a contribution to the latter could derive from an enhancement of\ninflationary gravitational waves at high frequencies due to an early kination\nphase, thus providing an interesting alternative way to constrain the theory.",

At low thickness values, insufficient substrate\ncoverage gives rise to chemical patchiness; at large thickness values, two\nfeatures appear: 1) a waviness forms on the surface of the liquid layer due to\na previously overlooked lateral microphase separation occurring in polydisperse\nbrushes, and 2) layer deformation due to the contact line is larger than in\nthinner layers. The most pronounced slippery behaviour occurs for smooth PDMS\nlayers that do not exhibit nanoscale waviness.

Using this approach we\nestablish an equation of local helicity balance, which gives a rigorous\nfoundation to the concept of local helicity density and flux at low regularity.\nWe provide a sufficient criterion for helicity conservation which is weaker\nthan many of the existing sufficient criteria for helicity conservation in the\nliterature.\n  Subsequently, we prove a sufficient condition for the helicity to be\nconserved in the zero viscosity limit of the Navier-Stokes equations.

    "abstract": "X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveal relativistic\nreflections from the innermost regions of accretion disks, which contain\ngeneral-relativistic footprints caused by spinning supermassive black holes\n(SMBH). We anticipate the spin of a SMBH to be stable over the human timeframe,\nso brightness changes in the high-energy corona above the SMBH should slightly\nalter relativistic reflection. In this brief review, we discuss the latest\ndevelopments in modeling relativistic reflection, as well as the rapid small\nvariation in relativistic emission disclosed by the principal component\nanalysis (PCA) of X-ray variability in AGN. PCA studies of X-ray spectra from\nAGNs have shown that relativistically blurred reflection has negligible\nfluctuations over the course of observations, which could originate from rapid\n(intrahour) intrinsic variations in near-horizon accretion flows and photon\nrings. The PCA technique is an effective way to disclose relativistic\nreflection from X-ray observations of AGNs, simplifying the complexity of\nlargely variable X-ray data for automated spectral analysis with machine\nlearning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of medical technology has led to an exponential\nincrease in multi-modal medical data, including imaging, genomics, and\nelectronic health records (EHRs). Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely\nused to represent this data due to their prominent performance in capturing\npairwise relationships. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of\nmulti-modal medical data still pose significant challenges for standard GNNs,\nwhich struggle with learning higher-order, non-pairwise relationships. This\npaper proposes GAMMA-PD (Graph-based Analysis of Multi-modal Motor Impairment\nAssessments in Parkinson's Disease), a novel heterogeneous hypergraph fusion\nframework for multi-modal clinical data analysis. GAMMA-PD integrates imaging\nand non-imaging data into a \"hypernetwork\" (patient population graph) by\npreserving higher-order information and similarity between patient profiles and\nsymptom subtypes. We also design a feature-based attention-weighted mechanism\nto interpret feature-level contributions towards downstream decision tasks. We\nevaluate our approach with clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression\nMarkers Initiative (PPMI) and a private dataset. We demonstrate gains in\npredicting motor impairment symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Our end-to-end\nframework also learns associations between subsets of patient characteristics\nto generate clinically relevant explanations for disease and symptom profiles.\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/favour-nerrise/GAMMA-PD.",

Although this region is defined by techniques\nunrelated to the physics of recombination and the sound horizon then, the\nstandard $Planck$ fit to the CMB anisotropies falls precisely in this region.\nThis concordance argues against early-time explanations for the anomalously\nhigh local estimate of $H_0$ (the 'Hubble tension'), which can only be\nreconciled with the age constraint at an implausibly low $\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}$.\nWe suggest instead that outflow from the local KBC supervoid (Keenan, Barger, &\nCowie 2013) inflates redshifts in the nearby universe and thus the apparent\nlocal $H_0$.

    "abstract": "We propose a novel method to reconstruct the full posterior distribution of\nthe star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies from broad-band photometry. Our\nmethod combines simulation-based inference (SBI) using a neural network trained\nwith SFHs and photometry from the {\\sc Horizon-AGN} hydrodynamical cosmological\nsimulation. We apply it to reconstruct SFHs using COSMOS2020 photometry at\nredshift $0<z<3$. We are able to accurately estimate the SFH and quantify the\nuncertainty on simulated data, with an unbiased posterior mean and well\ncalibrated credible intervals. Our SFHs are in broad agreement with independent\nliterature measurements The SFHs of galaxies as a function of location in the\n$\\mathrm{NUV}-r$ versus $r-J$ diagram are in agreement with expectations. We\nextract summary statistics to quantify the shape of the SFH, number of peaks,\nand formation redshift. The slopes of the SFHs of passive galaxies show only a\nweak trend with stellar mass at $z<1.35$ but a significant scatter, indicating\nthat other factors than mass could drive the suppression of star-formation.\nNevertheless, star-forming galaxies show a clear mass-dependent SFH, with\nlower-mass galaxies undergoing more vigorous recent star-formation. Low-mass\ngalaxies have more peaks in their mass assembly histories than high-mass ones.\nAt a given mass, we find many different formation redshifts, but for passive\ngalaxies the mass dependency of formation redshifts is weak. Most passive\ngalaxies with stellar mass $\\log M_*/M_\\odot > 9$ had a first event of mass\nassembly around $z\\sim 3$, independent of mass. This work represents a pilot\nstudy for the future analysis of the \\textit{Euclid} Deep fields that will\nreach similar depths in alike set of photometric bands, but with over an\norder-of-magnitude larger area, opening the possibility of deriving SFHs for\nmillions of galaxies in a robust manner.",

Here, we investigate how this rapid expansion affects the\ncirculation and exploitation of scientific ideas. Unlike other cultural\ndomains, science is experiencing a decline in the proportion of highly\ninfluential papers and a slower turnover in its canons. This results in the\ndisproportionate persistence of established works, a phenomenon we term the\n``gerontocratization of science''. To test whether hypergrowth drives this\ntrend, we develop a generative citation model that incorporates random\ndiscovery, cumulative advantage, and exponential growth of the scientific\nliterature. Our findings reveal that as scientific output expands\nexponentially, gerontocratization emerges and intensifies, reducing the\ninfluence of new research. Recognizing and understanding this mechanism is\ncrucial for developing targeted strategies to sustain intellectual dynamism and\nensure a balanced and healthy renewal of scientific knowledge.",

In particular, the challenge is derived from a mixed\nstrategy obtained by solving a zero-sum game against the intruder, which in\nturn decides its own positions. In addition, we derive the optimal strategy for\nmulti-round authentication, where the CR-PLA procedure is iterated over several\nrounds. We also consider the energy minimization problem, where legitimate\nusers want to minimize the energy consumption without compromising the security\nperformance of the protocol.

Here, we propose a new statistical framework to\nanalyze rate fluctuations and discern whether neurons employ multiplexing as a\nmeans of encoding multiple stimuli. We adopt a mechanistic approach to modeling\nmultiplexing by constructing a non-Markovian endogenous state-space model.\nSpecifically, we posit that multiplexing arises from competition between the\nstimuli, which are modeled as latent drift-diffusion processes. We propose a\nnew MCMC algorithm for conducting posterior inference on similar types of\nstate-space models, where typical state-space MCMC methods fail due to strong\ndependence between the parameters.

    "abstract": "The remarkable ecological success of humans is often attributed to our\nability to develop complex cultural artefacts that enable us to cope with\nenvironmental challenges. The evolution of complex culture (cumulative cultural\nevolution) is usually modelled as a collective process in which individuals\ninvent new artefacts (innovation) and copy information from others (social\nlearning). This classic picture overlooks the growing role of intelligent\nalgorithms in the digital age (e.g. search engines, recommender systems and\nlarge language models) in mediating information between humans, with potential\nconsequences for cumulative cultural evolution. Building on a previous model,\nwe investigate the combined effects of network-based social learning and a\nsimplistic version of algorithmic mediation on cultural accumulation. We find\nthat algorithmic mediation significantly impacts cultural accumulation and that\nthis impact grows as social networks become less densely connected. Cultural\naccumulation is most effective when social learning and algorithmic mediation\nare combined, and the optimal ratio depends on the network's density. This work\nis an initial step towards formalizing the impact of intelligent algorithms on\ncumulative cultural evolution within an established framework. Models like ours\nprovide insights into mechanisms of human-machine interaction in cultural\ncontexts, guiding hypotheses for future experimental testing.",

The self-attention mechanism and\ntokens employed in ViT, besides the local-to-global learning approach used in\nthe hybrid model, enable the proposed algorithm to extract a high-dimensional\nand high-quality feature space from images.

In our algorithm, for the first time among all self-supervised\nlearning and knowledge distillation models, the test dataset is 50% larger than\nthe training dataset.

This is because the uncertainty\nproduces unexpected observations that cannot be covered by manual scripting.\nLearning based robot controlling methods are a promising approach for\ngenerating flexible motions against unknown situations, but still tend to\nsuffer under uncertainty due to its deterministic nature. In order to\nadaptively perform the target task under such conditions, the robot control\nmodel must be able to accurately understand the possible uncertainty, and to\nexploratively derive the optimal action that minimizes such uncertainty. This\npaper extended an existing predictive learning based robot control method,\nwhich employ foresight prediction using dynamic internal simulation. The\nforesight module refines the model's hidden states by sampling multiple\npossible futures and replace with the one that led to the lower future\nuncertainty. The adaptiveness of the model was evaluated on a door opening\ntask. The door can be opened either by pushing, pulling, or sliding, but robot\ncannot visually distinguish which way, and is required to adapt on the fly. The\nresults showed that the proposed model adaptively diverged its motion through\ninteraction with the door, whereas conventional methods failed to stably\ndiverge. The models were analyzed on Lyapunov exponents of RNN hidden states\nwhich reflect the possible divergence at each time step during task execution.\nThe result indicated that the foresight module biased the model to consider\nfuture consequences, which lead to embedding uncertainties at the policy of the\nrobot controller, rather than the resultant observation.

Traditional numerical models, while accurate,\nare computationally expensive, limiting their practicality for real-time\npredictions. Recently, deep learning techniques have been developed for\nefficient simulation of time-dependent storm surge. To resolve the small scales\nof storm surge in both time and space over a long duration and a large area,\nthese simulations typically need to employ oversized neural networks that\nstruggle with the accumulation of prediction errors over successive time steps.\nTo address these challenges, this study introduces a hierarchical deep neural\nnetwork (HDNN) combined with a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to accurately\nand efficiently predict storm surge time series. The CAE reduces the\ndimensionality of storm surge data, streamlining the learning process. HDNNs\nthen map storm parameters to the low-dimensional representation of storm surge,\nallowing for sequential predictions across different time scales. Specifically,\nthe current-level neural network is utilized to predict future states with a\nrelatively large time step, which are passed as inputs to the next-level neural\nnetwork for smaller time-step predictions. This process continues sequentially\nfor all time steps. The results from different-level neural networks across\nvarious time steps are then stacked to acquire the entire time series of storm\nsurge. The simulated low-dimensional representations are finally decoded back\ninto storm surge time series. The proposed model was trained and tested using\nsynthetic data from the North Atlantic Comprehensive Coastal Study. Results\ndemonstrate its excellent performance to effectively handle high-dimensional\nsurge data while mitigating the accumulation of prediction errors over time,\nmaking it a promising tool for advancing storm surge prediction.",

To achieve these, we propose\n(1) adopting Mamba, a class of sequence modeling distinguished by linear-time\ndecoding, which is augmented by cross-attention mechanisms for conditioning,\n(2) utilizing rotary positional embeddings in the computation of\ncross-attention, enabling the model to process an infinite text stream by\nsliding a window, and (3) decoding with semantic guidance, a technique that\naligns speech with the transcript during inference with minimal overhead.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our models are competitive with\nstate-of-the-art language model-based zero-shot TTS models, while also\nproviding flexibility to support a wide range of streaming scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Medical imaging has kept up with the digital age. Medical images such as\nx-rays are no longer keep on film or; even made with film. Rather, they are\ndigital. In addition, they are transmitted for reasons of consultation and\ntelehealth as well as archived. Transmission and retrieval of these images\npresents an integrity issue, with a high level of integrity being needed. Very\nsmall artifacts in a digital medical image can have significant importance,\nmaking or changing a diagnosis. It is imperative that the integrity of a\nmedical image, especially in a Region of Interest be identifiable and\npreserved. Watermarking and steganography are used for the purposes of\nauthenticating images, especially for copyright purposes. These techniques can\nbe applied to medical images. However, these techniques can interfere with the\nintegrity of the picture. While such distortion may be acceptable in other\ndomains, in the medical domain this distortion is not acceptable. High accuracy\nis imperative for diagnosis. This paper discusses the techniques used, their\nadvantages and shortcomings as well as methods of overcoming obstacles to\nintegrity.",

Our results indicate that the DJ16A$^\\dagger$\ninteraction provides the most accurate $b$-parameter predictions between the\ntwo DJ16A-based interactions. Additionally, we explored mirror energy\ndifferences (MEDs) in low-energy spectra around $A = 20$ and demonstrated that\nlarge MEDs are primarily associated with high occupancies of the $1s_{1/2}$\norbital. Furthermore, $E2$ transition strengths were calculated using both\nDJ16A-based ISB interactions agreed with the experimental data, with minimal\nISB effects observed on these transitions. Overall, the DJ16A$^\\dagger$\ninteraction serves as a complementary set to the newly developed USD-family\ninteractions, USDC, and USDCm and can be further tested for other mirror nuclei\nacross the $sd$-shell to study nuclear structure properties and ISB effects in\nnuclear $\\beta$-decay.",

Our results\nshow that, in spite of the this noncommutative feature, excess decay estimates\nanalogous to the Euclidean case hold.\n  To illustrate the potency of our excess decay estimates, we prove two\nresults.

A buffer layer of SrTiO3 perovskite oxide,\nprepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD), was used to improve the growth of\nthis oxide significantly. This method overcomes the ultimatum of stabilizing\nperovskite oxide growth using MBE since the valence mismatch between the\nsubstrate and the films were effectively masked by the ultra-thin SrTiO3 and\nfurther supported interfacial charge transfer.

Central to these problems is the dose influence matrix\nwhich quantifies the radiation dose delivered from each beamlet to each voxel.\nOur findings demonstrate that this matrix is highly compressible, enabling a\ncompact representation of the optimization problems and allowing them to be\nsolved more efficiently and accurately. Methods: We precompute the primary (S)\nand scattering (L) dose contributions of the dose influence matrix A separately\nfor photon therapy, expressed as: A = S + L. Our analysis reveals that the\nsingular values of the scattering matrix L exhibit exponential decay,\nindicating that L is a low-rank matrix. This allows us to compress L into two\nsmaller matrices: L=HW, where r is relatively small (approximately 5 to 10).\nSince the primary dose matrix S is sparse, this supports the use of the\nwell-established \"sparse-plus-low-rank\" decomposition technique for the\ninfluence matrix A, approximated as: A = S + H * W. We introduce an efficient\nalgorithm for sparse-plus-low-rank matrix decomposition, even without direct\naccess to the scattering matrix. This algorithm is applied to optimize\ntreatment plans for ten lung and ten prostate patients, using both compressed\nand sparsified versions of matrix A. We then evaluate the dose discrepancy\nbetween the optimized and final plans. We also integrate this compression\ntechnique with our in-house automated planning system, ECHO, and evaluate the\ndosimetric quality of the generated plans with and without compression.",

However, errors may result when the spatial variation of the fields\nis not well-described by the conventionally used spherical harmonics model that\nhas the maximum order constrained by the number of probes. The objective of\nthis work was to develop and validate a field monitoring approach that\ncompresses higher order spherical harmonic basis functions into a smaller set\nof new basis functions that can be computed from fewer probes. Methods: Field\nmonitoring of acquisitions was repeated with probes in different locations.\nHigh-order field dynamics were computed from this calibration probe data\nassembled from all scans, from which compression matrices could be devised\nusing principal component analysis. Compression matrices were then utilized to\nfit field dynamics using compressed basis functions with data from 16 probes,\nwhich were then used in image reconstruction. Performance was evaluated by\nassessing the accuracy of computed field dynamics as well as in vivo image\nquality. Technique generalizability was also assessed by using various\nacquisition and diffusion encoding strategies for the calibration data.\nResults: Qualitative and quantitative improvements in accuracy were observed\nwhen using the proposed fitting method in comparison to the conventional\napproach.

    "abstract": "Robots-based smart pharmacies are essential for modern healthcare systems,\nenabling efficient drug delivery. However, a critical challenge exists in the\nrobotic handling of drugs with varying shapes and overlapping positions, which\nprevious studies have not adequately addressed. To enhance the robotic arm's\nability to grasp chaotic, overlapping, and variously shaped drugs, this paper\nproposed a novel framework combining a multi-stage grasping network with an\nadaptive robotics mechanism. The framework first preprocessed images using an\nimproved Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (SRCNN) algorithm, and\nthen employed the proposed YOLOv5+E-A-SPPFCSPC+BIFPNC (YOLO-EASB) instance\nsegmentation algorithm for precise drug segmentation. The most suitable drugs\nfor grasping can be determined by assessing the completeness of the\nsegmentation masks. Then, these segmented drugs were processed by our improved\nAdaptive Feature Fusion and Grasp-Aware Network (IAFFGA-Net) with the optimized\nloss function, which ensures accurate picking actions even in complex\nenvironments. To control the robot grasping, a time-optimal robotic arm\ntrajectory planning algorithm that combines an improved ant colony algorithm\nwith 3-5-3 interpolation was developed, further improving efficiency while\nensuring smooth trajectories. Finally, this system was implemented and\nvalidated within an adaptive collaborative robot setup, which dynamically\nadjusts to different production environments and task requirements.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of our multi-stage grasping\nnetwork in optimizing smart pharmacy operations, while also showcasing its\nremarkable adaptability and effectiveness in practical applications.",

Most of the existing benchmarks for\ncode generation LLMs focus on code authoring or code completion.

To address this gap, we create and release TestGenEval, a\nlarge-scale benchmark to measure test generation performance. Based on\nSWEBench, TestGenEval comprises 68,647 tests from 1,210 code and test file\npairs across 11 well-maintained Python repositories. It covers initial tests\nauthoring, test suite completion, and code coverage improvements. Test\nauthoring simulates the process of a developer writing a test suite from\nscratch, while test completion mimics the scenario where a developer aims to\nimprove the coverage of an existing test suite. We evaluate several popular\nmodels, with sizes ranging from 7B to 405B parameters. Our detailed analysis\nhighlights TestGenEval's contribution to a comprehensive evaluation of test\ngeneration performance. In particular, models struggle to generate\nhigh-coverage test suites, with the best model, GPT-4o, achieving an average\ncoverage of only 35.2%. This is primarily due to models struggling to reason\nabout execution, and their frequent assertion errors when addressing complex\ncode paths.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, I introduce RisingBALLER, the first publicly available\napproach that leverages a transformer model trained on football match data to\nlearn match-specific player representations. Drawing inspiration from advances\nin language modeling, RisingBALLER treats each football match as a unique\nsequence in which players serve as tokens, with their embeddings shaped by the\nspecific context of the match. Through the use of masked player prediction\n(MPP) as a pre-training task, RisingBALLER learns foundational features for\nfootball player representations, similar to how language models learn semantic\nfeatures for text representations. As a downstream task, I introduce next match\nstatistics prediction (NMSP) to showcase the effectiveness of the learned\nplayer embeddings. The NMSP model surpasses a strong baseline commonly used for\nperformance forecasting within the community. Furthermore, I conduct an\nin-depth analysis to demonstrate how the learned embeddings by RisingBALLER can\nbe used in various football analytics tasks, such as producing meaningful\npositional features that capture the essence and variety of player roles beyond\nrigid x,y coordinates, team cohesion estimation, and similar player retrieval\nfor more effective data-driven scouting. More than a simple machine learning\nmodel, RisingBALLER is a comprehensive framework designed to transform football\ndata analytics by learning high-level foundational features for players, taking\ninto account the context of each match. It offers a deeper understanding of\nfootball players beyond individual statistics.",

The properties of the neutron\nstar in the binary are investigated using NICER and NuSTAR observations during\nthe X-ray outbursts. The pulse profiles across a broad energy range, are found\nto be strongly dependent on luminosity and energy, revealing the complex nature\nof the emitting region. An absorbed power-law can describe each NICER spectrum\nin the 1-7 keV band. The 3-79 keV NuSTAR spectrum can be well-described by a\nnegative and positive power-law with an exponential cut-off model. Utilizing\nthe MAXI/GSC long-term light curve, we estimate the probable orbital period to\nbe 80 or 80/n (n=2,3,4) days. We investigate the evolution of the circumstellar\ndisc around the Be star by using optical spectroscopic observations of the\nsystem between 2022 and 2024. We observe variable H$\\alpha$ and FeII emission\nlines with an increase in equivalent width, indicating the presence of a\ndynamic circumstellar disc. A distinct variation in the V/R value for H$\\alpha$\nand FeII lines is also observed. The appearance of additional emission lines,\nsuch as HeI (5875.72 \\AA), HeI (6678 \\AA), and HeI (7065 \\AA), during the\npost-outburst observation in February 2024 suggests the growing of a larger or\ndenser circumstellar disc.

However, long-standing\nproblems in whole-brain 1H-MRSI are spectral overlap of metabolite peaks with\nlarge lipid signal from scalp, and overwhelming water signal that distorts\nspectra. Fast and effective methods are needed for high-resolution 1H-MRSI to\naccurately remove lipid and water signals while preserving the metabolite\nsignal. The potential of supervised neural networks for this task remains\nunexplored, despite their success for other MRSI processing.\n  Methods. We introduce a deep-learning method based on a modified Y-NET\nnetwork for water and lipid removal in whole-brain 1H-MRSI. The WALINET (WAter\nand LIpid neural NETwork) was compared to conventional methods such as the\nstate-of-the-art lipid L2 regularization and Hankel-Lanczos singular value\ndecomposition (HLSVD) water suppression. Methods were evaluated on simulated\nand in-vivo whole-brain MRSI using NMRSE, SNR, CRLB, and FWHM metrics.\n  Results. WALINET is significantly faster and needs 8s for high-resolution\nwhole-brain MRSI, compared to 42 minutes for conventional HLSVD+L2.\nQuantitative analysis shows WALINET has better performance than HLSVD+L2: 1)\nmore lipid removal with 41% lower NRMSE, 2) better metabolite signal\npreservation with 71% lower NRMSE in simulated data, 155% higher SNR and 50%\nlower CRLB in in-vivo data. Metabolic maps obtained by WALINET in healthy\nsubjects and patients show better gray/white-matter contrast with more visible\nstructural details.\n  Conclusions. WALINET has superior performance for nuisance signal removal and\nmetabolite quantification on whole-brain 1H-MRSI compared to conventional\nstate-of-the-art techniques. This represents a new application of deep-learning\nfor MRSI processing, with potential for automated high-throughput workflow.",

Unlike traditional BP-based methods, BDNN exhibits strong knowledge\ntransfer, supporting efficient incremental learning of new tactile information.\nIt requires no hyperparameter tuning and dynamically adapts to incoming data.\nMoreover, compared to the BP-based counterpart, it achieves classification\naccuracy on par with BP while learning over ten times faster in ideal\nconditions and up to two or three orders of magnitude faster in practical\nsettings.

Therefore, we introduce a novel mechanism that enables the\nstabilization of multimagnon bound states in quasi-one-dimensional edge-shared\ncuprates. Our theoretical framework, supported by numerical simulations and\nexperimental data, demonstrates that small antiferromagnetic interchain\ncouplings act as effective internal magnetic fields, promoting a collinear\nantiferromagnetic order and enabling magnon condensation even at zero external\nfield.

The cognitive-economic trade-off between group\nsize and rate of attention to detail is the connection between these. This\nallows humans to scale cooperative effort across groups, from teams to\ncommunities, with a trade-off between group size and attention. We show here\nthat an accurate concept of trust follows a bipartite `economy of work' model,\nand that this leads to correct predictions about the statistical distribution\nof group sizes in society. Trust is essentially a cognitive-economic issue that\ndepends on the memory cost of past behaviour and on the frequency of attentive\npolicing of intent.

A key observation is that the UV inputs (the location of the UV\nregulator, the number of species, and the cut-off in the angular Casimir\nquantum number) can all be combined into the freedom in a single real\nparameter. Remarkably, this parameter has an interpretation as the central\ncharge of a holomorphically factorized 2D CFT, and choosing it to be the\nKerr-CFT value reproduces the black hole's detailed thermodynamics from the\nstatistical mechanics of normal modes. This perspective provides a heuristic\nunderstanding for why the Kerr-CFT central charge is related to the angular\nmomentum of the black hole.

    "abstract": "The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundance of $z>10$\ngalaxies bright in the ultraviolet (UV) that has challenged traditional\ntheoretical models at high redshifts. Recently, various new models have emerged\nto address this discrepancy by refining their description of star formation.\nHere we investigate whether modifications to the stellar initial mass function\n(IMF) alone can reproduce the $z>10$ UV luminosity functions (UV LFs) when the\nstar formation rate is used as a proxy for the fraction of massive stars. We\nincorporate an Evolving IMF into the {\\sc astraeus} galaxy evolution and\nreionisation simulation framework, which becomes increasingly top-heavy as the\ngas density in a galaxy rises above a given threshold. Our implementation\naccounts for the IMF's effects on supernova (SN) feedback, metal enrichment,\nand the UV and ionising emissivities. For this Evolving IMF model, we find that\n(i) the maximum UV luminosity enhancement is twice as large in massive galaxies\n($\\Delta M_\\mathrm{UV}\\simeq2.6$) than those where star formation is strongly\nlimited by SN feedback ($\\Delta M_\\mathrm{UV}\\simeq1.3$); (ii) it successfully\nreproduces the observed UV LFs at $z=5-15$; (iii) galaxies with top-heavy IMFs\nexhibit the highest star formation rates, driven by their location in local\ndensity peaks, which facilitates higher gas accretion rates; (iv) the $1\\sigma$\nvariances in the UV luminosity are only slightly higher compared to when\nassuming a Salpeter IMF, but the $2\\sigma$ variances are significantly\nincreased by a factor of $1.4-2$ boosting the abundance of UV-bright galaxies\nat $z>10$; (v) reionisation begins earlier with more extended large ionised\nregions and fewer smaller ones during its initial stages, though these\ndifferences diminish at lower redshifts, leading to a similar end of\nreionisation at $z\\simeq5.6$.}",

In\nthis work, we propose a simple set of conditions under which a linear operator\non a CQG can be recognized as a Laplacian -- specifically, as the formal\nmodulus square of the differential associated with a bicovariant FODC. A key\nfeature of our framework is its generality: it applies to arbitrary\nfinite-dimensional bicovariant $*$-FODCs on \\( K_q \\), the \\( q \\)-deformation\nof a compact semisimple Lie group \\( K \\). To each such calculus, we associate\na Laplacian defined via the formal modulus square of its differential. Under\nmild additional assumptions, we demonstrate that these operators converge to\nclassical Laplacians on \\( K \\) in the classical limit \\( q \\to 1 \\), thereby\njustifying their interpretation as ``$q$-deformed Laplacians.\" Furthermore, we\nprove that the spectra of the $q$-deformed Laplacians are discrete, real,\nbounded from below, and diverge to infinity, much like those of their classical\ncounterparts.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in industrial anomaly detection have been hindered by the\nlack of realistic datasets that accurately represent real-world conditions.\nExisting algorithms are often developed and evaluated using idealized datasets,\nwhich deviate significantly from real-life scenarios characterized by\nenvironmental noise and data corruption such as fluctuating lighting\nconditions, variable object poses, and unstable camera positions. To address\nthis gap, we introduce the Realistic Anomaly Detection (RAD) dataset, the first\nmulti-view RGB-based anomaly detection dataset specifically collected using a\nreal robot arm, providing unique and realistic data scenarios. RAD comprises\n4765 images across 13 categories and 4 defect types, collected from more than\n50 viewpoints, providing a comprehensive and realistic benchmark. This\nmulti-viewpoint setup mirrors real-world conditions where anomalies may not be\ndetectable from every perspective. Moreover, by sampling varying numbers of\nviews, the algorithm's performance can be comprehensively evaluated across\ndifferent viewpoints. This approach enhances the thoroughness of performance\nassessment and helps improve the algorithm's robustness. Besides, to support 3D\nmulti-view reconstruction algorithms, we propose a data augmentation method to\nimprove the accuracy of pose estimation and facilitate the reconstruction of 3D\npoint clouds. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art RGB-based and point\ncloud-based models using RAD, identifying limitations and future research\ndirections.

We propose\ncontrastive abstraction learning to find abstract states, where we assume that\nsuccessive states in a trajectory belong to the same abstract state. Such\nabstract states may be basic locations, achieved subgoals, inventory, or health\nconditions. Contrastive abstraction learning first constructs clusters of state\nrepresentations by contrastive learning and then applies modern Hopfield\nnetworks to determine the abstract states. The first phase of contrastive\nabstraction learning is self-supervised learning, where contrastive learning\nforces states with sequential proximity to have similar representations. The\nsecond phase uses modern Hopfield networks to map similar state representations\nto the same fixed point, i.e.\\ to an abstract state. The level of abstraction\ncan be adjusted by determining the number of fixed points of the modern\nHopfield network.

    "abstract": "U.S. presidential elections are decided by the Electoral College, established\nin 1789, and designed to mitigate potential risks arising from the collusion of\nlarge groups of citizens. A statewide winner-take-all popular voting system for\nelectors is implemented in all but two states, which has led to instances where\nnarrow victories in key states were decisive in several recent elections. Small\ngroups of voters can significantly impact the election, for example, through\nvoter turnout. However, another dynamic can also influence this: a surprisingly\nsmall number of dedicated voters moving short distances across state lines. The\nextent to which the election's outcome is sensitive to small and\nwell-coordinated movements of people has not been investigated in detail. Using\na combination of forecasting, simulation, and optimization, we show that a\ncandidate's probability of winning can be increased by 1% through the strategic\nrelocation of approximately 10,000 people no farther than 100 miles from their\ncurrent county of residence, less than 0.006% of the eligible voting\npopulation. Moreover, an 8% probability increase can be realized by a mere\n50,000 voters relocating across state lines, or 0.03% of the voting population.\nGiven the remarkably small number of people involved and the fact that\nestablishing electoral residence in many states takes about a month, this\ncoordinated relocation of voters is not nearly as challenging as previously\nthought. As it stands, U.S. presidential elections may be vulnerable to the\nexploitation of the aforementioned loophole. Therefore, we anticipate our\nfindings will have direct consequences on policymaking and campaign strategy,\nas well as motivate new operations research methods within the political\nsciences.",

    "abstract": "Model predictive control (MPC) has become the de facto standard action space\nfor local planning and learning-based control in many continuous robotic\ncontrol tasks, including autonomous driving. MPC solves a long-horizon cost\noptimization as a series of short-horizon optimizations based on a global\nplanner-supplied reference path. The primary challenge in MPC, however, is that\nthe computational budget for re-planning has a hard limit, which frequently\ninhibits exact optimization. Modern edge networks provide low-latency\ncommunication and heterogeneous properties that can be especially beneficial in\nthis situation. We propose a novel framework for edge-assisted MPC (E-MPC) for\npath planning that exploits the heterogeneity of edge networks in three\nimportant ways: 1) varying computational capacity, 2) localized sensor\ninformation, and 3) localized observation histories. Theoretical analysis and\nextensive simulations are undertaken to demonstrate quantitatively the benefits\nof E-MPC in various scenarios, including maps, channel dynamics, and\navailability and density of edge nodes. The results confirm that E-MPC has the\npotential to reduce costs by a greater percentage than standard MPC does.",

Our findings indicate that\nsLMs did not consistently outperform NMT models, with fine-tuning proving more\neffective than few-shot prompting, particularly in models with continued\npre-training in the target language. These insights contribute to the\nadvancement of more reliable terminology translation methodologies.",

    "abstract": "Searches for variations of fundamental constants require a comprehensive\nunderstanding of measurement errors. This paper examines a source of error that\nis usually overlooked: the impact of continuum placement error. We investigate\nthe problem using a high resolution, high signal to noise spectrum of the white\ndwarf G191$-$B2B. Narrow photospheric absorption lines allow us to search for\nnew physics in the presence of a gravitational field approximately $10^4$ times\nthat on Earth. Modelling photospheric lines requires knowing the underlying\nspectral continuum level. We describe the development of a fully automated,\nobjective, and reproducible continuum estimation method. Measurements of the\nfine structure constant are produced using several continuum models. The\nresults show that continuum placement variations result in small systematic\nshifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines which impact\nsignificantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect should\ntherefore be included in the error budgets of future measurements. Our results\nsuggest that continuum placement variations should be investigated in other\ncontexts, including fine structure constant measurements in stars other than\nwhite dwarfs. The analysis presented here is based on NiV absorption lines in\nthe photosphere of G191$-$B2B. Curiously, the inferred measurement of the fine\nstructure constant obtained in this paper using NiV (the least negative of our\nmeasurements is $\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha = -1.462 \\pm 1.121 \\times 10^{-5}$) is\ninconsistent with the most recent previous G191$-$B2B photospheric measurement\nusing FeV ($\\Delta\\alpha/\\alpha = 6.36 \\pm 0.35_{stat} \\pm 1.84_{sys} \\times\n10^{-5}$). Given both measurements are derived from the same spectrum, we\npresume (but in this work are unable to check) that this 3.2$\\sigma$ difference\nresults from unknown laboratory wavelength systematics.",

In highly collisional regimes, the perturbation away from initial\nand boundary layers is small and can be compressed to reduce the overall\nstorage cost of the distribution. The convergence behavior of the MM methods,\nthe usual HOLO method, and the standard source iteration method is analyzed on\na linear BGK model. Both the HOLO and MM methods are implemented using a\ndiscontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization in phase space, which naturally\npreserves the consistency between high- and low-order models required by the\nHOLO approach. The accuracy and performance of these methods are compared on\nthe Sod shock tube problem and a sudden wall heating boundary layer problem.\nOverall, the results demonstrate the robustness of the MM and HOLO approaches\nand illustrate the compression benefits enabled by the MM formulation when the\nkinetic distribution is near equilibrium.",

The\ncomponents with $\\tau \\sim 10$ ps and vibration originate from the appearance\nof the PI state and the interference between the reflection lights at the\nsample surface and the boundary between the BI and PI states, suggesting that\nthe electronic structure of the PI phase is different from that of the BI\nstate. XAS spectra indicate that the Sm mean valence is shifted from the\nSm$^{2+}$ dominant to the intermediate between Sm$^{2+}$ and Sm$^{3+}$ by PE\nbut did not change to that of the GM phase across BGT, consistent with the\nreflectivity data. The XRD result after PE shows that the PI state has much\nless lattice contraction than the GM phase.

The J-PET\nModular scanner is a PET device made of 50 cm long plastic strips arranged\naxially, currently in operation at the Jagiellonian University in Krak\\'ow\n(Poland).\n  We have implemented a normalization method for the large field-of-view\nplastic-based J-PET Modular scanner using the component-based approach. We\nestimated the geometric normalization factors for the J-PET Modular scanner\nusing Monte Carlo simulations. We also analysed the effects of variations in\ndetection efficiency. A dedicated cylindrical phantom was simulated to\ninvestigate the impact of various factors on image quality. The image quality\nwas quantified in terms of radial and axial uniformity metrics, and the\nstandard deviation to mean intensity ratio, determined for a set of image\nslices.\n  Without normalization, reconstructions of a uniform cylinder exhibit\nartefacts. These artefacts were satisfactorily compensated using the\nnormalization factors. Applying geometrical corrections lowers the\nnon-uniformity of the image expressed as a standard deviation-to-mean ratio to\na range between 5.5 % to 8.5 %. Computationally, the technique is\nstraightforward to parallelize, making it time-efficient. Preliminary estimates\nsuggest that the method is appropriate for use with long axial field-of-view\nscanners, such as the total-body J-PET, currently under development at the\nJagiellonian University.",

This challenge is even greater in multi-company ecosystems. However,\nwhen faced with a common threat, the ecosystem needs to unite to face the\nchallenge. This study explores how the Omaolo ecosystem in Finland evolved from\ntraditional public-private cooperation to an alliance model during the COVID-19\npandemic from 2020 to 2022. It highlights how the crisis accelerated changes in\noperations and collaboration between public and private participants,\nidentifying key shifts, benefits, and challenges. Key findings include the\nremoval of traditional barriers and the creation of an alliance approach that\nsped up the development of Omaolo's symptom assessment tool. This improved\ncollaboration, service scalability, and responsiveness to healthcare needs\ndespite the initial regulatory and stakeholder alignment challenges. The study\nconcludes that crises can drive agile responses in public ecosystems. The new\ncollaboration model helped Omaolo to adapt quickly to changing service demands,\nmanaging healthcare patient loads more effectively. These findings highlight\nthe value of flexible, collaborative strategies for responding to emergencies\nin public software ecosystems.",

This indicator has been integrated into the standard ISO\nprocess for collecting soundscape data, forming a component of the sound\nquality assessment questionnaire. However, its role in soundscape quality\nassessment has not been fully understood. Herein, we present the findings from\nsoundscape data collected from Beiling Park in Shenyang, China. A method was\ndeveloped that integrates mediation effect models with multiscale\ngeographically weighted regression models to explore the mediating role of SA\nin the impact of sound source types on soundscape quality, as well as the\nspatial heterogeneity of this mediation effect. The results confirm that SA\ndoes mediates the influence of sound source types on acoustics comfort (AC).\nSpecifically, natural sounds (indirect effect/total effect = .19/.19), traffic\nsounds (indirect effect/total effect = -.46/-.65), and commercial sounds\n(indirect effect/total effect = -.25/-.12) impact the perception of AC by\neither enhancing or reducing SA. Moreover, the relationships among variables\ndepicted in this model demonstrate spatial heterogeneity, demonstrating that in\nurban open spaces with complex constructures, local spatial models may be\nneeded for soundscape assessment. The research reaffirms the significance of SA\nin urban open spaces. In terms of practical implications for urban and\nlandscape planners, when sound sources cannot be controlled or altered,\ncoordinating between the sound and the surrounding environment through\nlandscape optimisation could also improve the quality of the soundscape through\nenhancing SA and help achieve the goal of creating healthy urban open spaces.",

However, existing methods often fail to capture the\nevolving structure of neural connectivity in ways that capture its relationship\nto behavior, especially in dynamic, uncertain, or high-dimensional settings\nwith sufficient resolution or interpretability. We introduce the Temporal\nAttention-enhanced Variational Graph Recurrent Neural Network (TAVRNN), a novel\nframework that models time-varying neuronal connectivity by integrating\nprobabilistic graph learning with temporal attention mechanisms. TAVRNN learns\nlatent dynamics at the single-unit level while maintaining interpretable\npopulation-level representations, to identify key connectivity patterns linked\nto behavior. TAVRNN generalizes across diverse neural systems and modalities,\ndemonstrating state-of-the-art classification and clustering performance. We\nvalidate TAVRNN on three diverse datasets: (1) electrophysiological data from a\nfreely behaving rat, (2) primate somatosensory cortex recordings during a\nreaching task, and (3) biological neurons in the DishBrain platform interacting\nwith a virtual game environment. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art\ndynamic embedding techniques, revealing previously unreported relationships\nbetween adaptive behavior and the evolving topological organization of neural\nnetworks. These findings demonstrate that TAVRNN offers a powerful and\ngeneralizable approach for modeling neural dynamics across experimental and\nsynthetic biological systems.

While\nsemi-parametric approaches to modelling longitudinal data subject to irregular\nobservation are known to be sensitive to misspecification of the visit process,\nparametric models may provide a more robust alternative. Robustness of\nparametric models on the outcome alone has been assessed under the assumption\nthat the visit intensity is independent of the time since the last visit, given\nthe covariates and random effects. However, this assumption of a memoryless\nvisit process may not be realistic in the context of EHR data. In a special\ncase which includes memory embedded into the visit process, we derive an\nexpression for the bias in parametric models for the outcome alone and use this\nto identify factors that lead to increasing bias. Using simulation studies, we\nshow that this bias is often small in practice. We suggest diagnostics for\nidentifying the specific cases when the outcome model may be susceptible to\nmeaningful bias, and propose a novel joint model of the outcome and visit\nprocesses that can eliminate or reduce the bias. We apply these diagnostics and\nthe joint model to a study of juvenile dermatomyositis.

Explaining why a robot fails to complete a given task is\nparticularly important for non-expert users to be aware of the robot's\ncapabilities and limitations. So far, research on explaining robot failures has\nonly considered generating textual explanations, even though several studies\nhave shown the benefits of multimodal ones. However, a simple combination of\nmultiple modalities may lead to semantic incoherence between the information\nacross different modalities - a problem that is not well-studied. An incoherent\nmultimodal explanation can be difficult to understand, and it may even become\ninconsistent with what the robot and the human observe and how they perform\nreasoning with the observations. Such inconsistencies may lead to wrong\nconclusions about the robot's capabilities. In this paper, we introduce an\napproach to generate coherent multimodal explanations by checking the logical\ncoherence of explanations from different modalities, followed by refinements as\nrequired. We propose a classification approach for coherence assessment, where\nwe evaluate if an explanation logically follows another.

Fluid electron\nmodels with Spitzer-H\\\"arm or flux-limited Spitzer-H\\\"arm thermal conductivity,\ncombined with Maxwellian electrons for rate calculations, can increase or\ndecrease this error, depending on the impurity species and plasma conditions.\nBased on these results, we also discuss some approaches to experimentally\nobserving non-local electron transport in SOL plasmas.",

Recent CL approaches have achieved\nstrong performance by leveraging large pre-trained models that generalize well\nto downstream tasks. However, such methods lack theoretical guarantees, making\nthem prone to unexpected failures. Conversely, principled CL approaches often\nfail to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we aim to bridge this\ngap between theory and practice by designing a simple CL method that is\ntheoretically sound and highly performant. Specifically, we lift pre-trained\nfeatures into a higher dimensional space and formulate an over-parametrized\nminimum-norm least-squares problem. We find that the lifted features are highly\nill-conditioned, potentially leading to large training errors (numerical\ninstability) and increased generalization errors. We address these challenges\nby continually truncating the singular value decomposition of the lifted\nfeatures. Our approach, termed LoRanPAC, is stable with respect to the choice\nof hyperparameters, can handle hundreds of tasks, and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art CL methods on multiple datasets. Importantly, our method\nsatisfies a recurrence relation throughout its continual learning process,\nwhich allows us to prove it maintains small training and test errors by\nappropriately truncating a fraction of SVD factors. This results in a stable\ncontinual learning method with strong empirical performance and theoretical\nguarantees. Code available: https://github.com/liangzu/loranpac.",

With\nthe emergence of social coding platforms such as GitHub, researchers have now\naccess to millions of software repositories to use as source data for their\nstudies. With this massive amount of data, sampling techniques are needed to\ncreate more manageable datasets. The creation of these datasets is a crucial\nstep, and researchers have to carefully select the repositories to create\nrepresentative samples according to a set of variables of interest. However,\ncurrent sampling methods are often based on random selection or rely on\nvariables which may not be related to the research study (e.g., popularity or\nactivity). In this paper, we present a methodology for creating representative\nsamples of software repositories, where such representativeness is properly\naligned with both the characteristics of the population of repositories and the\nrequirements of the empirical study.

While it may be premature to attribute any excesses in these\nprecision measurements to new physics, they do offer a valuable indication of\npotential directions for physics beyond the SM. Additionally, the particle\nnature of dark matter (DM) remains a crucial enigma. Despite the absence of any\ndefinitive DM signal in direct detection and collider experiments, the Galactic\nCenter GeV $\\gamma$-ray excess and the AMS-02 antiproton ($\\overline{p}$)\nexcess could potentially offer hints related to the evidence of DM. Motivated\nby these observations, we propose a simple DM model that addresses all these\nissues. This model extends the SM by incorporating singlet and doublet Dirac\nfermion fields, along with a doublet complex scalar field. For the viable\nparameter regions in this model, we find that future upgrades of the Large\nHadron Collider and DM direct detection experiments can only partially probe\nthem, while future high-energy muon colliders hold promise for exploring the\nunexplored parameter space.",

This paper investigates the joint beamforming and antenna\nposition optimization for MA-enabled IRS (MA-IRS)-aided multi-user\nmultiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems, where the MA-IRS\nis deployed to aid the communication between the MA-enabled base station (BS)\nand user equipment (UE). In contrast to conventional fixed position antenna\n(FPA)-enabled IRS (FPA-IRS), the positions of the reflecting elements of the\nMA-IRS can be controlled to enhances the wireless channel. To verify the\nsystem's effectiveness and optimize its performance, we formulate a sum-rate\nmaximization problem with a minimum rate threshold constraint for the MU-MISO\ncommunication. To tackle the non-convex problem, a product Riemannian manifold\noptimization (PRMO) method is proposed for the joint optimization of the\nbeamforming and MA positions. Specifically, a product Riemannian manifold space\n(PRMS) is constructed and the corresponding Riemannian gradient is derived for\nupdating the variables, and the Riemannian exact penalty (REP) method and a\nRiemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) algorithm is exploited to\nobtain a feasible solution over the PRMS. Simulation results demonstrate that\ncompared with the conventional FPA-IRS-aided communications, the reflecting\nelements of the MA-IRS can move to the positions with higher channel gain, thus\nenhancing the system performance. Furthermore, it is shown that optimizing the\npositions of the reflecting elements brings higher performance gain than\ncontrolling the phase shifts of the IRS, and integrating MA with IRS leads to\nhigher performance gains compared to integrating MA with BS.",

Existing methods that are spatially\nexplicit and consider service dependencies currently lack practicality, as they\nrequire large amounts of data. To address this gap, we propose a novel method\ncalled DISruptionMap which analyzes complex disruptions to critical\ninfrastructure services. The proposed method combines i) spatial service models\nto assess direct service disruptions with ii) a service dependency model to\nassess indirect (cascading) service disruptions. A fault tree-based approach is\nimplemented, resulting in a significant decrease in the information required to\nset up the service dependency model.

MIXIM is comprised of a mask with equally-spaced apertures\nand an x-ray detector. The aperture size and mask-detector distance determine\nthe system's angular resolution. Although a smaller aperture gives a better\nresolution, the degree of improvement is limited by a diffraction effect. MIXIM\ncircumvents this problem by utilizing the Talbot effect. Our experiment with\nthe previous model equipped with a multi-pinhole mask obtained an angular\nresolution of 0.5\" with a mask-detector distance of 92 cm. A major downside of\nthe multi-pinhole mask is, however, that it has a very low opening fraction,\nwhich results in a very low effective area. Here, we newly adopt to MIXIM a\nmultiple coded aperture (MCA) mask, an array of coded aperture patterns. Our\nproof-of-concept experiment demonstrates that the Talbot effect works even for\nthe MCA mask with a high opening fraction of ~50% at 12.4 keV. Consequently,\nthe new MIXIM realizes about 25 times as large an effective area as that of the\nprevious model, while maintaining a high angular resolution of 0.2\" and a\ncompact size of ~1.5 m.",

    "abstract": "The nearby SN 1987A offers a unique opportunity to investigate the complex\nshock interaction between the ejecta and circumstellar medium. We track the\nevolution of the optical hotspots within the Equatorial Ring (ER) by analyzing\n33 Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations between 1994 and 2022. By\nfitting the ER with an elliptical model, we determine its inclination to be $\n42.85 \\pm 0.50^{\\circ}$ with its major axis oriented $ -6.24 \\pm 0.31^{\\circ}$\nfrom the west. We identify 26 distinct hotspots across the ER, with additional\nones emerging over time, particularly on the west side. The hotspots initially\nshow high velocities ranging from $390$ to $1660 \\ \\rm km \\ s^{-1}$, followed\nby a deceleration phase around day $\\sim 8000$. Subsequent velocities vary from\n$40$ to $660 \\ \\rm km \\ s^{-1}$. The light curves of the hotspots reach maxima\nbetween 7000 and 9000 days, suggesting a connection with the deceleration. Many\nspots are spatially resolved and show elongation perpendicular to the direction\nof motion, indicative of a short cooling time. To explain these results, we\npropose that each hotspot comprises dense substructures embedded in less dense\ngas. The initial velocities are then phase velocities, the break occurs when\nthe blast wave leaves the ER, while the late velocities reflect the propagation\nof radiative shocks in the dense substructures. We estimate that the dense\nsubstructures have a volumetric filling factor of $\\sim0.3 \\left(\nn_{\\mathrm{e}}/10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\right)^{-2} \\%$ and a total mass of\n$\\sim0.24 \\left(n_{\\mathrm{e}}/10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}\n\\right)^{-1}\\times10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$.",

To quantify their stability influences, frequency-domain modal\nanalysis (FMA) method based on the impedance network can serve as a good\nreference. However, since the adopted impedance network only retains electrical\nnodes, oscillation information provided by the FMA method is mainly concerned\nwith circuits (e.g., participation of nodes), which is not convenient for an\nintuitive probe of sync loops' participations. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes an extended admittance modeling method for FMA, the basis of\nwhich is the explicit characterization of GFL/GFM sync loops. First, a\nfour-port extended impedance model (EIM) of converter with one virtual sync\nnode is proposed. Its resulting extended impedance network (EIN) is formed for\nthe converters-interlinked system. Then, the FMA method can be directly applied\nto those virtual sync nodes/branches, so as to realize an intuitive evaluation\nof sync dynamics' effects on oscillations. The effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod is validated by the frequency scanning and time domain simulations in a\ntypical point-to-point HVDC system.",

In particular, we consider two types of\nnonlinearities in the system, viz. nonlinearity in the coupling between battery\nand the cavity, and the cavity itself comprising an anharmonic oscillator. In\nboth these scenarios, the cavity is connected to an environment, and is driven\nby an external laser source. We derive the Markovian master equation for the\ndynamics of the combined cavity-battery system in presence of the environment.\nWhen the cavity is non-linearly coupled to a battery, we find an enhancement in\nthe steady state ergotropy over the linearly-coupled case. We further see that\nthe times at which steady state ergotopy is attained get decreased in the\npresence of nonlinear coupling. We additionally find a complementarity between\nthe nonlinear interaction strength and the coherent-drive strength in the\nsteady-state ergotropy values, i.e. the same ergotropy as that obtained using\nweak nonlinearity and strong coherent drive can be obtained utilizing an\nopposite order of their values. We also identify the nonlinear interaction\nwhere the cavity can be considered as a ``charger\" and show an advantage of\nusing the nonlinear coupling over linear ones. In case when the cavity is\nmodeled as a multi-level transmon with an inherent anharmonicity, we find an\nadvantage in maximum ergotropy values over the harmonic instance. Unlike the\nnon-linearly coupled batteries, the ones mediated by an anharmonic cavity prove\nto be useful in the transient regime. We also determine values of the coherent\ndrive for which the anharmonic battery is beneficial over the harmonic one at\nall timescales. Further, we observe a distinct region of the anharmonic\nstrength and coherent drive where ergotropy values reach their maxima.",

In particular, we study the special case of\n''almost balanced'' plateaued functions, which only have two nonzero preimage\nset sizes, generalizing for instance all monomial functions. We achieve several\ndirect connections and (non)existence conditions for these functions, showing\nfor instance that plateaued $d$-to-$1$ functions (and thus plateaued monomials)\nonly exist for a very select choice of $d$, and we derive for all these\nfunctions their linearity as well as bounds on their differential uniformity.\nWe also specifically study the Walsh transform of plateaued APN functions and\ntheir relation to their value distribution.",

We add to this research area by designing\nan FPT $(6+\\epsilon)$-approximation that works for $k$-MSR under the mentioned\ngeneral fairness notion. For the special 1:1 case, we improve our algorithm to\nachieve a $(3+\\epsilon)$-approximation.",

Despite extensive research efforts, crosstalk in\nlarge-scale photonic circuits still poses a threat to the signal integrity. In\nthis paper, we present two designs of silicon Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI)\nswitches achieving ultra-low-crosstalk, driven thermally and electrically. Each\nswitch fabric is optimized at both the device and circuit level to suppress\ncrosstalk and reduce system complexity. Notably, for the first time to the best\nof our knowledge, we harness the inherent self-heating effect in a\ncarrier-injection-based MZI switch to create a pair of phase shifters that\noffer arbitrary phase differences. Such a pair of phase shifters induces\nmatched insertion loss at each arm, thus minimizing crosstalk. Experimentally,\nan ultra-low crosstalk ratio below -40 dB is demonstrated for both thermo-optic\n(T-O) and electro-optic (E-O) switches. The T-O switch exhibits an on-chip loss\nof less than 5 dB with a switching time of 500 microseconds, whereas the E-O\nswitch achieves an on-chip loss as low as 8.5 dB with a switching time of under\n100 ns.

To ensure machine protection in case of a sudden loss of\nplasma confinement (major disruption), a large fraction of the magnetic and\nthermal energy must be radiated to reduce thermal loads. The disruption\nmitigation system for ITER is based on massive material injection in the form\nof shattered pellet injection (SPI). To support ITER, a versatile SPI system\nwas installed at the tokamak ASDEX Upgrade (AUG). The AUG SPI features three\nindependent pellet generation cells and guide tubes, and each was equipped with\ndifferent shatter heads for the 2022 experimental campaign. We dedicated over\n200 plasma discharges to the study of SPI plasma termination, and in this\nmanuscript report on the results of bolometry (total radiation) analysis. The\namount of neon inside the pellets is the dominant factor determining the\nradiated energy fraction ($f_{rad}$). Large and fast fragments, produced by the\n12.5{\\deg} rectangular shatter head, lead to somewhat higher values of frad\ncompared to the 25{\\deg} circular or rectangular heads. This effect is\nstrongest for neon content of $< 3\\times10^{20}$ neon atoms ($f_\\textrm{neon}\n\\lesssim 1.25\\%$ neon) injected, where a lower normal velocity component\n(larger fragments) seems slightly beneficial. While full-sized, 8 mm diameter,\n100% deuterium ($D_2$) pellets lead to a disruption, the 4 mm or shortened 8 mm\npellets of 100% $D_2$ did not. The disruption threshold for 100% $D_2$ is found\nto be around $1\\times10^{22}$ $D_2$ molecules inside the pellet. While the\nradiated energy fraction of non-disruptive SPI is below 20%, this is increased\nto 40% during the TQ and VDE phase of the disruptive injections. For\n($D_2$-Ne-mix pellets, frad values of $< 90$% are observed, and the curve\nsaturates around 80% for 10% neon mixed into the 8 mm pellets ($2\\times10^{21}$\nneon atoms).",

However, training deep SNNs\nfrom scratch remains a challenge, as SNNs process and transmit information by\nquantizing the real-valued membrane potentials into binary spikes. This can\nlead to information loss and vanishing spikes in deeper layers, impeding\neffective training. While weight initialization is known to be critical for\ntraining deep neural networks, what constitutes an effective initial state for\na deep SNN is not well-understood. Existing weight initialization methods\ndesigned for conventional networks (ANNs) are often applied to SNNs without\naccounting for their distinct computational properties. In this work we derive\nan optimal weight initialization method specifically tailored for SNNs, taking\ninto account the quantization operation. We show theoretically that, unlike\nstandard approaches, this method enables the propagation of activity in deep\nSNNs without loss of spikes. We demonstrate this behavior in numerical\nsimulations of SNNs with up to 100 layers across multiple time steps. We\npresent an in-depth analysis of the numerical conditions, regarding layer width\nand neuron hyperparameters, which are necessary to accurately apply our\ntheoretical findings.

Experts typically associate spatial action units (AUs)\nfrom a codebook to facial regions for the visual interpretation of expressions.\nIn this paper, the same expert steps are followed. A new learning strategy is\nproposed to explicitly incorporate AU cues into classifier training, allowing\nto train deep interpretable models. During training, this AU codebook is used,\nalong with the input image expression label, and facial landmarks, to construct\na AU heatmap that indicates the most discriminative image regions of interest\nw.r.t the facial expression. This valuable spatial cue is leveraged to train a\ndeep interpretable classifier for FER. This is achieved by constraining the\nspatial layer features of a classifier to be correlated with AU heatmaps. Using\na composite loss, the classifier is trained to correctly classify an image\nwhile yielding interpretable visual layer-wise attention correlated with AU\nmaps, simulating the expert decision process. Our strategy only relies on image\nclass expression for supervision, without additional manual annotations. Our\nnew strategy is generic, and can be applied to any deep CNN- or\ntransformer-based classifier without requiring any architectural change or\nsignificant additional training time. Our extensive evaluation on two public\nbenchmarks RAF-DB, and AffectNet datasets shows that our proposed strategy can\nimprove layer-wise interpretability without degrading classification\nperformance.

    "abstract": "Barnard's star is a primary target within the ESPRESSO guaranteed time\nobservations (GTO) as it is the second closest neighbour to our Sun after the\n$\\alpha$ Centauri stellar system. We present here a large set of 156 ESPRESSO\nobservations of Barnard's star carried out over four years with the goal of\nexploring periods of shorter than 50 days, thus including the habitable zone\n(HZ). Our analysis of ESPRESSO data using Gaussian process (GP) to model\nstellar activity suggests a long-term activity cycle at 3200d and confirms\nstellar activity due to rotation at 140d as the dominant source of radial\nvelocity (RV) variations. These results are in agreement with findings based on\npublicly available HARPS, HARPS-N, and CARMENES data. ESPRESSO RVs do not\nsupport the existence of the previously reported candidate planet at 233d.\nAfter subtracting the GP model, ESPRESSO RVs reveal several short-period\ncandidate planet signals at periods of 3.15d, 4.12d, 2.34d, and 6.74d. We\nconfirm the 3.15d signal as a sub-Earth mass planet, with a semi-amplitude of\n$55 \\pm 7$cm/s, leading to a planet minimum mass $m_p \\sin i$ of $0.37 \\pm\n0.05$Mearth, which is about three times the mass of Mars. ESPRESSO RVs suggest\nthe possible existence of a candidate system with four sub-Earth mass planets\nin circular orbits with semi-amplitudes from 20 to 47cm/s, thus corresponding\nto minimum masses in the range of 0.17-0.32Mearth. The sub-Earth mass planet at\n$3.1533 \\pm 0.0006$d is in a close-to circular orbit with a semi-major axis of\n$0.0229 \\pm 0.0003$AU, thus located inwards from the HZ of Barnard's star, with\nan equilibrium temperature of 400K. Additional ESPRESSO observations would be\nrequired to confirm that the other three candidate signals originate from a\ncompact short-period planet system orbiting Barnard's star inwards from its HZ.",

In the antisymmetric case, one\nneutrino is always massless, and the other two can be degenerate if the mass\nmatrix is real. These findings are independent of the level $N$. If the charged\nleptons are arranged to exhibit an appropriate residual symmetry from the same\n$\\Gamma_N$, they determine a column of the leptonic mixing matrix, leading to\nspecific correlations between the mixing angles and the Dirac CP phase. The\npresence of residual (anti)symmetries enables the application of standard\nflavor symmetry techniques to derive these predictions, and we scan all\npossible $\\Gamma_N$ satisfying condition (a).

However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily\non expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks.\nInspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video\ngeneration, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for\nscaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper,\nwe introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based\nRL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn\ngeneral-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly\noptimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which\nstabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining.\nMoreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm\nto compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better\npolicies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150\nmillion parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games\nusing only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art\nlarge-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales\nfavorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel\ngames using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per\ngame, demonstrating superior generalization.

Knowledge of their primary physical properties is\nessential for understanding their origin and the evolution of the outer Solar\nSystem.\n  We predicted a stellar occultation by this TNO for 2020 October 23 UT and ran\na specific campaign to investigate this event. We derived the projected profile\nshape and size from the occultation observations by means of an elliptical fit\nto the occultation chords. We also performed photometric observations of\n(143707) 2003 UY117 to obtain the absolute magnitude and the rotational period\nfrom the observed rotational light curve. Finally, we combined these results to\nderive the three-dimensional shape, volume-equivalent diameter, and geometric\nalbedo for this TNO.\n  From the stellar occultation, we obtained a projected ellipse with axes of\n$(282 \\pm 18) \\times (184 \\pm 32)$ km. The area-equivalent diameter for this\nellipse is $D_\\textrm{eq,A} = 228 \\pm 21$ km. From our photometric $R$ band\nobservations, we derived an absolute magnitude of $H_V = 5.97 \\pm 0.07$ mag\nusing $V-R = 0.46 \\pm 0.07$ mag, which was derived from a $V$ band subset of\nthese data. The rotational light curve has a peak-to-valley amplitude of\n$\\Delta m = 0.36 \\pm 0.13$ mag. We find the most likely rotation period to be\n$P = 12.376 \\pm 0.0033$ hours.

    "abstract": "In the realm of quantum information processing, the efficient\ncharacterization of entangled states poses an overwhelming challenge, rendering\nthe traditional methods including quantum tomography unfeasible and\nimpractical. To tackle this problem, we propose a new verification scheme using\ncollective strategies, showcasing arbitrarily high efficiency that beats the\noptimal verification with global measurements. Our collective scheme can be\nimplemented in various experimental platforms and scalable for large systems\nwith a linear scaling on hardware requirement, and distributed operations are\nallowed. Notably, larger ensembles can always improve the efficiency further,\nbut without increasing the quantum memory. More importantly, the approach\nconsumes only a few copies of the entangled states, while ensuring the\npreservation of unmeasured ones, and even boosting their fidelity for any\nsubsequent tasks. Furthermore, our protocol provides additional insight into\nthe specific types of noise affecting the system, thereby facilitating\npotential targeted improvements. These advancements hold promise for a wide\nrange of applications, offering a pathway towards more robust and efficient\nquantum information processing.",

This study presents a new stacking-based\napproach for CCF detection by adding two extra layers to the usual\nclassification process: an attention layer and a confidence-based combination\nlayer. In the attention layer, we combine soft outputs from a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) using the dependent\nordered weighted averaging (DOWA) operator, and from a graph neural network\n(GNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network using the induced ordered\nweighted averaging (IOWA) operator. These weighted outputs capture different\npredictive signals, increasing the model's accuracy. Next, in the\nconfidence-based layer, we select whichever aggregate (DOWA or IOWA) shows\nlower uncertainty to feed into a meta-learner. To make the model more\nexplainable, we use shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to identify the top\nten most important features for distinguishing between fraud and normal\ntransactions.

The biomineralized magnetosomes\nproduced by these bacteria are high-quality magnetic nanoparticles that form\nchains through a highly reproducible natural process. Specifically,\nMagnetovibrio blakemorei and Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense exhibit distinct\nmagnetosome morphologies: truncated hexa-octahedral and truncated octahedral\nshapes, respectively. Despite having identical compositions (magnetite, Fe3O4)\nand comparable dimensions, their effective uniaxial anisotropies differ\nsignificantly, with M. blakemorei showing ~25 kJ/m^3 and M. gryphiswaldense ~11\nkJ/m^3 at 300K. This variation presents a unique opportunity to explore the\nrole of different anisotropy contributions in the magnetic responses of\nmagnetite-based nanoparticles. This study systematically investigates these\nresponses by examining static magnetization as a function of temperature (M vs.\nT, 5 mT) and magnetic field (M vs. H, up to 1 T). Above the Verwey transition\ntemperature (110 K), the effective anisotropy is dominated by shape anisotropy,\nnotably increasing coercivity for M. blakemorei by up to two-fold compared to\nM. gryphiswaldense. Below this temperature, the effective uniaxial anisotropy\nincreases non-monotonically, significantly altering magnetic behavior. Our\nsimulations based on dynamic Stoner-Wohlfarth models indicate that below the\nVerwey temperature, a uniaxial magnetocrystalline contribution emerges, peaking\nat ~22-24 kJ/m^3 at 5 K, values close to those of bulk magnetite. This\ndemonstrates the profound impact of anisotropic properties on the magnetic\nbehaviors and applications of magnetite-based nanoparticles and highlights the\nexceptional utility of magnetosomes as ideal model systems for studying the\ncomplex interplay of anisotropies in magnetite-based nanoparticles.",

The bare ASIC chip\nconfiguration sustained up to a dose rate (DR) of 270 Gy/s, although it\nexhibited limited spatial resolution due to low detection efficiency. In\ncontrast, Minipix Timepix3 with experimental GaAs sensors showed saturation at\nlow DR=5 Gy/s. Furthermore, the Advapix Timepix3 detector was used in standard\nand customized configurations. In the standard configuration (Ikrum =5), the\ndetector showed saturation at DR=5 Gy/s.

A Parikh automaton is a machine with\naccess to counters that can only be incremented, and have to meet a semilinear\nconstraint at the end of the run. Both of these separability problems are known\nto be decidable with elementary complexity.\n  Our main results are that both problems are coNP-complete.

Soft prompt tuning has mitigated the task\nmisalignment, yet the data misalignment remains a challenge. To analyze the\nimpacts of the data misalignment, we revisit the pre-training and adaptation\nprocesses of CLIP and develop a structural causal model. We discover that while\nwe expect to capture task-relevant information for downstream tasks accurately,\nthe task-irrelevant knowledge impacts the prediction results and hampers the\nmodeling of the true relationships between the images and the predicted\nclasses. As task-irrelevant knowledge is unobservable, we leverage the\nfront-door adjustment and propose Causality-Guided Semantic Decoupling and\nClassification (CDC) to mitigate the interference of task-irrelevant knowledge.\nSpecifically, we decouple semantics contained in the data of downstream tasks\nand perform classification based on each semantic. Furthermore, we employ the\nDempster-Shafer evidence theory to evaluate the uncertainty of each prediction\ngenerated by diverse semantics. Experiments conducted in multiple different\nsettings have consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of CDC.",

Pipeline parallelism, the\nmainstream solution, is inefficient for single-user scenarios, while tensor\nparallelism struggles with frequent communications. In this paper, we argue\nthat tensor parallelism can be more effective than pipeline on low-resource\ndevices, and present a compute- and memory-efficient tensor parallel inference\nsystem, named TPI-LLM, to serve 70B-scale models. TPI-LLM keeps sensitive raw\ndata local in the users' devices and introduces a sliding window memory\nscheduler to dynamically manage layer weights during inference, with disk I/O\nlatency overlapped with the computation and communication. This allows larger\nmodels to run smoothly on memory-limited devices.

    "abstract": "Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers based on discretizations of (overdamped)\nLangevin dynamics are commonly used in the Bayesian inference and computational\nstatistical physics literature to estimate high-dimensional integrals. One can\nintroduce a non-constant diffusion matrix to precondition these dynamics, and\nrecent works have optimized it in order to improve the rate of convergence to\nstationarity by overcoming entropic and energy barriers. However, the\nintroduced methodologies to compute these optimal diffusions are generally not\nsuited to high-dimensional settings, as they rely on costly optimization\nprocedures. In this work, we propose to optimize over a class of diffusion\nmatrices, based on one-dimensional collective variables (CVs), to help the\ndynamics explore the latent space defined by the CV. The form of the diffusion\nmatrix is chosen in order to obtain an efficient effective diffusion in the\nlatent space. We describe how this class of diffusion matrices can be\nconstructed and learned during the simulation. We provide implementations of\nthe Metropolis--Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Riemann Manifold (Generalized)\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithms, and discuss numerical optimizations in the\ncase when the CV depends only on a few degrees of freedom of the system. We\nillustrate the efficiency gains by computing mean transition durations between\ntwo metastable states of a dimer in a solvent.",

MAEs tend to focus on low-level information such as visual\npatterns and regularities within data. Therefore, it is unimportant what is\nportrayed in the input, whether it be images, audio mel-spectrograms, or even\nsynthetic patterns.

By combining MAEs and synthetic patterns, our framework\nenables the model to learn generalized feature representations without real\ndata, while addressing the issues related to real audio. To evaluate the\nefficacy of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments across a total of\n13 audio tasks and 17 synthetic datasets.

    "abstract": "Random vector functional link (RVFL), a variant of single-layer feedforward\nneural network (SLFN), has garnered significant attention due to its lower\ncomputational cost and robustness to overfitting. Despite its advantages, the\nRVFL network's reliance on the square error loss function makes it highly\nsensitive to outliers and noise, leading to degraded model performance in\nreal-world applications. To remedy it, we propose the incorporation of the\nHawkEye loss (H-loss) function into the RVFL framework. The H-loss function\nfeatures nice mathematical properties, including smoothness and boundedness,\nwhile simultaneously incorporating an insensitive zone. Each characteristic\nbrings its own advantages: 1) Boundedness limits the impact of extreme errors,\nenhancing robustness against outliers; 2) Smoothness facilitates the use of\ngradient-based optimization algorithms, ensuring stable and efficient\nconvergence; and 3) The insensitive zone mitigates the effect of minor\ndiscrepancies and noise. Leveraging the H-loss function, we embed it into the\nRVFL framework and develop a novel robust RVFL model termed H-RVFL. Notably,\nthis work addresses a significant gap, as no bounded loss function has been\nincorporated into RVFL to date. The non-convex optimization of the proposed\nH-RVFL is effectively addressed by the Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG)\nalgorithm, whose computational complexity is also discussed. The proposed\nH-RVFL model's effectiveness is validated through extensive experiments on $40$\nbenchmark datasets from UCI and KEEL repositories, with and without label\nnoise. The results highlight significant improvements in robustness and\nefficiency, establishing the H-RVFL model as a powerful tool for applications\nin noisy and outlier-prone environments.",

Our analysis reveals that different biases\nlead to varying model performances, with some biases, especially those\nunrelated to outcome mechanisms, having minimal effect on prediction accuracy.\nThis highlights the crucial need to account for specific biases in clinical\nobservational data in counterfactual ML model development, ultimately enhancing\nthe personalization of treatment decisions in precision medicine.",

To address this challenge, we propose FlipGuard, a constrained\noptimization approach to detect and mitigate update regression with focal\nattention.

Experimental tests were carried out to demonstrate the\nprototype's functionality and the effectiveness of a five-bar mechanism acting\nin a vertical plane, where gravity influences the mechanism's performance.\nPosition control using fifth-order polynomials with via points was implemented\nin the joint space. The design of the end-effector was also evaluated by\nperforming a theoretical comparison, calculated as a function of a real\nflexion-extension trajectory of the fingers and the angle of rotation obtained\nthrough an IMU. As a result, controlling the two degrees of freedom of the\nmechanism at several points of the trajectory assures the end-effector\ntrajectory and therefore the fingers' range of motion, which helps for full\npatient recovery.",

Unconditionally\nshowing quantum advantage is beyond our current understanding of complexity\ntheory, and therefore some computational assumptions are needed. Which\ncomplexity assumption is necessary and sufficient for quantum advantage? In\nthis paper, we show that inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ)\nexist if and only if classically-secure one-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) exist. As far\nas we know, this is the first time that a complete cryptographic\ncharacterization of quantum advantage is obtained. IV-PoQ capture various types\nof quantum advantage previously studied, such as sampling-based quantum\nadvantage and searching-based one. Previous work [Morimae and Yamakawa, Crypto\n2024] showed that IV-PoQ can be constructed from OWFs, but a construction of\nIV-PoQ from weaker assumptions was left open. Our result solves the open\nproblem. OWPuzzs are one of the most fundamental quantum cryptographic\nprimitives implied by many quantum cryptographic primitives weaker than one-way\nfunctions (OWFs). The equivalence between IV-PoQ and classically-secure OWPuzzs\ntherefore highlights that if there is no quantum advantage, then these\nfundamental primitives do not exist. The equivalence also means that quantum\nadvantage is an example of the applications of OWPuzzs. Except for commitments,\nno application of OWPuzzs was known before. Our result shows that quantum\nadvantage is another application of OWPuzzs, which solves the open question of\n[Chung, Goldin, and Gray, Crypto 2024].

    "abstract": "Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to ground specific segments within an\nuntrimmed video corresponding to the given natural language query. Existing VTG\nmethods largely depend on supervised learning and extensive annotated data,\nwhich is labor-intensive and prone to human biases. To address these\nchallenges, we present ChatVTG, a novel approach that utilizes Video Dialogue\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot video temporal grounding. Our\nChatVTG leverages Video Dialogue LLMs to generate multi-granularity segment\ncaptions and matches these captions with the given query for coarse temporal\ngrounding, circumventing the need for paired annotation data. Furthermore, to\nobtain more precise temporal grounding results, we employ moment refinement for\nfine-grained caption proposals. Extensive experiments on three mainstream VTG\ndatasets, including Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions, and TACoS, demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of ChatVTG. Our ChatVTG surpasses the performance of current\nzero-shot methods.",

    "abstract": "The frozen star model describes a type of black hole mimicker; that is, a\nregular, horizonless, ultracompact object that behaves just like a\nSchwarzschild black hole from an external-observer's perspective. In\nparticular, the frozen star is bald, meaning that it cannot be excited. To\nmimic the possible excitations of the frozen star, it needs to be \"defrosted\"\nby allowing deviations from the maximally negative radial pressure and\nvanishing tangential pressure of the fluid sourcing the star. Here, we extend a\nprevious study on non-radial oscillations of the defrosted star by considering,\nin addition to the fluid modes, the even-parity metric perturbations and their\ncoupling to the fluid modes. At first, general equations are obtained for the\nperturbations of the energy density and pressure along with the even-parity\nperturbations of the metric for a static, spherically symmetric but otherwise\ngeneric background with an anisotropic fluid. This formal framework is then\napplied to the case of a defrosted star. The spectrum of non-radial\noscillations is obtained to leading order in an expansion in terms of $\\gamma$,\nwhich is the small relative deviation away from maximally negative radial\npressure. We find that the sound velocity of the modes is non-relativistic, and\nproportional to $\\gamma$, while their lifetime is parametrically long,\nproportional to $1/\\gamma^2$. This result was anticipated by previous\ndiscussions on the collapsed polymer model, whose strongly non-classical\ninterior is argued to provide a microscopic description of the frozen and\ndefrosted star geometries. Our results will serve as a starting point for\ncalculating the spectrum of emitted gravitational waves from an excited frozen\nstar.",

Such light sterile neutrinos are necessarily long-lived\nand may give rise to striking signatures of displaced vertices (DVs) at\nterrestrial experiments. In this work, we study the prospect of the ongoing\nBelle II experiment for detecting the sterile neutrinos from the ALP,\nleveraging the $\\mathcal{O}(10^{10})$ $B$-mesons projected to be produced at\nthe experiment with an integrated luminosity of 50 ab$^{-1}$. We propose search\nstrategies for one or two DVs, and perform Monte-Carlo simulations in order to\nestimate the sensitivity reach of Belle II to active-sterile-neutrino mixing\n$|V_{eN}|^2$ as functions of the sterile-neutrino mass. Signatures include a\nselected list of sterile-neutrino final states, for which we estimate an\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ or lower background level. Our results show that the proposed\nsearch strategies can probe values of $|V_{eN}|^2$ up to about two orders of\nmagnitude beyond the existing bounds, for ALP mass over 4 GeV and\nsterile-neutrino mass above the $D$-meson threshold. Compared to the one-DV\nsearch, the two-DV one, despite its weaker sensitivities as a result of double\nexponential suppression of the sterile-neutrino decay positions, possesses the\nadvantage of possible full reconstruction of the signal event allowing for\npinning down the masses of the sterile neutrino and the ALP, if a discovery is\nmade.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant advancements in large language models (LLMs), the rapid\nand frequent integration of small-scale experiences, such as interactions with\nsurrounding objects, remains a substantial challenge. Two critical factors in\nassimilating these experiences are (1) Efficacy: the ability to accurately\nremember recent events; (2) Retention: the capacity to recall long-past\nexperiences. Current methods either embed experiences within model parameters\nusing continual learning, model editing, or knowledge distillation techniques,\nwhich often struggle with rapid updates and complex interactions, or rely on\nexternal storage to achieve long-term retention, thereby increasing storage\nrequirements. In this paper, we propose SELF-PARAM (Self-Updatable Large\nLanguage Models with Parameter Integration). SELF-PARAM requires no extra\nparameters while ensuring near-optimal efficacy and long-term retention. Our\nmethod employs a training objective that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence between the predictions of an original model (with access to\ncontextual information) and a target model (without such access). By generating\ndiverse question-answer pairs related to the knowledge and minimizing the KL\ndivergence across this dataset, we update the target model to internalize the\nknowledge seamlessly within its parameters. Evaluations on question-answering\nand conversational recommendation tasks demonstrate that SELF-PARAM\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods, even when accounting for non-zero\nstorage requirements.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized the field of\nartificial intelligence, enabling the creation of highly-realistic and detailed\nimages. In this study, we propose a novel Mask Conditional Text-to-Image\nGenerative Model (MCGM) that leverages the power of conditional diffusion\nmodels to generate pictures with specific poses. Our model builds upon the\nsuccess of the Break-a-scene [1] model in generating new scenes using a single\nimage with multiple subjects and incorporates a mask embedding injection that\nallows the conditioning of the generation process. By introducing this\nadditional level of control, MCGM offers a flexible and intuitive approach for\ngenerating specific poses for one or more subjects learned from a single image,\nempowering users to influence the output based on their requirements. Through\nextensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed model in generating high-quality images that meet predefined mask\nconditions and improving the current Break-a-scene generative model.",

This is\nachieved by, first, compressing the data with an autoencoder, and, second,\ninferring the temporal dynamics with recurrent neural networks. The overarching\ngoal of this paper is to show that a latent-space approach can not only infer\nthe solution of a chaotic partial differential equation, but it can also\npredict the stability properties of the physical system. First, we employ the\nconvolutional autoencoder echo state network (CAE-ESN) on the chaotic\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation for various chaotic regimes. We show that the\nCAE-ESN (i) finds a low-dimensional latent-space representation of the\nobservations and (ii) accurately infers the Lyapunov exponents and covariant\nLyapunov vectors (CLVs) in this low-dimensional manifold for different\nattractors. Second, we extend the CAE-ESN to a turbulent flow, comparing the\nLyapunov spectrum to estimates obtained from Jacobian-free methods. A\nlatent-space approach based on the CAE-ESN effectively produces a latent space\nthat preserves the key properties of the chaotic system, such as Lyapunov\nexponents and CLVs, thus retaining the geometric structure of the attractor.\nThe latent-space approach based on the CAE-ESN is a reduced-order model that\naccurately predicts the dynamics of the chaotic system, or, alternatively, it\ncan be used to infer stability properties of chaotic systems from data.",

In this paper, we\ninvestigate synchrotron polarization using a hybrid energy distribution of\nrelativistic thermal and nonthermal electrons within a globally toroidal\nmagnetic field in GRB prompt emission. Our results show that, compared to the\ncase of solely non-thermal electrons, the synchrotron polarization degrees\n(PDs) in these hybrid electrons can vary widely depending on different\nparameters and that the PD decreases progressively with frequency in the\n$\\gamma$-ray, X-ray, and optical bands. The time-averaged PD spectrum displays\na significant bump in the $\\gamma$-ray and X-ray bands with the PDs higher than\n$\\sim60\\%$ if the thermal peak energy of electrons is much smaller than the\nconjunctive energy of electrons between the thermal and non-thermal\ndistribution. The high synchrotron PD ($\\gtrsim 60\\%$) in the $\\gamma$-ray and\nX-ray bands, which generally can not be produced by solely non-thermal\nelectrons with typical power-law slopes, can be achieved by the hybrid\nelectrons and primarily originates from the exponential decay part of the\nthermal component. Moreover, this model can roughly explain the PDs and\nspectral properties of some GRBs, where GRB 110301A with a high PD\n($70_{-22}^{+22} \\%$) may be potential evidence for the existence of\nrelativistic thermal electrons.",

    "abstract": "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has spurred considerable interest\nin advancing autonomous LLMs-based agents, particularly in intriguing\napplications within smartphone graphical user interfaces (GUIs). When presented\nwith a task goal, these agents typically emulate human actions within a GUI\nenvironment until the task is completed. However, a key challenge lies in\ndevising effective plans to guide action prediction in GUI tasks, though\nplanning have been widely recognized as effective for decomposing complex tasks\ninto a series of steps. Specifically, given the dynamic nature of environmental\nGUIs following action execution, it is crucial to dynamically adapt plans based\non environmental feedback and action history.We show that the widely-used ReAct\napproach fails due to the excessively long historical dialogues. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Planning of Thoughts\n(D-PoT) for LLM-based GUI agents.D-PoT involves the dynamic adjustment of\nplanning based on the environmental feedback and execution history.\nExperimental results reveal that the proposed D-PoT significantly surpassed the\nstrong GPT-4V baseline by +12.7% (34.66% $\\rightarrow$ 47.36%) in accuracy. The\nanalysis highlights the generality of dynamic planning in different backbone\nLLMs, as well as the benefits in mitigating hallucinations and adapting to\nunseen tasks.

Targeting more parameter-efficient\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA), parameter sharing presents a promising solution.\nEmpirically, our research into high-level sharing principles highlights the\nindispensable role of differentiation in reversing the detrimental effects of\npure sharing. Guided by this finding, we propose Mixture of Shards (MoS),\nincorporating both inter-layer and intra-layer sharing schemes, and integrating\nfour nearly cost-free differentiation strategies, namely subset selection, pair\ndissociation, vector sharding, and shard privatization. Briefly, it selects a\ndesignated number of shards from global pools with a Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE)-like routing mechanism before sequentially concatenating them to low-rank\nmatrices. Hence, it retains all the advantages of LoRA while offering enhanced\nparameter efficiency, and effectively circumvents the drawbacks of peer\nparameter-sharing methods. Our empirical experiments demonstrate approximately\n8x parameter savings in a standard LoRA setting. The ablation study confirms\nthe significance of each component.

    "abstract": "In formal verification, runtime monitoring consists of observing the\nexecution of a system in order to decide as quickly as possible whether or not\nit satisfies a given property. We consider monitoring in a distributed setting,\nfor properties given as reachability timed automata. In such a setting, the\nsystem is made of several components, each equipped with its own local clock\nand monitor. The monitors observe events occurring on their associated\ncomponent, and receive timestamped events from other monitors through FIFO\nchannels. Since clocks are local, they cannot be perfectly synchronized,\nresulting in imprecise timestamps. Consequently, they must be seen as\nintervals, leading monitors to consider possible reorderings of events. In this\ncontext, each monitor aims to provide, as early as possible, a verdict on the\nproperty it is monitoring, based on its potentially incomplete and imprecise\nknowledge of the current execution. In this paper, we propose an on-line\nmonitoring algorithm for timed properties, robust to time imprecision and\npartial information from distant components. We first identify the date at\nwhich a monitor can safely compute a verdict based on received events. We then\npropose a monitoring algorithm that updates this date when new information\narrives, maintains the current set of states in which the property can reside,\nand updates its verdict accordingly.",

To address these challenges, we propose SynTalker,\nwhich utilizes the off-the-shelf text-to-motion dataset as an auxiliary for\nsupplementing the missing full-body motion and prompts. The core technical\ncontributions are two-fold. One is the multi-stage training process which\nobtains an aligned embedding space of motion, speech, and prompts despite the\nsignificant distributional mismatch in motion between speech-to-motion and\ntext-to-motion datasets. Another is the diffusion-based conditional inference\nprocess, which utilizes the separate-then-combine strategy to realize\nfine-grained control of local body parts.

However, scalar\nmodels lack interpretability and are known to be susceptible to biases in\ndatasets. This paper investigates leveraging the generation capability of LLMs\nto address both limitations in one shot. Specifically, we prompt the\npre-trained LLM to generate positive and negative judgments, both supported\nwith rationales in natural language form. The self-generated contrastive\njudgment pairs are used to train the generative judge with Direct Preference\nOptimization (DPO). This proposal of training the generative Judge using\nself-generated Contrastive judgments (Con-J) ensures natural interpretability\ndue to the generated rationales together with the judgments, as well as high\nrobustness against bias without the need for an additional reward head.\nExperimental results show that the performance of Con-J is comparable to the\nscalar reward model trained on the same collection of preference data, and\ndemonstrate its superior interpretability and robustness in encoding human\npreferences.",

Most recent studies have shown estimating hip joint moments\ninstantaneously offers a lot of advantages compared to generating assistive\ntorque profiles based on gait estimation, such as simple sensor requirements\nand adaptability to variable walking speeds. However, existing joint moment\nestimation methods still suffer from a lack of personalization, leading to\nestimation accuracy degradation for new users. To address the challenges, this\npaper proposes a hip joint moment estimation method based on generalized moment\nfeatures (GMF). A GMF generator is constructed to learn GMF of the joint moment\nwhich is invariant to individual variations while remaining decodable into\njoint moments through a dedicated decoder. Utilizing this well-featured\nrepresentation, a GRU-based neural network is used to predict GMF with joint\nkinematics data, which can easily be acquired by hip exoskeleton encoders. The\nproposed estimation method achieves a root mean square error of 0.1180 Nm/kg\nunder 28 walking speed conditions on a treadmill dataset, improved by 6.5%\ncompared to the model without body parameter fusion, and by 8.3% for the\nconventional fusion model with body parameter. Furthermore, the proposed method\nwas employed on a hip exoskeleton with only encoder sensors and achieved an\naverage 20.5% metabolic reduction (p<0.01) for users compared to assist-off\ncondition in level-ground walking.",

In this paper, we propose a Bayesian\nContext-Aware Time Series Imputation (Bayes-CATSI) framework which leverages\nuncertainty quantification offered by variational inference. We consider the\ntime series derived from electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography\n(EOG), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiology (EKG). Variational Inference\nassumes the shape of the posterior distribution and through minimization of the\nKullback-Leibler(KL) divergence it finds variational densities that are closest\nto the true posterior distribution. Thus , we integrate the variational\nBayesian deep learning layers into the CATSI model. Our results show that\nBayes-CATSI not only provides uncertainty quantification but also achieves\nsuperior imputation performance compared to the CATSI model.

The question analysed here is to link this measurement to the\ninitial size distribution. To do so, we first derive, from the initial reaction\nsystem $$\\mathcal{C}_i \\stackrel{b}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathcal{C}_{i-1} +\n\\mathcal{C}_1,\\qquad i\\geq i_0\\geq 2,$$ two asymptotic models: at first order,\na backward transport equation, and at second order, an\nadvection-diffusion/Fokker-Planck equation complemented with a mixed boundary\ncondition at $x = 0$. We estimate their distance to the original system\nsolution. We then turn to the inverse problem, i.e., how to estimate the\ninitial size distribution from the time measurement of an average quantity,\ngiven by a moment of the solution. This question has been already studied for\nthe first order asymptotic model, and we analyse here the second order\nasymptotic. Thanks to Carleman inequalities and to log-convexity estimates, we\nprove observability results and error estimates for a Tikhonov regularization.\nWe then develop a Kalman-based observer approach, and implement it on simulated\nobservations.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the evolution of opinions governed by a Friedkin Johnsen\n(FJ) based model in arbitrary network structures with signed interactions. The\nagents contributing to the opinion formation are characterised as being\ninfluential. Initially, the agents are classified as opinion leaders and\nfollowers based on network connectivity and the nature of interactions.\nHowever, the addition of stubbornness leads to interesting behaviours wherein a\nnon influential agent can now become influential and vice versa. Thereafter, a\nsignal flow graph (SFG) based method is proposed to quantify the influence of\nan influential agents' opinions. Additionally, it helps illustrate the role\nplayed by network topology in shaping the final opinions of the agents. Based\non this analysis, the absolute centrality measure is proposed to determine the\noverall influence of all the agents in the network. Unlike most of the existing\nmeasures, it is applicable to any network structure and considers the effect of\nstubbornness and antagonism. Examples are presented throughout the paper to\nillustrate and validate these results.",

    "abstract": "Merge sort as a divide-sort-merge paradigm has been widely applied in\ncomputer science fields. As modern reduced instruction set computing\narchitectures like the fifth generation (RISC-V) regard multiple registers as a\nvector register group for wide instruction parallelism, optimizing merge sort\nwith this vectorized property is becoming increasingly common. In this paper,\nwe overhaul the divide-sort-merge paradigm, from its register-level sort to the\ncache-aware merge, to develop a fine-grained RISC-V vectorized merge sort\n(RVMS). From the register-level view, the inline vectorized transpose\ninstruction is missed in RISC-V, so implementing it efficiently is non-trivial.\nBesides, the vectorized comparisons do not always work well in the merging\nnetworks. Both issues primarily stem from the expensive data shuffle\ninstruction. To bypass it, RVMS strides to take register data as the proxy of\ndata shuffle to accelerate the transpose operation, and meanwhile replaces\nvectorized comparisons with scalar cousin for more light real value swap. On\nthe other hand, as cache-aware merge makes larger data merge in the cache, most\nmerge schemes have two drawbacks: the in-cache merge usually has low cache\nutilization, while the out-of-cache merging network remains an ineffectively\nsymmetric structure. To this end, we propose the half-merge scheme to employ\nthe auxiliary space of in-place merge to halve the footprint of naive merge\nsort, and meanwhile copy one sequence to this space to avoid the former data\nexchange. Furthermore, an asymmetric merging network is developed to adapt to\ntwo different input sizes.",

    "abstract": "Modern computer processors use microarchitectural optimization mechanisms to\nimprove performance. As a downside, such optimizations are prone to introducing\nside-channel vulnerabilities. Speculative loading of memory, called\nprefetching, is common in real-world CPUs and may cause such side-channel\nvulnerabilities: Prior work has shown that it can be exploited to bypass\nprocess isolation and leak secrets, such as keys used in RSA, AES, and ECDH\nimplementations. However, to this date, no effective and efficient\ncountermeasure has been presented that secures software on systems with\naffected prefetchers.\n  In this work, we answer the question: How can a process defend against\nprefetch-based side channels? We first systematize prefetching-based\nside-channel vulnerabilities presented in academic literature so far. Next, we\ndesign and implement PreFence, a scheduling-aware defense against these side\nchannels that allows processes to disable the prefetcher temporarily during\nsecurity-critical operations. We implement our countermeasure for an x86_64 and\nan ARM processor; it can be adapted to any platform that allows to disable the\nprefetcher. We evaluate our defense and find that our solution reliably stops\nprefetch leakage. Our countermeasure causes negligible performance impact while\nno security-relevant code is executed, and its worst case performance is\ncomparable to completely turning off the prefetcher. The expected average\nperformance impact depends on the security-relevant code in the application and\ncan be negligible as we demonstrate with a simple web server application.\n  We expect our countermeasure could widely be integrated in commodity OS, and\neven be extended to signal generally security-relevant code to the kernel to\nallow coordinated application of countermeasures.",

Building on prior research, we hypothesize that these adversarial\nsuffixes are not mere bugs but may represent features that can dominate the\nLLM's behavior. To evaluate this hypothesis, we conduct several experiments.\nFirst, we demonstrate that benign features can be effectively made to function\nas adversarial suffixes, i.e., we develop a feature extraction method to\nextract sample-agnostic features from benign dataset in the form of suffixes\nand show that these suffixes may effectively compromise safety alignment.\nSecond, we show that adversarial suffixes generated from jailbreak attacks may\ncontain meaningful features, i.e., appending the same suffix to different\nprompts results in responses exhibiting specific characteristics. Third, we\nshow that such benign-yet-safety-compromising features can be easily introduced\nthrough fine-tuning using only benign datasets.

In this paper, we\ninvestigate cosmic Ly$\\alpha$ emission by post-processing cosmological\nsimulations from \\texttt{IllustrisTNG} and \\texttt{THESAN} project.\nSpecifically, we calculate the Ly$\\alpha$ emission from galaxies,\ncircum-galactic medium (CGM) and inter-galactic medium (IGM) across various\nredshifts. Our results show that IGM alone is significantly under the current\nobservational upper limits. Meanwhile, CGM overshoots the observed galaxy\ncontribution at $z \\lesssim 0.5$ indicating that either the escape fraction for\nthe inner CGM is less than unity or the current photoionization equilibrium\ntreatment with an approximate self-shielding prescription is less accurate. The\ngalaxy component also overshoots at low redshift, indicating that the escape\nfraction has strong evolution caused by an evolving halo mass function and dust\ngrowth distribution, that agrees with observationally inferred escape\nfractions. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the Ly$\\alpha$ emission from\ndiffuse gas (CGM+IGM) peaked at $z \\sim 4$ and diminishes toward lower\nredshift. The Ly$\\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas mainly originates through\nthe collisional excitation of hot plasma. By comparing models with observation,\nour predicted Ly$\\alpha$ emission from diffuse gas remains $\\sim 6$ times\nfainter than the observed cosmic Ly$\\alpha$ emission at $z=1-3$. However,\nfuture large telescopes may hold great promise to detect Ly$\\alpha$ emission\nfrom diffuse gas toward $z>3$.",

Different from the\nprevious works that directly use scene graphs for generation, we employ the\ngenerative capabilities of variational autoencoders and diffusion models in a\ngeneralizable manner, compositing diverse disentangled visual clues from scene\ngraphs. Specifically, we first propose a Semantics-Layout Variational\nAutoEncoder (SL-VAE) to jointly derive (layouts, semantics) from the input\nscene graph, which allows a more diverse and reasonable generation in a\none-to-many mapping. We then develop a Compositional Masked Attention (CMA)\nintegrated with a diffusion model, incorporating (layouts, semantics) with\nfine-grained attributes as generation guidance. To further achieve graph\nmanipulation while keeping the visual content consistent, we introduce a\nMulti-Layered Sampler (MLS) for an \"isolated\" image editing effect.

    "abstract": "The spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), an inherently random\nquantum process, produces a non-deterministic photon-pair with strong temporal\nand spatial correlations owing to both energy and momentum conservation.\nTherefore, the SPDC-based photon pairs are used for quantum random number\ngeneration (QRNG). Typically, temporal correlation in association with an ideal\nunbiased beam splitter is used for QRNG without fully exploring the spatial\ncorrection. As a result, SPDC-based QRNG has a low bit rate. On the other hand,\ndue to the spatial correlation, the photon pairs in non-collinear phase-matched\ngeometry are generated randomly in diametrically opposite points over an\nannular ring spatial distribution. Therefore, exploring the temporal\ncorrelation between photon pairs from different sections of the annual ring can\nlead to multi-bit QRNG at a high rate, avoiding the need for a beam splitter.\nAs a proof-of-concept, we report on high-bit-rate QRNG by using spatial\ncorrelation of photon-pairs by sectioning the SPDC ring of a non-collinear,\ndegenerate, high-brightness source and temporal correlation between the\ndiametrically opposite sections. Dividing the annular ring of the\nhigh-brightness photon-pair source based on a 20 mm long, type-0 phase-matched,\nperiodically-poled KTP crystal into four sections, recording the timestamp of\nthe coincidences (widow of 1 ns) between photons from diametrically opposite\nsections and assigning bits (0 and 1), we extracted 90 million raw bits over\n27.7 s at a pump power of 17 mW. We determined the extraction ratio using the\nminimum entropy evaluation of more than 95% in our case. Using Toeplitz\nmatrix-based post-processing, we achieved a QRNG with a bit-rate of 3 Mbps,\npassing all NIST 800-22 and TestU01 test suites. The generic scheme shows the\npossibility of further enhancement of the bit rate through more sectioning of\nthe SPDC ring.",

The model is governed by the anisotropic surface\ndiffusion for the evolving curve, with appropriate boundary conditions at the\ncontact points where the two curves meet. The continuum model obeys an energy\ndecay law and preserves the enclosed area between the two curves. We introduce\nan arclength parameterization for the substrate curve, which plays a crucial\nrole in a structure-preserving approximation as it straightens the curved\nsubstrate and tracks length changes between contact points. Based on this\ninsight, we introduce a symmetrized weak formulation which leads to an\nunconditional energy stable parametric approximation in terms of the discrete\nenergy. We also provide an error estimate of the enclosed area, which depends\non the substrate profile and can be zero in the case of a flat substrate.\nFurthermore, we introduce a correction to the discrete normals to enable an\nexact area preservation for general curved substrates.

Fine-tuning (FT) is a method of customizing a\npre-trained AI foundation model by further training it on a smaller, targeted\ndataset. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Privacy-Preserving\nParameter-Efficient FT (P3EFT) framework, which can be viewed as the\nintersection of Parameter-Efficient FT (PEFT) and Privacy-Preserving FT (PPFT).\nPEFT modifies only a small subset of the model's parameters to achieve FT\n(i.e., adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset), while PPFT uses\nprivacy-preserving technologies to protect the confidentiality of the model\nduring the FT process. There have been many studies on PEFT or PPFT but very\nfew on their fusion, which motivates our work on P3EFT to achieve both\nparameter efficiency and model privacy. To exemplify our P3EFT, we present the\nPrivTuner scheme, which incorporates Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabled\nprivacy protection into LoRA (short for ``Low-Rank Adapter''). Intuitively\nspeaking, PrivTuner allows the model owner and the external data owners to\ncollaboratively implement PEFT with encrypted data.

Then, we consider a PrivTuner system over wireless communications\nand formulate a joint optimization problem to adaptively minimize energy while\nmaximizing privacy protection, with the optimization variables including FDMA\nbandwidth allocation, wireless transmission power, computational resource\nallocation, and privacy protection. A resource allocation algorithm is devised\nto solve the problem.

Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block\nallocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system\nmemory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level\nObjectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging\nfrom 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that\nLayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by\n28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.",

Semantic search is particularly beneficial\nfor discovering scholarly publications where differences in vocabulary between\nusers' search terms and document content are common, often yielding irrelevant\nsearch results. Many scholarly search engines have adopted knowledge graphs to\nrepresent semantic relations between authors, publications, and research\nconcepts. However, users may face challenges when navigating these graphical\nsearch interfaces due to the complexity and volume of data, which impedes their\nability to discover publications effectively. To address this problem, we\ndeveloped a conversational search system for exploring scholarly publications\nusing a knowledge graph. We outline the methodical approach for designing and\nimplementing the proposed system, detailing its architecture and functional\ncomponents. To assess the system's effectiveness, we employed various\nperformance metrics and conducted a human evaluation with 40 participants,\ndemonstrating how the conversational interface compares against a graphical\ninterface with traditional text search. The findings from our evaluation\nprovide practical insights for advancing the design of conversational search\nsystems.",

We utilize DRL\nto develop flow control strategies that enhance energy efficiency and minimize\nenergy consumption, thereby addressing the limitations of traditional methods.\nWe find that the optimal jet placement for both square and circular cylinders\nis at the main flow separation point, achieving the best balance between energy\nefficiency and control effectiveness. For the circular cylinder, positioning\nthe jet at approximately 105{\\deg} from the stagnation point requires only 1%\nof the inlet flow rate and achieves an 8% reduction in drag, with energy\nconsumption one-third of that at other positions. For the square cylinder,\nplacing the jet near the rear corner requires only 2% of the inlet flow rate,\nachieving a maximum drag reduction of 14.4%, whereas energy consumption near\nthe front corner is 27 times higher, resulting in only 12% drag reduction. In\nmulti-action control, the convergence speed and stability are lower compared to\nsingle-action control, but activating multiple jets significantly reduces\ninitial energy consumption and improves energy efficiency. Physically, the\ninteraction of the synthetic jet with the flow generates new vortices that\nmodify the local flow structure, significantly enhancing the cylinder's\naerodynamic performance.

We refer to this as question awareness of LLMs. The lack of\nquestion awareness in LLMs leads to two phenomena that LLMs are: (1) too casual\nto answer non-open-ended questions or (2) too boring to answer open-ended\nquestions. In this paper, we first evaluate the question awareness in LLMs. The\nexperimental results show that LLMs have the issues of lacking awareness of\nquestions in certain domains, e.g. factual knowledge, resulting in\nhallucinations during the generation. To mitigate these, we propose a method\ncalled Question Awareness Temperature Sampling (QuATS).

    "abstract": "Flow control of bluff bodies plays a critical role in engineering\napplications. In this study, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is employed to\ndevelop flow control strategies for the flow past an elliptical cylinder\nconfined between two walls. The primary objective is to investigate the\nfeasibility of achieving multi-objective flow control for an elliptical\ncylinder with varying aspect ratios ($Ar$), while maintaining low control\nenergy input. DRL training results demonstrate that for an elliptical cylinder\nwith larger $Ar$, the control strategy effectively reduces drag, minimizes lift\nfluctuations, and completely suppresses vortex shedding, all while maintaining\nlow external energy consumption. Conversely, decreasing the $Ar$ compromises\nthe effectiveness of multi-objective control, even when greater energy input is\napplied. Through detailed physical analysis, the coupling effect between the\nblockage ratio ($\\beta$) and $Ar$ is identified as a limiting factor for vortex\nshedding suppression and wake stabilization. At lower values of $\\beta$, the\ncontrol strategy successfully achieves multi-objective optimization for\nelliptical cylinders across the entire range of $Ar$. Although balancing energy\nefficiency and control performance remains challenging for highly slender\ncylinders, the proposed DRL strategy still achieves effective vortex shedding\nsuppression. This work highlights the potential of DRL-based control strategies\nto effectively stabilize wake flows around slender bluff bodies, with an\nexplicit emphasis on maintaining energy efficiency.",

To achieve this goal, current\nmethods commonly attempt to sample from the posterior distribution, or to\noptimize a weighted sum of a distortion loss (e.g., MSE) and a perceptual\nquality loss (e.g., GAN). Unlike previous works, this paper is concerned\nspecifically with the optimal estimator that minimizes the MSE under a\nconstraint of perfect perceptual index, namely where the distribution of the\nreconstructed images is equal to that of the ground-truth ones. A recent\ntheoretical result shows that such an estimator can be constructed by optimally\ntransporting the posterior mean prediction (MMSE estimate) to the distribution\nof the ground-truth images. Inspired by this result, we introduce\nPosterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF), a simple yet highly effective algorithm\nthat approximates this optimal estimator. In particular, PMRF first predicts\nthe posterior mean, and then transports the result to a high-quality image\nusing a rectified flow model that approximates the desired optimal transport\nmap.

Recent semantic\nparsers have been developed with sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLMs) or large language models, where the models treat logical\nforms as sequences of tokens. For syntactic and semantic validity, the semantic\nparsers use grammars that enable constrained decoding. However, the grammars\nlack the ability to utilize large information of KBs, although logical forms\ncontain representations of KB elements, such as entities or relations. In this\nwork, we propose a grammar augmented with candidate expressions for semantic\nparsing on a large KB with a seq2seq PLM. The grammar defines actions as\nproduction rules, and our semantic parser predicts actions during inference\nunder the constraints by types and candidate expressions. We apply the grammar\nto knowledge base question answering, where the constraints by candidate\nexpressions assist a semantic parser to generate valid KB elements. We also\nintroduce two special rules, sub-type inference and union types, and a mask\ncaching algorithm. In particular, sub-type inference and the mask caching\nalgorithm greatly increase the decoding speed of our semantic parser. We\nexperimented on two benchmarks, KQA Pro and Overnight, where the constraints by\ncandidate expressions increased the accuracy of our semantic parser, whether it\nwas trained with strong supervision or weak supervision.

    "abstract": "Buckminsterfullerene, C$_{60}$, has not only a beautiful truncated\nicosahedral (soccerball) shape, but simple H\\\"uckel calculations predict a\nthree-fold degenerate lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) which can\naccomodate up to six electrons making it a good electron acceptor. Experiments\nhave confirmed that C60 is a radical sponge and it is now sold for use in\ntopical cosmetics. Further medical uses require functionalization of C60 to\nmake it soluble and one of the simplest functionalization is to make C60(OH)n\nfullerenols. A previous article [Adv. Quant. Chem. 8, 351 (2023)] studied\nreactivity indices for the successive addition of the $^\\bullet$OH radical to\n($^\\bullet$)C$_{60}$(OH)$_n$ in gas phase. [($^\\bullet$)C$_{60}$(OH)$_n$ is\nonly a radical when n is an odd number.] This present article extends this\nprevious work by examining various aspects of how the reaction, changes in\naqueous solution. One obvious difference between C$_{60}$ and their various\nisomers of C$_{60}$(OH)$_2$ is the presence of a dipole. As fullerendiols are\nnearly spherical, their change in dipole moment in going from gas to aqueous\nphase may be estimated using back-of-the-envellope calculations with the\nOnsager model. The result is remarkably similar to what is obtained using\ndensity-functional theory (DFT) and the more sophisticated solvation model\nbased upon the quantum mechanical density (SMD). Calculation of fullerendiol\nC-O bond energies and reactivity indices using with the SMD approach confirm\nthat the general conclusions from the earlier work regarding gas-phase\nreactivity still hold in the aqueous phase.",

    "abstract": "Sensing technology has significantly advanced in automating systems that\nreflect human movement, particularly in robotics and healthcare, where it is\nused to automatically detect target movements. This study develops a method to\nautomatically count exercise repetitions by analyzing IMU signals, with a focus\non a universal exercise repetition counting task that counts all types of\nexercise movements, including novel exercises not seen during training, using a\nsingle model. Since peak patterns can vary significantly between different\nexercises as well as between individuals performing the same exercise, the\nmodel needs to learn a complex embedding space of sensor data to generalize\neffectively. To address this challenge,we propose a repetition counting\ntechnique utilizing a deep metric-based few-shot learning approach, designed to\nhandle both existing and novel exercises. By redefining the counting task as a\nfew-shot classification problem, the method is capable of detecting peak\nrepetition patterns in exercises not seen during training. The approach employs\na Siamese network with triplet loss, optimizing the embedding space to\ndistinguish between peak and non-peak frames. Evaluation results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing an 86.8% probability of\naccurately counting ten or more repetitions within a single set across 28\ndifferent exercises. This performance highlights the model's ability to\ngeneralize across various exercise types, including those not present in the\ntraining data.

    "abstract": "Enabling generative models to decompose visual concepts from a single image\nis a complex and challenging problem. In this paper, we study a new and\nchallenging task, customized concept decomposition, wherein the objective is to\nleverage diffusion models to decompose a single image and generate visual\nconcepts from various perspectives. To address this challenge, we propose a\ntwo-stage framework, CusConcept (short for Customized Visual Concept\nDecomposition), to extract customized visual concept embedding vectors that can\nbe embedded into prompts for text-to-image generation. In the first stage,\nCusConcept employs a vocabulary-guided concept decomposition mechanism to build\nvocabularies along human-specified conceptual axes. The decomposed concepts are\nobtained by retrieving corresponding vocabularies and learning anchor weights.\nIn the second stage, joint concept refinement is performed to enhance the\nfidelity and quality of generated images. We further curate an evaluation\nbenchmark for assessing the performance of the open-world concept decomposition\ntask. Our approach can effectively generate high-quality images of the\ndecomposed concepts and produce related lexical predictions as secondary\noutcomes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CusConcept.",

As datasets continue to grow in size, distributed-PCA (DPCA) has\nbecome an active research area. A key challenge in DPCA lies in efficiently\naggregating results across multiple machines or computing nodes due to\ncomputational overhead. Fan et al.

However, their method does not utilize\neigenvalue information. In this article, we propose a novel DPCA method that\nincorporates eigenvalue information to aggregate local results via the matrix\n$\\beta$-mean, which we call $\\beta$-DPCA. The matrix $\\beta$-mean offers a\nflexible and robust aggregation method through the adjustable choice of $\\beta$\nvalues. Notably, for $\\beta=1$, it corresponds to the arithmetic mean; for\n$\\beta=-1$, the harmonic mean; and as $\\beta \\to 0$, the geometric mean.\nMoreover, the matrix $\\beta$-mean is shown to associate with the matrix\n$\\beta$-divergence, a subclass of the Bregman matrix divergence, to support the\nrobustness of $\\beta$-DPCA.

    "abstract": "Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) is an emerging method for uncertainty\nestimation that provides reliable predictive uncertainty in a single forward\npass, attracting significant attention. Grounded in subjective logic, EDL\nderives Dirichlet concentration parameters from neural networks to construct a\nDirichlet probability density function (PDF), modeling the distribution of\nclass probabilities. Despite its success, EDL incorporates several nonessential\nsettings: In model construction, (1) a commonly ignored prior weight parameter\nis fixed to the number of classes, while its value actually impacts the balance\nbetween the proportion of evidence and its magnitude in deriving predictive\nscores. In model optimization, (2) the empirical risk features a\nvariance-minimizing optimization term that biases the PDF towards a Dirac delta\nfunction, potentially exacerbating overconfidence. (3) Additionally, the\nstructural risk typically includes a KL-divergence-minimizing regularization,\nwhose optimization direction extends beyond the intended purpose and\ncontradicts common sense, diminishing the information carried by the evidence\nmagnitude. Therefore, we propose Re-EDL, a simplified yet more effective\nvariant of EDL, by relaxing the nonessential settings and retaining the\nessential one, namely, the adoption of projected probability from subjective\nlogic. Specifically, Re-EDL treats the prior weight as an adjustable\nhyperparameter rather than a fixed scalar, and directly optimizes the\nexpectation of the Dirichlet PDF provided by deprecating both the\nvariance-minimizing optimization term and the divergence regularization term.\nExtensive experiments and state-of-the-art performance validate the\neffectiveness of our method.

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the emergence of compact, anisotropic stellar\nstructures through the gravitational decoupling scheme within the framework of\ncomplete geometric deformation. The study introduces a novel synthesis of two\nindependent techniques, namely the zero-complexity factor and density-like\nconstraints, applied simultaneously to determine the deformation functions.\nThis dual implementation represents a new methodological step in stellar\nmodeling, as it allows us to explicitly control the role of anisotropy and\ncomplexity in the internal structure of self-gravitating objects. Starting from\na chosen metric ansatz as a seed solution, we demonstrate that the\nzero-complexity condition captures the gravitational response of compact matter\nin a fully tractable form. The complete deformation procedure then yields two\nnew physically viable anisotropic solutions, passing all standard stability and\nenergy condition tests. Our results show, for the first time, that the\ndirection of energy transfer between the seed sector and the decoupled source\nis uniquely governed by the deformation parameter, providing direct physical\ninsight into the coupling between known and generic gravitational fields.\nFurthermore, we find that anisotropy plays a decisive role in the stability\ncriteria of these stars, highlighting its nontrivial influence on realistic\nstellar evolution. These results offer a new perspective on the modeling of\nhigh-density stellar interiors and open a pathway for extending gravitational\ndecoupling analyses to more complex astrophysical scenarios.",

For instance, LLMs are expected to selectively provide confidential\ninformation to authorized internal users, such as employees or trusted\npartners, while withholding it from external users, including the general\npublic and unauthorized entities. Therefore, we propose a novel method termed\n``in-context knowledge unlearning'', which enables the model to selectively\nforget information in test-time based on the query context. Our method\nfine-tunes pre-trained LLMs to enable prompt unlearning of target knowledge\nwithin the context, while preserving unrelated information. Experiments on\nTOFU, AGE and RWKU datasets using Llama2-7B/13B and Mistral-7B models\ndemonstrate that our method achieves up to 95% forget accuracy while retaining\n80% of unrelated knowledge, significantly outperforming baselines in both\nin-domain and out-of-domain scenarios. Further investigation of the model's\ninternal behavior revealed that while fine-tuned LLMs generate correct\npredictions in the middle layers and preserve them up to the final layer.\nHowever, the decision to forget is made only at the last layer, i.e. ``LLMs\npretend to forget''.

To help provide high-resolution\nprecipitation estimates over long time scales, this study presents Wasserstein\nRegularized Diffusion (WassDiff), a diffusion framework to downscale\n(super-resolve) precipitation fields from low-resolution gauge and reanalysis\nproducts.

The key common ingredient in the architectural\ndesigns of these models is Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). We first show\nthat CSA is an overall low-rank operation. Then, we propose an instance-Guided\nLow-rank Multi-Head selfattention (GLMHA) to replace the CSA for a considerable\ncomputational gain while closely retaining the original model performance.\nUnique to the proposed GLMHA is its ability to provide computational gain for\nboth short and long input sequences.

Thus, we conduct a comprehensive benchmarking of\nexisting mainstream X-ray report generation models and large language models\n(LLMs), on the CheXpert Plus dataset.

We explore the scenario\nwhere two $Z_{\\mathcal N}$ QCD axions undergo mass mixing during the QCD phase\ntransition, yielding three distinct mixing scenarios: the mixing I, II, and\nIII. These scenarios are realized through fine-tuning of the axion decay\nconstants, the temperature parameters, as well as the value of $\\mathcal N$. We\nconduct a thorough analysis of the level crossing phenomena in these three\nmixing scenarios, detailing the conditions under which they occur. Notably, in\nthe mixing I and II, the level crossing precedes the critical temperature of\nthe QCD phase transition ($T_{\\rm QCD}$), with minimal non-essential\ndiscrepancies in the cosmological evolution of the mass eigenvalues at $T_{\\rm\nQCD}$. In contrast, the mixing III exhibits a unique double level crossings,\noccurring both before and at $T_{\\rm QCD}$. Despite superficial similarities in\naxion evolution between the mixing II and III, we uncover fundamental\ndifferences between them. Additionally, we briefly address the transition in\nenergy density between the two axions within our mixing scenarios.

We aim to maximize sum rate by jointly optimizing the BS transmit\nbeamforming vectors, the covariance matrix of the dedicated radar signal, the\nRIS phase shift matrix, the FDA frequency offsets and the radar receive\nequalizer, while guaranteeing the required signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio\n(SCNR) of the radar echo signal. To tackle this challenging problem, we first\ntheoretically prove that the dedicated radar signal is unnecessary for\nenhancing target sensing performance, based on which the original problem is\nmuch simplified. Then, we turn our attention to the single-user single-target\n(SUST) scenario to demonstrate that the FDA-RIS-aided ISAC system always\nachieves a higher SCNR than its PA-RIS-aided counterpart. Moreover, it is\nrevealed that the SCNR increment exhibits linear growth with the BS transmit\npower and the number of BS receive antennas. In order to effectively solve this\nsimplified problem, we leverage the fractional programming (FP) theory and\nsubsequently develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based\non symmetric alternating direction method of multipliers (SADMM) and successive\nconvex approximation (SCA) techniques.

The\ngeneralization ability of spatiotemporal models has received considerable\nattention in recent scholarly discourse. However, no substantive datasets\nspecifically addressing traffic out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios have been\nproposed. Existing ST-OOD methods are either constrained to testing on extant\ndata or necessitate manual modifications to the dataset. Consequently, the\ngeneralization capacity of current spatiotemporal models in OOD scenarios\nremains largely underexplored. In this paper, we investigate state-of-the-art\nmodels using newly proposed traffic OOD benchmarks and, surprisingly, find that\nthese models experience a significant decline in performance. Through\nmeticulous analysis, we attribute this decline to the models' inability to\nadapt to previously unobserved spatial relationships. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, which learns\na set of graph generators (i.e., graphons) during training and adaptively\ncombines them to generate new graphs based on novel environmental conditions to\nhandle spatial distribution shifts during testing. We further extend this\nconcept to the Transformer architecture, achieving substantial improvements.\nOur method is both parsimonious and efficacious, and can be seamlessly\nintegrated into any spatiotemporal model, outperforming current\nstate-of-the-art approaches in addressing spatial dynamics.",

In this\nmanuscript, we extend the framework of functional mixed membership models to\nallow for covariate-dependent adjustments. The proposed model utilizes a\nmultivariate Karhunen-Lo\\`eve decomposition, which allows for a scalable and\nflexible model. Within this framework, we establish a set of sufficient\nconditions ensuring the identifiability of the mean, covariance, and allocation\nstructure up to a permutation of the labels. This manuscript is primarily\nmotivated by studies on functional brain imaging through electroencephalography\n(EEG) of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Specifically, we are\ninterested in characterizing the heterogeneity of alpha oscillations for\ntypically developing (TD) children and children with ASD. Since alpha\noscillations are known to change as children develop, we aim to characterize\nthe heterogeneity of alpha oscillations conditionally on the age of the child.\nUsing the proposed framework, we were able to gain novel information on the\ndevelopmental trajectories of alpha oscillations for children with ASD and how\nthe developmental trajectories differ between TD children and children with\nASD.",

However, a complete\ntheoretical framework for understanding these scaling laws remains\nunderdeveloped. In this paper, we explore the neural scaling laws for deep\noperator networks, which involve learning mappings between function spaces,\nwith a focus on the Chen and Chen style architecture. These approaches, which\ninclude the popular Deep Operator Network (DeepONet), approximate the output\nfunctions using a linear combination of learnable basis functions and\ncoefficients that depend on the input functions. We establish a theoretical\nframework to quantify the neural scaling laws by analyzing its approximation\nand generalization errors. We articulate the relationship between the\napproximation and generalization errors of deep operator networks and key\nfactors such as network model size and training data size. Moreover, we address\ncases where input functions exhibit low-dimensional structures, allowing us to\nderive tighter error bounds. These results also hold for deep ReLU networks and\nother similar structures. Our results offer a partial explanation of the neural\nscaling laws in operator learning and provide a theoretical foundation for\ntheir applications.",

A key component of T-CPS\nis the Digital Twin (DT), a virtual representation that enables simulation,\nanalysis, and optimization through real-time data exchange and communication.\nAlthough existing studies have explored DTs for vehicles, communications,\npedestrians, and traffic, real-world validations and implementations of DTs\nthat encompass infrastructure, vehicles, signals, communications, and more\nremain limited due to several challenges. These include accessing real-world\nconnected infrastructure, integrating heterogeneous, multi-sourced data,\nensuring real-time data processing, and synchronizing the digital and physical\nsystems. To address these challenges, this study develops a traffic DT based on\na real-world connected vehicle corridor. Leveraging the Cellular\nVehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) infrastructure in the corridor, along with\ncommunication, computing, and simulation technologies, the proposed DT\naccurately replicates physical vehicle behaviors, signal timing,\ncommunications, and traffic patterns within the virtual environment. Building\nupon the previous data pipeline, the digital system ensures robust\nsynchronization with the physical environment. Moreover, the DT's scalable and\nredundant architecture enhances data integrity, making it capable of supporting\nfuture large-scale C-V2X deployments. Furthermore, its ability to provide\nfeedback to the physical system is demonstrated through applications such as\nsignal timing adjustments, vehicle advisory messages, and incident\nnotifications.

We explore and implement two independent methods to\naccomplish these tasks, which enable one to directly compute the Kossakowski\nmatrix of an arbitrary Markovian QME from its Liouvillian. In the first method,\ndue to Hall, Cresser, Li, and Andersson, the Kossakowski matrix elements are\nobtained by evaluating the action of the Liouvillian on the orthonormal SU($N$)\nbasis matrices and then computing a sum of matrix-product traces. The second\nmethod, developed in this work, is based on the real $N$-level coherence vector\nand relies on the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of a rectangular matrix composed\nof the structure constants of SU$(N)$. We show that both methods give identical\nresults, and apply them to establish the complete positivity of the partial\nsecular Bloch-Redfield QME for the $\\Lambda$ and V-systems driven by incoherent\nlight. We find that the eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix of these\nseemingly different three-level systems are identical, implying close\nsimilarities of their dissipative dynamics. By facilitating the expression of\nmultilevel Markovian QMEs in Lindblad form, our results enable testing the QMEs\nfor complete positivity without solving them, as well as restoring complete\npositivity by keeping only non-negative eigenvalues of the Kossakowski matrix.",

An in-house direct simulation Monte\nCarlo (DSMC) solver is employed to simulate a series of hypersonic air flows\nover a wedge-cylinder configuration at the freestream Mach number of 10. The\nDSMC simulations cover 15 different Knudsen numbers, spanning from 0.006688 to\n0.6688. At the lowest Knudsen number, the numerical results are validated by\nthe corresponding wind-tunnel experiment, and demonstrate the features of an\nEdney type IV shock-shock interaction, including the type IV wave pattern, the\nsupersonic jet impingement, the augmentations of surface shear stress, pressure\nand heat flux, as well as the shifts in the angular positions of the peak shear\nstress, pressure and heat flux over the cylinder surface. In ascending order of\nKnudsen number, the overviews and details of the flow fields with and without\nshock-shock interaction, as well as the distributions of the shear stress,\npressure and heat flux over the cylinder surface are displayed and analyzed.\nThe increase of flow rarefaction continuously alters the flow pattern of the\nshock-shock interaction, in which the wave system gradually losses the\nabilities to deflect the streamlines or to concentrate the energy in the flow.\nAs the flow becomes more rarefied, the shock-shock interaction will result in\nsmaller augmentation factors and less angular shifts of the peak\naerodynamic/aerothermal loads. At the highest Knudsen number in this study, the\naugmentation factors for skin friction and heat flux are found to be less than\nunity. The existence/vanishment of the supersonic jet and its position relative\nto the cylinder account for the distribution characteristics of\naerodynamic/aerothermal loads over the cylinder surface.",

    "abstract": "Our paper introduces a new theoretical framework called the Fractional\nEinstein--Gauss--Bonnet scalar field cosmology, which has important physical\nimplications. Using fractional calculus to modify the gravitational action\nintegral, we derived a modified Friedmann equation and a modified Klein--Gordon\nequation. Our research reveals non-trivial solutions associated with\nexponential potential, exponential couplings to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and a\nlogarithmic scalar field, which are dependent on two cosmological parameters,\n$m$ and $\\alpha_{0}=t_{0}H_{0}$ and the fractional derivative order $\\mu$. By\nemploying linear stability theory, we reveal the phase space structure and\nanalyze the dynamic effects of the Gauss--Bonnet couplings. The scaling\nbehavior at some equilibrium points reveals that the geometric corrections in\nthe coupling to the Gauss--Bonnet scalar can mimic the behavior of the dark\nsector in modified gravity. Using data from cosmic chronometers, type Ia\nsupernovae, supermassive Black Hole Shadows, and strong gravitational lensing,\nwe estimated the values of $m$ and $\\alpha_{0}$, indicating that the solution\nis consistent with an accelerated expansion at late times with the values\n$\\alpha_0=1.38\\pm 0.05$, $m=1.44\\pm 0.05$, and $\\mu=1.48 \\pm 0.17$ (consistent\nwith $\\Omega_{m,0}=0.311\\pm 0.016$ and $h=0.712\\pm 0.007$), resulting in an age\nof the Universe $t_{0}=19.0\\pm 0.7$ [Gyr] at 1$\\sigma$ CL. Ultimately, we\nobtained late-time accelerating power-law solutions supported by the most\nrecent cosmological data, and we proposed an alternative explanation for the\norigin of cosmic acceleration other than $\\Lambda$CDM. Our results generalize\nand significantly improve previous achievements in the literature, highlighting\nthe practical implications of fractional calculus in cosmology.",

The gas is mainly\nejected around the rotation axis of the outer part of the disk rather than\naround the spin axis of the BH. The disk precession changes the ejection\ndirection of the gas with time. The radiation energy is also released in\napproximately the same direction as the outflow, so the precession is expected\nto cause a quasi-periodic time-variation of the observed luminosity. The\ntimescale of the precession is about $10$ s for the 10 solar mass BH and for\nthe radial extent of the disk of several tens of gravitational radii. This\ntimescale is consistent with the frequency of the low-frequency quasi-periodic\noscillation ($0.01-1$ Hz) observed in some ultraluminous X-ray sources.",

The bubble oscillation equation can be simplified\nto the Keller-Miksis equation by neglecting the effects of phase transition and\nbubble migration. The present theoretical model effectively captures the\nexperimental results for bubbles generated in free fields, near free surfaces,\nadjacent to rigid walls, and in the vicinity of other bubbles. Based on the\npresent theory, we explore the effect of the bubble content by changing the\nvapor proportion inside the cavitation bubble for an initial high-pressure\nbubble. It is found that the energy loss of the bubble shows a consistent\nincrease with increasing Mach number and initial vapor proportion. However, the\nradiated pressure peak by the bubble at the collapse stage increases with the\ndecreasing Mach number and increasing vapor proportion. The energy analyses of\nthe bubble reveal that the presence of vapor inside the bubble not only\ndirectly contributes to the energy loss of the bubble through phase transition\nbut also intensifies the bubble collapse, which leads to greater radiation of\nenergy into the surrounding flow field due to the fluid compressibility.",

Heating such a sheet leads to a\nlarge spontaneous deformation, coupled to the director design through a metric\nconstraint that is now well-established by the literature. Here we go beyond\nthe metric constraint and identify the full plate theory that underlies this\nphenomenon. Starting from a widely used bulk model for LCEs, we derive a plate\ntheory for the pure bending deformations of patterned LCE sheets in the limit\nthat the sheet thickness tends to zero using the framework of\n$\\Gamma$-convergence. Specifically, after dividing the bulk energy by the cube\nof the thickness to set a bending scale, we show that all limiting midplane\ndeformations with bounded energy at this scale satisfy the aforementioned\nmetric constraint. We then identify the energy of our plate theory as an\nansatz-free lower bound of the limit of the scaled bulk energy, and construct a\nrecovery sequence that achieves this plate energy for all smooth enough\nmidplane deformations.

    "abstract": "Tiered memory, built upon a combination of fast memory and slow memory,\nprovides a cost-effective solution to meet ever-increasing requirements from\nemerging applications for large memory capacity. Reducing the size of fast\nmemory is valuable to improve memory utilization in production and reduce\nproduction costs because fast memory tends to be expensive. However, deciding\nthe fast memory size is challenging because there is a complex interplay\nbetween application characterization and the overhead of page migration used to\nmitigate the impact of limited fast memory capacity. In this paper, we\nintroduce a system, Tuna, to decide fast memory size based on modeling of page\nmigration. Tuna uses micro-benchmarking to model the impact of page migration\non application performance using three metrics. Tuna decides the fast memory\nsize based on offline modeling results and limited information on workload\ntelemetry. Evaluating with common big-memory applications and using 5% as the\nperformance loss target, we show that Tuna in combination with a page\nmanagement system (TPP) saves fast memory by 8.5% on average (up to 16%). This\nis in contrast to the 5% saving in fast memory reported by Microsoft Pond for\nthe same workloads (BFS and SSSP) and the same performance loss target.",

Traditional methods for enzyme\nfunction prediction or protein binding pocket design often fall short in\ncapturing the dynamic and complex nature of enzyme-substrate interactions,\nparticularly in catalytic processes.

In support of that explanation, this paper\nexamines the influence of the same FFP flyby on the Hilda asteroids, which\norbit stably in the 3:2 mean motion resonance with Jupiter. The observed Hilda\npopulation exhibits two distinct resonant patterns: (1) a lack of Hildas with\nresonant amplitudes < 40 deg. at eccentricities < 0.1; (2) a nearly complete\nabsence of Hildas with amplitudes < 20 deg., regardless of eccentricity.\nPrevious models of Jupiter migration and resonance capture could account for\nthe eccentricity distribution of Hildas but have failed to replicate the\nunusual absence of those with the smallest resonant amplitudes, which\ntheoretically should be the most stable. Here we report that the FFP flyby can\ntrigger an extremely rapid outward migration of Jupiter, causing a sudden shift\nin the 3:2 Jovian resonance. Consequently, Hildas with varying eccentricities\nwould have their resonant amplitudes changed by different degrees, leading to\nthe observed resonant patterns. We additionally show that, in our FFP flyby\nscenario, these patterns are consistently present across different resonant\namplitude distributions of primordial Hildas arising from various formation\nmodels. We also place constraints on the potential parameters of the FFP,\nsuggesting it should have an eccentricity of 1-1.3 or larger, an inclination up\nto 30 deg. or higher, and a minimum mass of about 50 Earth masses.",

AFDM is based on the discrete affine Fourier transform\n(DAFT) with two adjustable parameters of the chirp signals, termed as the\npre-chirp and post-chirp parameters, respectively. We show that the pre-chirp\ncounterpart can be flexibly manipulated for additional degree-of-freedom (DoF).\nTherefore, this paper proposes a novel AFDM scheme with the pre-chirp index\nmodulation (PIM) philosophy (AFDM-PIM), which can implicitly convey extra\ninformation bits through dynamic pre-chirp parameter assignment, thus enhancing\nboth spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, we first demonstrate that\nthe subcarrier orthogonality is still maintained by applying distinct pre-chirp\nparameters to various subcarriers in the AFDM modulation process. Inspired by\nthis property, each AFDM subcarrier is constituted with a unique pre-chirp\nsignal according to the incoming bits. By such arrangement, extra binary bits\ncan be embedded into the index patterns of pre-chirp parameter assignment\nwithout additional energy consumption. For performance analysis, we derive the\nasymptotically tight upper bounds on the average bit error rates (BERs) of the\nproposed schemes with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection, and validate that the\nproposed AFDM-PIM can achieve the optimal diversity order under doubly\ndispersive channels. Based on the derivations, we further propose an optimal\npre-chirp alphabet design to enhance the BER performance via intelligent\noptimization algorithms. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed AFDM-PIM\noutperforms the classical benchmarks under doubly dispersive channel.",

    "abstract": "Major solar flares are abrupt surges in the Sun's magnetic flux, presenting\nsignificant risks to technological infrastructure. In view of this, effectively\npredicting major flares from solar active region magnetic field data through\nmachine learning methods becomes highly important in space weather research.\nMagnetic field data can be represented in multivariate time series modality\nwhere the data displays an extreme class imbalance due to the rarity of major\nflare events. In time series classification-based flare prediction, the use of\ncontrastive representation learning methods has been relatively limited. In\nthis paper, we introduce CONTREX, a novel contrastive representation learning\napproach for multivariate time series data, addressing challenges of temporal\ndependencies and extreme class imbalance. Our method involves extracting\ndynamic features from the multivariate time series instances, deriving two\nextremes from positive and negative class feature vectors that provide maximum\nseparation capability, and training a sequence representation embedding module\nwith the original multivariate time series data guided by our novel contrastive\nreconstruction loss to generate embeddings aligned with the extreme points.\nThese embeddings capture essential time series characteristics and enhance\ndiscriminative power. Our approach shows promising solar flare prediction\nresults on the Space Weather Analytics for Solar Flares (SWAN-SF) multivariate\ntime series benchmark dataset against baseline methods.",

Conventional methods generate \\emph{shear maps} from\nwhich we can infer the matter distribution in the universe. Current methods\n(e.g., Kaiser-Squires inversion) for generating these maps, however, are tricky\nto implement and can introduce bias. Recent alternatives construct a spatial\nprocess prior for the lensing potential, which allows for inference of the\nconvergence and shear parameters given lensing shear measurements. Realizing\nthese spatial processes, however, scales cubically in the number of\nobservations - an unacceptable expense as near-term surveys expect billions of\ncorrelated measurements. Therefore, we present a linearly-scaling shear map\nconstruction alternative using a scalable Gaussian Process (GP) prior called\nMuyGPs. MuyGPs avoids cubic scaling by conditioning interpolation on only\nnearest-neighbors and fits hyperparameters using batched leave-one-out cross\nvalidation. We use a suite of ray-tracing results from N-body simulations to\ndemonstrate that our method can accurately interpolate shear maps, as well as\nrecover the two-point and higher order correlations.

The\nanatomy, disease texture patterns, and location of the disease are extremely\nimportant to generate realistic images; moreover the fidelity of image\ngeneration can have significant implications in downstream tasks involving\ndisease diagnosis or treatment repose assessment.

Since there are about ten G objects in the Galactic\ncenter, it is more likely that they are dust-enshrouded stars whose\ngaseous-dusty envelopes are stable within the corresponding tidal (Hill) radii\nof the order of a few astronomical units. Such a length-scale is consistent\nwith their infrared broad-band spectral energy distributions. Broad emission\nlines, in particular Br$\\gamma$ recombination line, can be interpreted to arise\nwithin the accretion stream from the circumstellar envelopes forming a compact\ndisc that is truncated by the stellar magnetic field. Alternatively, they could\nalso be associated with circumstellar accretion-disc outflows as well as the\nmaterial within a denser bow shock ahead of the star. In comparison with the\nline origin in the photoionized envelopes that can generally be tidally\nstretched, the scenario involving the circumstellar accretion-disc inflow or\noutflow can ensure that the line luminosity is rather stable, except for the\nviewing-angle effects.

We propose\nalgorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and\npresent a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach\nwhich involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional\napproach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the\nnon-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions\nas initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve\nsignificant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of\nthe final solutions.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential for contextual understanding of\nboth visual and textual information. However, their vulnerability to\nadversarially manipulated inputs presents significant risks, leading to\ncompromised outputs and raising concerns about the reliability in\nVLM-integrated applications. Detecting these malicious prompts is thus crucial\nfor maintaining trust in VLM generations. A major challenge in developing a\nsafeguarding prompt classifier is the lack of a large amount of labeled benign\nand malicious data. To address the issue, we introduce VLMGuard, a novel\nlearning framework that leverages the unlabeled user prompts in the wild for\nmalicious prompt detection. These unlabeled prompts, which naturally arise when\nVLMs are deployed in the open world, consist of both benign and malicious\ninformation. To harness the unlabeled data, we present an automated\nmaliciousness estimation score for distinguishing between benign and malicious\nsamples within this unlabeled mixture, thereby enabling the training of a\nbinary prompt classifier on top. Notably, our framework does not require extra\nhuman annotations, offering strong flexibility and practicality for real-world\napplications. Extensive experiment shows VLMGuard achieves superior detection\nresults, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Our evaluation, using diverse applications and\nperformance metrics, provides significant insights into the system's\nadaptability and efficiency. We observed scalable throughput increases across\nconfigurations of 1, 2, and 4 Virtual Machines (VMs), reaching up to 5.1\nGibibits per second (Gib/s) for different data transfer sizes. This scalability\ndemonstrates the system's capacity to handle tasks that require substantial\namounts of data. The energy consumption of our virtualized accelerator\nenvironment increased nearly linearly with the addition of more NeuroVM\naccelerators, ranging from 25 to 45 millijoules (mJ) as the number of\naccelerators increased from 1 to 20. Further, our investigation of\nreconfiguration overheads revealed that partial reconfigurations significantly\nreduce the time spent on reconfigurations compared to full reconfigurations,\nparticularly when there are more virtual machines, as indicated by the\nlogarithmic scale of time measurements.",

Exploiting the worldline effective field theory (EFT) formalism, we\nfirst characterize three types of quadrupole finite-size effects: the\nspin-induced quadrupole moments, the conservative tidal deformations, and the\ntidal heating. We then derive the corresponding contributions to the\ngravitational waveform phases for binary compact objects in aligned-spin\nquasi-circular orbits. We separately estimate the constraints on these\nfinite-size effects for black holes using the power spectral densities (PSDs)\nof the CE+ET detector network and LISA observations. For the CE+ET network, we\nfind that the bounds on the mass-weighted spin-independent dissipation number\n$H_0$ are of the order $O(1)$, while the bounds on the mass-weighted tidal Love\nnumber $\\tilde{\\Lambda}$ are of the order $O(10)$. For high-spin binary black\nholes with dimensionless spin $\\chi \\simeq 0.8$, the bounds on the symmetric\nspin-induced quadrupole moment $\\kappa_s$ are of the order $O(10^{-1})$. LISA\nobservations of supermassive black hole mergers offer slightly tighter\nconstraints on all three finite-size parameters. Additionally, we perform a\nFisher analysis for a binary neutron star merger within the CE+ET network.

To tackle these\nchallenges, we introduce an innovative multi-modal diagnostic pipeline (MDPipe)\nby employing large language models (LLMs) for ocular surface disease diagnosis.\nWe first employ a visual translator to interpret meibography images by\nconverting them into quantifiable morphology data, facilitating their\nintegration with clinical metadata and enabling the communication of nuanced\nmedical insight to LLMs. To further advance this communication, we introduce a\nLLM-based summarizer to contextualize the insight from the combined morphology\nand clinical metadata, and generate clinical report summaries. Finally, we\nrefine the LLMs' reasoning ability with domain-specific insight from real-life\nclinician diagnoses. Our evaluation across diverse ocular surface disease\ndiagnosis benchmarks demonstrates that MDPipe outperforms existing standards,\nincluding GPT-4, and provides clinically sound rationales for diagnoses.",

    "abstract": "We explore a reduced-order model (ROM) of plane Couette flow with a view to\nperforming turbulence control. The ROM is derived through Galerkin projections\nof the incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) system onto a basis composed of\ncontrollability modes, truncated to a few streamwise and spanwise wavenumbers.\nSuch ROMs were found to reproduce key aspects of nonlinear turbulence dynamics\nin Couette flow with only a few hundreds degrees of freedom. Here we use the\nROM to devise a control strategy. For that, we consider a ROM with an extra\nforcing term, consisting in a steady body force. The spatial structure of the\nforcing is given by a linear combination of Stokes modes, optimised using a\ngradient-descent algorithm in order to minimise the total fluctuation energy.\nThe optimisation is performed at different Reynolds numbers, with the optimal\nforcing leading to laminarisation of the flow in all cases. The forcing\nmechanism acts by strongly reducing the shear in a large central portion of the\nchannel. This disrupts the dynamics of large-scale streaks and rolls and\nhinders the main energy input to the system. When the forcing is active, the\nflow reaches a new laminar state which is linearly stable and whose linear\ntransient growth is substantially reduced with respect to that of laminar\nCouette flow. These features prompt the flow to return to the laminar Couette\nstate when the forcing is switched off. Body forces optimised in the ROM are\nsubsequently applied to the full NS system in direct numerical simulations\n(DNS) for the same flow configurations. The same control mechanisms are\nobserved in the DNS, where laminarisation is also achieved. The present work\nopens up interesting possibilities for turbulence control. We show that the\nROMs provide an effective framework to design turbulence control strategies,\ndespite the high degree of truncation with respect to the full system.",
