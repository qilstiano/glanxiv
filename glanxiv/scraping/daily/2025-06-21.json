    "abstract": "Recent work analyzing in-context learning (ICL) has identified a broad set of\nstrategies that describe model behavior in different experimental conditions.\nWe aim to unify these findings by asking why a model learns these disparate\nstrategies in the first place. Specifically, we start with the observation that\nwhen trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the\nstrategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of\nBayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on\nthe set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, where the prior matches\nthe underlying task distribution. Adopting the normative lens of rational\nanalysis, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal adaptation to\ndata given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian\nframework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next-token predictions\nthroughout training -- without assuming access to its weights. Under this\nframework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL\nphenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend\nin the timescale for transitioning from generalization to memorization as task\ndiversity increases. Overall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive\naccount of ICL grounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing fetal body motion and shape is paramount in prenatal diagnostics\nand monitoring. Existing methods for fetal MRI analysis mainly rely on\nanatomical keypoints or volumetric body segmentations. Keypoints simplify body\nstructure to facilitate motion analysis, but may ignore important details of\nfull-body shape. Body segmentations capture complete shape information but\ncomplicate temporal analysis due to large non-local fetal movements. To address\nthese limitations, we construct a 3D articulated statistical fetal body model\nbased on the Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model (SMPL). Our algorithm\niteratively estimates body pose in the image space and body shape in the\ncanonical pose space. This approach improves robustness to MRI motion artifacts\nand intensity distortions, and reduces the impact of incomplete surface\nobservations due to challenging fetal poses. We train our model on\nsegmentations and keypoints derived from $19,816$ MRI volumes across $53$\nsubjects. Our model captures body shape and motion across time series and\nprovides intuitive visualization. Furthermore, it enables automated\nanthropometric measurements traditionally difficult to obtain from\nsegmentations and keypoints. When tested on unseen fetal body shapes, our\nmethod yields a surface alignment error of $3.2$ mm for $3$ mm MRI voxel size.\nTo our knowledge, this represents the first 3D articulated statistical fetal\nbody model, paving the way for enhanced fetal motion and shape analysis in\nprenatal diagnostics.

AbRank aggregates\nover 380,000 binding assays from nine heterogeneous sources, spanning diverse\nantibodies, antigens, and experimental conditions, and introduces standardized\ndata splits that systematically increase distribution shift, from local\nperturbations such as point mutations to broad generalization across novel\nantigens and antibodies. To ensure robust supervision, AbRank defines an\nm-confident ranking framework by filtering out comparisons with marginal\naffinity differences, focusing training on pairs with at least an m-fold\ndifference in measured binding strength. As a baseline for the benchmark, we\nintroduce WALLE-Affinity, a graph-based approach that integrates protein\nlanguage model embeddings with structural information to predict pairwise\nbinding preferences. Our benchmarks reveal significant limitations in current\nmethods under realistic generalization settings and demonstrate that\nranking-based training improves robustness and transferability.

Etch rates decrease sharply with increasing source-to-substrate\ndistance due to reduced Ga vapor availability, while elevated temperatures\nenhance surface reaction kinetics through increased Ga reactivity and suboxide\nformation, leading to enhanced etch rates. In-plane anisotropy studies using\nradial trench patterns reveal that the (100) orientation produces the most\nstable etch front, characterized by smooth, vertical sidewalls and minimal\nlateral etching, consistent with its lowest surface free energy. In contrast,\norientations such as (101), which possess higher surface energy, exhibit\npronounced lateral etching and micro-faceting. As the trench orientation\nprogressively deviates from (100), lateral etching increases. Facet evolution\nis observed between (100) and (-102), where stepped sidewalls composed of\nalternating (100) and (-102) segments progressively transition into a single\ninclined facet, which stabilizes along (100) or (-102) depending on the trench\norientation.

Bayesian estimation\nof parameters incorporates prior beliefs with observed data to infer\ndistribution parameters probabilistically and robustly. Moreover, it provides\nfull posterior distributions, allowing uncertainty quantification and\nregularization, especially useful in small or truncated samples. Utilizing the\nleft-truncated log-logistic (LTLL) distribution is particularly well-suited for\nmodeling time-to-event data where observations are subject to a known lower\nbound such as precipitation data and cancer survival times. In this paper, we\npropose a Bayesian approach for estimating the parameters of the LTLL\ndistribution with a fixed truncation point \\( x_L > 0 \\). Given a random\nvariable \\( X \\sim LL(\\alpha, \\beta; x_L) \\), where \\( \\alpha > 0 \\) is the\nscale parameter and \\( \\beta > 0 \\) is the shape parameter, the likelihood\nfunction is derived based on a truncated sample \\( X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_N \\) with\n\\( X_i > x_L \\).

    "abstract": "This position paper argues that formal optimal control theory should be\ncentral to AI alignment research, offering a distinct perspective from\nprevailing AI safety and security approaches. While recent work in AI safety\nand mechanistic interpretability has advanced formal methods for alignment,\nthey often fall short of the generalisation required of control frameworks for\nother technologies. There is also a lack of research into how to render\ndifferent alignment/control protocols interoperable. We argue that by recasting\nalignment through principles of formal optimal control and framing alignment in\nterms of hierarchical stack from physical to socio-technical layers according\nto which controls may be applied we can develop a better understanding of the\npotential and limitations for controlling frontier models and agentic AI\nsystems. To this end, we introduce an Alignment Control Stack which sets out a\nhierarchical layered alignment stack, identifying measurement and control\ncharacteristics at each layer and how different layers are formally\ninteroperable. We argue that such analysis is also key to the assurances that\nwill be needed by governments and regulators in order to see AI technologies\nsustainably benefit the community. Our position is that doing so will bridge\nthe well-established and empirically validated methods of optimal control with\npractical deployment considerations to create a more comprehensive alignment\nframework, enhancing how we approach safety and reliability for advanced AI\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "A planet's axial tilt (\"obliquity\") substantially affects its atmosphere and\nhabitability. It is thus essential to comprehend the various mechanisms that\ncan excite planetary obliquities, particularly at the primordial stage. Here,\nwe explore planetary obliquity excitation induced by the early evolution of the\nhost star. A young, distended star spins rapidly, resulting in a large\ngravitational quadrupole moment that induces nodal recession of the planet's\norbit. As the star contracts and spins down, the nodal recession frequency\ndecreases and can cross the planet's spin axis precession frequency. An\nadiabatic encounter results in the planet's capture into a secular spin-orbit\nresonance and excites the obliquity to large values. We find planets within $a\n\\lesssim 1 \\ \\mathrm{AU}$ are most affected, but adiabatic capture depends on\nthe initial stellar radius and spin rate. The overall picture is complicated by\nother sources of perturbation, including the disk, multiple planets, and tidal\ndissipation. Tides make it such that stellar oblateness-induced obliquity\nexcitation is transient since tidal perturbations cause the resonance to break\nonce high obliquities are reached. However, this early transient excitation is\nimportant because it can prime planets for long-term capture in a secular\nspin-orbit resonance induced by planet-planet interactions. Thus, although\nstellar oblateness-induced resonances are short-lived, they facilitate the\nprevalence of long-lived non-zero obliquities in exoplanets.",

We begin by consolidating essential criteria that effective\nmeasures of functional diversity should meet. We then evaluate fifteen widely\nused functional diversity metrics against these criteria and assess their\nperformance across six synthetic ecosystem scenarios where optimal behavior is\nknown. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that none of the widely used metrics\nfully satisfy all the established requirements, and all fail in at least one\necosystem scenario. In particular, we find that almost all metrics flagrantly\nviolate set monotonicity and distance monotonicity, requirements that adding a\nnovel species should increase diversity, and that the magnitude of that\nincrease should grow with trait dissimilarity. We also find that metrics fail\nto decline when rare, functionally extreme species are lost, and even increase\nwhen a perfectly redundant species is added. These critical flaws leave them\nblind to the very biodiversity loss that functional diversity measures are\nintended to detect. Our findings underscore the urgent need to develop a new\ngeneration of functional diversity metrics that more accurately reflect\necological realities.",

In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization\nproblem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex\nsubproblems by newly established algorithms.

This\nwork presents a revised, first-principles model that establishes the\noverwhelming dominance of jetting for producing micron and sub-micron aerosols.\nOur approach first rules out the film droplet mechanism as a primary\ncontributor for this size range by demonstrating through physical scaling and\nnumerical simulations that the final average ejected volume of sub-micron\ndroplets is much smaller than that from jetting. A comprehensive global\nprobability distribution function (PDF) for SSA is constructed by rigorously\nmodeling its fundamental components in sequence: (i) refining the sub-surface\nbubble size distribution with a simpler and better experimentally supported\nexponential law, and (ii) deriving consistent number and size distribution\nmodels of droplets per bursting event from an ample set of high-resolution\nnumerical simulations. The droplet size PDF from a single bubble follows a\nhighly-skewed distribution -- optimally modeled by a Generalized Inverse\nGaussian distribution -- revealing the production of nanometric droplets\npreviously unaccounted for by simpler models. When integrated, these components\nyield a final predictive model for the global SSA size distribution, with\nparameters derived directly from physical principles and simulations rather\nthan empirical fitting.

As a case study, we take up the problem of\nagile tracking of an end-effector for a quadrotor with a fixed arm. We develop\na set of best practices for synthesizing the best-in-class RL and geometric\ncontrollers (GC) for benchmarking.

The resulting findings are the\nfollowing: our improvements to the experimental protocol for comparing learned\nand classical controllers are critical, and each of the above asymmetries can\nyield misleading conclusions. Prior works have claimed that RL outperforms GC,\nbut we find the gaps between the two controller classes are much smaller than\npreviously published when accounting for symmetric comparisons. Geometric\ncontrol achieves lower steady-state error than RL, while RL has better\ntransient performance, resulting in GC performing better in relatively slow or\nless agile tasks, but RL performing better when greater agility is required.\nFinally, we open-source implementations of geometric and RL controllers for\nthese aerial vehicles, implementing best practices for future development.\nWebsite and code is available at https://pratikkunapuli.github.io/rl-vs-gc/",

However, all but\na few of these approaches rely on the implicit assumption that anomalies\nmanifest as noisy, high-complexity outliers from some normal baseline. This\nwork challenges this assumption by investigating if a best-in-class detection\nmodel built on this assumption can effectively deal with real-world security\nevents' diverse signatures. We employ an LSTM-based autoencoder, a classical\nexample of a reconstruction-based anomaly detector, as our test vehicle. We\nthen contrast this model with a representative sampling of historical BGP\nanomalies, including the Slammer worm and the Moscow blackout, and with a\nsimulated 'BGP storm' designed as a positive control. Our experience unveils a\nblind spot of our model: the model easily identifies the synthetic anomaly of\nhigh complexity but invariably fails to identify real-world events that\nmanifest in the form of a \"signal loss\" (e.g., Slammer, Moscow Blackout) or\n\"low-deviation\" (e.g., WannaCry) signature. We demonstrate that the model\nmistakenly recognizes the abrupt cut-off of BGP updates during catastrophic\nfailures as a signal of extreme stability, leading to reconstruction errors of\nvirtually zero and total failure to detect. We conclude that the\ncharacterization of BGP anomalies as high-reconstruction-error events alone is\na weak and dangerous oversimplification.

Existing LLM-based tools and coding agents\nrespond to every issue and generate a patch for every case, even when the input\nis vague or their own output is incorrect. There are no mechanisms in place to\nabstain when confidence is low. This leads to unreliable behaviour, such as\nhallucinated code changes or responses based on vague issue reports. We\nintroduce BouncerBench, a benchmark that evaluates whether LLM-based software\nagents can refuse to act when inputs are ill-defined or refuse to respond when\ntheir own outputs are likely to be incorrect. Unlike prior benchmarks that\nimplicitly incentivize models to generate responses even when uncertain,\nBouncerBench aims to improve precision by targeting two overlooked failure\npoints: (1) vague or underspecified issue descriptions in tickets and (2)\nlogically or functionally incorrect code patches created by the system. It\nmeasures whether proposed systems can distinguish actionable issues from vague\ntickets and valid patches from untrustworthy ones. We also implement a basic\ninput and output bouncer, evaluating how well current LLMs can abstain when\nneeded. Our results show that most models fail to abstain from underspecified\ninputs or incorrect outputs. Hence, we conclude that there is significant room\nfor improvement before LLMs can be trusted to make correct decisions and\nrecommendations in real-world software engineering workflows.

Building on these insights, we\nintroduce RoboMonkey, a test-time scaling framework for VLAs.

Through\nextensive simulated and hardware experiments, we show that pairing existing\nVLAs with RoboMonkey yields significant performance gains, achieving a 25%\nabsolute improvement on out-of-distribution tasks and 9% on in-distribution\ntasks.

A key observation is that \"flat\" minima tend to\ngeneralize better than \"sharp\" minima. While this idea is supported by\nempirical evidence, it has also been shown that deep networks can generalize\neven with arbitrary sharpness, as measured by either the trace or the spectral\nnorm of the Hessian. In this paper, we argue that generalization could be\nassessed by measuring flatness using a soft rank measure of the Hessian. We\nshow that when the common neural network model (neural network with exponential\nfamily negative log likelihood loss) is calibrated, and its prediction error\nand its confidence in the prediction are not correlated with the first and the\nsecond derivatives of the network's output, our measure accurately captures the\nasymptotic expected generalization gap. For non-calibrated models, we connect\nour flatness measure to the well-known Takeuchi Information Criterion and show\nthat it still provides reliable estimates of generalization gaps for models\nthat are not overly confident. Experimental results indicate that our approach\noffers a robust estimate of the generalization gap compared to baselines.",

While clients only share model updates with the aggregator,\nstudies reveal that aggregators can infer sensitive information from these\nupdates. Secure Aggregation (SA) protects individual updates during\ntransmission; however, recent work demonstrates a critical vulnerability where\nadversarial aggregators manipulate client selection to bypass SA protections,\nconstituting a Biased Selection Attack (BSA). Although verifiable random\nselection prevents BSA, it precludes informed client selection essential for FL\nperformance. We propose Adversarial Robust Federated Learning (AdRo-FL), which\nsimultaneously enables: informed client selection based on client utility, and\nrobust defense against BSA maintaining privacy-preserving aggregation. AdRo-FL\nimplements two client selection frameworks tailored for distinct settings. The\nfirst framework assumes clients are grouped into clusters based on mutual\ntrust, such as different branches of an organization. The second framework\nhandles distributed clients where no trust relationships exist between them.\nFor the cluster-oriented setting, we propose a novel defense against BSA by (1)\nenforcing a minimum client selection quota from each cluster, supervised by a\ncluster-head in every round, and (2) introducing a client utility function to\nprioritize efficient clients. For the distributed setting, we design a\ntwo-phase selection protocol: first, the aggregator selects the top clients\nbased on our utility-driven ranking; then, a verifiable random function (VRF)\nensures a BSA-resistant final selection. AdRo-FL also applies quantization to\nreduce communication overhead and sets strict transmission deadlines to improve\nenergy efficiency. AdRo-FL achieves up to $1.85\\times$ faster time-to-accuracy\nand up to $1.06\\times$ higher final accuracy compared to insecure baselines.",

Motivated by a recent\ndiscovery that certain wireless network settings benefit significantly from\nnon-signaling (NS) correlations, various generalizations are considered. First,\nit is shown that for a point to point discrete memoryless channel with a\nnon-causal channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the NS-assisted\nShannon capacity matches the classical (without NS assistance) capacity of the\nchannel for the setting where the state is also made available to the receiver.\nThe key insight is summarized as 'virtual teleportation of CSIT via\nNS-assistance' and is supported by further results as follows. For a discrete\nmemoryless 2-user broadcast channel (BC), the Shannon capacity region with\nNS-assistance available only between the transmitter and User 1, is found next.\nConsistent with the aforementioned key insight, the result matches the\nclassical capacity region for the setting where the desired message of User 2\nis made available in advance as side-information to User 1. The latter capacity\nregion is known from a result of Kramer and Shamai. Next, for a\nsemi-deterministic BC, the Shannon capacity region with full (tripartite)\nNS-assistance is shown to be the same as if only bipartite NS-assistance was\navailable between the transmitter and the non-deterministic user. Bipartite\nNS-assistance between the transmitter and only the deterministic user, does not\nimprove the capacity region relative to the corresponding classical setting.\nFinally, the analysis is extended to a K-user BC with full NS-assistance among\nall parties.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the energy growth and dissipation of wind-forced breaking\nwaves using direct numerical simulations of the coupled air-water Navier-Stokes\nequations. We vary the wind friction velocity over the wave speed $u_\\ast/c$ up\nto 1. A turbulent wind boundary layer drives the growth of a pre-existing\nnarrowband wave field until it breaks and transfers energy into the water\ncolumn. Under sustained wind forcing, the wave field then resumes growth. We\nseparately analyze energy transfers during wave growth and breaking-induced\ndissipation. Energy transfers are dominated by pressure input during growth and\nturbulent dissipation during breaking. The wave growth rate scales with\n$(u_\\ast/c)^2$, modulated by the wave steepness due to sheltering. The energy\ndissipation follows the inertial scaling with wave slope at breaking,\nconfirming the universality of the process. Following breaking, near-surface\nvertical turbulence dissipation profiles scale as $z^{-1}$, with its magnitude\ncontrolled by the breaking-induced dissipation.",

Lattice\nmodels, such as the Ising, Potts, cluster expansion, and magnetic cluster\nexpansion models, are powerful tools for studying complex magnetic alloys and\ncompounds. In this paper we introduce CLAMM, which is a new open source toolkit\nfor developing custom lattice models from density functional theory (DFT) data\nsets. The toolkit is comprised of three main components. The first component is\nCLAMM_Prep, a python tool that converts data sets consisting of the Vienna\nAb-initio Simulation Package (VASP) DFT simulations into a compact format. The\nsecond component, CLAMM_Fit, is also python-based and uses the compact data set\nto parameterize a lattice model, chosen from a set of available options\n(cluster expansion, Ising, and others). The third component is CLAMM_MC, which\nis a C++ Monte Carlo solver for generating ensembles of configurations,\naccounting for both magnetic and alloy configurational entropies, at different\ntemperatures. These ensembles and their analysis can be used for simulating\nphase transformations and constructing phase diagrams. The code can also be\nused for generating special quasi-random structures and structures with\nuser-defined short-range order. This document provides a comprehensive overview\nof each CLAMM tool in order to demonstrate CLAMM's potential for the\ncomputational materials community.",

One\ndecomposition of a general unitary matrix can be expressed as the product of an\nexponential of a diagonal matrix and an exponential of an off-diagonal matrix.\nThis decomposition is relevant for controlling superconducting qutrits using\nfixed-frequency resonant control pulses. This decomposition is numerically\nconfirmed to allow the parameterization of any element in U(3). It is shown\nthat a simple setting of parameter ranges of parameters can easily lead to an\nover-parameterization, in the sense that several different sets of values for\nthe parameters produce the same element in U(3). This fact is demonstrated\nusing the Walsh-Hadamard (WH) matrix as an example, which is also a special\nqutrit gate of practical interest. The different decompositions are shown to be\nrelated, and the relationships between them are presented using general\nmethods. The shortest path needed for the implementation of a qutrit gate is\nfound.

    "abstract": "Latent stochastic differential equation (SDE) models are important tools for\nthe unsupervised discovery of dynamical systems from data, with applications\nranging from engineering to neuroscience. In these complex domains, exact\nposterior inference of the latent state path is typically intractable,\nmotivating the use of approximate methods such as variational inference (VI).\nHowever, existing VI methods for inference in latent SDEs often suffer from\nslow convergence and numerical instability. Here, we propose SDE Inference via\nNatural Gradients (SING), a method that leverages natural gradient VI to\nefficiently exploit the underlying geometry of the model and variational\nposterior. SING enables fast and reliable inference in latent SDE models by\napproximating intractable integrals and parallelizing computations in time. We\nprovide theoretical guarantees that SING will approximately optimize the\nintractable, continuous-time objective of interest. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat better state inference enables more accurate estimation of nonlinear drift\nfunctions using, for example, Gaussian process SDE models. SING outperforms\nprior methods in state inference and drift estimation on a variety of datasets,\nincluding a challenging application to modeling neural dynamics in freely\nbehaving animals. Altogether, our results illustrate the potential of SING as a\ntool for accurate inference in complex dynamical systems, especially those\ncharacterized by limited prior knowledge and non-conjugate structure.",

    "abstract": "Hardware security primitives including True Random Number Generators (TRNG)\nand Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are central components to establishing\na root of trust in microelectronic systems. In this paper, we propose a unified\nPUF-TRNG architecture that leverages a combination of the static entropy\navailable in a strong PUF called the shift-register, reconvergent-fanout (SiRF)\nPUF, and the dynamic entropy associated with random noise present in path delay\nmeasurements. The SiRF PUF uses an engineered netlist containing a large number\nof paths as the source of static entropy, and a time-to-digital-converter (TDC)\nas a high-resolution, embedded instrument for measuring path delays, where\nmeasurement noise serves as the source of dynamic entropy. A novel data\npostprocessing algorithm is proposed based on a modified duplex sponge\nconstruction. The sponge function operates on soft data, i.e., fixed point data\nvalues, to add entropy to the ensuing random bit sequences and to increase the\nbit generation rate. A postprocessing algorithm for reproducing PUF-generated\nencryption keys is also used in the TRNG to protect against temperature voltage\nattacks designed to subvert the random characteristics in the bit sequences.\nThe unified PUF-TRNG architecture is implemented across multiple instances of a\nZYBO Z7-10 FPGA board and extensively tested with NIST SP 800-22, NIST SP\n800-90B, AIS-31, and DieHarder test suites.

Most existing bias mitigation\nmethods attempt to eliminate the correlation between sensitive attributes and\ndiagnostic prediction, but those methods often degrade performance due to the\nlost of clinically relevant diagnostic cues. In this work, we propose an\nalternative approach that incorporates sensitive attributes to achieve\nfairness. We introduce FairMoE, a framework that employs layer-wise\nmixture-of-experts modules to serve as group-specific learners. Unlike\ntraditional methods that rigidly assign data based on group labels, FairMoE\ndynamically routes data to the most suitable expert, making it particularly\neffective for handling cases near group boundaries. Experimental results show\nthat, unlike previous fairness approaches that reduce performance, FairMoE\nachieves substantial accuracy improvements while preserving comparable fairness\nmetrics.",

    "abstract": "We revisit the problem of a two dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model\non a square lattice to first minutely analyze its spectra including zero energy\nstates (ZES) and in-gap states both under periodic and open boundaries.\nThereafter, a series of antiphase domain walls (DW), distributed along two\northogonal lines, are introduced in the lattice with SSH like hoppings and this\ncauses the ZES to localize not only at the corners but also at the intersection\nof the lines of domain walls. In-gap states not only populate at the edges but\nalso show finite amplitudes along the DW lines. A different scenario appears\nfor a radially symmetric distribution of domain walls along a circle around a\npoit within the lattice. It produces in-gap states localized at the center of\nthe DW circle while the ZES show localizations around it in a symmetric fashion\nin the square lattice. We also probe the effect of a diagonal quasiperiodic\ndisorder on the spectra and eigen-states of the 2D SSH model. This gives\nlocalization of the states more with a stronger disorder. We calculate\nparticipation ratios of the states and their averages to demonstrate how such\nlocalization develops with disorder. Lastly we also elaborate further on the\neigenvalue and eigenstates of a few periodically hopping modulated cases,\npreviously outlined briefly in the article: Jour. Phys. Cond.-Mat.{\\bf 36},\n065301 (2024) and also give an account of the changed features of the spectra\nas a result of the application of DWs there. Our findings on these various\nfronts can increase many-fold the visibility of this popular model and the\noutcomes can be utilized in many emerging fields like topological quantum\ninformation processing, for example, by designing topological shielding of\nvarious kinds.",

    "abstract": "Most atomic nuclei exhibit ellipsoidal shapes characterized by quadrupole\ndeformation $\\beta_2$ and triaxiality $\\gamma$, and sometimes even a pear-like\noctupole deformation $\\beta_3$. The STAR experiment introduced a new\n\"imaging-by-smashing\" technique [arXiv:2401.06625, arXiv:2501.16071] to image\nthe nuclear global shape by colliding nuclei at ultra-relativistic speeds and\nanalyzing outgoing debris. Features of nuclear shape manifest in collective\nobservables like anisotropic flow $v_n$ and radial flow via mean transverse\nmomentum $[p_T]$. We present new measurements of the variances of $v_n$ ($n=2$,\n3, and 4) and $[p_T]$, and the covariance of $v_n^2$ with $[p_T]$, in\ncollisions of highly deformed $^{238}$U and nearly spherical $^{197}$Au.

Measurements of $v_3$ and its\ncorrelation with $[p_T]$ also provide the first experimental suggestion of a\npossible octupole deformation for $^{238}$U.

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative to\nreducing reliance on manual judgments, particularly in complex domains like\nmedical case-based retrieval, where relevance assessment requires analyzing\nboth textual and visual information. In this work, we explore using a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to expand relevance judgments, creating\na new dataset of automated judgments.

We\nsystematically experimented with various prompt configurations to maximize\nagreement with human judgments.

This data limitation hinders the use of large models, as\noverfitting becomes a major concern. As a result, physics applications\ntypically rely on small models, which struggle with long-range prediction due\nto limited context understanding. Additionally, unlike images, videos, or\ntext-which typically exhibit fixed granularity-physics datasets often vary\ndrastically in scale, amplifying the challenges of scaling up multitask\ntraining. We introduce PhysiX, the first large-scale foundation model for\nphysics simulation. PhysiX is a 4.5B parameter autoregressive generative model.\nIt uses a discrete tokenizer to encode physical processes at different scales\ninto a sequence of discrete tokens, and employs an autoregressive next-token\nprediction objective to model such processes in the token space. To mitigate\nthe rounding error in the discretization process, PhysiX incorporates a\nspecialized refinement module. Through extensive experiments, we show that\nPhysiX effectively addresses the data bottleneck, outperforming task-specific\nbaselines under comparable settings as well as the previous absolute\nstate-of-the-art approaches on The Well benchmark. Our results indicate that\nknowledge learned from natural videos can be successfully transferred to\nphysics simulation, and that joint training across diverse simulation tasks\nenables synergistic learning.",

In this work, we propose \\textbf{LoLA-SpecViT}(Low-rank adaptation\nLocal Attention Spectral Vision Transformer), a lightweight spectral vision\ntransformer that addresses these limitations through a parameter-efficient\narchitecture tailored to the unique characteristics of hyperspectral imagery.\nOur model combines a 3D convolutional spectral front-end with local\nwindow-based self-attention, enhancing both spectral feature extraction and\nspatial consistency while reducing computational complexity. To further improve\nadaptability, we integrate low-rank adaptation (LoRA) into attention and\nprojection layers, enabling fine-tuning with over 80\\% fewer trainable\nparameters. A novel cyclical learning rate scheduler modulates LoRA adaptation\nstrength during training, improving convergence and generalisation.

As far as the\ngravitational theory is concerned, we assume Einstein's gravity in four\ndimensions with a vanishing cosmological constant. Regarding matter content, we\nconsider a state-of-matter to a linear form of equation-of-state (EoS), while\nfor dark matter we assume a quartic scalar potential, which implies a certain\nnon-linear EoS obtained long time ago. Adopting the two-fluid formalism we\nintegrate the structure equations as well as the Riccati equation for the\nmetric even perturbations imposing appropriate initial conditions at the center\nof the stars and matching conditions at their surface. We compute the stellar\nmass and radius, factor of compactness and dimensionless deformability varying\nseveral free parameters of the model studied here. Tidal deformability and the\ncorresponding tidal Love number determine the imprint of the underlying EoS\nwithin the signals emitted during binary coalescences, and it is expected to be\naltered due to the presence of dark matter inside the objects. We find that in\nall cases considered here, the dimensionless deformability of the canonical\nstellar mass remains lower than the upper bound, $\\Lambda_{1.4} < 800$. We also\nlook at the stability of these stars based on the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov\ncriterion under various conditions.

    "abstract": "Classical variational Hodge structure theory characterizes the algebraicity\nof Hodge classes by studying the transversality of period mappings under\ngeometric deformations. However, when algebraic varieties lack appropriate\ndeformation families, this method faces applicability limitations. This paper\ndevelops a non-constructive method based on exceptional Lie group constraints\nto handle such cases. Our main technical contribution is establishing a\ndimension control mechanism for Spencer cohomology theory under Lie group\nconstraints. Specifically, we prove that when a compact K\\\"ahler manifold $X$\nis equipped with $E_7$ group constraints, the corresponding Spencer kernel\n$\\mathcal{K}_\\lambda^{1,1}$ has complex dimension simultaneously constrained by\ntwo bounds: representation theory gives the lower bound\n$\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{K}_\\lambda^{1,1} \\geq 56$, while the degenerate\nSpencer-de Rham mapping gives the upper bound\n$\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{K}_\\lambda^{1,1} \\leq h^{1,1}(X)$. For 5-dimensional\nCalabi-Yau manifolds satisfying $h^{1,1}(X) = 56$, this dimension constraint\nbecomes the equality $\\dim_{\\mathbb{C}}\\mathcal{K}_\\lambda^{1,1} = 56 =\nh^{1,1}(X)$. Combined with our established Spencer-calibration equivalence\nprinciple, this dimension matching result is sufficient to verify the\n$(1,1)$-type Hodge conjecture. Our proof completely avoids explicit algebraic\ncycle construction, instead achieving the goal through abstract dimensional\narguments. This method demonstrates the application potential of Lie group\nrepresentation theory in algebraic geometry, providing new theoretical tools\nfor handling geometric objects where traditional deformation methods are not\napplicable.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary Language Models (LMs), while impressively fluent, often generate\ncontent that is factually incorrect or unfaithful to the input context - a\ncritical issue commonly referred to as 'hallucination'. This tendency of LMs to\ngenerate hallucinated content undermines their reliability, especially because\nthese fabrications are often highly convincing and therefore difficult to\ndetect. While several existing methods attempt to detect hallucinations, most\nrely on analyzing multiple generations per input, leading to increased\ncomputational cost and latency. To address this, we propose a single-pass,\ntraining-free approach for effective Hallucination detectIon via Decoupled\nrEpresentations (HIDE). Our approach leverages the hypothesis that\nhallucinations result from a statistical decoupling between an LM's internal\nrepresentations of input context and its generated output. We quantify this\ndecoupling using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) applied to\nhidden-state representations extracted while generating the output sequence. We\nconduct extensive experiments on four diverse question answering datasets,\nevaluating both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations across six\nopen-source LMs of varying scales and properties. Our results demonstrate that\nHIDE outperforms other single-pass methods in almost all settings, achieving an\naverage relative improvement of ~29% in AUC-ROC over the best-performing\nsingle-pass strategy across various models and datasets. Additionally, HIDE\nshows competitive and often superior performance with multi-pass\nstate-of-the-art methods, obtaining an average relative improvement of ~3% in\nAUC-ROC while consuming ~51% less computation time.

This paper aims at\nunderstanding the curse of dimensionality in Bayesian model updating, and thus\nproposing feasible strategies to overcome it. An analytical investigation is\nconducted, which allows us to answer fundamental questions in Bayesian\nanalysis, e.g., where the posterior mass locates and how large of it comparing\nto the prior volume. The key concept here is the distance from the prior to the\nposterior, which makes the parameter estimation really difficult in\nhigh-dimension problems. In this sense, not only the dimensionality matters,\nbut also the multi-modality, the pronounced degeneracy, and other factors that\ninfluence the prior-posterior distance matter.",

    "abstract": "In inland waterways, the efficient management of water lock operations\nimpacts the level of congestion and the resulting uncertainty in inland\nwaterway transportation. To achieve reliable and efficient traffic, schedules\nshould be easy to understand and implement, reducing the likelihood of errors.\nThe simplest schedules follow periodic patterns, reducing complexity and\nfacilitating predictable management. Since vessels do not arrive in perfectly\nregular intervals, periodic schedules may lead to more wait time. The aim of\nthis research is to estimate this cost by evaluating how effective these\nperiodic schedules manage vessel traffic at water locks. The first objective is\nto estimate a periodic arrival pattern that closely matches a dataset of\nirregular vessel arrivals at a specific lock. We develop an algorithm that,\ngiven a fixed number of vessel streams, solves the problem in polynomial time.\nThe solution then serves as input for the subsequent part, where we consider\nalgorithms that compute operational schedules by formulating an optimisation\nproblem with periodic arrival patterns as input, and the goal is to determine a\nperiodic schedule that minimises the long-run average waiting time of vessels.\nWe present a polynomial-time algorithm for the two-stream case and a\npseudo-polynomial-time algorithm for the general case, along with incremental\npolynomial-time approximation schemes. In our numerical experiments, use AIS\ndata to construct a periodic arrival pattern closely matching the observed\ndata. Our experiments demonstrate that when evaluated against actual data,\nintuitive and straightforward policies often outperform optimal policies\nspecifically trained on the periodic arrival pattern.",

    "abstract": "Multi-condition fault diagnosis is prevalent in industrial systems and\npresents substantial challenges for conventional diagnostic approaches. The\ndiscrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions\ndegrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied\nto others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has\nbeen introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing\nmulti-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization\napproaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault\nfeatures. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific\nmulti-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect\nfault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the\nextent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely\nstudied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact\non fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the\nmodel to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall\ngeneralization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing\nend-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically\nin variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a\nreal-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed,\naiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant\noperating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with\na retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant\nfault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the\nsource domain. Several experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset are\nconducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsic responses are of paramount importance in physics research, as they\nrepresent the inherent properties of materials, independent of extrinsic\nfactors that vary from sample to sample, and often reveal the intriguing\nquantum geometry of the band structure. Here, we report the experimental\ndiscovery of a new intrinsic response in charge transport, specifically the\nintrinsic nonlinear planar Hall effect (NPHE), in the topological semimetal\nTaIrTe$_4$. This effect is characterized by an induced Hall current that is\nquadratic in the driving electric field and linear in the in-plane magnetic\nfield. The response coefficient is determined by the susceptibility tensor of\nBerry-connection polarizability dipole, which is an intrinsic band geometric\nquantity. Remarkably, the signal persists up to room temperature. Our\ntheoretical calculations show excellent agreement with the experimental results\nand further elucidate the significance of a previously unknown orbital\nmechanism in intrinsic NPHE. This finding not only establishes a novel\nintrinsic material property but also opens a new route toward innovative\nnonlinear devices capable of operating at room temperature.",

Such an understanding within evolutionary\ngame theory so far has been sought by appealing to bounded rationality. Here,\nwe present a perceptual rationality framework in the context of group\ncooperative interactions, where individuals make rational decisions based on\ntheir evolvable perception of the environment. We show that a simple public\ngoods game accounts for power law distributed perceptual diversity.\nIncorporating the evolution of social information use into the framework\nreveals that rational decision-making is a natural root of the evolution of\nconsistent personality differences and power-law distributed behavioral\ndiversity. The behavioral diversity, core to the perceptual rationality\napproach, can lead to ever-shifting polymorphism or cyclic dynamics, through\nwhich different rational personality types coexist and engage in mutualistic,\ncomplementary, or competitive and exploitative relationships. This polymorphism\ncan lead to non-monotonic evolution as external environmental conditions\nchange. The framework provides predictions consistent with some large-scale\neco-evolutionary patterns and illustrates how the evolution of social structure\ncan modify large-scale eco-evolutionary patterns. Furthermore, consistent with\nmost empirical evidence and in contrast to most theoretical predictions, our\nwork suggests diversity is often detrimental to public good provision,\nespecially in strong social dilemmas.",

However, automated segmentation\nremains challenging due to factors such as complex organ morphologies and\nconfusing context. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Pattern\nDivide-and-Conquer Network (PDC-Net) for PRI segmentation. The core idea is to\nuse different network modules to \"divide\" various local and global patterns\nand, through flexible feature selection, to \"conquer\" the Regions of Interest\n(ROI) during the decoding phase. Specifically, considering that our ROI often\nmanifests as strip-like or circular-like structures in MR slices, we introduce\na Multi-Direction Aggregation (MDA) module. This module enhances the model's\nability to fit the shape of the organ by applying strip convolutions in four\ndistinct directions. Additionally, to mitigate the challenge of confusing\ncontext, we propose a Memory-Guided Context (MGC) module. This module\nexplicitly maintains a memory parameter to track cross-image patterns at the\ndataset level, thereby enhancing the distinction between global patterns\nassociated with the positive and negative classes. Finally, we design an\nAdaptive Fusion Decoder (AFD) that dynamically selects features from different\npatterns based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, ultimately generating\nthe final segmentation results.

Recent\nmethods commonly utilize a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to\nsynthesize new content of previously unseen regions along camera movement.\nHowever, the underlying 2D diffusion model lacks 3D awareness and results in\ndistorted artifacts. Moreover, they are limited to generating views of static\n3D scenes, neglecting to capture object movements within the dynamic 4D world.\nTo alleviate these issues, we present DreamJourney, a two-stage framework that\nleverages the world simulation capacity of video diffusion models to trigger a\nnew perpetual scene view generation task with both camera movements and object\ndynamics. Specifically, in stage I, DreamJourney first lifts the input image to\n3D point cloud and renders a sequence of partial images from a specific camera\ntrajectory. A video diffusion model is then utilized as generative prior to\ncomplete the missing regions and enhance visual coherence across the sequence,\nproducing a cross-view consistent video adheres to the 3D scene and camera\ntrajectory. Meanwhile, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies (early\nstopping and view padding) to further stabilize the generation process and\nimprove visual quality. Next, in stage II, DreamJourney leverages a multimodal\nlarge language model to produce a text prompt describing object movements in\ncurrent view, and uses video diffusion model to animate current view with\nobject movements. Stage I and II are repeated recurrently, enabling perpetual\ndynamic scene view generation.

To fill this gap, we propose Action\nSemantics Learning (ASL), a novel learning framework, where the learning\nobjective is capturing the semantics of the ground truth actions.

To\nsupport the effectiveness of ASL, we theoretically demonstrate the superior\nrobustness of ASL for the OOD problem compared with the existing syntax\nlearning paradigm.

    "abstract": "We present a spatiotemporal gain-loss framework for selective acoustic mode\namplification illustrated using coupled Helmholtz resonators. In our scheme,\nthe gain or loss in each resonator is determined by the amplitude in adjacent\ncavities, forming a non-Hermitian yet energy-conserving system. Our scheme\nenables the system to collapse toward the eigenstate of an effective linear\nHamiltonian with the eigenvalue of largest imaginary part, serving as a\nfixed-point attractor. In dimer systems, we identify exceptional points that\nseparate oscillatory and convergent regimes, allowing controllable switching\nbetween mode collapsing and Rabi-type oscillation. By modulating the gain-loss\nprofile over time, we achieve programmable transitions between eigenmodes, with\nstrategically introduced symmetry-breaking perturbations accelerating\nconvergence. Full-wave simulations validate our approach and highlight its\npotential for acoustic switching, signal processing, and analog computation.\nOur results establish a new paradigm for sustainable wave control by bridging\nnon-Hermitian physics and time-varying physics in resonant metamaterials.",

Inferring their rheological properties remains a major challenge,\nparticularly when traditional rheometry fails to capture their complex,\nthree-dimensional, and often heterogeneous behavior. This difficulty is\nexacerbated by system size, boundary conditions, and other material-specific\nphysical, chemical, or thermal constraints. In this work, we explore whether\nrheological laws can be inferred directly from flow observations. We propose a\nphysics-informed neural network (PINN) framework designed to learn constitutive\nviscoplastic laws from velocity field data alone. Our method uses a neural\nnetwork to interpolate the velocity field, enabling the computation of velocity\ngradients via automatic differentiation. These gradients are used to estimate\nthe residuals of the governing conservation laws, which implicitly depend on\nthe unknown rheology. We jointly optimize both the constitutive model and the\nvelocity field representation by minimizing the physical residuals and\ndiscrepancies from observed data. We validate our approach on synthetic\nvelocity fields generated from numerical simulations using Herschel-Bulkley,\nCarreau and Panastasiou models under various flow conditions. The algorithm\nreliably infers rheological parameters, even in the presence of significant\nnoise. We analyze the dependence of inference performance on flow geometry and\nsampling, highlighting the importance of shear rate distribution in the\ndataset. Finally, we explore preliminary strategies for model-agnostic\ninference via embedded model selection, demonstrating the potential of PINNs\nfor identifying the most suitable rheological law from candidate models.",

    "abstract": "Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising solution for\ndecomposing large language model representations into interpretable features.\nHowever, Paulo and Belrose (2025) have highlighted instability across different\ninitialization seeds, and Heap et al. (2025) have pointed out that SAEs may not\ncapture model-internal features. These problems likely stem from training SAEs\non external datasets - either collected from the Web or generated by another\nmodel - which may contain out-of-distribution (OOD) data beyond the model's\ngeneralisation capabilities. This can result in hallucinated SAE features,\nwhich we term \"Fake Features\", that misrepresent the model's internal\nactivations. To address these issues, we propose FaithfulSAE, a method that\ntrains SAEs on the model's own synthetic dataset. Using FaithfulSAEs, we\ndemonstrate that training SAEs on less-OOD instruction datasets results in SAEs\nbeing more stable across seeds. Notably, FaithfulSAEs outperform SAEs trained\non web-based datasets in the SAE probing task and exhibit a lower Fake Feature\nRatio in 5 out of 7 models. Overall, our approach eliminates the dependency on\nexternal datasets, advancing interpretability by better capturing\nmodel-internal features while highlighting the often neglected importance of\nSAE training datasets.",

    "abstract": "In ride-hailing systems, drivers decide whether to accept or reject ride\nrequests based on factors such as order characteristics, traffic conditions,\nand personal preferences. Accurately predicting these decisions is essential\nfor improving the efficiency and reliability of these systems. Traditional\nmodels, such as the Random Utility Maximization (RUM) approach, typically\npredict drivers' decisions by assuming linear correlations among attributes.\nHowever, these models often fall short because they fail to account for\nnon-linear interactions between attributes and do not cater to the unique,\npersonalized preferences of individual drivers. In this paper, we develop a\nmethod for learning personalized utility functions using hypernetwork and\nensemble learning. Hypernetworks dynamically generate weights for a linear\nutility function based on trip request data and driver profiles, capturing the\nnon-linear relationships. An ensemble of hypernetworks trained on different\ndata segments further improve model adaptability and generalization by\nintroducing controlled randomness, thereby reducing over-fitting. We validate\nthe performance of our ensemble hypernetworks model in terms of prediction\naccuracy and uncertainty estimation in a real-world dataset. The results\ndemonstrate that our approach not only accurately predicts each driver's\nutility but also effectively balances the needs for explainability and\nuncertainty quantification.

    "abstract": "Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong\nperformance across many natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, their\nquadratic computational and memory requirements, particularly in self-attention\nlayers, pose challenges for efficient inference on long contexts and for\ndeployment in resource-limited environments. We present TPTT (Transforming\nPretrained Transformers into Titans), a framework designed to augment\npretrained Transformers with linearized attention (LiZA) and internal memory\ngating via Memory as Gate (MaG), applied without full retraining. TPTT supports\nparameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) and integrates with standard toolkits\nsuch as Hugging Face Transformers. We evaluated TPTT on several pretrained\nmodels, including Llama-1B, OlMoE-1B-7B, Qwen2.5-1.5B, Gemma3-270m,\nOpenELM-1.3B, and Mistral-7B, in order to assess applicability across\narchitectures of different scales. Experiments on models with approximately 1\nbillion parameters, evaluated primarily on the MMLU benchmark, suggest\npotential improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline\nmodels. For example, Titans-Llama-1B exhibited up to a 20\\% relative increase\nin Exact Match scores in one-shot evaluation. An additional finding is that it\nis possible to convert a quadratic-attention model into a purely\nlinear-attention model using the DeltaProduct mechanism. All training runs were\ncarried out with modest computational resources. These preliminary findings\nindicate that TPTT may help adapt pretrained LLMs for long-context tasks with\nlimited overhead. Further studies on larger models and a broader set of\nbenchmarks will be necessary to evaluate the generality and robustness of the\nframework.

We study the problem of adaptive multi-LLM selection in an online\nsetting, where the learner interacts with users through multi-step query\nrefinement and must choose LLMs sequentially without access to offline datasets\nor model internals. A key challenge arises from unstructured context evolution:\nthe prompt dynamically changes in response to previous model outputs via a\nblack-box process, which cannot be simulated, modeled, or learned. To address\nthis, we propose the first contextual bandit framework for sequential LLM\nselection under unstructured prompt dynamics. We formalize a notion of myopic\nregret and develop a LinUCB-based algorithm that provably achieves sublinear\nregret without relying on future context prediction. We further introduce\nbudget-aware and positionally-aware (favoring early-stage satisfaction)\nextensions to accommodate variable query costs and user preferences for early\nhigh-quality responses. Our algorithms are theoretically grounded and require\nno offline fine-tuning or dataset-specific training.

We use archival data from $Chandra$\nobservations to extract the diffuse X-ray emission from 23 nearby star-forming\ngalaxies and study its correlation with star formation activity in the central\nregion of these galaxies. The surface brightness profile of each galaxy\npresents a sharp decrease in the central region of $\\thicksim$0.3$-$2 kpc and\nthen varies slowly outside this range.

    "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed the proliferation of network function\nvirtualization (NFV) in the telco industry, thanks to its unparalleled\nflexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. However, as the NFV\ninfrastructure is shared by virtual network functions (VNFs), sporadic resource\ncontentions are inevitable. Such contention makes it extremely challenging to\nguarantee the performance of the provisioned network services, especially in\nhigh-speed regimes (e.g., Gigabit Ethernet). Existing solutions typically rely\non direct traffic analysis (e.g., packet- or flow-level measurements) to detect\nperformance degradation and identify bottlenecks, which is not always\napplicable due to significant integration overhead and system-level\nconstraints. This paper complements existing solutions with a lightweight,\nnon-intrusive framework for online performance inference that easily adapts to\ndrift (i.e., a change over time of the actual state of our system). Instead of\ndirect data-plane collection, we reuse hardware features in the underlying NFV\ninfrastructure, introducing negligible interference in the data-plane. Our\nDrift-Resilient and Self-Tuning (DRST) framework can be integrated into\nexisting NFV systems with minimal engineering effort and operate without the\nneed for predefined traffic models or VNF-specific customization. DRST is\ndeployed via a lightweight MLOps pipeline that automates the adaptation under\nruntime drift. We show how DRST can deliver accurate performance inference or\ndiagnose run-time bottlenecks, as demonstrated through a comprehensive\nevaluation across diverse NFV scenarios.",

Converting longitudinal waves to flexural ones is of particular\ninterest in elasticity due to their significant displacement amplitudes,\nfacilitating detection at the surface for practical applications. Typically,\nthe design of wave conversion devices requires (i) the use of locally resonant\nstructures with a spacing much shorter than the associated wavelengths, or (ii)\narchitected media whose effective properties yield efficient mode conversion at\nselected frequencies. In both cases, the realization of these devices may incur\nin fabrication difficulties, thus requiring alternative solutions based on\nsimpler designs that can retain the wave manipulation capabilities of interest.\nIn this paper, we propose the use of single-phase periodically undulated beams\nto design phononic crystals that achieve wave mode conversion between\nlongitudinal and flexural waves. We derive the corresponding dispersion\nrelations using the plane wave expansion method and demonstrate that the\ncoupling between longitudinal and flexural wave modes can be manipulated using\nan undulated profile, generating mode veering with inverted group velocities.\nThe wave conversion mechanism is verified both computationally and\nexperimentally, showing good agreement.

Unlike\nPIELM which randomly initializes the parameters of its hidden layers, RINN\nincorporates a preconditioning stage. In this stage, covariance-driven\nregularization is employed to optimize the orthogonality of the basis functions\ngenerated by the last hidden layer. The key innovation lies in minimizing the\noff-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix derived from the hidden-layer\noutput. By doing so, pairwise orthogonality constraints across collocation\npoints are enforced which effectively enhances both the numerical stability and\nthe approximation ability of the optimized function space.The RINN algorithm\nunfolds in two sequential stages. First, it conducts a non-linear optimization\nprocess to orthogonalize the basis functions. Subsequently, it solves the PDE\nconstraints using linear least-squares method. Extensive numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that RINN significantly reduces performance variability due to\nparameter initialization compared to PIELM. Incorporating an early stopping\nmechanism based on PDE loss further improves stability, ensuring consistently\nhigh accuracy across diverse initialization settings.",

As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing\ninterest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA\nhas organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated\noffense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,\nfrom knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight\nthe importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately\nconstruct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'\nperformance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative\nmeasurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it\nto solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess\nsubstantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this\nknowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback\nfrom the CTF environment.\n  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a\nnovel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent\nintroduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and\ninteractive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge\nand vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results\nshow that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%\nperformance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,\nCTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams.

    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) frameworks have served as fundamental components in DL\nsystems over the last decade. However, bugs in DL frameworks could lead to\ncatastrophic consequences in critical scenarios. A simple yet effective way to\nfind bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing). Existing approaches focus\non test generation, leaving execution results with high semantic value (e.g.,\ncoverage information, bug reports, and exception logs) in the wild, which can\nserve as multiple types of feedback. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to\neffectively utilize the feedback information, which comprises two Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs): analysis LLM and generation LLM. Specifically, analysis\nLLM infers analysis summaries from feedback information, while the generation\nLLM creates tests guided by these summaries. Furthermore, based on multiple\nfeedback guidance, we design two additional components: (i) a feedback-aware\nsimulated annealing algorithm to select operators for test generation,\nenriching test diversity. (ii) a program self-repair strategy to automatically\nrepair invalid tests, enhancing test validity. We evaluate FUEL on the two most\npopular DL frameworks, and experiment results show that FUEL can improve line\ncode coverage of PyTorch and TensorFlow by 9.15% and 14.70% over\nstate-of-the-art baselines (e.g., TitanFuzz and WhiteFox).

To begin with, we reviewed\nexisting methods and observed that many of them mutate DL models (e.g.,\nchanging their parameters) without any customization, ignoring the unique\nchallenges in framework testing. Another issue with these methods is their\nlimited effectiveness, characterized by a high rate of false positives caused\nby illegal mutations arising from the use of generic, non-customized mutation\noperators.

However, we find existing LLM-based methods still have\nshortcomings: (1) the absence of a unified paradigm for textual prompt\nformulation and (2) the neglect of modality discrepancies between textual\nprompts and time series. To address this, we propose LLM-Prompt, an LLM-based\ntime series forecasting framework integrating multi-prompt information and\ncross-modal semantic alignment. Specifically, we first construct a unified\ntextual prompt paradigm containing learnable soft prompts and textualized hard\nprompts. Second, to enhance LLMs' comprehensive understanding of the\nforecasting task, we design a semantic space embedding and cross-modal\nalignment module to achieve cross-modal fusion of temporal and textual\ninformation. Finally, the transformed time series from the LLMs are projected\nto obtain the forecasts. Comprehensive evaluations on 6 public datasets and 3\ncarbon emission datasets demonstrate that LLM-Prompt is a powerful framework\nfor time series forecasting.",

We propose a five-level\nanswer-visibility prompt framework that systematically manipulates answer cues\nand probes model behavior through indirect, behavioral analysis.

Consequently,\ngenerating new datasets through code perturbation has become essential.\nHowever, existing methods often fail to produce complex and diverse variations,\nstruggle with complex cross-file dependencies, and lack support for multiple\nprogramming languages, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing LLM\nevaluations for coding tasks. To fill this gap, we propose CodeMorph, an\napproach designed to support multiple programming languages while preserving\ncross-file dependencies to mitigate data leakage. CodeMorph consists of two\nmain components that work together to enhance the perturbation process. The\nfirst component employs 26 semantic-preserving transformation methods to\niteratively perturb code, generating diverse variations while ensuring that the\nmodified code remains compilable. The second component introduces a genetic\nalgorithm-based selection algorithm, PESO, to identify the more effective\nperturbation method for each iteration by targeting lower similarity scores\nbetween the perturbed and original code, thereby enhancing overall perturbation\neffectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that after applying CodeMorph,\nthe accuracy of the LLM on code completion tasks across five programming\nlanguages decreased by an average of 24.67%, with Python showing the most\nsignificant reduction at 45%. The similarity score of code optimized by PESO\nis, on average, 7.01% lower than that of randomly perturbed code, peaking at a\nreduction of 42.86%.",

This combination leverages\nthe approximation power of randomized neural networks and the parallelism of\ndomain decomposition.

First,\nlocal RRQR factorizations identify and remove redundant basis functions while\npreserving numerically informative ones, reducing problem size, and improving\nconditioning.

We validate our approach on challenging, multi-scale PDE problems in\n1D, 2D, and (2+1)D, demonstrating reductions in condition numbers by up to\neleven orders of magnitude, LSQR convergence speedups by factors of 10-1000,\nand higher accuracy than both unpreconditioned and additive\nSchwarz-preconditioned baselines, all at significantly lower memory and\ncomputational cost.

Efficiently serving\nthese models typically requires distributing them across numerous accelerator\ndevices, which introduces substantial performance overhead from inter-device\ncommunication (collectives). While model quantization has been widely adopted\nto reduce the memory and compute requirements of LLM weights and activations\nwith minimal quality impact, applying quantization directly to collectives like\nAllReduce is inherently difficult due to the inter-device summation involved,\nwhich can lead to numerical instability or significant error accumulation. In\nthis work, we present a native dynamic block-wise efficient quantized AllReduce\nwithin the XLA compiler for TPUs (EQuARX). By using TPU-friendly quantization\nand deep pipelining of communication and compute, EQuARX with int8 precision\nachieves a 1.8X speedup over baseline BF16 AllReduce across various network\ntopologies. Furthermore, EQuARX accelerates the prefill stage of Gemma 3 27B by\n1.25X and Gemma 3 12B by 1.1X, respectively, with small to negligible impact on\nquality.",

We introduce two problems related to the notion of context: (1)\nthe Contextual Pattern Mining (CPM) problem, which given $T$, $(m,l,r)$, and an\ninteger $\\tau>0$, asks for outputting the context of each substring $P$ of\nlength $m$ of $T$, provided that the size of the context of $P$ is at least\n$\\tau$; and (2) the Contextual Pattern Counting (CPC) problem, which asks for\npreprocessing $T$ so that the size of the context of a given query string $P$\nof length $m$ can be found efficiently.\n  For CPM, we propose a linear-work algorithm that either uses only internal\nmemory, or a bounded amount of internal memory and external memory, which\nallows much larger datasets to be handled. For CPC, we propose an\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n)$-space index that can be constructed in\n$\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}n)$ time and answers queries in\n$\\mathcal{O}(m)+\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1)$ time. We further improve the\npractical performance of the CPC index by optimizations that exploit the LZ77\nfactorization of $T$ and an upper bound on the query length. Using\nbillion-letter datasets from different domains, we show that the external\nmemory version of our CPM algorithm can deal with very large datasets using a\nsmall amount of internal memory while its runtime is comparable to that of the\ninternal memory version. Interestingly, we also show that our optimized index\nfor CPC outperforms an approach based on the state of the art for the reporting\nversion of CPC [Navarro, SPIRE 2020] in terms of query time, index size,\nconstruction time, and construction space, often by more than an order of\nmagnitude.",

While Transformer-based models have demonstrated strong\nperformance in modeling the temporal dynamics of dense trajectories of humans\nand vehicles in smart cities, they usually lack access to broader contextual\nknowledge that enhances the forecasting reliability of sparse meteorological\ntrajectories, such as typhoon tracks. To address this challenge, we propose\nTyphoFormer, a novel framework that incorporates natural language descriptions\nas auxiliary prompts to improve typhoon trajectory forecasting. For each time\nstep, we use Large Language Model (LLM) to generate concise textual\ndescriptions based on the numerical attributes recorded in the North Atlantic\nhurricane database. The language descriptions capture high-level meteorological\nsemantics and are embedded as auxiliary special tokens prepended to the\nnumerical time series input. By integrating both textual and sequential\ninformation within a unified Transformer encoder, TyphoFormer enables the model\nto leverage contextual cues that are otherwise inaccessible through numerical\nfeatures alone. Extensive experiments are conducted on HURDAT2 benchmark,\nresults show that TyphoFormer consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods, particularly under challenging scenarios involving nonlinear\npath shifts and limited historical observations.",

The fundamental challenge lies in effectively\ncorrelating microscopic growth fields to the macroscopic shapes and mechanical\nresponses of the ribbon structures. However, existing ribbon or shell models\nstruggle to directly link growth gradients to macroscopic curvature and\ntorsion, necessitating a reduced-dimensional framework. This work establishes a\nunified one-dimensional (1D) morphoelastic ribbon model derived rigorously from\n3D finite elasticity theory via a two-step asymptotic dimension reduction. The\nreduced-order model captures key geometric nonlinearities and finite rotations\nwhile retaining explicit dependence on the growth tensor. We obtain analytical\nsolutions for saddle-bending and twisting configurations induced by specific\ngrowth gradients. Furthermore, numerical continuation, based on the reduced\nmodel, reveals post-buckling transitions into helical morphologies, identifying\nbifurcation thresholds and constructing phase diagrams.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the estimation of fractional delay and Doppler shifts in\nmultipath channels that cause doubly selective fading-an essential task for\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in high-mobility\nenvironments. Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation enables simple\nand robust channel compensation under such conditions. However, fractional\ndelay and Doppler components introduce inter-path interference, degrading\nestimation accuracy. We propose a two-stage estimation method based on Prony's\ntechnique using OTFS pilot signals with M subchannels and N pilot repetitions.\nIn the first stage, Doppler frequencies are estimated by jointly solving M\ncoupled Prony equations, exploiting the periodicity of the pilot signal. In the\nsecond stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform\n(DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage.\nThe proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters\nunder noiseless conditions. In noisy environments, conventional information\ncriteria such as AIC and BIC yield suboptimal performance; thus, a heuristic\nmodel order selection is adopted. Numerical simulations confirm that the\nproposed method achieves high estimation accuracy, highlighting its potential\nfor future ISAC frameworks.",

It is assumed that a conservative system admits an invariant measure\nwith a positive and mildly regular density. Our findings affirm, in particular,\nthat such an invariant measure has strong stochastic stability whenever it is\nphysical, that is, for a large class of small random perturbations, the density\nof this invariant measure is the zero-noise limit in $L^{1}$ of the densities\nof unique stationary measures of corresponding randomly perturbed systems.\nStochastic stability in a stronger sense is obtained under additional\nassumptions.

Prior work often conflates the\ncognitive decision to randomize with the mechanical generation of randomness,\nleading to incomplete evaluations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-sum\ngame inspired by the Tian Ji Horse Race, where the Nash equilibrium corresponds\nto a maximal entropy strategy. The game's complexity masks this property from\nuntrained humans and underdeveloped LLMs. We evaluate five LLMs across prompt\nstyles -- framed, neutral, and hinted -- using competitive multi-tournament\ngameplay with system-provided random choices, isolating the decision to\nrandomize. Results show that weaker models remain deterministic regardless of\nprompts, while stronger models exhibit increased randomization under explicit\nhints. When facing weaker models, strong LLMs adopt deterministic strategies to\nexploit biases, but converge toward equilibrium play when facing peers. Through\nwin/loss outcomes and Bayes factor analysis, we demonstrate meaningful\nvariation in LLMs' strategic reasoning capabilities, highlighting opportunities\nfor improvement in abstract reasoning and adaptive learning.

Our model processes\npseudo-3D T1-weighted MRI scans from three anatomical views and incorporates\nbrain volumetric information. By introducing a stem architecture, we reduce the\nconventional quadratic complexity of transformer models to linear complexity,\nenabling scalability for high-dimensional MRI data.

    "abstract": "The real value of knowledge lies not just in its accumulation, but in its\npotential to be harnessed effectively to conquer the unknown. Although recent\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit impressing multimodal\ncapabilities, they often fail in rarely encountered domain-specific tasks due\nto limited relevant knowledge. To explore this, we adopt visual game cognition\nas a testbed and select Monster Hunter: World as the target to construct a\nmultimodal knowledge graph (MH-MMKG), which incorporates multi-modalities and\nintricate entity relations. We also design a series of challenging queries\nbased on MH-MMKG to evaluate the models' ability for complex knowledge\nretrieval and reasoning. Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent retriever that\nenables a model to autonomously search relevant knowledge without additional\ntraining. Experimental results show that our approach significantly enhances\nthe performance of MLLMs, providing a new perspective on multimodal\nknowledge-augmented reasoning and laying a solid foundation for future\nresearch.",

To address these issues, we\npropose utilizing the Residue Number System (RNS) based distributed quantum\nmultiplication, which executes multiple quantum modulo multiplication circuits\nacross quantum computers or jobs with lower Toffoli depth and T gate usage.\nTowards this end, we propose a design of Quantum Diminished-1 Modulo $(2^n+1)$\nMultiplier, an essential component of RNS based distributed quantum\nmultiplication. We provide estimates of quantum resource usage and compare them\nwith those of an existing non-distributed quantum multiplier for 6 to 16 qubit\nsized output.

In this work, we\nintroduce an architecture-level solution, HalluRNN, which enhances model\nstability through recurrent cross-layer reasoning. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel Dual-Gated Depth Propagation Unit (DG-DPU) module, which is shared across\nlayers and recurrently refines hidden states. This allows for the adaptive\npropagation of information throughout the model, enforces consistency across\nlayers, and mitigates hallucinations caused by representational drift.

In this paper, we offer a new\nproof based on three circles that circumscribe the sides of a right triangle.\nRather than invoke coordinate geometry, the argument relies purely on classical\nEuclidean constructions, trigonometric identities independent of the theorem\nitself, and a careful analysis of the areas of circular segments.\n  The key idea is to evaluate the area of the semicircle built on the\nhypotenuse in two distinct ways: directly and as a combination of areas formed\nby overlapping circular segments and triangles constructed on the legs of the\ntriangle, as shown in Figure 10. Thales' Theorem, inscribed angle theorem,\nbasic trigonometric identities, and segment area formulas all play a role in a\nderivation that is both elementary and rigorous.\n  To the author's knowledge, this specific approach, which combines circular\nsymmetry, angle decomposition, and area comparison, has not appeared in the\nprior literature, including Loomis' comprehensive catalog [3] and the extensive\ndatabase at Cut-the-Knot [4]. As such, it provides both a new perspective on an\nancient theorem and an example of how classical tools can still yield original\ninsights.",

While language models can sometimes attribute their outputs to\npretraining data, their citations are often unreliable due to hallucination.

We explore whether LLMs can be made to\nreliably attribute to the documents seen during (continual)\npretraining--without test-time retrieval--by revising the training process. To\nevaluate this, we release CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world\ncorpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel, unseen documents and\nprobes both short-form (single fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks.\nOur approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to bind\nfacts to persistent document identifiers, and (2) instruction tuning to elicit\ncitation behavior. We find that simple Passive Indexing, which appends an\nidentifier to each document, helps memorize verbatim text but fails on\nparaphrased or compositional facts. Instead, we propose Active Indexing, which\ncontinually pretrains on synthetic QA pairs that (1) restate each fact in\ndiverse compositional forms, and (2) require bidirectional source-to-fact and\nfact-to-source generation, jointly teaching the model to generate content from\na cited source and to attribute its own answers. Experiments with Qwen2.5-7B\nand 3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms Passive Indexing\nacross all tasks and models, with citation precision gains up to 30.2 percent.\nOur ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale\nthe amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16 times the\noriginal token count.",

We devised a new spectral-line fitting approach to\nde-blend rotating and non-rotating gas components, which is better tailored to\nthe extreme feedback mechanisms at work in NGC6240. We find that ~65% of the\nPa$\\alpha$, H$_2$, and [FeII] line fluxes within the NIRSpec field of view\narise from gas components that are kinematically decoupled from the stars. The\nNIR H$_2$ lines show the most deviation from the stars, with peak emission\nbetween the two rotating stellar structures. The PAH 3.3$\\mu$m feature does not\nfollow the NIR H$_2$ morphology, indicating that the latter does not trace\nPDRs. In the non-rotating gas components, we identify a biconical wind launched\nfrom the northern AGN, expanding along the minor axis of stellar rotation. This\nwind is dominated by ionised gas and, although it entrains some H$_2$, it does\nnot show a H$_2$/PAH enhancement, suggesting either high UV irradiation or\nexpansion along a relatively gas-free path. Furthermore, we find bright\nnon-rotating gas emission between the two AGN and around the southern AGN,\nwhich we interpret as due to an outflow launched from the southern nucleus,\ncoinciding with the molecular outflow previously studied in cold\n(sub-)millimeter tracers. The strong H$_2$/PAH enhancement measured in this\nregion, coextensive with high velocity redshifted gas ($v\\sim900$ km s$^{-1}$),\nsuggests that the shocks responsible for the high H$_2$/PAH ratios are due to\nthe outflow rather than to the collision of media during the merger. Our\nresults show that the bulk of the NIR line emission in NGC6240 is decoupled\nfrom the stars, and that most of the warm H$_2$ is shock-excited and embedded\nin a powerful outflow, where it coexists with colder molecular gas.",

Building on these insights, we examine the conditions\nthat facilitate the efficient production of UHE $r$-process nuclei during the\nprompt radiation (PR), extended emission (EE), and plateau emission phases of\nshort gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) following neutron star mergers. Our study\nreveals that jets associated with the PR phase, characterized by typical bulk\nLorentz factors ($\\gtrsim 400-500$), dissipation radii, and magnetic field\nstrengths, can accelerate $r$-process nuclei to energies $\\gtrsim 100$ EeV\nwhile preserving them during propagation within the source. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the production of HE neutrinos from photomeson and hadronic\ninteractions, as well as from the $\\beta$ decay of accelerated $r$-process\nnuclei. We find that the HE neutrino fluxes from sGRBs, mainly produced via\nphotomeson interactions, are significantly limited to preserve the accelerated\nheavy nuclei, leading to lower fluxes than the predictions without allowing for\ncontributions to UHECRs.

The main emphasis is to identify dominant mechanisms for heating\nplasmas in the reconnection region under different plasma-$\\beta$ conditions in\nthe partially ionized low solar atmosphere. The numerical results show that\nmore plasmoids are generated in a lower $\\beta$ reconnection event. The\nfrequent coalescence of these plasmoids leads to a significant enhancement of\nturbulence and compression heating, which becomes the dominant mechanism for\nheating plasma in a lower plasma-$\\beta$ reconnection process. The average\npower density of the compression heating (Q$_{comp}$) decreases with increasing\ninitial plasma-$\\beta$ as a power function: Q$_{comp} \\sim \\beta_{0}^{-a}$,\nwhere the value $a$ is $1.9$ in the photosphere and decreases to about 1.29 in\nthe upper chromosphere.

In\nthe upper chromosphere, the ambipolar diffusion heating and the viscous heating\nwill become equally important as the compression heating when the initial\nplasma-$\\beta$ is larger than the critical value $\\beta_{0-critical} = 0.5$.\nThese results indicate that the compression heating caused by turbulent\nreconnection mediated with plasmoids is likely the major heating mechanism for\nthe small-scale reconnection events with stronger magnetic fields such as\nactive region EBs and UV bursts.

Instead, such systems are dominated by complex\nheterogeneous architectures and macroscopic interactions, presenting a\nclassical many-body problem with unique complexities that remain less\nsystematically understood than their quantum counterparts. In this work, we\ndevelop an operator-based theoretical framework to characterize these systems,\nusing composite dielectric behavior as a paradigmatic example. By integrating\neffective medium theory with electromagnetic simulation techniques, we\nconstruct an operator that rigorously expresses the effective permittivity\ntensor as an exact functional. Global and local structure-property\nrelationships can be established by analyzing the operator's structure through\nsymmetric singular value decomposition and block operator matrix analysis,\nrespectively. This framework bridges the gap between microscopic physics and\nmacroscopic material behavior, offering a powerful approach for understanding\ndiverse material properties and guiding the rational design of novel functional\ncomposites.",

However, the\noverpractice of skills--students spending time on skills they have already\nmastered--remains a fundamental challenge for tutoring systems. Previous\nresearch has reduced overpractice through the development of better problem\nselection algorithms and the authoring of focused practice tasks. However, few\nefforts have concentrated on reducing overpractice through step-level\nadaptivity, which can avoid resource-intensive curriculum redesign. We propose\nand evaluate Fast-Forwarding as a technique that enhances existing problem\nselection algorithms. Based on simulation studies informed by learner models\nand problem-solving pathways derived from real student data, Fast-Forwarding\ncan reduce overpractice by up to one-third, as it does not require students to\ncomplete problem-solving steps if all remaining pathways are fully mastered.\nFast-Forwarding is a flexible method that enhances any problem selection\nalgorithm, though its effectiveness is highest for algorithms that\npreferentially select difficult problems. Therefore, our findings suggest that\nwhile Fast-Forwarding may improve student practice efficiency, the size of its\npractical impact may also depend on students' ability to stay motivated and\nengaged at higher levels of difficulty.",

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) suffer from severe performance\ndegradation in deep architectures due to over-smoothing. While existing studies\nprimarily attribute the over-smoothing to repeated applications of graph\nLaplacian operators, our empirical analysis reveals a critical yet overlooked\nfactor: trainable linear transformations in GCNs significantly exacerbate\nfeature collapse, even at moderate depths (e.g., 8 layers). In contrast,\nSimplified Graph Convolution (SGC), which removes these transformations,\nmaintains stable feature diversity up to 32 layers, highlighting linear\ntransformations' dual role in facilitating expressive power and inducing\nover-smoothing. However, completely removing linear transformations weakens the\nmodel's expressive capacity. To address this trade-off, we propose Layer-wise\nGradual Training (LGT), a novel training strategy that progressively builds\ndeep GCNs while preserving their expressiveness. LGT integrates three\ncomplementary components: (1) layer-wise training to stabilize optimization\nfrom shallow to deep layers, (2) low-rank adaptation to fine-tune shallow\nlayers and accelerate training, and (3) identity initialization to ensure\nsmooth integration of new layers and accelerate convergence. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LGT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on vanilla GCN, significantly improving accuracy\neven in 32-layer settings. Moreover, as a training method, LGT can be\nseamlessly combined with existing methods such as PairNorm and ContraNorm,\nfurther enhancing their performance in deeper networks. LGT offers a general,\narchitecture-agnostic training framework for scalable deep GCNs. The code is\navailable at [https://github.com/jfklasdfj/LGT_GCN].",

By\nanalysing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and employing Fisher forecast, we show\nthat upcoming GW experiments have good potential to probe the DM parameter\nspace involving its mass and annihilation cross-section.

We also explore the behaviors of particle energy,\nangular momentum, and Keplerian frequency. Secondly, for null geodesics, both\nthe photon sphere radius and the shadow radius decrease with increasing l and\nQ, and are consistently smaller than those of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole\n(RNBH) and Schwarzschild-like BH. And based on observational data reported by\nthe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration, we constrain the parameters l\nand Q by using the shadow radius data of Sgr A*. Thirdly, we explore the\nobservation characteristics of charged BHs under three thin disk accretion\nmodels. The results show that, compared to RNBH, the increase of l leads to a\ngreater thickness of the photon rings and lensed rings. However, due to their\nextremely narrow ranges, the contributions are small, and the observed\nintensities are mainly contributed by the direct emissions. Moreover, when the\nparameter l is fixed, the peaks of the observed intensities of rings decrease\nwith increasing Q for the same emission model, and it is always lower than the\ncorresponding value for Schwarzschild-like BH.

    "abstract": "LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in Medical Report Generation\n(MRG), yet their development requires large amounts of medical image-report\npairs, which are commonly scattered across multiple centers. Centralizing these\ndata is exceptionally challenging due to privacy regulations, thereby impeding\nmodel development and broader adoption of LLM-driven MRG models. To address\nthis challenge, we present FedMRG, the first framework that leverages Federated\nLearning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving, multi-center development of\nLLM-driven MRG models, specifically designed to overcome the critical challenge\nof communication-efficient LLM training under multi-modal data heterogeneity.\nTo start with, our framework tackles the fundamental challenge of communication\noverhead in FL-LLM tuning by employing low-rank factorization to efficiently\ndecompose parameter updates, significantly reducing gradient transmission costs\nand making LLM-driven MRG feasible in bandwidth-constrained FL settings.\nFurthermore, we observed the dual heterogeneity in MRG under the FL scenario:\nvarying image characteristics across medical centers, as well as diverse\nreporting styles and terminology preferences. To address this, we further\nenhance FedMRG with (1) client-aware contrastive learning in the MRG encoder,\ncoupled with diagnosis-driven prompts, which capture both globally\ngeneralizable and locally distinctive features while maintaining diagnostic\naccuracy; and (2) a dual-adapter mutual boosting mechanism in the MRG decoder\nthat harmonizes generic and specialized adapters to address variations in\nreporting styles and terminology. Through extensive evaluation of our\nestablished FL-MRG benchmark, we demonstrate the generalizability and\nadaptability of FedMRG, underscoring its potential in harnessing multi-center\ndata and generating clinically accurate reports while maintaining communication\nefficiency.",

Methods: First,\nwe used the TESS follow-up data of LTT9779b from three sectors (2, 29, and 69)\nto remodel the transit signature and estimate an updated set of transit and\nephemeris parameters, which were directly used in the modeling of the secondary\neclipse lightcurves.

In\naddition to using the officially released reduced aperture photometry data from\nCHEOPS DRP, we also reduced the raw data using an independent PSF photometry\npipeline, known as PIPE, to verify the robustness of our analysis. The\nextracted secondary eclipse lightcurves were modeled using the PYCHEOPS\npackage, where we have detrended the background noise correlated with the\nspacecraft roll angle, originating from the inhomogeneous and asymmetric shape\nof the CHEOPS point spread function, using an N-order glint function.

We examine four prior choices for Bayesian\nregularisation of regression coefficients: Cauchy, Lasso (Laplace), Ridge\n(Gaussian), and Zellner's g-prior. Simulation results suggest that the Cauchy\nprior delivers the best trade-off between predictive accuracy and model\nsimplicity, achieving the lowest RMSE, AIC, and BIC values. Empirically, we\napply the model to large negative returns (exceeding 5%) in the Nifty 50 index.\nVolatility measures from the Nifty 50, S&P 500, and gold are used as covariates\nto capture both domestic and global risk drivers. Our findings show that tail\nrisk increases significantly with higher market volatility. In particular, both\nS&P 500 and gold volatilities contribute meaningfully to crash prediction,\nhighlighting global spillover and flight-to-safety effects. The proposed GPR\nmodel offers a robust and interpretable approach for tail risk forecasting in\nemerging markets. It improves upon traditional EVT-based models by\nincorporating real-time financial indicators, making it useful for\npractitioners, policymakers, and financial regulators concerned with systemic\nrisk and stress testing.",

    "abstract": "Currently, utilizing large language models to understand the 3D world is\nbecoming popular. Yet existing 3D-aware LLMs act as black boxes: they output\nbounding boxes or textual answers without revealing how those decisions are\nmade, and they still rely on pre-trained 3D detectors to supply object\nproposals. We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query. In the\nsubsequent image grounding stage, we analyze the image and predict the 2D\nbounding box. After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce\npixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby\neliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine\ngeometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video. Our training\npipeline only needs task-level 2D boxes or textual labels without dense 3D\npoint-wise labels. Scene-R1 surpasses existing open-vocabulary baselines on\nmultiple datasets, while delivering transparent, step-by-step rationales. These\nresults show that reinforcement-learning-based reasoning combined with RGB-D\nvideo alone offers a practical, annotation-efficient route to trustworthy 3D\nscene understanding.",

In the rapidly evolving landscape of online retail, accurate\nprediction of user behavior is crucial for optimizing inventory management,\npersonalizing user experiences, and maximizing sales. Our method adapts\nconcepts from reinforcement learning to a supervised learning context,\ncombining the sequential modeling capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nnetworks with the strategic decision-making aspects of DQNs. We evaluate our\nmodel on a large-scale e-commerce dataset comprising over 885,000 user\nsessions, each characterized by 1,114 features. Our approach demonstrates\nrobust performance in handling the inherent class imbalance typical in\ne-commerce data, where purchase events are significantly less frequent than\nnon-purchase events. Through comprehensive experimentation with various\nclassification thresholds, we show that our model achieves a balance between\nprecision and recall, with an overall accuracy of 88\\% and an AUC-ROC score of\n0.88. Comparative analysis reveals that our DQN-inspired model offers\nadvantages over traditional machine learning and standard deep learning\napproaches, particularly in its ability to capture complex temporal patterns in\nuser behavior.

Multiple SARB units are integrated into a\nTransformer-based single-stage network (STformer), which uses a U-shaped\narchitecture to extract contextual information, combined with multi-scale\nwavelet blocks (MSWB) to align semantic information in the spatial-frequency\ndual domain.

Our analysis is based on the numerical solution\nof the system of equations for the BECDM gravitationally coupled to Euler\nequations for a compressible ideal gas (IG) that we use as a model of baryonic\nmatter. Numerical simulations are constructed for various scenarios that start\nwith a vortex solution for the BECDM and a randomly distributed ideal gas, with\nthe aim of investigating whether the matter distribution and dynamics of the\nvortex influences the dynamics and distribution of the gas. We find that the\ngas condensation process is most efficient when the IG mass dominates over the\nBECDM, and when the IG has low initial velocity dispersion. We also find that\nstrong bosonic self-interaction does not guarantee the vortex stability,\ninstead, it can trigger dynamical instabilities that disrupt both the vortex\nstructure and the surrounding gas. An interesting finding is that the vortex\ndrives a persistent morphological signature on the gas, often in the form of\nring-like features visible in projected density maps. These patterns survive\nnonlinear evolution and may serve as indirect tracers of vortex structures in\nBECDM halos, potentially offering a novel and testable observational probe of\nthe model.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the foundational\nwaveform in current 5G deployments due to its robustness in quasi-static\nchannels and efficient spectrum use. However, in high-mobility scenarios, OFDM\nsuffers from inter-carrier interference (ICI), and its reliance on dense pilot\npatterns and cyclic prefixes significantly reduces spectral efficiency. In this\nwork, we propose Deep-OFDM: a learnable modulation framework that augments\ntraditional OFDM by incorporating neural parameterization. Instead of mapping\neach symbol to a fixed resource element, Deep-OFDM spreads information across\nthe OFDM grid using a convolutional neural network modulator. This modulator is\njointly optimized with a neural receiver through end-to-end training, enabling\nthe system to adapt to time-varying channels without relying on explicit\nchannel estimation. Deep-OFDM outperforms conventional OFDM when paired with\nneural receiver baselines, particularly in pilot-sparse and pilotless regimes,\nachieving substantial gains in BLER and goodput, especially at high Doppler\nfrequencies. In the pilotless setting, the neural modulator learns a low-rank\nstructure that resembles a superimposed pilot, effectively enabling reliable\ncommunication without explicit overhead. Deep-OFDM demonstrates significant\nimprovements in BLER and goodput at high Doppler frequencies across various\nscenarios, including MIMO systems. Comprehensive ablation studies quantify the\nrole of nonlinear activations and characterize performance-complexity\ntrade-offs. These results highlight the potential of transmitter-receiver\nco-design for robust, resource-efficient communication, paving the way for\nAI-native physical layer designs in next-generation wireless systems.",

For each cluster, we identify the halos hosting its member\ngalaxies, and we define the main halo as the one contributing the most to the\ncluster's richness ($\\lambda$, the estimated number of member galaxies). At\n$z=0.3$, for clusters with $\\lambda > 60$, the main halo typically contributes\nto $92\\%$ of the richness, and this fraction drops to $67\\%$ for $\\lambda\n\\approx 20$.

Since the\nadvent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in\n\\textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking\ndecades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP)\nobservations near the Alfv\\'en surface have revealed a systematic absence of\nthe $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to\ninvestigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations\nof the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined\nits properties across different solar wind conditions.

    "abstract": "This paper describes how intentional and unintentional radio emission from\nairplanes is recorded with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G). We\ncharacterize the received signals and define a procedure to extract a clean set\nof impulsive signals. These signals are highly suitable for instrument\ncalibration, also for future experiments. A set of signals is used to probe the\ntiming precision of RNO-G in-situ, which is found to match expectations. We\nalso discuss the impact of these signals on the ability to detect neutrinos\nwith RNO-G.",

    "abstract": "We study graph-theoretic formulations of two fundamental problems in\nalgorithmic differentiation. The first (Structural Optimal Jacobian\nAccumulation) is that of computing a Jacobian while minimizing multiplications.\nThe second (Minimum Edge Count) is to find a minimum-size computational graph.\nFor both problems, we consider the vertex elimination operation. Our main\ncontribution is to show that both problems are NP-complete, thus resolving\nlongstanding open questions. In contrast to prior work, our reduction for\nStructural Optimal Jacobian Accumulation does not rely on any assumptions about\nthe algebraic relationships between local partial derivatives; we allow these\nvalues to be mutually independent. We also provide $O^*(2^n)$-time exact\nalgorithms for both problems, and show that under the exponential time\nhypothesis these running times are essentially tight. Finally, we provide a\ndata reduction rule for Structural Optimal Jacobian Accumulation by showing\nthat false twins may always be eliminated consecutively.",
