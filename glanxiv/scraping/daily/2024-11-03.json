    "abstract": "Reheating in inflationary cosmology is essential for understanding the early\nuniverse, influencing particle production, thermalization, and the primordial\npower spectrum. Crucial quantities defined during the reheating epoc, such as\nthe equation of state parameter $\\omega_{re}$, reheating temperature $T_{re}$,\nand the number of $e$-folds $N_{re}$, affect inflationary observables like the\nscalar spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We analyze two\nclasses of inflationary models: generalized $\\alpha$-attractor models and the\n$\\alpha$-Starobinsky generalization. These models, motivated by supergravity\nand string theory, exhibit attractor behavior, ensuring strong predictions and\nhave been studied extensively before. A salient novelty of this study, compared\nto previous works, is the inclusion of an analytical expression for the\nreheating temperature, $T_{\\text{re}}$, which makes it a dynamical quantity.\nThis is crucial for determining all the cosmological quantities analyzed in\nthis work. Our results show a universal scaling behavior for a tightly bounded\n$T_{re}$ in both models. We believe this is the first time that $T_{re}$ is so\nclosely determined. This work complements previous Bayesian and numerical\nstudies by providing detailed numerical and analytical insights into the\nevolution of cosmological observables and reheating parameters, offering also\nconstraints on inflationary models based on observational data.",

Given that the large-$N_c$ analysis is predicated on\nthe nucleons and $\\Delta$'s being degenerate, this is a curious result. We show\nthat for purely $S$-wave interactions the relationships dictated by large-$N_c$\nscaling are unaffected whether the $\\Delta$ is included or not. In the case of\nhigher partial waves that do not mix with $S$-waves, the impact of the $\\Delta$\nis perturbative, which makes the agreement with naive ($\\Delta$-less)\nlarge-$N_c$ ordering unsurprising. For higher partial waves that mix with\n$S$-waves, the nucleon and $\\Delta$ would need to decouple to get agreement\nwith naive large-$N_c$ ordering.

To address this limitation, we reformulate the\nproblem directly on G, revolutionizing grid-based MCPP solving and establishing\nnew NP-hardness results.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by\nincorporating external knowledge bases, but it also introduces new attack\nsurfaces. In this paper, we investigate data extraction attacks targeting RAG's\nknowledge databases. We show that previous prompt injection-based extraction\nattacks largely rely on the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs. As a\nresult, they fail on models that are less responsive to such malicious prompts\n-- for example, our experiments show that state-of-the-art attacks achieve\nnear-zero success on Gemma-2B-IT. Moreover, even for models that can follow\nthese instructions, we found fine-tuning may significantly reduce attack\nperformance. To further reveal the vulnerability, we propose to backdoor RAG,\nwhere a small portion of poisoned data is injected during the fine-tuning phase\nto create a backdoor within the LLM. When this compromised LLM is integrated\ninto a RAG system, attackers can exploit specific triggers in prompts to\nmanipulate the LLM to leak documents from the retrieval database. By carefully\ndesigning the poisoned data, we achieve both verbatim and paraphrased document\nextraction. For example, on Gemma-2B-IT, we show that with only 5\\% poisoned\ndata, our method achieves an average success rate of 94.1\\% for verbatim\nextraction (ROUGE-L score: 82.1) and 63.6\\% for paraphrased extraction (average\nROUGE score: 66.4) across four datasets.

    "abstract": "We present NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations of CO(8-7), (9-8),\nand (10-9) lines, as well as the underlying continuum for two far-infrared\nluminous quasars: SDSS J2054-0005 at $\\rm z=6.0389$ and SDSS J0129-0035 at $\\rm\nz=5.7788$. Both quasars were previously detected in CO (2-1) and (6-5)\ntransitions, making them candidates for studying the CO Spectral Line Energy\nDistribution (SLED) of quasars at $z \\sim 6$. Utilizing the radiative transfer\ncode CLOUDY, we fit the CO SLED with two heating mechanisms, including the\nphoto-dissociation region (PDR) and X-ray-dominated region (XDR) for both\nobjects. The CO SLEDs can be fitted by either a dense PDR component with an\nextremely strong far-ultraviolet radiation field (gas density $ n_{\\rm H} \\sim\n10^6 \\, \\rm cm^{-3}$ and field strength $G_0 \\gtrsim 10^6$) or a two-component\nmodel including a PDR and an XDR. However, the line ratios, including \\tir and\nprevious \\cii and \\ci measurements, argue against a very high PDR radiation\nfield strength. Thus, the results prefer a PDR+XDR origin for the CO SLED. The\nexcitation of the high-J CO lines in both objects is likely dominated by the\ncentral AGN. We then check the CO (9-8)-to-(6-5) line luminosity ratio $r_{96}$\nfor all $z \\sim 6$ quasars with available CO SLEDs (seven in total) and find\nthat there are no clear correlations between $r_{96}$ and both \\fir and the AGN\nUV luminosities. This further demonstrates the complexity of the CO excitation\npowered by both the AGN and nuclear star formation in these young quasar host\ngalaxies.",

While initially mostly an\ninteresting algorithmic endeavor, now the practical application by applying\nrearrangement distance methods and more advanced phylogenetic tasks is becoming\ncommon practice, given the availability of many completely sequenced genomes.\nSeveral genome rearrangement models have been developed over time, sometimes\nwith surprising computational properties. A prominent example is the fact that\ncomputing the reversal distance of two signed permutations is possible in\nlinear time, while for two unsigned permutations it is NP-hard. Therefore one\nhas always to be careful about the precise problem formulation and complexity\nanalysis of rearrangement problems in order not to be fooled. The double\ndistance is the minimum number of genomic rearrangements between a singular and\na duplicated genome that, in addition to rearrangements, are separated by a\nwhole genome duplication. At the same time it allows to assign the genes of the\nduplicated genome to the two paralogous chromosome copies that existed right\nafter the duplication event. Computing the double distance is another example\nof a tricky hardness landscape: If the distance measure underlying the double\ndistance is the simple breakpoint distance, the problem can be solved in linear\ntime, while with the more elaborate DCJ distance it is NP-hard. Indeed, there\nis a family of distance measures, parameterized by an even number k, between\nthe breakpoint distance (k=2) and the DCJ distance (k=\\infty).

To address this\nissue and maximize the benefit of collaborative filtering (CF) in FRS, it is\nintuitive to consider clustering clients (users) as well as items into\ndifferent groups and learning group-specific models. Existing methods either\nresort to client clustering via user representations-risking privacy leakage,\nor employ classical clustering strategies on item embeddings or gradients,\nwhich we found are plagued by the curse of dimensionality.

Subsequently, clients are grouped regarding a specific item category\npicked from the item membership during each communication round, resulting in\nan intelligently aggregated group model.

Furthermore, our findings\nchallenge the prevailing assumption that expressibility alone dictates circuit\nrobustness; instead, we demonstrate that the inclusion of controlled rotation\ngates around the Z-axis generally enhances the resilience of QuNNs. Our results\ndemonstrate that QuNNs exhibit up to 60% greater robustness on the MNIST\ndataset and 40% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset compared to CNNs.

    "abstract": "Record matching is the task of identifying records that refer to the same\nreal-world entity across datasets. While most existing models optimize for\naccuracy, fairness has become an important concern due to the potential for\nunequal outcomes across demographic groups. Prior work typically focuses on\nbinary outcomes evaluated at fixed decision thresholds. However, such\nevaluations can miss biases in matching scores--biases that persist across\nthresholds and affect downstream tasks. We propose a threshold-independent\nframework for measuring and reducing score bias, defined as disparities in the\ndistribution of matching scores across groups. We show that several\nstate-of-the-art matching methods exhibit substantial score bias, even when\nappearing fair under standard threshold-based metrics. To address this, we\nintroduce two post-processing score calibration algorithms. The first, calib,\naligns group-wise score distributions using the Wasserstein barycenter,\ntargeting demographic parity. The second, ccalib, conditions on predicted\nlabels to further reduce label-dependent biases, such as equal opportunity.\nBoth methods are model-agnostic and require no access to model training data.\ncalib also offers theoretical guarantees, ensuring reduced bias with minimal\ndeviation from original scores. Experiments across real-world datasets and\nmatching models confirm that calib and ccalib substantially reduce score bias\nwhile minimally impacting model accuracy.",

We show that when the frequency is lower than the inverse of the\ncharacteristic time for barchan formation, the dune adapts to the new flow\ndirection and recovers the barchan shape while losing less grains than under\none-directional flow. For higher frequencies, the dune has not enough time for\nadaptation and becomes more round while losing more grains.

Using a sample of 458\nEnglish-speaking adults who responded to online hate speech posts covering\nrace, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and disability status, our research\nreveals that the match between a hate post's topic and a counter-speaker's\nidentity (topic-identity match, or TIM) shapes perceptions of hatefulness and\nexperiences with counterspeech writing. Specifically, TIM significantly\nincreases the perceived hatefulness of posts related to race and sexual\norientation.

In addition, counterspeech\nthat displayed more empathy, was longer, had a more positive tone, and was\nassociated with higher ratings of effectiveness and perceptions of hatefulness.\nPrior experience with, and openness to AI writing assistance tools like\nChatGPT, correlate negatively with perceived difficulty in writing online\ncounterspeech.

    "abstract": "State-specific thermochemical collisional models are crucial to accurately\ndescribe the physics of systems involving nonequilibrium plasmas, but they are\nalso computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale,\nmulti-dimensional simulations. Historically, computational cost has been\nmitigated by using empirical and physics-based arguments to reduce the\ncomplexity of the governing equations. However, the resulting models are often\ninaccurate and they fail to capture the important features of the original\nphysics. Additionally, the construction of these models is often impractical,\nas it requires extensive user supervision and time-consuming parameter tuning.\nIn this paper, we address these issues through an easily-implementable and\ncomputationally-efficient model reduction pipeline based on the Petrov-Galerkin\nprojection of the nonlinear kinetic equations. Our approach is justified by the\nobservation that kinetic systems in thermal nonequilibrium tend to exhibit\nlow-rank dynamics that rapidly drive the state towards a low-dimensional\nsubspace. Furthermore, despite the nonlinear nature of the governing equations,\nwe observe that the dynamics of these systems evolve on subspaces that can be\naccurately identified using the linearized equations about thermochemical\nequilibrium, which significantly reduce the cost associated with the\nconstruction of the model. The approach is demonstrated on a rovibrational\ncollisional model for the O$_2$-O system, and a vibrational collisional model\nfor the combined O$_2$-O and O$_2$-O$_2$ systems. Our method achieves high\naccuracy, with relative errors of less than 1% for macroscopic quantities\n(i.e., moments) and 10% for microscopic quantities (i.e., energy levels\npopulation), while also delivering excellent compression rates and speedups,\noutperforming existing state-of-the-art techniques.",

Furthermore, we introduce the\nconcept of the generalization difference, defined as the gap between the\noutputs of 1-bit networks and their full-precision counterparts, and\ndemonstrate that this difference maintains a negligible level as network width\nscales. Building on the work of Kaplan et al. (2020), we conclude by examining\nhow the training loss scales as a power-law function of the model size, dataset\nsize, and computational resources utilized for training. Our findings\nunderscore the promising potential of scaling 1-bit neural networks, suggesting\nthat int1 could become the standard in future neural network precision.",

Here we demonstrate the efficient control of\nmagnetization dynamics of $\\beta$-W/CoFeB bilayer when capped by low SOC\norganic and inorganic layers. The C$_{60}$ capping layer (CL) significantly\nenhances the magnetization relaxation process compared to the CuO$_x$ in\n$\\beta$-W/CoFeB/CL heterostructures, while the static magnetic properties\nremain in-different irrespective of the nature of CL. Interestingly, the\nspin-orbital to charge conversion phenomenon is found to be enhanced for\n$\\beta$-W/CoFeB/CuO$_x$ stacking compared to the $\\beta$-W/CoFeB/C$_{60}$\nheterostructure, signifying the anti-correlation between the magnetic damping\nand spin-orbital to charge conversion. The results are interpreted by the\ninterfacial phenomena, like the orbital Rashba effect, two-magnon scattering,\nand interfacial spin memory loss. Our detailed experimental investigations shed\nlight on the importance of low SOC materials in effectively tuning the\nmagnetization dynamics for the development of future power efficient\nspintronics devices.",

In this context, the key\nissue lies in how to deal with different types of degraded images\nsimultaneously. In this work, we present a Degradation-Aware\nResidual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (DA-RCOT) approach that models\n(all-in-one) image restoration as an optimal transport (OT) problem for\nunpaired and paired settings, introducing the transport residual as a\ndegradation-specific cue for both the transport cost and the transport map.\nSpecifically, we formalize image restoration with a residual-guided OT\nobjective by exploiting the degradation-specific patterns of the Fourier\nresidual in the transport cost. More crucially, we design the transport map for\nrestoration as a two-pass DA-RCOT map, in which the transport residual is\ncomputed in the first pass and then encoded as multi-scale residual embeddings\nto condition the second-pass restoration. This conditioning process injects\nintrinsic degradation knowledge (e.g., degradation type and level) and\nstructural information from the multi-scale residual embeddings into the OT\nmap, which thereby can dynamically adjust its behaviors for all-in-one\nrestoration. Extensive experiments across five degradations demonstrate the\nfavorable performance of DA-RCOT as compared to state-of-the-art methods, in\nterms of distortion measures, perceptual quality, and image structure\npreservation. Notably, DA-RCOT delivers superior adaptability to real-world\nscenarios even with multiple degradations and shows distinctive robustness to\nboth degradation levels and the number of degradations.",

Accurate and real-time analysis of\nbiomedical signals during CPR is essential for monitoring and decision-making,\nfrom the pre-hospital stage to the intensive care unit (ICU). However, CPR\nsignals are often corrupted by noise and artifacts, making precise\ninterpretation challenging. Traditional denoising methods, such as filters,\nstruggle to adapt to the varying and complex noise patterns present in CPR\nsignals. Given the high-stakes nature of CPR, where rapid and accurate\nresponses can determine survival, there is a pressing need for more robust and\nadaptive denoising techniques.

This paper introduces a novel unsupervised ML approach for denoising\nCPR signals using a multi-modality framework, which leverages multiple signal\nsources to enhance the denoising process. The proposed approach not only\nimproves noise reduction and signal fidelity but also preserves critical\ninter-signal correlations (0.9993) which is crucial for downstream tasks.\nFurthermore, it outperforms existing methods in an unsupervised context in\nterms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),\nmaking it highly effective for real-time applications.

In astrophysical systems with\nhigh velocities, relativistic corrections are necessary. We investigate the\nlinear theory of relativistic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (R-RTI) in a\nmagnetized medium, where fluids can move parallel to the interface at\nrelativistic velocities. We chose an \"intermediate frame\" where fluids on each\nside of the interface move in opposite directions with identical Lorentz\nfactors gamma_*. This symmetry facilitates analytical derivations and the study\nof relativistic effects on the instability's dynamics. We derive the correct\nversion of the R-RTI. We find that the instability is activated when the Atwood\nnumber A = (rho1 h1 - rho2 h2) / (rho1 h1 + rho2 h2) > 0, where rho1 and rho2\nare densities measured in the rest frame of the fluids, and that this criterion\ndoes not contain relativistic corrections. The relativistic effect is mostly\ncontained in the Lorentz transformation of the gravitational acceleration g' =\ng / (gamma_*)^2, which, combined with time dilation, leads to a much slower\ngrowth of instability (omega' = omega0 / gamma_*), and a slightly elongated\nlength of the unstable patch, due to weaker g in the intermediate frame. Taking\ntime dilation into account, when viewed in the rest frame of the medium, we\nexpect the instability to grow at a much reduced rate. The analytical results\nshould guide further explorations of instability in systems such as\nmicroquasars (muQSOs), active galactic nuclei (AGNs), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs),\nand radio pulsars (PSRs), where the apparent stability of the jet can be\nattributed to either the intrinsic stability (e.g. the Atwood number) or the\nmuch prolonged duration through which R-RTI can grow.",

It states that the new disorder can be\nrelevant only if $d \\nu < 2$. We analyze the applicability of the Harris\ncriterion to the GKNS network disorder formulated in the paper [I. A. Gruzberg,\nA. Kl\\\"umper, W. Nuding, and A. Sedrakyan, Phys. Rev. B 95, 125414 (2017)] and\nshow that the fluctuations of the geometry are relevant despite $d \\nu> 2$,\nimplying that Harris criterion should be modified. We have observed that the\nfluctuations of the critical point in different quenched configurations of\ndisordered network blocks is of order $L^0$, i.e.~it does not depend on block\nsize $L$ in contrast to the expectation based on the Harris criterion that they\nshould decrease as $L^{-d/2}$ according to the central limit theorem. Since\n$L^0 > (x-x_c)$ is always satisfied near the critical point, the mentioned\nnetwork disorder is relevant and the critical indices of the system can be\nchanged. We have also shown that the GKNS disordered network is fundamentally\ndifferent from Voronoi-Delaunay and dynamically triangulated random lattices:\nthe probability of higher connectivity in the GKNS network decreases in a power\nlaw as opposed to an exponential, indicating that we are dealing with a ``scale\nfree\" network, such as the Internet, protein-protein interactions, etc.",

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory\ninterpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical\nchallenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework\nto disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first\nintroduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception\nuncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision\nuncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans.\n  To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the\nunique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal\nprediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce\nFormal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty,\nleveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building\non this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an\nactive sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to\nenhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that\nfine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet\ntask specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic\ntasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces\nvariability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to\nbaselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both\ninterventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement,\nwhich facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and\nreliability of autonomous systems.

    "abstract": "This research investigates the implementation of a real-time,\nmicroservices-oriented dynamic pricing system for the travel sector. The system\nis designed to address factors such as demand, competitor pricing, and other\nexternal circumstances in real-time. Both controlled simulation and real-life\napplication showed a respectable gain of 22% in revenue generation and a 17%\nimprovement in pricing response time which concern the issues of scaling and\nflexibility of classical pricing mechanisms. Demand forecasting, competitor\npricing strategies, and event-based pricing were implemented as separate\nmicroservices to enhance their scalability and reduce resource consumption by\n30% during peak loads. Customers were also more content as depicted by a 15%\nincrease in satisfaction score post-implementation given the appreciation of\nmore appropriate pricing. This research enhances the existing literature with\npractical illustrations of the possible application of microservices technology\nin developing dynamic pricing solutions in a complex and data-driven context.\nThere exist however areas for improvement for instance inter-service latency\nand the need for extensive real-time data pipelines. The present research goes\non to suggest combining these with direct data capture from customer behavior\nat the same time as machine learning capacity developments in pricing\nalgorithms to assist in more accurate real time pricing. It is determined that\nthe use of microservices is a reasonable and efficient model for dynamic\npricing, allowing the tourism sector to employ evidence-based and customer\ncentric pricing techniques, which ensures that their profits are not\njeopardized because of the need for customers.",

In a P-N leg-pair module, the effective ZT lies between the individual ZT\nvalues of the P- and N-legs. In a single-leg module, however, the effective ZT\nis less than approximately one-third of the leg's ZT. This reduction results\nfrom the need for an external wire to complete the circuit, introducing\nadditional thermal and electrical losses. Multi-dimensional numerical analysis\nshows that, although structural optimization can mitigate these losses, the\nsystem efficiency remains limited to below half of the ideal single-leg\nmaterial efficiency.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of multiclass transductive online learning when the\nnumber of labels can be unbounded. Previous works by Ben-David et al. [1997]\nand Hanneke et al. [2023b] only consider the case of binary and finite label\nspaces, respectively. The latter work determined that their techniques fail to\nextend to the case of unbounded label spaces, and they pose the question of\ncharacterizing the optimal mistake bound for unbounded label spaces. We answer\nthis question by showing that a new dimension, termed the Level-constrained\nLittlestone dimension, characterizes online learnability in this setting. Along\nthe way, we show that the trichotomy of possible minimax rates of the expected\nnumber of mistakes established by Hanneke et al. [2023b] for finite label\nspaces in the realizable setting continues to hold even when the label space is\nunbounded. In particular, if the learner plays for $T \\in \\mathbb{N}$ rounds,\nits minimax expected number of mistakes can only grow like $\\Theta(T)$,\n$\\Theta(\\log T)$, or $\\Theta(1)$. To prove this result, we give another\ncombinatorial dimension, termed the Level-constrained Branching dimension, and\nshow that its finiteness characterizes constant minimax expected\nmistake-bounds. The trichotomy is then determined by a combination of the\nLevel-constrained Littlestone and Branching dimensions. Quantitatively, our\nupper bounds improve upon existing multiclass upper bounds in Hanneke et al.\n[2023b] by removing the dependence on the label set size. In doing so, we\nexplicitly construct learning algorithms that can handle extremely large or\nunbounded label spaces. A key and novel component of our algorithm is a new\nnotion of shattering that exploits the sequential nature of transductive online\nlearning. Finally, we complete our results by proving expected regret bounds in\nthe agnostic setting, extending the result of Hanneke et al. [2023b].",

    "abstract": "Adding noise is easy; what about denoising? Diffusion is easy; what about\nreverting a diffusion? Diffusion-based generative models aim to denoise a\nLangevin diffusion chain, moving from a log-concave equilibrium measure $\\nu$,\nsay isotropic Gaussian, back to a complex, possibly non-log-concave initial\nmeasure $\\mu$. The score function performs denoising, going backward in time,\npredicting the conditional mean of the past location given the current. We show\nthat score denoising is the optimal backward map in transportation cost. What\nis its localization uncertainty? We show that the curvature function determines\nthis localization uncertainty, measured as the conditional variance of the past\nlocation given the current. We study in this paper the effectiveness of the\ndiffuse-then-denoise process: the contraction of the forward diffusion chain,\noffset by the possible expansion of the backward denoising chain, governs the\ndenoising difficulty. For any initial measure $\\mu$, we prove that this offset\nnet contraction at time $t$ is characterized by the curvature complexity of a\nsmoothed $\\mu$ at a specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scale $r(t)$. We\ndiscover that the multi-scale curvature complexity collectively determines the\ndifficulty of the denoising chain. Our multi-scale complexity quantifies a\nfine-grained notion of average-case curvature instead of the worst-case.\nCuriously, it depends on an integrated tail function, measuring the relative\nmass of locations with positive curvature versus those with negative curvature;\ndenoising at a specific SNR scale is easy if such an integrated tail is light.\nWe conclude with several non-log-concave examples to demonstrate how the\nmulti-scale complexity probes the bottleneck SNR for the diffuse-then-denoise\nprocess.",

With the popularity of deep learning, various convolutional neural\nnetworks have been proposed for pixel-level classification and segmentation\ntasks. In practical scenarios, however, imaging angles are often arbitrary,\nencompassing instances such as water body images from remote sensing and\ncapillary and polyp images in the medical domain, where prior orientation\ninformation is typically unavailable to guide these networks to extract more\neffective features. In this case, learning features from objects with diverse\norientation information poses a significant challenge, as the majority of\nCNN-based semantic segmentation networks lack rotation equivariance to resist\nthe disturbance from orientation information. To address this challenge, this\npaper first constructs a universal convolution-group framework aimed at more\nfully utilizing orientation information and equipping the network with rotation\nequivariance. Subsequently, we mathematically design a padding-based rotation\nequivariant convolution mode (PreCM), which is not only applicable to\nmulti-scale images and convolutional kernels but can also serve as a\nreplacement component for various types of convolutions, such as dilated\nconvolutions, transposed convolutions, and asymmetric convolution. To\nquantitatively assess the impact of image rotation in semantic segmentation\ntasks, we also propose a new evaluation metric, Rotation Difference (RD). The\nreplacement experiments related to six existing semantic segmentation networks\non three datasets show that, the average Intersection Over Union (IOU) of their\nPreCM-based versions respectively improve 6.91%, 10.63%, 4.53%, 5.93%, 7.48%,\n8.33% compared to their original versions in terms of random angle rotation.\nAnd the average RD values are decreased by 3.58%, 4.56%, 3.47%, 3.66%, 3.47%,\n3.43% respectively.",

In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal\nprocessing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process,\nwe introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our\nproposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal\npatterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time\nseries signals.

Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet\ncan approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in\ntime series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling\nhigh-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is\nbeneficial for forecasting.

    "abstract": "Critical open source software systems undergo significant validation in the\nform of lengthy fuzz campaigns. The fuzz campaigns typically conduct a biased\nrandom search over the domain of program inputs, to find inputs which crash the\nsoftware system. Such fuzzing is useful to enhance the security of software\nsystems in general since even closed source software may use open source\ncomponents. Hence testing open source software is of paramount importance.\nCurrently OSS-Fuzz is the most significant and widely used infrastructure for\ncontinuous validation of open source systems. Unfortunately even though\nOSS-Fuzz has identified more than 10,000 vulnerabilities across 1000 or more\nsoftware projects, the detected vulnerabilities may remain unpatched, as\nvulnerability fixing is often manual in practice. In this work, we rely on the\nrecent progress in Large Language Model (LLM) agents for autonomous program\nimprovement including bug fixing. We customise the well-known AutoCodeRover\nagent for fixing security vulnerabilities. This is because LLM agents like\nAutoCodeRover fix bugs from issue descriptions via code search. Instead for\nsecurity patching, we rely on the test execution of the exploit input to\nextract code elements relevant to the fix. Our experience with OSS-Fuzz\nvulnerability data shows that LLM agent autonomy is useful for successful\nsecurity patching, as opposed to approaches like Agentless where the control\nflow is fixed. More importantly our findings show that we cannot measure\nquality of patches by code similarity of the patch with reference codes (as in\nCodeBLEU scores used in VulMaster), since patches with high CodeBLEU scores\nstill fail to pass given the given exploit input. Our findings indicate that\nsecurity patch correctness needs to consider dynamic attributes like test\nexecutions as opposed to relying of standard text/code similarity metrics.",

Due to the challenges posed by\nocclusion, unfavourable imaging conditions and low resolution,\n\\emph{generating} the BEV semantic maps corresponding to corrupted or invalid\nareas in the perspective view (PV) is appealing very recently. \\emph{The\nquestion is how to align the PV features with the generative models to\nfacilitate the map estimation}. In this paper, we propose to utilize a\ngenerative model similar to the Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder\n(VQ-VAE) to acquire prior knowledge for the high-level BEV semantics in the\ntokenized discrete space. Thanks to the obtained BEV tokens accompanied with a\ncodebook embedding encapsulating the semantics for different BEV elements in\nthe groundtruth maps, we are able to directly align the sparse backbone image\nfeatures with the obtained BEV tokens from the discrete representation learning\nbased on a specialized token decoder module, and finally generate high-quality\nBEV maps with the BEV codebook embedding serving as a bridge between PV and\nBEV. We evaluate the BEV map layout estimation performance of our model, termed\nVQ-Map, on both the nuScenes and Argoverse benchmarks, achieving 62.2/47.6 mean\nIoU for surround-view/monocular evaluation on nuScenes, as well as 73.4 IoU for\nmonocular evaluation on Argoverse, which all set a new record for this map\nlayout estimation task.

    "abstract": "An important stage of most state-of-the-art (SOTA) noisy-label learning\nmethods consists of a sample selection procedure that classifies samples from\nthe noisy-label training set into noisy-label or clean-label subsets. The\nprocess of sample selection typically consists of one of the two approaches:\nloss-based sampling, where high-loss samples are considered to have noisy\nlabels, or feature-based sampling, where samples from the same class tend to\ncluster together in the feature space and noisy-label samples are identified as\nanomalies within those clusters. Empirically, loss-based sampling is robust to\na wide range of noise rates, while feature-based sampling tends to work\neffectively in particular scenarios, e.g., the filtering of noisy instances via\ntheir eigenvectors (FINE) sampling exhibits greater robustness in scenarios\nwith low noise rates, and the K nearest neighbor (KNN) sampling mitigates\nbetter high noise-rate problems. This paper introduces the Adaptive Nearest\nNeighbors and Eigenvector-based (ANNE) sample selection methodology, a novel\napproach that integrates loss-based sampling with the feature-based sampling\nmethods FINE and Adaptive KNN to optimize performance across a wide range of\nnoise rate scenarios. ANNE achieves this integration by first partitioning the\ntraining set into high-loss and low-loss sub-groups using loss-based sampling.\nSubsequently, within the low-loss subset, sample selection is performed using\nFINE, while the high-loss subset employs Adaptive KNN for effective sample\nselection. We integrate ANNE into the noisy-label learning state of the art\n(SOTA) method SSR+, and test it on CIFAR-10/-100 (with symmetric, asymmetric\nand instance-dependent noise), Webvision and ANIMAL-10, where our method shows\nbetter accuracy than the SOTA in most experiments, with a competitive training\ntime.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we propose GITSR, an effective framework for Graph Interaction\nTransformer-based Scene Representation for multi-vehicle collaborative\ndecision-making in intelligent transportation system. In the context of mixed\ntraffic where Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Human Driving Vehicles\n(HDVs) coexist, in order to enhance the understanding of the environment by\nCAVs to improve decision-making capabilities, this framework focuses on\nefficient scene representation and the modeling of spatial interaction\nbehaviors of traffic states. We first extract features of the driving\nenvironment based on the background of intelligent networking. Subsequently,\nthe local scene representation, which is based on the agent-centric and dynamic\noccupation grid, is calculated by the Transformer module. Besides, feasible\nregion of the map is captured through the multi-head attention mechanism to\nreduce the collision of vehicles. Notably, spatial interaction behaviors, based\non motion information, are modeled as graph structures and extracted via Graph\nNeural Network (GNN). Ultimately, the collaborative decision-making among\nmultiple vehicles is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), with\ndriving actions output by Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Our\nalgorithmic validation is executed within the extremely challenging scenario of\nhighway off-ramp task, thereby substantiating the superiority of agent-centric\napproach to scene representation. Simulation results demonstrate that the GITSR\nmethod can not only effectively capture scene representation but also extract\nspatial interaction data, outperforming the baseline method across various\ncomparative metrics.",

We hypothesize that one\nkey factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that\nspan distinct spatial and temporal scales, ranging from high-frequency local\nvibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a\ngraph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE\nframework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes\nmolecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph\nLaplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural\nODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally\nreconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier\ntransform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this\nunified pipeline, GF-NODE captures long-range correlations and local\nfluctuations more effectively. We provide theoretical insight through heat\nequation analysis on a simplified diffusion model, demonstrating how graph\nLaplacian eigenvalues can determine temporal dynamics scales, and crucially\nvalidate this correspondence through comprehensive empirical analysis on real\nmolecular dynamics trajectories showing quantitative spatial-temporal\ncorrelations across diverse molecular systems. Experimental results on\nchallenging MD benchmarks demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended\nsimulations.

    "abstract": "In this work, we focus on two important aspects of modern cosmology:\nreheating and Hubble constant tension within the framework of a unified model,\nnamely, quintessential inflation connecting the early inflationary era and\nlate-time cosmic acceleration. In the context of reheating, we use instant\npreheating and gravitational reheating, two viable reheating mechanisms when\nthe evolution of the universe is not affected by an oscillating regime. After\nobtaining the reheating temperature, we analyze the number of $e$-folds and\nestablish its relationship with the reheating temperature. This allows us to\nconnect, for different quintessential inflation models, the reheating\ntemperature with the spectral index of scalar perturbations, thereby enabling\nus to constrain its values. In the second part of this article, we explore\nvarious alternatives to address the $H_0$ tension, a discrepancy which\nindicates a possible revision of the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Initially, we\nestablish that quintessential inflation alone cannot mitigate the Hubble\ntension by solely deviating from the concordance model at low redshifts. The\nintroduction of a phantom fluid, capable of increasing the Hubble rate at the\npresent time, becomes a crucial element in alleviating the Hubble tension,\nresulting in a deviation from the $\\Lambda$CDM model only at low redshifts. On\na different note, by utilizing quintessential inflation as a source of early\ndark energy, thereby diminishing the physical size of the sound horizon close\nto the baryon-photon decoupling redshift, we observe a reduction in the Hubble\ntension. This alternative avenue, which has the same effect of a cosmological\nconstant changing its scale close to the recombination, sheds light on the\nnuanced interplay between the quintessential inflation and the Hubble tension,\noffering a distinct perspective on addressing this cosmological challenge.",

Traditional RSIC methods often struggle to\nproduce rich and diverse descriptions. Recently, with advancements in VLMs,\nefforts have emerged to integrate these models into the remote sensing domain\nand to introduce descriptive datasets specifically designed to enhance VLM\ntraining. This paper proposes RS-MoE, a first Mixture of Expert based VLM\nspecifically customized for remote sensing domain. Unlike traditional MoE\nmodels, the core of RS-MoE is the MoE Block, which incorporates a novel\nInstruction Router and multiple lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) as\nexpert models. The Instruction Router is designed to generate specific prompts\ntailored for each corresponding LLM, guiding them to focus on distinct aspects\nof the RSIC task. This design not only allows each expert LLM to concentrate on\na specific subset of the task, thereby enhancing the specificity and accuracy\nof the generated captions, but also improves the scalability of the model by\nfacilitating parallel processing of sub-tasks. Additionally, we present a\ntwo-stage training strategy for tuning our RS-MoE model to prevent performance\ndegradation due to sparsity. We fine-tuned our model on the RSICap dataset\nusing our proposed training strategy.

However, existing VTON methods still fall short in high-fidelity\ntry-on due to the conflict between the high diversity of dressing styles (\\eg\nclothes occluded by pants or distorted by posture) and the limited paired data\nfor training. In this work, we propose a novel framework \\textbf{Boosted\nVirtual Try-on (BVTON)} to leverage the large-scale unpaired learning for\nhigh-fidelity try-on. Our key insight is that pseudo try-on pairs can be\nreliably constructed from vastly available fashion images. Specifically,\n\\textbf{1)} we first propose a compositional canonicalizing flow that maps\non-model clothes into pseudo in-shop clothes, dubbed canonical proxy. Each\nclothing part (sleeves, torso) is reversely deformed into an in-shop-like shape\nto compositionally construct the canonical proxy. \\textbf{2)} Next, we design a\nlayered mask generation module that generates accurate semantic layout by\ntraining on canonical proxy. We replace the in-shop clothes used in\nconventional pipelines with the derived canonical proxy to boost the training\nprocess. \\textbf{3)} Finally, we propose an unpaired try-on synthesizer by\nconstructing pseudo training pairs with randomly misaligned on-model clothes,\nwhere intricate skin texture and clothes boundaries can be generated. Extensive\nexperiments on high-resolution ($1024\\times768$) datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively\nand quantitatively.

To fit the model, a\nmulti-task learning approach achieves lower error rates compared to node-wise\nregressions.

These\nfeatures of the interface interplay with specific mechanisms proposed for\nmicrodroplet reactivity, including partial solvation and possible gas phase\nchannels.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) trains deep models across edge devices without\ncentralizing raw data, preserving user privacy. However, client heterogeneity\nslows down convergence and limits global model accuracy. Clustered FL (CFL)\nmitigates this by grouping clients with similar representations and training a\nseparate model for each cluster. In practice, client data evolves over time, a\nphenomenon we refer to as data drift, which breaks cluster homogeneity and\ndegrades performance. Data drift can take different forms depending on whether\nchanges occur in the output values, the input features, or the relationship\nbetween them. We propose FIELDING, a CFL framework for handling diverse types\nof data drift with low overhead. FIELDING detects drift at individual clients\nand performs selective re-clustering to balance cluster quality and model\nperformance, while remaining robust to malicious clients and varying levels of\nheterogeneity. Experiments show that FIELDING improves final model accuracy by\n1.9-5.9% and achieves target accuracy 1.16x-2.23x faster than existing\nstate-of-the-art CFL methods.",

The fundamental theoretical question in\nthis line of work is the \\textit{price of explainability}, defined as the ratio\nbetween the clustering cost of the tree and the optimal cost. Numerous papers\nhave provided worst-case guarantees on this quantity. For $K$-medians, it has\nrecently been shown that the worst-case price of explainability is $\\Theta(\\log\nK)$.

Artificial intelligence methods have shown promise\nin enhancing CBCT quality to produce synthetic CT (sCT) images. However,\nexisting methods either produce images of suboptimal quality or incur excessive\ntime costs, failing to satisfy clinical practice standards. Methods and\nmaterials: We propose a novel hybrid conditional latent diffusion model for\nefficient and accurate CBCT-to-CT synthesis, named HC$^3$L-Diff. We employ the\nUnified Feature Encoder (UFE) to compress images into a low-dimensional latent\nspace, thereby optimizing computational efficiency. Beyond the use of CBCT\nimages, we propose integrating its high-frequency knowledge as a hybrid\ncondition to guide the diffusion model in generating sCT images with preserved\nstructural details. This high-frequency information is captured using our\ndesigned High-Frequency Extractor (HFE). During inference, we utilize denoising\ndiffusion implicit model to facilitate rapid sampling. We construct a new\nin-house prostate dataset with paired CBCT and CT to validate the effectiveness\nof our method. Result: Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sCT quality and\ngeneration efficiency. Moreover, our medical physicist conducts the dosimetric\nevaluations to validate the benefit of our method in practical dose\ncalculation, achieving a remarkable 93.8% gamma passing rate with a 2%/2mm\ncriterion, superior to other methods. Conclusion: The proposed HC$^3$L-Diff can\nefficiently achieve high-quality CBCT-to-CT synthesis in only over 2 mins per\npatient. Its promising performance in dose calculation shows great potential\nfor enhancing real-world adaptive radiotherapy.",

To address this issue, we propose a conditional\ncontrollable fusion (CCF) framework for general image fusion tasks without\nspecific training. Due to the dynamic differences of different samples, our CCF\nemploys specific fusion constraints for each individual in practice.

The appropriate conditions are dynamically selected to ensure the\nfusion process remains responsive to the specific requirements in each reverse\ndiffusion stage.

Previous jailbreak methods primarily\nexploited the internal properties or capabilities of LLMs, such as\noptimization-based jailbreak methods and methods that leveraged the model's\ncontext-learning abilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak\nmethod, SQL Injection Jailbreak (SIJ), which targets the external properties of\nLLMs, specifically, the way LLMs construct input prompts. By injecting\njailbreak information into user prompts, SIJ successfully induces the model to\noutput harmful content.

For closed-source\nmodels, SIJ achieves an average attack success rate over 85% across five models\nin the GPT and Doubao series. Additionally, SIJ exposes a new vulnerability in\nLLMs that urgently requires mitigation.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has excelled in medical image classification, but its clinical\napplication is limited by poor interpretability. Capsule networks, known for\nencoding hierarchical relationships and spatial features, show potential in\naddressing this issue. Nevertheless, traditional capsule networks often\nunderperform due to their shallow structures, and deeper variants lack\nhierarchical architectures, thereby compromising interpretability. This paper\nintroduces a novel capsule network, ParseCaps, which utilizes the sparse axial\nattention routing and parse convolutional capsule layer to form a\nparse-tree-like structure, enhancing both depth and interpretability. Firstly,\nsparse axial attention routing optimizes connections between child and parent\ncapsules, as well as emphasizes the weight distribution across instantiation\nparameters of parent capsules. Secondly, the parse convolutional capsule layer\ngenerates capsule predictions aligning with the parse tree. Finally, based on\nthe loss design that is effective whether concept ground truth exists or not,\nParseCaps advances interpretability by associating each dimension of the global\ncapsule with a comprehensible concept, thereby facilitating clinician trust and\nunderstanding of the model's classification results. Experimental results on\nCE-MRI, PH$^2$, and Derm7pt datasets show that ParseCaps not only outperforms\nother capsule network variants in classification accuracy, redundancy reduction\nand robustness, but also provides interpretable explanations, regardless of the\navailability of concept labels.",

However, increasing the number of propagation layers\nin GNNs can lead to feature redundancy, which may negatively impact the overall\nrecommendation performance. In addition, the existing recommendation task\nmethod directly maps the preprocessed multimodal features to the\nlow-dimensional space, which will bring the noise unrelated to user preference,\nthus affecting the representation ability of the model. To tackle the\naforementioned challenges, we propose Multimodal Graph Neural Network for\nRecommendation (MGNM) with Dynamic De-redundancy and Modality-Guided Feature\nDe-noisy, which is divided into local and global interaction. Initially, in the\nlocal interaction process,we integrate a dynamic de-redundancy (DDR) loss\nfunction which is achieved by utilizing the product of the feature coefficient\nmatrix and the feature matrix as a penalization factor. It reduces the feature\nredundancy effects of multimodal and behavioral features caused by the stacking\nof multiple GNN layers. Subsequently, in the global interaction process, we\ndeveloped modality-guided global feature purifiers for each modality to\nalleviate the impact of modality noise. It is a two-fold guiding mechanism\neliminating modality features that are irrelevant to user preferences and\ncaptures complex relationships within the modality.

Moreover, we present a number of fascinating applications.\nSpecifically: i) Resolving a conjecture proposed by the third author, we\ndemonstrate that under certain conditions, every graph cospectral with a graph\n$G$ is determined by its generalized spectrum. ii) We demonstrate that whenever\nthe complements of two trees are cospectral, then one tree has a perfect\nmatching if and only if the other does. An analogous result holds for the\nexistence of triangles in general graphs. iii) An unexpected connection to the\npolynomial reconstruction problem is also provided, showing that the parity of\nthe constant term of the characteristic polynomial is reconstructible.",

Within density functional theory, when using various\nexchange-correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the\nspin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which\nis directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and\nchallenges the description of molecular dissociation.

    "abstract": "Purpose: With the development of spectral CT, several novel spectral filters\nhave been introduced to modulate the spectra, such as split filters and\nspectral modulators. However, due to the finite size of the focal spot of X-ray\nsource, these filters cause spectral mixing in the penumbra region. Traditional\nspectrum estimation methods fail to account for it, resulting in reduced\nspectral accuracy. Methods: To address this challenge, we develop a multi-ray\nspectrum estimation model and propose an Adaptive Subsampled WeIghting of\nFilter Thickness (A-SWIFT) method. First, we estimate the unfiltered spectrum\nusing traditional methods. Next, we model the final spectra as a weighted\nsummation of spectra attenuated by multiple filters. The weights and equivalent\nlengths are obtained by X-ray transmission measurements taken with altered\nspectra using different kVp or flat filters. Finally, the spectra are\napproximated by using the multi-ray model. To mimic the penumbra effect, we\nused a spectral modulator (0.2 mm Mo, 0.6 mm Mo) and a split filter (0.07 mm\nAu, 0.7 mm Sn) in simulations, and used a copper modulator and a molybdenum\nmodulator (0.2 mm, 0.6 mm) in experiments. Results: Simulation results show\nthat the mean energy bias in the penumbra region decreased from 7.43 keV using\nthe previous SCFM method (Spectral Compensation for Modulator) to 0.72 keV\nusing the A-SWIFT method for the split filter, and from 1.98 keV to 0.61 keV\nfor the spectral modulator. In experiments, the root mean square error of the\nselected ROIs was decreased from 77 to 7 Hounsfield units (HU) for the pure\nwater phantom with a molybdenum modulator, and from 85 to 21 HU with a copper\nmodulator. Conclusion: Based on a multi-ray spectrum estimation model, the\nA-SWIFT method provides an accurate and robust approach for spectrum estimation\nin penumbra region of CT systems utilizing spectral filters.",

However, computing the attention matrix in traditional\ndot-product attention mechanisms results in a quadratic complexity with\nsequence lengths, leading to high computational costs for long-term sequential\nrecommendation. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel\nL2-Normalized Linear Attention for the Transformer-based Sequential Recommender\nSystems (LinRec), which theoretically improves efficiency while preserving the\nlearning capabilities of the traditional dot-product attention. Specifically,\nby thoroughly examining the equivalence conditions of efficient attention\nmechanisms, we show that LinRec possesses linear complexity while preserving\nthe property of attention mechanisms. In addition, we reveal its latent\nefficiency properties by interpreting the proposed LinRec mechanism through a\nstatistical lens. Extensive experiments are conducted based on two public\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating that the combination of LinRec and\nTransformer models achieves comparable or even superior performance than\nstate-of-the-art Transformer-based SRS models while significantly improving\ntime and memory efficiency.",

The volume change may predominantly\noccur in either of these two phases, as we demonstrate for the scenarios of\nregulatory volume decrease and increase.

Additionally, the framework not only ensures coherence among\nforecasts but also improves overall accuracy throughout the hierarchy. Its\ninherent flexibility and interpretability enable users to perform hierarchical\nforecast updating concisely. The methodology is extensively demonstrated in a\nsimulation study with various settings and comparing different data-generating\nprocesses, hierarchies, and reconciliation methods. Practical applicability is\nillustrated through two case studies in the energy sector, energy generation\nand solar power data, where the framework yields superior results compared to\nbase models that do not incorporate new data, leading to more precise\ndecision-making outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Assuming that a cosmological model can describe the whole Universe history,\nwe look for the conditions of a cosmological bounce thus in agreement with late\ntime observations. Our approach involves casting such a theory into General\nRelativity with curvature ($\\Omega_{\\kappa}$), matter ($\\Omega_{m}$), radiation\n($\\Omega_{r}$) and an effective dark fluid ($\\Omega_{d}$) and formulating the\ncorresponding field equations as a 2D dynamical system, wherein phase space\npoints corresponding to extrema of the metric function are constrained by\nobservational data. We show that if this effective dark fluid density is\npositive at the bounce, these observational constraints imply its occurrence in\nthe future at a redshift $z<-0.81$ whatever the cosmological model (dark\nenergy, brane, $f(R)$, etc.) corresponding to this effective dark fluid and\neven with a positive curvature. Hence, the effective dark fluid density must be\nnegative at the bounce such as it arises for $z>-0.81$ and thus possibly in the\npast. Observations also impose that the dark fluid effective density can change\nsign only within the redshift range $0.54<z<0.61$. We then proceed by examining\n3 cosmological models: a non linear dark fluid model, a Randall Sundrum brane\nmodel and a $f(R)=R+mR^n+\\Lambda$ model. For each of them, we examine the\nconditions for (1) a bounce at early time, (2) with a negative effective dark\nfluid energy density, (3) this having to change sign within the above specified\nredshift interval. We find that none of these three models satisfy all three\nconstraints. We conclude that while a negative effective dark fluid energy\ndensity required by observational constraints for a bounce at early times\nfacilitates this bounce, the requirement for $\\Omega_d$ to change sign and\nbecome positive within the above specified narrow redshift interval proves\nexceedingly challenging to satisfy these same constraints.",

    "abstract": "We attempt to characterize irreversibility of a dynamical system from the\nexistence of different forward and backward mathematical representations\ndepending on the direction of the time arrow. Such different representations\nhave been studied intensively and are shown to exist for stochastic diffusion\nmodels. In this setting one has however to face the preliminary justification\nof the existence of a stochastic description for physical systems which are\ntraditionally described by classical mechanics as inherently deterministic and\nconservative.\n  In part one of this paper we have addressed this modeling problem from a\ndeterministic viewpoint for linear systems. We have shown that there are\nforward-backward representations which can describe conservative finite\ndimensional deterministic systems when they are coupled to an\ninfinite-dimensional conservative heat bath. A key observation is that the heat\nbath acts on the finite-dimensional system by {\\em state-feedback} which can\nshift its eigenvalues to make the system dissipative, but also may generate a\ntotally unstable system which naturally evolves backward in time.\n  In this second part, we address the stochastic description of these two\nrepresentations. Under a natural family of invariant measures it is shown that\nthe heat bath induces a white noise input acting on both the forward-backward\nrepresentations making them true dissipative diffusions. We also consider how\nto relate the Stochastics to the Hamiltonian deterministic picture discussed in\nPart one. In our current context, we show that a continuous stationary process\nwith a rational spectrum can always be thought of, or represented as, the\noutput of a lossless deterministic system coupled to an infinite dimensional\nheat bath.",

However, its\ncomplexity grows exponentially with the channel memory, posing a significant\ncomputational burden. In contrast, the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)\nequalizer offers a notably simpler solution, albeit with reduced performance\ncompared to the BCJR. Recently, Neural Network (NN) based equalizers have\nemerged as promising alternatives. Trained to map observations to the original\ntransmitted symbols, these NNs demonstrate performance similar to the BCJR\nalgorithm. However, they often entail a high number of learnable parameters,\nresulting in complexities comparable to or even larger than the BCJR. This\npaper explores the potential of NN-based equalization with a reduced number of\nlearnable parameters and low complexity. We introduce a NN equalizer with\ncomplexity comparable to LMMSE, surpassing LMMSE performance and achieving a\nmodest performance gap from the BCJR equalizer. A significant challenge with\nNNs featuring a limited parameter count is their susceptibility to converging\nto local minima, leading to suboptimal performance.

FaceDig is open-source and integrates\nseamlessly with analytical platforms like R and Python. It was trained using\none of the largest and most ethnically diverse face datasets, applying a\nlandmark configuration optimized for 2D enface photographs. Our results\ndemonstrate that FaceDig provides reliable landmark coordinates, comparable to\nthose placed manually by experts. The tool's output is compatible with the\nwidely-used TpsDig2 software, facilitating adoption and ensuring consistency\nacross studies. Users are advised to work with standardized facial images and\nvisually inspect the results for potential corrections. Despite the growing\npreference for 3D morphometrics, 2D facial photographs remain valuable due to\ntheir cultural and practical significance. Future enhancements to FaceDig will\ninclude support for profile views, further expanding its utility. By offering a\nstandardized approach to landmark placement, FaceDig promotes reproducibility\nin facial morphology research and provides a robust alternative to existing 2D\ntools.",

The proposed framework attempts\nto address the challenge of including the rainflow algorithm for cycle counting\nby directly developing a closed-form of marginal degradation as a function of\ndispatch decisions. Further, this closed-form degradation profile is embedded\ninto an energy portfolio allocation (EPA) problem designed for making the\noptimal dispatch decisions for all the batteries together, in a shared economy\nmanner. We term the entity taking these decisions as `facilitator' which works\nas a link between storage units and market operators. The proposed EPA\nformulation is quipped with a conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR)-based mechanism\nto bring risk-averseness against uncertainty in market prices. The proposed\nDI-EPA problem introduces fairness by dividing the profits into various units\nusing the idea of marginal contribution. Simulation results regarding the\naccuracy of the closed-form of degradation, effectiveness of CVaR in handling\nuncertainty within the EPA problem, and fairness in the context of degradation\nawareness are discussed.

    "abstract": "Humans excel at detecting and segmenting moving objects according to the\nGestalt principle of \"common fate\". Remarkably, previous works have shown that\nhuman perception generalizes this principle in a zero-shot fashion to unseen\ntextures or random dots. In this work, we seek to better understand the\ncomputational basis for this capability by evaluating a broad range of optical\nflow models and a neuroscience inspired motion energy model for zero-shot\nfigure-ground segmentation of random dot stimuli. Specifically, we use the\nextensively validated motion energy model proposed by Simoncelli and Heeger in\n1998 which is fitted to neural recordings in cortex area MT. We find that a\ncross section of 40 deep optical flow models trained on different datasets\nstruggle to estimate motion patterns in random dot videos, resulting in poor\nfigure-ground segmentation performance. Conversely, the neuroscience-inspired\nmodel significantly outperforms all optical flow models on this task. For a\ndirect comparison to human perception, we conduct a psychophysical study using\na shape identification task as a proxy to measure human segmentation\nperformance. All state-of-the-art optical flow models fall short of human\nperformance, but only the motion energy model matches human capability. This\nneuroscience-inspired model successfully addresses the lack of human-like\nzero-shot generalization to random dot stimuli in current computer vision\nmodels, and thus establishes a compelling link between the Gestalt psychology\nof human object perception and cortical motion processing in the brain.\n  Code, models and datasets are available at\nhttps://github.com/mtangemann/motion_energy_segmentation",

A well-known class of\noptimal (classical) LRCs are subcodes of Reed-Solomon codes constructed using a\nspecial type of polynomials called good polynomials.

While these\nmethods achieve high performance, manually setting prior anchors is cumbersome,\nand ensuring sufficient coverage across diverse datasets often requires a large\namount of dense anchors. Furthermore, the use of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)\nto eliminate redundant predictions complicates real-world deployment and may\nunderperform in complex scenarios.

The radio data are represented by the 1-22 GHz measurements\nfrom the RATAN-600 radio telescope, the 5 and 8 GHz data from the RT-32\ntelescopes, and the 37 GHz data from the RT-22 telescope. The optical\nmeasurements in the $R$-band were collected with the 1-m Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-m\nAS-500/2 telescopes. Additionally we used the archive data at 230~GHz from the\nSMA and the $\\gamma$-ray data in the 0.1-100 GeV band from the Fermi-LAT point\nsource 4FGL-DR2 catalogue. The variability properties during four epochs\ncontaining major flares and one epoch of relatively low activity were analysed.\nA significant correlation ($\\geq\\!2\\sigma$) between the radio, optical, and\n$\\gamma$-ray bands is found for all these periods with time delays from 0 to\n1.7 yrs. The relation between time delay and frequency is described by a linear\nlaw with a negative slope of -10 day/GHz. The discovered properties of MW\nvariability for the low activity period and for flaring states suggest that the\nmechanisms dominating the radio-$\\gamma$-ray variations are not substantially\ndifferent. The detected quasi-periodic oscillations of about 6 and 2 years are\ntentative, as the time span of the observations includes fewer than 4 full\ncycles for the radio and optical data and only about 3 cycles for the Fermi-LAT\ndata. The physical parameters of the radio jet were obtained using the Hedgehog\nmodel applied to the average radio spectrum of AO 0235+164 in the range 0.1-300\nGHz. The effectiveness of replacing electrons with protons in the synchrotron\nradio emission of relativistic jets is shown for describing the nature of\nblazars and the generation of high energy neutrinos.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies on large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models\n(LMMs) have demonstrated promising skills in various domains including science\nand mathematics. However, their capability in more challenging and real-world\nrelated scenarios like engineering has not been systematically studied. To\nbridge this gap, we propose EEE-Bench, a multimodal benchmark aimed at\nassessing LMMs' capabilities in solving practical engineering tasks, using\nelectrical and electronics engineering (EEE) as the testbed. Our benchmark\nconsists of 2860 carefully curated problems spanning 10 essential subdomains\nsuch as analog circuits, control systems, etc. Compared to benchmarks in other\ndomains, engineering problems are intrinsically 1) more visually complex and\nversatile and 2) less deterministic in solutions. Successful solutions to these\nproblems often demand more-than-usual rigorous integration of visual and\ntextual information as models need to understand intricate images like abstract\ncircuits and system diagrams while taking professional instructions, making\nthem excellent candidates for LMM evaluations. Alongside EEE-Bench, we provide\nextensive quantitative evaluations and fine-grained analysis of 17 widely-used\nopen and closed-sourced LLMs and LMMs. Our results demonstrate notable\ndeficiencies of current foundation models in EEE, with an average performance\nranging from 19.48% to 46.78%. Finally, we reveal and explore a critical\nshortcoming in LMMs which we term laziness: the tendency to take shortcuts by\nrelying on the text while overlooking the visual context when reasoning for\ntechnical image problems. In summary, we believe EEE-Bench not only reveals\nsome noteworthy limitations of LMMs but also provides a valuable resource for\nadvancing research on their application in practical engineering tasks, driving\nfuture improvements in their capability to handle complex, real-world\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL), with the growing IoT and edge computing, is seen as\na promising solution for applications that are latency- and privacy-aware.\nHowever, due to the widespread dispersion of data across many clients, it is\nchallenging to monitor client anomalies caused by malfunctioning devices or\nunexpected events. The majority of FL solutions now in use concentrate on the\nclassification problem, ignoring situations in which anomaly detection may also\nnecessitate privacy preservation and effectiveness. The system in federated\nlearning is unable to manage the potentially flawed behavior of its clients\ncompletely. These behaviors include sharing arbitrary parameter values and\ncausing a delay in convergence since clients are chosen at random without\nknowing the malfunctioning behavior of the client. Client selection is crucial\nin terms of the efficiency of the federated learning framework. The challenges\nsuch as client drift and handling slow clients with low computational\ncapability are well-studied in FL. However, the detection of anomalous clients\neither for security or for overall performance in the FL frameworks is hardly\nstudied in the literature. In this paper, we propose an anomaly client\ndetection algorithm to overcome malicious client attacks and client drift in FL\nframeworks. Instead of random client selection, our proposed method utilizes\nanomaly client detection to remove clients from the FL framework, thereby\nenhancing the security and efficiency of the overall system. This proposed\nmethod improves the global model convergence in almost 50\\% fewer communication\nrounds compared with widely used random client selection using the MNIST\ndataset.",

The extended emission in the prompt emission, flares and\nplateaus in X-ray afterglow, are proposed to be as the signature of central\nengine re-activity. However, the directly evidence from observations of\nidentifying the central engines remain an open question. In this paper, we\nsystemically search for long-duration GRBs that consist of bumps in X-ray\nafterglow detected by Swift/XRT, and find that the peak time of the X-ray bumps\nexhibit bimodal distribution (defined as early and late bumps) with division\nline at $t=7190$ s. Although we cannot rule out that such a bimodality arises\nfrom selection effects. We proposed that the long-duration GRBs with an early\n(or late) bumps may be originated from the fall-back accretion onto a new-born\nmagnetar (or black hole). By adopting MCMC method to fit the early (or late)\nbumps of X-ray afterglow with the fall-back accretion of magnetar (or black\nhole), it is found that the initial surface magnetic filed and period of\nmagnetars for most early bumps are clustered around $5.88\\times10^{13}$ G and\n$1.04$ ms, respectively. Meanwhile, the derived accretion mass of black hole\nfor late bumps is range of $[4\\times10^{-4}, 1.8\\times10^{-2}]~M_{\\odot}$, and\nthe typical fall-back radius is distributed range of $[1.04, 4.23]\\times\n10^{11}$ cm which is consistent with the typical radius of a Wolf-Rayet star.\nHowever, we also find that the fall-back accretion magnetar model is disfavored\nby the late bumps, but the fall-back accretion of black hole model can not be\nruled out to interpret the early bumps of X-ray afterglow.",

This important result seems to be little known outside of ME; even\nin ME, it has not been made clear before that the method gets sometimes the\nright answer, even though the conditions of the NGM theorem are not all\nsatisfied. Thus, beyond the theorem, there is a heuristic approach, the\nvalidity conditions for which are not sufficiently understood.\n  Thirdly, we show that some simple CRN models with absolute concentration\nrobustness (ACR), are close qualitatively to simple ME models, in the sense\nthat they have an unique disease free equilibrium, and a unique interior fixed\npoint, and the latter enters the positive domain and becomes stable precisely\nwhen $R_0:=s_{dfe} \\mathcal{R}=\\frac{s_{dfe}}{s_e}>1.$\n  (where $s$ denotes the \"ACR species\"). Thus, for these \"ME type models\", a\n\"relay phenomena\" takes place: precisely when the DFE loses stability, a new\nfixed point enters the domain, and takes over.\n  Last but not least, we offer in the associated GitHub repository\nhttps://github.com/adhalanay/epidemiology_crns a Mathematica package, Epid-CRN,\nwhich is addressed to researchers of both disciplines, and provide illustrative\nnotebooks, which in particular solve a few minor open ME and CRN problems.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a more efficient NECIL\nmethod that replaces prototypes with synthesized retrospective features for old\nclasses. Specifically, we model each old class's feature space using a\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution and generate deep representations by\nsampling from high-likelihood regions. Additionally, we introduce a\nsimilarity-based feature compensation mechanism that integrates generated old\nclass features with similar new class features to synthesize robust\nretrospective representations. These retrospective features are then\nincorporated into our incremental learning framework to preserve the decision\nboundaries of previous classes while learning new ones. Extensive experiments\non CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-Subset demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves the efficiency of non-exemplar class-incremental\nlearning and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

The well accepted concept is\nthat a larger band gap (E_g) often leads to a larger intrinsic breakdown\nstrength. In this work, we analytically derive a simplified model of F_bd,\nshowing a linear relationship between F_bd and the maximum electron density of\nstates (DOS_max) within the energy range spanning from the conduction band\nminimum (CBM) to CBM+E_g. Using the Wannier interpolation technique to reduce\nthe cost of calculating the F_bd for various three- and two-dimensional\nmaterials, we find that the calculated F_bd did not show any simple\nrelationship with band gap, but it behaves linearly with the DOS_max,\nconsistent with our theoretical derivation. Our work shows that the DOS_max is\nmore fundamental than the band gap value in determining the F_bd, thus\nproviding useful physical insights into the intrinsic dielectric breakdown\nstrength and opening directions for improving high-power devices. The\ndimensional effects on F_bd has also been revealed that monolayers tend to have\nlarger F_bd due to reduced screening effects.",

We focus on a\ncommon fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and a well-known\nefficient (and fair) notion of the maximum Nash social welfare (Max-NSW). By\nusing properties of matroids, we demonstrate that the Max-NSW allocation,\nimplying Pareto optimality (PO), achieves a tight $1/2$-EF1 under matroid\nconstraints. This result resolves an open question proposed in prior literature\n[26]. In particular, if agents have 2-valued ($\\{1, a\\}$) valuations, we prove\nthat the Max-NSW allocation admits $\\max\\{1/a^2, 1/2\\}$-EF1 and PO.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) systems excel at capturing users' dynamic\npreferences by leveraging their interaction histories. Most existing SR systems\nassign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, and\nvarious types of models are adopted to combine these item embeddings into a\nsequence representation vector to capture the user intent. However, we argue\nthat this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's\nmulti-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Besides, users\noften exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking\nboth action and musical films in the facet of genre), which are challenging to\nfully represent. To address the issues above, we propose a novel structure\ncalled Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential\nRecommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the last\nmulti-head attention layer to predict the next item separately. This approach\ncaptures the potential multi-faceted nature of items without increasing model\ncomplexity. A gating mechanism integrates recommendations from each head and\ndynamically determines their importance. Furthermore, we introduce a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) network in each attention head to disentangle various\nuser preferences within each facet. Each expert within the MoE focuses on a\nspecific preference. A learnable router network is adopted to compute the\nimportance weight for each expert and aggregate them.

This study is conducted to preserve\nthe privacy of training data in the context of customer churn prediction\nmodeling for the telecommunications industry (TCI). In this work, we propose a\nframework for privacy-preserving customer churn prediction (PPCCP) model in the\ncloud environment. We have proposed a novel approach which is a combination of\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and adaptive Weight-of-Evidence (aWOE).\nSynthetic data is generated from GANs, and aWOE is applied on the synthetic\ntraining dataset before feeding the data to the classification algorithms. Our\nexperiments were carried out using eight different machine learning (ML)\nclassifiers on three openly accessible datasets from the telecommunication\nsector. We then evaluated the performance using six commonly employed\nevaluation metrics. In addition to presenting a data privacy analysis, we also\nperformed a statistical significance test. The training and prediction\nprocesses achieve data privacy and the prediction classifiers achieve high\nprediction performance (87.1\\% in terms of F-Measure for GANs-aWOE based\nNa\\\"{\\i}ve Bayes model).

This has greatly hindered the application of\nVQA to downstream tasks, such as ship information analysis based on Synthetic\nAperture Radar (SAR) imagery. To address this challenge, this letter proposes a\nnovel VQA approach that integrates object detection networks with visual\nlanguage models, specifically designed for analyzing ships in SAR images. This\nintegration aims to enhance the capabilities of VQA systems, focusing on\naspects such as ship location, density, and size analysis, as well as risk\nbehavior detection. Initially, we conducted baseline experiments using YOLO\nnetworks on two representative SAR ship detection datasets, SSDD and HRSID, to\nassess each model's performance in terms of detection accuracy. Based on these\nresults, we selected the optimal model, YOLOv8n, as the most suitable detection\nnetwork for this task. Subsequently, leveraging the vision-language model\nQwen2-VL, we designed and implemented a VQA task specifically for SAR scenes.\nThis task employs the ship location and size information output by the\ndetection network to generate multi-turn dialogues and scene descriptions for\nSAR imagery. Experimental results indicate that this method not only enables\nfundamental SAR scene question-answering without the need for additional\ndatasets or fine-tuning but also dynamically adapts to complex, multi-turn\ndialogue requirements, demonstrating robust semantic understanding and\nadaptability.",

Despite its potential, transformer encoders are\nunderutilized due to the collapsed self-attention map, having low\nrepresentation capacity. This work highlights the problem and investigates it\nfrom a new perspective: distortion of query-key embedding space. Based on the\nstatistical analysis, we reveal that queries and keys are mapped in completely\ndifferent spaces while only a few keys are blended into the query region. This\nleads to the collapse of the self-attention map as all queries are considered\nsimilar to those few keys. Therefore, we propose simple but effective solutions\nto activate self-attention. Concretely, we present an auxiliary loss that\naligns queries and keys, preventing the distortion of query-key space and\nencouraging the model to find global relations by self-attention. In addition,\nthe fixed sinusoidal positional encoding is adopted instead of undertrained\nlearnable one to reflect appropriate positional clues into the inputs of\nself-attention.

A key innovation is the use of an adjacency matrix\nas a trainable parameter, optimized through a new adaptive learning rate\ntechnique called AdaRelation, which adjusts based on the historical sensitivity\nof the decoder to changes in the interaction graph. Additionally, a data\naugmentation method named Trajectory Mirror (TM) is introduced to improve\ngeneralization by exposing the model to varied trajectory patterns.\nExperimental results on both synthetic datasets and real-world data (CMU MoCap\nfor human motion) demonstrate that ORI significantly improves the accuracy and\nadaptability of relational inference in dynamic settings compared to existing\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed an explosive growth of AI models. The high cost\nof hosting AI services on GPUs and their demanding service requirements, make\nit timely and challenging to lower service costs and guarantee service quality.\nWhile spot instances have long been offered with a large discount, spot\npreemptions have discouraged users from using them to host model replicas when\nserving AI models.\n  To address this, we propose a simple yet efficient policy, SpotHedge, that\nleverages spot replicas across different failure domains (e.g., regions and\nclouds) to ensure availability, lower costs, and high service quality.\nSpotHedge intelligently spreads spot replicas across different regions and\nclouds to improve availability and reduce correlated preemptions,\noverprovisions cheap spot replicas than required as a safeguard against\npossible preemptions, and dynamically falls back to on-demand replicas when\nspot replicas become unavailable. We built SkyServe, a system leveraging\nSpotHedge to efficiently serve AI models over a mixture of spot and on-demand\nreplicas across regions and clouds. We compared SkyServe with both research and\nproduction systems on real AI workloads: SkyServe reduces cost by 43% on\naverage while achieving high resource availability compared to using on-demand\nreplicas. Additionally, SkyServe improves P50, P90, and P99 latency by\n2.3$\\times$, 2.1$\\times$, 2.1$\\times$ on average compared to other research and\nproduction systems.",

This framework\nassumes that an individual's hazard function is the sum of a known population\nhazard and an excess hazard associated with the cancer. Several estimands are\nderived from the excess hazard, including the \\emph{net survival}, which are\nused to inform decisions and to assess the effectiveness of interventions on\ncancer management. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian machine learning\napproach to estimating the excess hazard and identifying vulnerable subgroups,\nwith a higher excess risk, using Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). We\nfirst develop a proportional hazards extension of the BART model to the\nrelative survival setting, and then extend this model to non-proportional\nhazards.

Inspired by the flight of $\\textit{Cynopterus brachyotis}$, the lesser\nshort-nosed fruit bat, we built a two-degree-of-freedom flapping wing platform\nwith variable wing folding capability. In late upstroke, the wings \"clap\" and\nproduce an air jet that significantly increases lift production, with a\npositive peak matched to that produced in downstroke. Though ventral clapping\nhas been observed in avian flight, potential aerodynamic benefit of this\nbehavior has yet to be rigorously assessed. We used multiple approaches --\nquasi-steady modeling, direct force/power measurement, and PIV experiments in a\nwind tunnel -- to understand critical aspects of lift/power variation in\nrelation to wing folding magnitude over Strouhal numbers between $St = 0.2 -\n0.4$. While lift increases monotonically with folding amplitude in that range,\npower economy (ratio of lift/power) is more nuanced. At $St = 0.2 - 0.3$, it\nincrease with wing folding amplitude monotonically. At $St = 0.3 - 0.4$, it\nfeatures two maxima -- one at medium folding amplitude ($\\sim 30^\\circ$), and\nthe other at maximum folding.

However, deploying MoE-based LLMs on\nmemoryconstrained edge devices remains challenging due to their substantial\nmemory requirements. While existing expertoffloading methods alleviate the\nmemory requirements, they often incur significant expert-loading costs or\ncompromise model accuracy. We present HOBBIT, a mixed precision expert\noffloading system to enable flexible and efficient MoE inference. Our key\ninsight is that dynamically replacing less critical cache-miss experts with low\nprecision versions can substantially reduce expert-loading latency while\npreserving model accuracy. HOBBIT introduces three innovative techniques that\nmap the natural hierarchy of MoE computation: (1) a token-level dynamic expert\nloading mechanism, (2) a layer-level adaptive expert prefetching technique, and\n(3) a sequence-level multidimensional expert caching policy. These innovations\nfully leverage the benefits of mixedprecision expert inference. By implementing\nHOBBIT on top of the renowned LLM inference framework Llama.cpp, we evaluate\nits performance across different edge devices with representative MoE models.\nThe results demonstrate that HOBBIT achieves up to a 9.93x speedup in decoding\ncompared to state-of-the-art MoE offloading systems.",

In the context of quantum gravity this is called \"the problem of time\".\nA crucial difference is that time $t$ may be seen as an observable in\nrelativity theory, just like position $x$, whereas in quantum theory $t$ is a\nparameter, in contrast to the observable $x$. Aiming to resolve the\ndiscrepancy, a formalization of time in the spirit of Kant's Copernican\nrevolution is suggested, where it is required that the treatment of time in\nphysics agree with our cognition. This leads to reconsideration of the notions\nof identity and change of objects, as well as the nature of physical states and\ntheir evolution. The formalization has two components: sequential time $n$ and\nrelational time $t$. The evolution of physical states is described in terms of\n$n$, which is updated each time an event occurs. The role of $t$ is to quantify\ndistances between events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with\neach $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal\ndistances between present and past events. A universal ordering of events in\nterms of $n$ can be postulated even though distances $t$ are relativistic. In\nshort, it is argued that time as a sequential flow of events should be\nseparated from time as a measure of distance between events. In physical\nmodels, these aspects of time can be expressed as one evolution parameter and\none observable, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The streaming bipartite graph is extensively used to model the dynamic\nrelationship between two types of entities in many real-world applications,\nsuch as movie recommendations, location-based services, and online shopping.\nSince it contains abundant information, discovering the dense subgraph with\nhigh structural cohesiveness (i.e., community detection) in the bipartite\nstreaming graph is becoming a valuable problem. Inspired by this, in this\npaper, we study the structure of community on the butterfly motif in the\nbipartite graph. We propose a novel problem, named Community Detection over\nStreaming Bipartite Network (CD-SBN), which aims to retrieve qualified\ncommunities with user-specific query keywords and high structural cohesiveness\nat snapshot and continuous scenarios. In particular, we formulate the user\nrelationship score in the weighted bipartite network via the butterfly pattern\nand define a novel $(k,r,\\sigma)$-bitruss as the community structure. To\nefficiently tackle the CD-SBN problem, we design effective pruning strategies\nto rule out false alarms of $(k,r,\\sigma)$-bitruss and propose a hierarchical\nsynopsis to facilitate the CD-SBN processing. Due to the dynamic of streaming\nbipartite networks, we devise an efficient procedure for incremental graph\nmaintenance. We develop an efficient algorithm to answer the snapshot and\ncontinuous CD-SBN query by traversing the synopsis and applying the pruning\nstrategies. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of our proposed CD-SBN processing approach over real/synthetic\nstreaming bipartite networks.",

Using 1D string-based representations for drugs and targets is a\ncommon approach that has demonstrated good results in drug-target affinity\nprediction. However, these approach lacks information on the relative position\nof the atoms and bonds. To address this limitation, graph-based representations\nhave been used to some extent. However, solely considering the structural\naspect of drugs and targets may be insufficient for accurate DTA prediction.\nIntegrating the functional aspect of these drugs at the genetic level can\nenhance the prediction capability of the models. To fill this gap, we propose\nGramSeq-DTA, which integrates chemical perturbation information with the\nstructural information of drugs and targets. We applied a Grammar Variational\nAutoencoder (GVAE) for drug feature extraction and utilized two different\napproaches for protein feature extraction: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\nand Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The chemical perturbation data is obtained\nfrom the L1000 project, which provides information on the upregulation and\ndownregulation of genes caused by selected drugs. This chemical perturbation\ninformation is processed, and a compact dataset is prepared, serving as the\nfunctional feature set of the drugs. By integrating the drug, gene, and target\nfeatures in the model, our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art\nDTA prediction models when validated on widely used DTA datasets (BindingDB,\nDavis, and KIBA).

This study presents a\nproof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular\nTime-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients.\nIn contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering\nor utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST\nintegrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications,\nand vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a\nhierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among\nfeatures within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different\ntimestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated\nusing the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals),\nMITST achieves a statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) average improvement of\n1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art\nrandom forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but\nlife-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially\nenabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible\narchitecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without\nretraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision\nsupport. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate\nMITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital\nmortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in\nICU settings.

A prominent\nsource of such inefficiency is the deadhead miles. This issue becomes\nespecially severe during high-demand periods, when the volume of ride requests\nexceeds the available driver supply, leading to suboptimal rider-to-driver\nassignments, longer deadhead trips, and increased emissions. Although limiting\nthese unproductive miles can reduce emissions, doing so may increase passenger\nwait times due to limited driver availability, thereby degrading the overall\nservice experience.

While LARA is\napplicable in general settings, it is particularly effective during peak demand\nperiods, achieving reductions in both emissions and wait times.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning has developed very fast in recent years. However, during\nthe multimodal training process, the model tends to rely on only one modality\nbased on which it could learn faster, thus leading to inadequate use of other\nmodalities. Existing methods to balance the training process always have some\nlimitations on the loss functions, optimizers and the number of modalities and\nonly consider modulating the magnitude of the gradients while ignoring the\ndirections of the gradients. To solve these problems, in this paper, we present\na novel method to balance multimodal learning with Classifier-Guided Gradient\nModulation (CGGM), considering both the magnitude and directions of the\ngradients. We conduct extensive experiments on four multimodal datasets:\nUPMC-Food 101, CMU-MOSI, IEMOCAP and BraTS 2021, covering classification,\nregression and segmentation tasks. The results show that CGGM outperforms all\nthe baselines and other state-of-the-art methods consistently, demonstrating\nits effectiveness and versatility.

Despite the importance of deduplication, several drawbacks of the\nmethod, such as storage robustness and file fragmentation, have not been\npreviously analyzed from a theoretical point of view. Storage robustness\npertains to ensuring that deduplicated data can be used to reconstruct the\noriginal files without service disruptions and data loss. Fragmentation\npertains to the problems of placing deduplicated data chunks of different user\nfiles in a proximity-preserving linear order, since neighboring chunks of the\nsame file may be stored in sectors far apart on the server. This work proposes\na new theoretical model for data fragmentation and introduces novel graph- and\ncoding-theoretic approaches for reducing fragmentation via limited duplication\n(repetition coding) and coded deduplication (e.g., linear coding). In addition\nto alleviating issues with fragmentation, limited duplication and coded\ndeduplication can also serve the dual purpose of increasing the robusteness of\nthe system design. The contributions of our work are three-fold. First, we\ndescribe a new model for file structures in the form of self-avoiding (simple)\npaths in specialized graphs. Second, we introduce several new metrics for\nmeasuring the fragmentation level in deduplication systems on graph-structured\nfiles, including the stretch metric that captures the worst-case \"spread\" of\nadjacent data chunks within a file when deduplicated and placed on the server;\nand, the jump metric that captures the worst-case number of times during the\nreconstruction process of a file that one has to change the readout location on\nthe server.

The estimated polarization deviates from zero\nwith a statistical significance of $0.07\\sigma$ with the data statistics\ncollected from 2010 to 2011 and $0.15\\sigma$ with the one from 2015 to 2018.

Traditional\nlearning-based approaches often consider registration networks as black boxes\nwithout interpretability. One core insight is that disentangling alignment\nfeatures and non-alignment features across modalities bring benefits.\nMeanwhile, it is challenging for the prominent methods for image registration\ntasks, such as convolutional neural networks, to capture long-range\ndependencies by their local receptive fields. The methods often fail when the\ngiven image pair has a large misalignment due to the lack of effectively\nlearning long-range dependencies and correspondence. In this paper, we propose\nMambaReg, a novel Mamba-based architecture that integrates Mamba's strong\ncapability in capturing long sequences to address these challenges. With our\nproposed several sub-modules, MambaReg can effectively disentangle\nmodality-independent features responsible for registration from\nmodality-dependent, non-aligning features. By selectively attending to the\nrelevant features, our network adeptly captures the correlation between\nmulti-modal images, enabling focused deformation field prediction and precise\nimage alignment. The Mamba-based architecture seamlessly integrates the local\nfeature extraction power of convolutional layers with the long-range dependency\nmodeling capabilities of Mamba. Experiments on public non-rigid RGB-IR image\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming existing\napproaches in terms of registration accuracy and deformation field smoothness.",

The\nkey idea is clustering to group states that are easily reachable from one\nanother by the current policy under training in a latent space and traversing\nto states holding significant exploration potential on the boundary of these\nclusters before doing exploratory behavior. In challenging robotics\nenvironments including navigating a maze with a multi-legged ant robot,\nmanipulating objects with a robot arm on a cluttered tabletop, and rotating\nobjects in the palm of an anthropomorphic robotic hand, $CE^2$ demonstrates\nsuperior efficiency in exploration compared to baseline methods and ablations.",

It has been shown in our results that there have two\nmain possible mechanisms for the formation of CDs in coal burning dust. One is\nthe self-assembly of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contained in coal or\nproduced by incomplete combustion of coal. The other mechanism is that the\nbridge bonds linking different aromatic structures in coal are breaking which\nwould form CDs with different functional groups when the coals are burning at\nhigh temperature. Under violet light excitation at 310-340 nm or red light at\n610-640 nm, CDs extracted from coal burning dust can emit purple fluorescence\naround 410 nm. The mechanism of up-conversion fluorescence emission of CDs is\ndue to a two-photon absorption process.

Notably, this requires the sketch to obtain more\nprecise estimates for the ranks of elements on the tails of the distribution,\nas compared to the additive $\\pm \\epsilon n$ error regime.\n  Previously, the best-known algorithms for relative error achieved space\n$\\tilde O(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log^{1.5}(\\epsilon n))$ (Cormode, Karnin, Liberty,\nThaler, Vesel{\\`y}, 2021) and $\\tilde O(\\epsilon^{-2}\\log(\\epsilon n))$ (Zhang,\nLin, Xu, Korn, Wang, 2006). In this work, we present a nearly-optimal streaming\nalgorithm for the relative-error quantile estimation problem using $\\tilde\nO(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log(\\epsilon n))$ space, which almost matches the trivial\n$\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-1} \\log (\\epsilon n))$ lower bound.\n  To surpass the $\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-1}\\log^{1.5}(\\epsilon n))$ barrier of the\nprevious approach, our algorithm crucially relies on a new data structure,\ncalled an elastic compactor, which can be dynamically resized over the course\nof the stream. Interestingly, we design a space allocation scheme which\nadaptively allocates space to each compactor based on the \"hardness\" of the\ninput stream. This approach allows us to avoid using the maximal space\nsimultaneously for every compactor and facilitates the improvement in the total\nspace complexity.\n  Along the way, we also propose and study a new problem called the Top\nQuantiles Problem, which only requires the sketch to provide estimates for a\nfixed-length tail of the distribution. This problem serves as an important\nsubproblem in our algorithm, though it is also an interesting problem of its\nown right.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose an automatic method for the analysis of experiments\nthat incorporates hierarchical relationships between the experimental\nvariables. We use a modified version of nonnegative garrote method for variable\nselection which can incorporate hierarchical relationships. The nonnegative\ngarrote method requires a good initial estimate of the regression parameters\nfor it to work well. To obtain the initial estimate, we use generalized ridge\nregression with the ridge parameters estimated from a Gaussian process prior\nplaced on the underlying input-output relationship. The proposed method, called\nHiGarrote, is fast, easy to use, and requires no manual tuning. Analysis of\nseveral real experiments are presented to demonstrate its benefits over the\nexisting methods.",

    "abstract": "Reliable Bayesian predictive inference has long been an open problem under\nunidentified transformation models, since the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nchains of posterior predictive distribution (PPD) values are generally poorly\nmixed. We address the poorly mixed PPD value chains under unidentified\ntransformation models through an adaptive scheme for prior adjustment.\nSpecifically, we originate a conception of sufficient informativeness, which\nexplicitly quantifies the information level provided by nonparametric priors,\nand assesses MCMC mixing by comparison with the within-chain MCMC variance. We\nformulate the prior information level by a set of hyperparameters induced from\nthe nonparametric prior elicitation with an analytic expression, which is\nguaranteed by asymptotic theory for the posterior variance under unidentified\ntransformation models. The analytic prior information level consequently drives\na hyperparameter tuning procedure to achieve MCMC mixing. The proposed method\nis general enough to cover various data domains through a multiplicative error\nworking model. Comprehensive simulations and real-world data analysis\ndemonstrate that our method successfully achieves MCMC mixing and outperforms\nstate-of-the-art competitors in predictive capability.",
