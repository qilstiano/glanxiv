However, in finite horizon scenarios, where input lengths are\nfinite, determining the optimal stopping rule becomes computationally intensive\ndue to the need for backward induction, limiting practical applicability. We\nthus introduce FIRMBOUND, an SPRT-based framework that efficiently estimates\nthe solution to backward induction from training data, bridging the gap between\noptimal stopping theory and real-world deployment. It employs density ratio\nestimation and convex function learning to provide statistically consistent\nestimators for sufficient statistic and conditional expectation, both essential\nfor solving backward induction; consequently, FIRMBOUND minimizes Bayes risk to\nreach optimality.

The optimal scattering control of the spider diffusion at the junction\npoint is governed by an appropriate and highly non-trivial condition of the\nKirchhoff Law type, involving an optimal diffraction probability measure\nselected from the own local time of the spider process at the vertex. In this\nwork, we prove first the weak dynamic programming principle in the spirit of\n[32], adapted to the new class of spider diffusion introduced recently in\n[37]-[38]. Thereafter, we show that the value function of the problem is\ncharacterized uniquely in terms of a Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) system posed\non a star-shaped network, having a new boundary condition at the vertex called\n: non linear local-time Kirchhoff's transmission. The key main point is to use\nthe recent comparison theorem obtained in [40], that has significantly unlocked\nthe study of this type of problem. We conclude by discussing the formulation of\nstochastic scattering control problems, where there is no dependency w.r.t. the\nlocal-time variable, for which their well-posedness appear as a simpler\nconsequence of the results of this work and the advances contained in [40].",

We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness\nmetric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding\nfeatures. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find\nthat all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical\ncenter to a strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are\nobserved. Only one model so far has a robustness index greater than one,\nmeaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. A\nquantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on\nFM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of\nunrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that\ncancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable\nto same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical\ncenter. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly\norganized by medical centers than by biological factors.

    "abstract": "How has the public responded to the increasing prevalence of artificial\nintelligence (AI)-based technologies? We investigate public perceptions of AI\nby collecting over 12,000 responses over 12 months from a nationally\nrepresentative U.S. sample. Participants provided open-ended metaphors\nreflecting their mental models of AI, a methodology that overcomes the\nlimitations of traditional self-reported measures by capturing more nuance.\nUsing a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative clustering and\nqualitative coding, we identify 20 dominant metaphors shaping public\nunderstanding of AI. To analyze these metaphors systematically, we present a\nscalable framework integrating language modeling (LM)-based techniques to\nmeasure key dimensions of public perception: anthropomorphism (attribution of\nhuman-like qualities), warmth, and competence. We find that Americans generally\nview AI as warm and competent, and that over the past year, perceptions of AI's\nhuman-likeness and warmth have significantly increased ($+34\\%, r = 0.80, p <\n0.01; +41\\%, r = 0.62, p < 0.05$). These implicit perceptions, along with the\nidentified dominant metaphors, strongly predict trust in and willingness to\nadopt AI ($r^2 = 0.21, 0.18, p < 0.001$). Moreover, we uncover systematic\ndemographic differences in metaphors and implicit perceptions, such as the\nhigher propensity of women, older individuals, and people of color to\nanthropomorphize AI, which shed light on demographic disparities in trust and\nadoption. In addition to our dataset and framework for tracking evolving public\nattitudes, we provide actionable insights on using metaphors for inclusive and\nresponsible AI development.",

Empirical evidence from surveys and historical data reveal that\npatenting remains an exception rather than a rule in many, but not all,\nindustries.

Inspired by the widespread improvement of transport quality when\ntwo-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials are gated exclusively by other\nvdW materials, we have developed a method for gating non-vdW materials with an\nall-vdW gate stack, consisting of a hexagonal boron nitride dielectric layer\nand a few-layer graphite gate electrode. We demonstrate this gating approach on\nMOVPE-grown InSb nanoribbons (NRs), a novel variant of the InSb nanowire, with\na flattened cross-section. In our all-vdW gated NR devices we observe\nconductance features that are reproducible and have low- to near-zero gate\nhysteresis. We also report quantized conductance, which persists to lower\nmagnetic fields and longer channel lengths than typical InSb nanowire devices\nreported to date. Additionally, we observe level splitting that is highly\nanisotropic in an applied magnetic field, which we attribute to the ribbon\ncross-section. The performance of our devices is consistent with the reduced\ndisorder expected from the all-vdW gating scheme, and marks the first report of\nballistic, few-modes quantum transport in a non-vdW material with an all-vdW\ngate. Our results establish all-vdW gating as a promising approach for\nhigh-quality gating of non-vdW materials for quantum transport, which is in\nprinciple applicable generically, beyond InSb systems. In addition, the work\nshowcases the specific potential of all-vdW gate/InSb NR devices for enabling\nclean quantum devices that may be relevant for spintronics and topological\nsuperconductivity studies.",

Inverse Compton scattering becomes increasingly effective\nat hardening spectral outputs with increasing black hole spin, and becomes the\ndominant mechanism for photons that escape with energies between 10 to several\nhundred keV.

This phenomenon\nis characterized by the spontaneous symmetry breaking of discrete\ntime-translation and provides a rich playground to study a fundamental question\nin statistical physics: what mechanism allows for driven quantum systems to\nexhibit emergent behavior that deviates from their counterparts with\ntime-independent evolution? Unlike equilibrium phases, DTCs exhibit macroscopic\nmanifestations of coherent quantum dynamics, challenging the conventional\nnarrative that thermodynamic behavior universally erases quantum signatures.\nHowever, due to the difficulty of simulating these systems with either\nclassical or quantum computers, previous studies have been limited to a set of\nmodels with Ising-like couplings -- and mostly only in one dimension -- thus\nprecluding our understanding of the existence (or not) of DTCs in models with\ninteractions that closely align with what occurs in nature. In this work, by\ncombining the latest generation of IBM quantum processors with state-of-the-art\ntensor network methods, we are able to demonstrate the existence of a DTC in a\ntwo-dimensional system governed by anisotropic Heisenberg interactions. Our\ncomprehensive analysis reveals a rich phase diagram encompassing spin-glass,\nergodic, and time-crystalline phases, highlighting the tunability of these\nphases through multiple control parameters. Crucially, our results emphasize\nthe interplay of initialization, interaction anisotropy, and driving protocols\nin stabilizing the DTC phase.

With the\ncontinuous spatial and spectral coverage of data from the Multi-Unit\nSpectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), we measure the physical properties in the\nionized gas including the electron density and temperature, excitation, and\nionization. MUSE also provides an excellent view of the famous jets HH 901,\n902, and 1066, revealing them to be high-density, low-ionization outflows\ndespite the harsh environment. HH 901 shows spatially extended [C I] emission\ntracing the rapid dissociation of the photoevaporating molecular outflow in\nthis highly irradiated source. We compute the photoevaporation rate of the\nMystic Mountains and combine it with recent ALMA observations of the cold\nmolecular gas to estimate the remaining lifetime of the Mystic Mountains and\nthe corresponding shielding time for the embedded protostars. The longest\nremaining lifetimes are for the smallest structures, suggesting that they have\nbeen compressed by ionizing feedback. Our data do not suggest that star\nformation in the Mystic Mountains has been triggered but it does point to the\nrole that ionization-driven compression may play in enhancing the shielding of\nembedded stars and disks. Planet formation models suggest that the shielding\ntime is a strong determinant of the mass and orbital architecture of planets,\nmaking it important to quantify in high-mass regions like Carina that represent\nthe type of environment where most stars form.",

Significant strides have been recently made into\nbuilding better `quantum mixers', with promise being shown by Kerr-free\nthree-wave mixers that suppress driven frequency shifts, and balanced quantum\nmixers that explicitly forbid a significant fraction of parasitic processes. We\npropose a novel mixer that combines both these strengths, with engineered\nselection rules that make it essentially linear (not just Kerr-free) when idle,\nand activate clean parametric processes even when driven at high strength.\nFurther, its ideal Hamiltonian is simple to analyze analytically, and we show\nthat this ideal behavior is first-order insensitive to dominant experimental\nimperfections.

In these games, a leader decides the\ncoalition during each round and the players not in the coalition follow their\nadmissible strategies. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend the\nconcept of admissibility to games on graphs with preferences and characterize\nit using maximal sure winning, a concept originally defined for adversarial\ntwo-player games with preferences. Second, we define a value function that\nassigns a vector to each state, identifying which player has a maximal sure\nwinning strategy for certain subset of objectives. Finally, we present a\npolynomial-time algorithm to synthesize admissible strategies for all players\nbased on this value function and prove their existence in all games within the\nchosen subclass.

This disparity arises from the\nrelative ease of assessing the risk of default and bankruptcy in these more\nprominent companies. Historically, risk analysis studies have focused on data\nfrom publicly traded or stock exchange-listed companies, leaving a gap in\nknowledge about small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Addressing this gap,\nthis study introduces a method for evaluating SMEs by generating images for\nprocessing via a convolutional neural network (CNN). To this end, more than\n10,000 images, one for each company in the sample, were created to identify\nscenarios in which the CNN can operate with higher assertiveness and reduced\ntraining error probability.

Recently, there has been\ngrowing interest in providing live guidance by analyzing video feeds from tools\nsuch as endoscopes. Existing approaches, including anatomy detection,\norientation feedback, phase recognition, and visual question-answering,\nprimarily focus on aiding surgeons in assessing the current surgical scene.\nThis work aims to provide guidance on a finer scale, aiming to provide guidance\nby forecasting the trajectory of the surgical instrument, essentially\naddressing the question of what to do next. To address this task, we propose a\nmodel that not only leverages the historical locations of surgical instruments\nbut also integrates anatomical features.

Instead, the ground\ntruth is generated by a detection model trained to detect both anatomical\nstructures and instruments within surgical videos of a comprehensive dataset\ncontaining pituitary surgery videos. By analyzing the interaction between\nanatomy and instrument movements in these videos and forecasting future\ninstrument movements, we show that anatomical features are a valuable asset in\naddressing this challenging task.

While the natural greedy algorithm has a poor\napproximation ratio in the subadditive case, we show that a suitable truncation\nachieves the above guarantee. Our analysis is based on a connection to the\nminimum sum set cover problem. As applications, we obtain the first\napproximation algorithms for sequential testing under various cost-structures:\n$(5+\\epsilon)$-approximation for tree-based costs, $9.5$-approximation for\nrouting costs and $(4+\\ln n)$ for machine activation costs.

Crashes occurring in production\nenvironments, such as that of SAP HANA, provide solely crash logs and stack\ntraces. We present a novel approach to localize faults based only on the stack\ntrace information and no additional runtime information, by fine-tuning large\nlanguage models (LLMs). We address complex cases where the root cause of a\ncrash differs from the technical cause, and is not located in the innermost\nframe of the stack trace.

While\nthis approach is computationally and theoretically attractive, it currently\nlacks a well-established statistical mechanics foundation. As a result,\ninternal variables are typically chosen phenomenologically and lack a direct\nlink to the underlying physics which hinders the predictability of the theory.\nTo address these challenges, we propose a machine learning approach that is\nconsistent with the principles of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The\nproposed approach leverages the following techniques (i) the information\nbottleneck (IB) method to ensure that the learned internal variables are\nfunctions of the microstates and are capable of capturing the salient feature\nof the microscopic distribution; (ii) conditional normalizing flows to\nrepresent arbitrary probability distributions of the microscopic states as\nfunctions of the state variables; and (iii) Variational Onsager Neural Networks\n(VONNs) to guarantee thermodynamic consistency and Markovianity of the learned\nevolution equations. The resulting framework, called IB-VONNs, is tested on two\nproblems of colloidal systems, governed at the microscale by overdamped\nLangevin dynamics. The first one is a prototypical model for a colloidal\nparticle in an optical trap, which can be solved analytically, and thus ideal\nto verify the framework. The second problem is a one-dimensional\nphase-transforming system, whose macroscopic description still lacks a\nstatistical mechanics foundation under general conditions. The results in both\ncases indicate that the proposed machine learning strategy can indeed bridge\nstatistical mechanics and thermodynamics with internal variables away from\nequilibrium.",

    "abstract": "Lipid bilayers often form high-curvature configurations due to self-assembly\nconditions or certain biological processes. However, particle-based simulations\nof lipid membranes are predominantly of flat lipid membranes because planar\nmembranes are easily connected over periodic boundary conditions. To simulate a\ncurved lipid membrane, one can simulate an entire vesicle, a cylinder, or a\nbicelle (disk-like bilayer aggregate). One can also use artificial methods to\ncontrol curvature, such as applying virtual walls of beads, radial harmonic\npotentials, or ``tape up the edges''. These existing methods have limitations\ndue to the method by which curvature is imposed. Herein, we propose an\nalternative method of introducing arbitrary curvature by anchoring a curved\nlipid membrane with ``frozen'' equilibrated membrane patches. The method\npresented here is compatible with all particle-based lipid models and easily\nextended to many geometries. As an example, we simulate curved membranes with\nDPPC, DOPC, DLPC and DOPE lipids as parameterized by the Martini3\ncoarse-grained model. This method introduces limited finite-size artifacts,\nprevents lipid flip-flop at membrane edges, and allows fluctuations of the free\nmembrane center. We provide verification of the method on flat membranes and\ndiscussion on extracting shape and per-leaflet quantities (thickness, order\nparameter) from curved membranes. Curvature produces asymmetric changes in\nlipid leaflet properties. Finally, we explore the coupled effect of curvature\nand membrane asymmetry in both number and lipid type.

While we briefly assess two recently\nproposed methods - one-shot matrix-omnidirectional integration (OS-MODI) and\nGreen's function integral (GFI) - the primary focus is on the advantages of the\nSIREN approach. The OS-MODI technique performs well in noise-free conditions\nand with structured meshes but struggles when applied to unstructured meshes\nwith high aspect ratio. Similarly, the GFI method encounters difficulties due\nto singularities inherent from the Newtonian kernel. In contrast, the proposed\nSIREN approach is a mesh-free method that directly reconstructs the pressure\nfield, bypassing the need for an intrinsic grid connectivity and, hence,\navoiding the challenges associated with ill-conditioned cells and unstructured\nmeshes. This provides a distinct advantage over traditional mesh-based methods.\nMoreover, it is shown that changes in the architecture of the SIREN can be used\nto filter out inherent noise from velocimetry data.

We evaluate the extension of the MS\nin terms of the drop in the relative number of stars as a function of effective\ntemperature ($T_{\\rm eff}$). We find a consistent boundary at $\\approx$22.5kK\nwithin the full range of luminosities that we use to delineate the terminal-age\nmain sequence (TAMS). We obtain a smooth decrease of the highest $v\\sin i$ with\n$T_{\\rm eff}$ along the MS, likely limited by the critical velocity. We\nconsider this effect combined with a lower expected fraction of stars beyond\nthe MS as the best explanation for the lack of fast-rotating objects in the\npost-MS region. Our results favor low to mild initial rotation for the full\nsample and a binary past for the tail of fast-rotating stars. The prominence of\nSB1/SB2 systems in the MS, and the 25% decrease in the relative fraction of SB1\nsystems when crossing the TAMS can further delineate its location.",

    "abstract": "Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing images poses\nsignificant challenges due to unstable image quality, small object sizes,\ncomplex backgrounds, and environmental occlusions. Small objects, in\nparticular, occupy small portions of images, making their accurate detection\nhighly difficult. Existing multi-scale feature fusion methods address these\nchallenges to some extent by aggregating features across different resolutions.\nHowever, they often fail to effectively balance the classification and\nlocalization performance for small objects, primarily due to insufficient\nfeature representation and imbalanced network information flow. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel feature fusion framework specifically designed for UAV\nobject detection tasks to enhance both localization accuracy and classification\nperformance. The proposed framework integrates hybrid upsampling and\ndownsampling modules, enabling feature maps from different network depths to be\nflexibly adjusted to arbitrary resolutions. This design facilitates cross-layer\nconnections and multi-scale feature fusion, ensuring improved representation of\nsmall objects. Our approach leverages hybrid downsampling to enhance\nfine-grained feature representation, improving spatial localization of small\ntargets, even under complex conditions. Simultaneously, the upsampling module\naggregates global contextual information, optimizing feature consistency across\nscales and enhancing classification robustness in cluttered scenes.\nExperimental results on two public UAV datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed framework. Integrated into the YOLO-v10 model, our method\nachieves a 2% improvement in average precision (AP) compared to the baseline\nYOLO-v10 model, while maintaining the same number of parameters. These results\nhighlight the potential of our framework for accurate and efficient UAV object\ndetection.",

However, as the\ntime between map creation and robot deployment increases, portions of the map\ncan become stale, and landmarks, once believed to be permanent, may disappear.\nWe refer to the propensity of a landmark to disappear as landmark evanescence.\nReasoning about landmark evanescence during path planning, and the associated\nimpact on localization accuracy, requires analyzing the presence or absence of\neach landmark, leading to an exponential number of possible outcomes of a given\nmotion plan. To address this complexity, we develop BRULE, an extension of the\nBelief Roadmap.

Secondly, fast online trajectory optimization is implemented\nto update robot trajectories in real-time within 100 ms. This helps to mitigate\npose estimation errors from the vision system. To account for model\ninaccuracies, disturbances, and other non-modeled effects, trajectory tracking\ncontrollers for both the robot and the gripper are implemented to execute the\noptimal trajectories from the proposed framework. The intensive experimental\nresults effectively demonstrate the performance of our trajectory planning\nframework in both simulation and real-world scenarios.",

High-order solvers\nbased on adaptive box codes or the fast Fourier transform can efficiently treat\nthe volumetric inhomogeneity, but require care to be taken near the boundary to\nensure that the volume data is globally smooth. We avoid function extension or\ncut-cell quadratures near the boundary by dividing the domain into two regions:\na bulk region away from the boundary that is efficiently treated with a\ntruncated free-space box code, and a variable-width boundary-conforming strip\nregion that is treated with a spectral collocation method and accompanying fast\ndirect solver. Particular solutions in each region are then combined with\nLaplace layer potentials to yield the global solution. The resulting solver has\nan optimal computational complexity of $O(N)$ for an adaptive discretization\nwith $N$ degrees of freedom. With an efficient two-dimensional (2D)\nimplementation we demonstrate adaptive resolution of volumetric data, boundary\ndata, and geometric features across a wide range of length scales, to typically\n10-digit accuracy. The cost of all boundary corrections remains small relative\nto that of the bulk box code.

Specifically, the graphs\ntake a semi-bipartite form where input nodes map to output nodes, such that\noutput nodes may connect to each other but input nodes may not. Intuitively,\nthe graph's input-output edges represent information propagation of the\nencoder, while output-output edges represent the code's entanglement. We prove\nthat this graph representation is in bijection with tableaus and give an\nefficient compilation algorithm that transforms tableaus into graphs. We show\nthat this map is efficiently invertible, which gives a universal recipe for\ncode construction by finding graphs with nice properties. The graph\nrepresentation gives insight into both code construction and algorithms. To the\nformer, we argue that graphs provide a flexible platform for building codes.

    "abstract": "Graph clustering is a fundamental technique in data analysis with\napplications in many different fields. While there is a large body of work on\nclustering undirected graphs, the problem of clustering directed graphs is much\nless understood. The analysis is more complex in the directed graph case for\ntwo reasons: the clustering must preserve directional information in the\nrelationships between clusters, and directed graphs have non-Hermitian\nadjacency matrices whose properties are less conducive to traditional spectral\nmethods. Here we consider the problem of partitioning the vertex set of a\ndirected graph into $k\\ge 2$ clusters so that edges between different clusters\ntend to follow the same direction. We present an iterative algorithm based on\nspectral methods applied to new Hermitian representations of directed graphs.\nOur algorithm performs favourably against the state-of-the-art, both on\nsynthetic and real-world data sets. Additionally, it is able to identify a\n\"meta-graph\" of $k$ vertices that represents the higher-order relations between\nclusters in a directed graph. We showcase this capability on data sets\npertaining food webs, biological neural networks, and the online card game\nHearthstone.",

    "abstract": "Dust grains play a crucial role in the modeling of protostellar formation,\nparticularly through their opacity and interaction with the magnetic field. The\ndestruction of dust grains in numerical simulations is currently modeled\nprimarily by temperature dependent functions. However, a dynamical approach\ncould be necessary to accurately model the vaporization of dust grains. We\nfocused on modeling the evolution of dust grains during star formation,\nspecifically on the vaporization of the grains by chemisputtering. We also\ninvestigated the evolution of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic resistivities and\nthe Planck and Rosseland mean opacities influenced by the grain evolution. We\nmodeled the evolution of the dust by considering spherical grains at thermal\nequilibrium with the gas phase, composed only of one kind of material for each\ngrain. We then took into account the exchange processes that can occur between\nthe grains and the gas phase and that make the grain size evolve. We considered\nthree materials for the grains: carbon, silicate, and aluminum oxide. Given a\ntemporal evolution in temperature and density of the gas phase, we computed the\nevolution of a dust grain distribution. We observed a significant dependence of\nthe sublimation temperature of the carbon grains on the dynamical evolution of\nthe gas phase.

Our\nobservations were obtained during the 2018 eruption of MAXI J1820+070 with the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST) and AstroSat observatory. The extinction towards\nthe source turns out to be low - $\\rm E_{B-V} = 0.2 \\pm 0.05$ - making it one\nof the best UV accretion laboratories among LMXBs. Remarkably, we observe only\nmoderate differences between all three states, with all spectra displaying\nsimilar continuum shapes and emission lines. Moreover, the continua are not\nwell-described by physically plausible irradiated disc models. All of this\nchallenges the standard reprocessing picture for UV emission from erupting\nLMXBs. The UV emission lines are double-peaked, with high-ionization lines\ndisplaying higher peak-to-peak velocities. None of the lines display obvious\noutflow signatures, even though blue-shifted absorption features have been seen\nin optical and near-infrared lines during the hard state. The emission line\nratios are consistent with normal abundances, suggesting that the donor mass at\nbirth was low enough to avoid CNO processing ($\\rm M_{2,i} \\lesssim 1.0 - 1.5\n{\\mathrm M_{\\odot}}$). Finally, we study the evolution of UV variability in our\ntime-resolved HST observations (hard and hard-intermediate states).

Gravitationally driven outflows from this KBC void might inflate\nredshifts enough to solve the Hubble tension, a scenario explored in detail by\nHaslbauer et al. We obtain predictions for the baryon acoustic oscillation\n(BAO) observables in their best-fitting void models and in the homogeneous\n$Planck$ cosmology. We compare these models against our compilation of\navailable BAO measurements from the past twenty years. We find that the quality\nand quantity of available measurements are best using the isotropically\naveraged distance $D_{\\mathrm{V}}$. Taking its ratio with the expected value in\nthe homogeneous model yields good agreement with unity at high redshift, but a\ndiscrepancy appears that systematically grows with decreasing redshift.\nAssuming independent uncertainties, the 42 considered $D_{\\mathrm{V}}$\nobservations give a total $\\chi^2$ of 75.7 for the void-free model, while the\nvoid models give only $47.3 - 51.2$ depending on the density profile.

The $\\chi^2$ differences are\nsmaller when considering measurements of the angular BAO scale or its redshift\ndepth. The void-free model provides the worst fit in almost every case.\nOverall, our results suggest that recent evidence of BAO observables deviating\nfrom expectations in the homogeneous $Planck$ cosmology could indicate a local\nvoid, which was motivated by considerations unrelated to BAO data or the Hubble\ntension.",

We aim to determine the spectral types and physical properties of\n122 LMC & 103 SMC OB stars observed via XShootU. Physical parameters are\nrequired for these to serve as templates in spectral libraries of metal poor\nmassive stars.

We apply a pipeline designed to\nanalyse large spectroscopic samples of hot luminous stars to XShootU\nspectroscopic datasets, together with grids of synthetic model spectra computed\nwith the non-LTE atmospheric code fastwind at LMC & SMC metallicities. We\ndetermine physical and wind properties of 97 LMC & 77 SMC massive stars,\nranging from O2 to B9 subtypes, representing the majority of the XShootU OB\nsample (OeBe & candidate SB2 systems are excluded). Results are broadly in\nagreement with previous optical spectroscopic studies, with evolutionary masses\nspanning 12-117 Msun in the LMC & 11-74 Msun in the SMC.

Models for the PNLF have generally assumed solar\nmetallicities and artificial stellar populations. In this work, we investigate\nhow metallicity and helium abundances affect the PNe and PNLF, and the\nimportance of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR), to resolve the tension\nbetween PNLF observations and models. We introduce PICS (PNe In Cosmological\nSimulations), a PN model framework that accounts for metallicity and is\napplicable to realistic stellar populations from cosmological simulations and\nobservations. The framework combines stellar evolution models with post-AGB\ntracks, PN models, and circumnebular extinction to obtain PNe from a parent\nstellar population. We find that metallicity plays an important role for the\nresulting PNe: old metal-rich populations can harbor much brighter PNe than old\nmetal-poor ones. We show that the helium abundance is a vital ingredient at\nhigh metallicities and explore the impact on the PNLF of a possible saturation\nof helium at high metallicities. We present PNLF grids for different stellar\nages and metallicities, where the observed PNLF bright end can be reached even\nfor old stellar populations of 10 Gyr at high metallicities. Finally, we find\nthat the PNLFs of old stellar populations are sensitive to the IFMR, allowing\nfor the production of bright PNe. With PICS, we have laid the groundwork for\nstudying how different models affect the PNe and PNLF. Two central ingredients\nfor this are the metallicity and helium abundance. Future applications of PICS\ninclude modeling PNe in a cosmological framework to explain the origin of the\nuniversal PNLF cutoff and using it as a diagnostic tool for galaxy formation.",

The two predominant paradigms to tackle this\ntask are Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles.

BNNs\nare often touted as more principled due to their reliance on the Bayesian\nparadigm, whereas ensembles are perceived as more ad-hoc; yet, deep ensembles\ntend to empirically outperform BNNs, with no satisfying explanation as to why\nthis is the case. In this work we bridge this gap by showing that deep\nensembles perform exact Bayesian averaging with a posterior obtained with an\nimplicitly learned data-dependent prior. In other words deep ensembles are\nBayesian, or more specifically, they implement an empirical Bayes procedure\nwherein the prior is learned from the data. This perspective offers two main\nbenefits: (i) it theoretically justifies deep ensembles and thus provides an\nexplanation for their strong empirical performance; and (ii) inspection of the\nlearned prior reveals it is given by a mixture of point masses -- the use of\nsuch a strong prior helps elucidate observed phenomena about ensembles.\nOverall, our work delivers a newfound understanding of deep ensembles which is\nnot only of interest in it of itself, but which is also likely to generate\nfuture insights that drive empirical improvements for these models.",

We demonstrate that this method scales more\neffectively than previous methods and ensures convergence to the Lindbladian\nsolution independent of system size, which we show both rigorously and\nnumerically.

    "abstract": "Comets, asteroids, and other small bodies are thought to be remnants of the\noriginal planetesimal population of the Solar System. As such, their physical,\nchemical, and isotopic properties hold crucial details on how and where they\nformed and how they evolved. Yet, placing precise constraints on the formation\nregion of these bodies has been challenging. Data from spacecraft missions have\na particularly high potential of addressing the question of the origin of the\nvisited bodies. ESA's Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko\nreturned data from the comet for two years on its journey around the Sun. This\nextensive data set has revolutionised our view on comets and still holds\nunsolved problems. We use the Rosetta/ROSINA (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for\nIon and Neutral Analysis) measurement of the volatile/ice composition and the\nRosetta/COSIMA (COmetary Secondary Ion Mass Analyzer) measurements of the\nrefractory composition of comet 67P. These measurements are combined using a\nMonte Carlo method. The refractory-to-ice ratio is a free parameter that is\nconstrained a posteriori.\n  Using only the composition, we constrain the refractory-to-ice ratio to\n$0.5<\\chi<1.7$, and derive the bulk elemental abundances for 67P of H, C, N, O,\nNa, Mg, Al, S, K, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, Kr, and Xe. We find the noble gas xenon\nin near solar elemental abundance in comet 67P. Krypton is slightly depleted,\nwhile argon is heavily depleted. Comet 67P is enriched in all three noble gases\nby up to 2.5 orders of magnitude compared to CI chondrites. We show this is\nconsistent with a formation region between 25 and 35 au in a protoplanetary\ndisk region with temperatures between 30 and 40 K and with the trapping of dust\nfor a long time in rings of the protoplanetary disk.",

    "abstract": "Using the expansion of Zubarev's density operator, we develop a linear\nresponse approach to study various spin physics in a locally equilibrated\nmedium, particularly focusing on various polarization phenomena in heavy-ion\ncollisions. Specifically, we connect familiar correlation functions and\ndiagrammatic methods to the Zubarev formalism, enabling the use of established\ntechniques like the Matsubara/imaginary time formalism to facilitate\ncalculations. For a spin-1/2 particle, we re-derive its vector polarization\nusing this Zubarev response approach, which exactly reproduces with our\nprevious results based on Luttinger's method. For a spin-1 particle, we\ncalculate the vector polarization and find the expected contributions from\nvorticity, temperature gradients, and shear, which are identical to those for\nspin-1/2 particles except for a factor of 4/3 as expected. For the tensor\npolarization and spin alignment of a spin-1 boson, we explicitly prove that the\nnon-dissipative contribution is zero at leading order in gradients, and briefly\nreiterate our previous findings for the dissipative contribution with further\ndiscussions on several concerns. Additionally, we discuss several relevant\nsubtleties and questions, including an alternative derivation for Zubarev\nresponse approach, the covariance issues of different spin density matrix\ndefinitions, a further explanation of slow and fast modes, the mode selection\nscheme, etc. We also discuss skeleton expansions, higher-order contributions,\nand non-perturbative methods, particularly their potential connection to\nlattice field theory. In summary, this work discusses the foundations and\nsubtleties of Zubarev response approach, with specific examples from spin\nphysics in heavy-ion collisions.",

While Chatbot Arena is widely regarded as a reliable LLM\nranking leaderboard, we show that crowdsourced voting can be rigged to improve\n(or decrease) the ranking of a target model $m_{t}$. We first introduce a\nstraightforward target-only rigging strategy that focuses on new battles\ninvolving $m_{t}$, identifying it via watermarking or a binary classifier, and\nexclusively voting for $m_{t}$ wins. However, this strategy is practically\ninefficient because there are over $190$ models on Chatbot Arena and on average\nonly about $1\\%$ of new battles will involve $m_{t}$. To overcome this, we\npropose omnipresent rigging strategies, exploiting the Elo rating mechanism of\nChatbot Arena that any new vote on a battle can influence the ranking of the\ntarget model $m_{t}$, even if $m_{t}$ is not directly involved in the battle.\nWe conduct experiments on around $1.7$ million historical votes from the\nChatbot Arena Notebook, showing that omnipresent rigging strategies can improve\nmodel rankings by rigging only hundreds of new votes.

While pressure bumps arising from other\nmechanisms have been numerically demonstrated to promote planet formation, the\nimpact of infall-induced pressure bumps remains unexplored. We aim to\ninvestigate the potential for planetesimal formation in an infall-induced\npressure bump, starting with sub-micrometer-sized dust grains, and to identify\nthe conditions most conducive to triggering this process. We developed a\nnumerical model that integrates axisymmetric infall, dust drift, and dust\ncoagulation, along with planetesimal formation via streaming instability. Our\nparameter space includes gas viscosity, dust fragmentation velocity, initial\ndisk mass, characteristic disk radius, infall rate and duration, as well as the\nlocation and width of the infall region. An infall-induced pressure bump can\ntrap dust from both the infalling material and the outer disk, promoting dust\ngrowth. The locally enhanced dust-to-gas ratio triggers streaming instability,\nforming a planetesimal belt inside the central infall location until the\npressure bump is smoothed out by viscous gas diffusion. Planetesimal formation\nis favored by a massive, narrow streamer infalling onto a low-viscosity,\nlow-mass, and spatially extended disk containing dust with a high fragmentation\nvelocity. This configuration enhances the outward drift speed of dust on the\ninner side of the pressure bump, while also ensuring the prolonged persistence\nof the pressure bump. Planetesimal formation can occur even if the infalling\nmaterial consists solely of gas. A pressure bump induced by infall is a\nfavorable site for dust growth and planetesimal formation, and this mechanism\ndoes not require a preexisting massive planet to create the bump.",

Sanitization can be done on speech content keeping\nin mind that it has to avoid compromising transcription accuracy. Realizing the\nunder utilized capabilities of tiny speech foundation models (FMs), for the\nfirst time, we propose a novel use: enhancing speech privacy on\nresource-constrained devices. We introduce XYZ, an edge/cloud privacy\npreserving speech inference engine that can filter sensitive entities without\ncompromising transcript accuracy. We utilize a timestamp based on-device\nmasking approach that utilizes a token to entity prediction model to filter\nsensitive entities. Our choice of mask strategically conceals parts of the\ninput and hides sensitive data. The masked input is sent to a trusted cloud\nservice or to a local hub to generate the masked output. The effectiveness of\nXYZ hinges on how well the entity time segments are masked. Our recovery is a\nconfidence score based approach that chooses the best prediction between cloud\nand on-device model. We implement XYZ on a 64 bit Raspberry Pi 4B. Experiments\nshow that our solution leads to robust speech recognition without forsaking\nprivacy. XYZ with < 100 MB memory, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) speech\ntranscription performance while filtering about 83% of private entities\ndirectly on-device.

    "abstract": "Sangyop Lee has done much work to determine the knot types of twisted torus\nknots, including classifying the twisted torus knots which are the unknot.\nAmong the unknotted twisted torus knots are those of the form $K(F_{n+2}, F_n,\nF_{n+1}, -1)$, where $F_i$ is the $i$th Fibonacci number. Here, we consider\ntwisted torus knots with parameters that are defined recursively, similarly to\nthe Fibonacci sequence. We call these \\textit{Horadam parameters}, after the\ngeneralization of the Fibonacci sequence introduced by A.F. Horadam.

Additionally, we provide lists of primitive/primitive and\nprimitive/Seifert twisted torus knots and connect these lists to the Horadam\ntwisted torus knots.",

    "abstract": "Theories of self-organized active fluid surfaces have emerged as an important\nclass of minimal models for the shape dynamics of biological membranes, cells\nand tissues. However, due to their inherent geometric nonlinearities and the\nabsence of general minimization principles in active systems, it remains a\nmajor challenge to systematically study the emergent shape spaces such theories\ngive rise to. Here, we introduce a novel variational approach that allows for a\ndirect computation of stationary surface geometries and flows, which enables\nthe classification of non-equilibrium phase transitions in shape spaces\ndescribed by active surface theories. To achieve this, we construct a\ndissipation functional systematically from the entropy production in active\nsurfaces and show how generic symmetries imposed by Onsager relations can be\nexploited to also account for reactive non-dissipative terms in constitutive\nlaws. This functional is supplemented by Lagrange multipliers that relax\nnonlinear geometric constraints, which leads to a tractable variational problem\nsuitable for implicit dynamic simulations and explicit calculations of\nnon-trivial steady state geometries and flows. We apply this framework to study\nthe dynamics of open fluid membranes and closed active fluid surfaces, and\ncharacterize the space of stationary solutions that corresponding surfaces and\nflows occupy. These analyses rationalize the interplay of first-order shape\ntransitions of internally and externally forced fluid membranes, reveal\ndegenerate regions in stationary shape spaces of mechanochemically active\nsurfaces and identify a mechanism by which hydrodynamic screening controls the\ngeometry of active surfaces undergoing cell division-like shape\ntransformations.",

The equality graph is a data\nstructure capable of compactly storing expressions and their equivalent forms\nallowing an efficient verification of whether an expression has been visited in\nany of their stored equivalent forms.

Despite the\nincrease in AI-based models for bioacoustics, their full potential remains\nunrealized without accessible tools to deploy them on custom hardware and\ntailor device behaviour to specific monitoring goals. 2.

We are interested in the\nsetting where the sketches must be computed independently of each other, except\nfor the use of a shared random seed. We prove that, when $\\mathbf{A}$ and\n$\\mathbf{B}$ are sparse, methods based on \\emph{coordinated random sampling}\ncan outperform classical linear sketching approaches, like\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss Projection or CountSketch. For example, to obtain\nFrobenius norm error $\\epsilon\\|\\mathbf{A}\\|_F\\|\\mathbf{B}\\|_F$, coordinated\nsampling requires sketches of size $O(s/\\epsilon^2)$ when $\\mathbf{A}$ and\n$\\mathbf{B}$ have at most $s \\leq d,m$ non-zeros per row. In contrast, linear\nsketching leads to sketches of size $O(d/\\epsilon^2)$ and $O(m/\\epsilon^2)$ for\n$\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$. We empirically evaluate our approach on two\napplications: 1) distributed linear regression in databases, a problem\nmotivated by tasks like dataset discovery and augmentation, and 2)\napproximating attention matrices in transformer-based language models. In both\ncases, our sampling algorithms yield an order of magnitude improvement over\nlinear sketching.",

    "abstract": "Augmenting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with external real-world data\n(RWD) has the potential to improve the finite sample efficiency of treatment\neffect estimators. We describe using adaptive targeted maximum likelihood\nestimation (A-TMLE) for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) by\ndecomposing the ATE estimand into two components: a pooled-ATE estimand that\ncombines data from both the RCT and external sources, and a bias estimand that\ncaptures the conditional effect of RCT enrollment on the outcome. This approach\nviews the RCT data as the reference and corrects for inconsistencies of any\nkind between the RCT and the external data source. Given the growing abundance\nof external RWD from modern electronic health records, determining the optimal\nstrategy to select candidate external patients for data integration remains an\nopen yet critical problem. In this work, we begin by analyzing the robustness\nproperty of the A-TMLE estimator and then propose a matching-based sampling\nstrategy that improves the robustness of the estimator with respect to the\ntarget estimand. Our proposed strategy is outcome-blind and involves matching\nbased on two one-dimensional scores: the trial enrollment score and the\npropensity score in the external data. We demonstrate in simulations that our\nsampling strategy improves the coverage and shortens the widths of confidence\nintervals produced by A-TMLE.

The\nplatform's status as a key news source, particularly among younger\ndemographics, raises concerns about its potential influence on politics in the\nU.S. and globally. Despite these concerns, there is scant research\ninvestigating TikTok's recommendation algorithm for political biases. We fill\nthis gap by conducting 323 independent algorithmic audit experiments testing\npartisan content recommendations in the lead-up to the 2024 U.S. presidential\nelections. Specifically, we create hundreds of \"sock puppet\" TikTok accounts in\nTexas, New York, and Georgia, seeding them with varying partisan content and\ncollecting algorithmic content recommendations for each of them. Collectively,\nthese accounts viewed ~394,000 videos from April 30th to November 11th, 2024,\nwhich we label for political and partisan content. Our analysis reveals\nsignificant asymmetries in content distribution: Republican-seeded accounts\nreceived ~11.8% more party-aligned recommendations compared to their\nDemocratic-seeded counterparts, and Democratic-seeded accounts were exposed to\n~7.5% more opposite-party recommendations on average. These asymmetries exist\nacross all three states and persist when accounting for video- and\nchannel-level engagement metrics such as likes, views, shares, comments, and\nfollowers, and are driven primarily by negative partisanship content.

However, the magnetic oscillations in\ncorrelated insulators remain poorly understood. Here we report the observations\nof resistivity quantum oscillations in an excitonic insulator realized in\nCoulomb-coupled electron-hole double layers with gate-tunability that allows\nthe phenomenon to be explored in a more controllable fashion than in bulk\nmaterials. When the cyclotron energy of the electrons or holes is tuned to be\ncomparable to or larger than the exciton binding energy, recurring transitions\nbetween excitonic insulators and electron-hole decoupled quantum Hall states\nare observed. Compressibility measurements show an oscillatory exciton binding\nenergy as a function of magnetic field and electron-hole pair density. Coulomb\ndrag measurements further reveal the formation of excitons with finite angular\nmomentum. Our results are qualitatively captured by mean-field theory\ncalculations.

Superconducting qubits have emerged as a frontrunner\namong many competing technologies, primarily because of their speed of\noperations, relatively well-developed and offer a promising path toward\nscalability. Here, we address the challenges of optimizing superconducting\nqubit hardware through the development of a comprehensive theoretical framework\nthat spans the entire process - from design to the calibration of hardware\nthrough quantum gate execution. We develop this framework in four key steps:\ncircuit design, electromagnetic analysis, spectral analysis, and pulse\nsequencing with calibration. We first refine the qubit's core components - such\nas capacitance, Josephson junctions, and resonators - to set the foundation for\nstrong performance. The electromagnetic analysis, using the Lumped Oscillator\nmodel, allows us to map out the capacitance matrix, ensuring that we minimize\nspectral dispersion while maximizing coherence times. Following this, we\nconduct spectral analysis to fine-tune the qubit's frequency spectrum and\ncoherence properties, ensuring that the qubit parameters are optimized.\nFinally, we focus on pulse sequencing, including pulse-width optimization, DRAG\noptimization, and randomized benchmarking, to achieve high gate fidelity. We\napplied this framework to both Transmon and Fluxonium qubits, obtaining results\nthat closely match those found in experimental studies.

With the existence of many pre-trained deep\nneural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings\nfor sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs,\ngiven their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing\nGPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split\ninto many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then\nbe represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such\na setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning\nwhere for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a\nsingle embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple\nset-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature.

    "abstract": "We prove that if a topological dynamical system $(X,T)$ is surjective and has\nthe vague specification property, then its ergodic measures are dense in the\nspace of all invariant measures. The vague specification property generalises\nBowen's classical specification property and encompasses the majority of the\nextensions of the specification property introduced so far.\n  The proof proceeds by first considering the natural extension $X_T$ of\n$(X,T)$ as a subsystem of the shift action on the space $X^\\mathbb{Z}$ of\n$X$-valued biinfinite sequences. We then construct a sequence of subsystems of\n$X^\\mathbb{Z}$ that approximate $X_T$ in the Hausdorff metric induced by a\nmetric compatible with the product topology on $X^\\mathbb{Z}$. The\napproximating subsystems consist of $\\delta$-chains for $\\delta$ decreasing to\n$0$. We show that chain mixing implies that each approximating system possesses\nthe classical periodic specification property. Furthermore, we use vague\nspecification to prove that our approximating subsystems of $X^\\mathbb{Z}$\nconverge to $X_T$ in the Hausdorff metric induced the Besicovitch pseudometric.\nIt follows that the simplices of invariant measures of these subsystems of\n$\\delta$-chains converge to the simplex of invariant measures of $X_T$ with\nrespect to a generalised version of Ornstein's $\\bar{d}$ metric. What is more,\nthe density of ergodic measures is preserved in the limit. The proof concludes\nby observing that the simplices of invariant measures for $X_T$ and $(X,T)$\ncoincide.\n  The approximation technique developed in this paper appears to be of\nindependent interest.",

In this paper, we study how to automatically cancel out the\ndilatons by finding a suitable double-copy prescription in terms of\ngauge-theory fields, effectively treating the new contributions as ghosts that\nsubtract out the unwanted states. At tree level, we find that an asymmetric\ndouble copy can reproduce the dilaton graphs in general dimension, which we\nexplicitly verify up to six external massive scalars.

The first of our main results is a formula for the\nasymptotics of the logarithm of the number of claw-free graphs of edge density\n$\\gamma \\in (0,1)$. We show that the problem exhibits a second-order phase\ntransition at edge density $\\gamma^\\ast=\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{4}$. The asymptotic\nformula arises by solving a variational problem over graphons. For\n$\\gamma\\geq\\gamma^\\ast$ there is a unique optimal graphon, while for\n$\\gamma<\\gamma^\\ast$ there is an infinite set of optimal graphons. By analyzing\nmore detailed structure, we prove that for $\\gamma<\\gamma^\\ast$, there is in\nfact a unique graphon $W$ such that almost all claw-free graphs at edge density\n$\\gamma$ are close in cut metric to $W$. We also analyze the probability of\nclaw-freeness in the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph $G(n,p)$ for constant $p$,\nobtaining a formula for the large-deviation rate function for claw-freeness. In\nthis case, the problem exhibits a first-order phase transition at\n$p^\\ast=\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, separating distinct structural regimes.

Since\nclassical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented\nlevel of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions\nof components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies\nfor quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands\nor even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect\nrequirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical\ncircuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be\nneeded. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale\nsystems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of\nscalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot\narray that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to\neach quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture\nprovides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D\nsquare lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices\ncan be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on\nthe order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while\nmaintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme,\nwhere the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS\ncircuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our\ntrilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor\ntechnologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for\nfuture research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.",

This study presents\na modified formulation of a neuron model with time-dependent membrane\ncapacitance and shows that action potentials can be elicited for certain\ncapacitance dynamics. Our main results can be summarized as: (a) it is\nnecessary to have significant and abrupt variations in the capacitance to\ngenerate action potentials; (b) certain simple and explicitly constructed\ncapacitance profiles with strong variations do generate action potentials; (c)\nforcing abrupt changes in the capacitance too frequently may result in no\naction potentials.

From a model's perspective, this presents an interesting\nchallenge. If models could autonomously retrieve knowledge useful for transfer\nor decision-making to solve problems, they would transition from passively\nacquiring to actively accessing and learning from knowledge. However, filling\nmodels with knowledge is relatively straightforward -- it simply requires more\ntraining and accessible knowledge bases. The more complex task is teaching\nmodels about which knowledge can be analogized and transferred. Therefore, we\ndesign a knowledge augmentation method, LEKA, for knowledge transfer that\nactively searches for suitable knowledge sources that can enrich the target\ndomain's knowledge. This LEKA method extracts key information from the target\ndomain's textual information, retrieves pertinent data from external data\nlibraries, and harmonizes retrieved data with the target domain data in feature\nspace and marginal probability measures. We validate the effectiveness of our\napproach through extensive experiments across various domains and demonstrate\nsignificant improvements over traditional methods in reducing computational\ncosts, automating data alignment, and optimizing transfer learning outcomes.",

To address this, we\nintroduce the Momentum Consensus-Based Optimization (M-CBO) and Adaptive\nMomentum Consensus-Based Optimization (Adam-CBO) frameworks. These methods\noptimize policies using Monte Carlo estimates of the value function, rather\nthan its gradients. Adjustable Gaussian noise supports efficient exploration,\nhelping the algorithm converge to optimal policies in complex, nonconvex\nenvironments. Numerical results confirm the accuracy and scalability of our\napproach across various problem dimensions and show the potential for extension\nto mean-field control problems.

Specifically, SPHEREx will\ntarget highly obscured sources throughout the Milky Way, and observe the\nspecies of concern in absorption against background illumination. SPHEREx\nspectrophotometry will yield ice column density measurements for millions of\nobscured Milky Way sources of all ages and types. By correlating those column\ndensities with source ages, the SPHEREx mission will shed light on whether\nthose molecules were formed in situ along with their nascent stellar systems,\nor whether instead they formed elsewhere and were introduced into those systems\nafter their formation.

They identified the presence of axis-aligned ghost\nclusters that can be misidentified as normal clusters, leading to biased\nanomaly scores and inaccurate predictions. In response, they developed the\nExtended Isolation Forest (EIF), which effectively solves these issues by\neliminating the ghost clusters introduced by iForest. This enhancement results\nin improved consistency of anomaly scores and superior performance. We reveal a\npreviously overlooked problem in the Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), showing\nthat it is vulnerable to ghost inter-clusters between normal clusters of data\npoints. In this paper, we introduce the Rotated Isolation Forest (RIF)\nalgorithm which effectively addresses both the axis-aligned ghost clusters\nobserved in iForest and the ghost inter-clusters seen in EIF. RIF accomplishes\nthis by randomly rotating the dataset (using random rotation matrices and QR\ndecomposition) before feeding it into the iForest construction, thereby\nincreasing dataset variation and eliminating ghost clusters.

In this paper, we concentrate on\nrigidly aligning pairs of closed curves in the plane. If the curves have the\nsame length and are centered at the origin, the critical steps to an optimal\nrigid alignment are finding the best rotation for one curve to match the other\nand redefining the starting point of the rotated curve so that the starting\npoints of the two curves match. Unlike open curves, closed curves do not have\nfixed starting points, and this introduces an additional degree of freedom in\nthe alignment. Hence the common naive method to find the best rotation and\nstarting point for optimal rigid alignment has O(N^2) time complexity, N the\nnumber of nodes per curve. This can be slow for curves with large numbers of\nnodes. In this paper, we propose a new O(N log N) algorithm for this problem\nbased on the Fast Fourier Transform. Together with uniform resampling of the\ncurves with respect to arc length, the new algorithm results in an order of\nmagnitude speed-up in our experiments.

In GMST, in order to establish\nproperties as deadlock-freedom, the environments which type processes are\nassumed to satisfy extensional properties holding in all infinite sequences.\nThis is a problem because: (1) the mechanisation of GMST and equi-recursion in\nproof assistants is utterly complex and eventually requires co-induction; and\n(2) the implementation of GMST in type checkers relies on model checkers for\nenvironment verification, and thus the program analysis is not self-contained.\n  In this paper, we overcome these limitations by providing an iso-recursive\ntyping system that computes the behavioural properties of environments. The\ntype system relies on a terminating function named compliance that computes all\nfinal redexes of an environment, and determines when these redexes do not\ncontain mismatches or deadlocks: compliant environments cannot go wrong.

Characterising properties of the scalar potential $V$ is also more\ndelicate in a multifield setting. We provide several examples of string\neffective theories with $V>0$, where the latter admits an asymptotically flat\ndirection along an off-shell field trajectory: in other words, there exists a\nlimit $\\varphi \\rightarrow \\infty$ for which $\\frac{|\\partial_{\\varphi} V|}{V}\n\\rightarrow 0$.

We investigate a core-periphery network model and\ndetermine, both theoretically and experimentally, a regime of parameters for\nwhich our approach closely approximates the threshold, while the estimate\nderived using the leading eigenvalue does not.

Parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential for higher speeds\nwhile maintaining the same energy limits due to their low moving masses.\nHowever, they require methods for contact detection and reaction while avoiding\nsingularities and self-collisions. We address this issue and present SafePR - a\nunified approach for the detection and localization, including the distinction\nbetween collision and clamping to perform a reaction that is safe for humans\nand feasible for PRs. Our approach uses information from the encoders and motor\ncurrents to estimate forces via a generalized-momentum observer. Neural\nnetworks and particle filters classify and localize the contacts. We introduce\nreactions with redundancy resolution to avoid type-II singularities and\nself-collisions. Our approach detected and terminated 72 real-world collision\nand clamping contacts with end-effector speeds of up to 1.5 m/s, each within\n25-275 ms. The forces were below the thresholds from ISO/TS 15066. By using\nbuilt-in sensors, SafePR enables safe interaction with already assembled PRs\nwithout the need for new hardware components.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) have demonstrated\nsignificant potential for Speaker Verification (SV), but closing the\nperformance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. SSL\nframeworks rely on anchor-positive pairs, constructed from segments of the same\naudio utterance. Hence, positives have channel characteristics similar to those\nof their corresponding anchors, even with extensive data-augmentation.\nTherefore, this positive sampling strategy is a fundamental limitation as it\nencodes too much information regarding the recording source in the learned\nrepresentations. This article introduces Self-Supervised Positive Sampling\n(SSPS), a bootstrapped technique for sampling appropriate and diverse positives\nin SSL frameworks for SV. SSPS samples positives close to their anchor in the\nrepresentation space, assuming that these pseudo-positives belong to the same\nspeaker identity but correspond to different recording conditions. This method\nconsistently demonstrates improvements in SV performance on VoxCeleb benchmarks\nwhen applied to major SSL frameworks, including SimCLR, SwAV, VICReg, and DINO.\nUsing SSPS, SimCLR and DINO achieve 2.57% and 2.53% EER on VoxCeleb1-O,\nrespectively. SimCLR yields a 58% relative reduction in EER, getting comparable\nperformance to DINO with a simpler training framework. Furthermore, SSPS lowers\nintra-class variance and reduces channel information in speaker representations\nwhile exhibiting greater robustness without data-augmentation.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel Two-Stage framework for Structured Pruning (\\textsc{2SSP})\nfor pruning Large Language Models (LLMs), which combines two different\nstrategies of pruning, namely Width and Depth Pruning. The first stage (Width\nPruning) removes entire neurons, hence their corresponding rows and columns,\naiming to preserve the connectivity among the pruned structures in the\nintermediate state of the Feed-Forward Networks in each Transformer block. This\nis done based on an importance score measuring the impact of each neuron on the\noutput magnitude. The second stage (Depth Pruning), instead, removes entire\nAttention submodules. This is done by applying an iterative process that\nremoves the Attention with the minimum impact on a given metric of interest (in\nour case, perplexity). We also propose a novel mechanism to balance the\nsparsity rate of the two stages w.r.t. to the desired global sparsity. We test\n\\textsc{2SSP} on four LLM families and three sparsity rates (25\\%, 37.5\\%, and\n50\\%), measuring the resulting perplexity over three language modeling datasets\nas well as the performance over six downstream tasks.

To address this, we\nintroduce generalized wheelspaces, which do form a symmetric monoidal category\nand provide solid ground for the theory of wheelgebras. To support their first\nclaim, Ginzburg and Schedler defined Poisson (Fock) wheelgebras in connection\nwith Van den Bergh's double Poisson algebras via the Fock functor. We provide\nstrong evidence to their claim by introducing symplectic wheelgebras and prove\nthat the Fock functor sends smooth bisymplectic algebras, as defined by W.\nCrawley-Boevey, V.

In\nthe process, we develop a Cartan calculus adapted to this wheeled context.\nMoreover, we present a wheeled version of the significant Van den Bergh\nfunctor, which facilitates a formalization of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg\nprinciple, bridging the noncommutative and commutative frameworks.

    "abstract": "Transformer models have made great strides in generating symbolically\nrepresented music with local coherence. However, controlling the development of\nmotifs in a structured way with global form remains an open research area. One\nof the reasons for this challenge is due to the note-by-note autoregressive\ngeneration of such models, which lack the ability to correct themselves after\ndeviations from the motif. In addition, their structural performance on\ndatasets with shorter durations has not been studied in the literature. In this\nstudy, we propose Yin-Yang, a framework consisting of a phrase generator,\nphrase refiner, and phrase selector models for the development of motifs into\nmelodies with long-term structure and controllability. The phrase refiner is\ntrained on a novel corruption-refinement strategy which allows it to produce\nmelodic and rhythmic variations of an original motif at generation time,\nthereby rectifying deviations of the phrase generator. We also introduce a new\nobjective evaluation metric for quantifying how smoothly the motif manifests\nitself within the piece. Evaluation results show that our model achieves better\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art transformer models while having the\nadvantage of being controllable and making the generated musical structure\nsemi-interpretable, paving the way for musical analysis.

    "abstract": "Gliomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system.\nMultimodal MRI is widely used for the preliminary screening of gliomas and\nplays a crucial role in auxiliary diagnosis, therapeutic efficacy, and\nprognostic evaluation. Currently, the computer-aided diagnostic studies of\ngliomas using MRI have focused on independent analysis events such as tumor\nsegmentation, grading, and radiogenomic classification, without studying\ninter-dependencies among these events. In this study, we propose a Glioma\nMultimodal MRI Analysis System (GMMAS) that utilizes a deep learning network\nfor processing multiple events simultaneously, leveraging their\ninter-dependencies through an uncertainty-based multi-task learning\narchitecture and synchronously outputting tumor region segmentation, glioma\nhistological subtype, IDH mutation genotype, and 1p/19q chromosome disorder\nstatus. Compared with the reported single-task analysis models, GMMAS improves\nthe precision across tumor layered diagnostic tasks. Additionally, we have\nemployed a two-stage semi-supervised learning method, enhancing model\nperformance by fully exploiting both labeled and unlabeled MRI samples.\nFurther, by utilizing an adaptation module based on knowledge self-distillation\nand contrastive learning for cross-modal feature extraction, GMMAS exhibited\nrobustness in situations of modality absence and revealed the differing\nsignificance of each MRI modal. Finally, based on the analysis outputs of the\nGMMAS, we created a visual and user-friendly platform for doctors and patients,\nintroducing GMMAS-GPT to generate personalized prognosis evaluations and\nsuggestions.",

    "abstract": "Seeking the external equitable partitions (EEPs) of networks under unknown\nstructures is an emerging problem in network analysis. The special structure of\nEEPs has found widespread applications in many fields such as cluster\nsynchronization and consensus dynamics. While most literature focuses on\nutilizing the special structural properties of EEPs for network studies, there\nhas been little work on the extraction of EEPs or their connection with graph\nsignals. In this paper, we address the interesting connection between low pass\ngraph signals and EEPs, which, as far as we know, is the first time. We provide\na method BE-EEPs for extracting EEPs from low pass graph signals and propose an\noptimization model, which is essentially a problem involving nonnegative\northogonality matrix decomposition. We derive theoretical error bounds for the\nperformance of our proposed method under certain assumptions and apply three\nalgorithms to solve the resulting model, including the K-means algorithm, the\npractical exact penalty method and the iterative Lagrangian approach. Numerical\nexperiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Under strong low\npass graph signals, the iterative Lagrangian and K-means perform equally well,\noutperforming the exact penalty method.

GPUs,\ncritical for tasks like machine learning (ML) and GenAI, are major contributors\nto power consumption. NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology improves GPU\nutilization by enabling isolated partitions with per-partition resource\ntracking, facilitating GPU sharing by multiple tenants. However, accurately\napportioning GPU power consumption among MIG instances remains challenging due\nto a lack of hardware support. This paper addresses this challenge by\ndeveloping software methods to estimate power usage per MIG partition. We\nanalyze NVIDIA GPU utilization metrics and find that light-weight methods with\ngood accuracy can be difficult to construct. We hence explore the use of\nML-based power models to enable accurate, partition-level power estimation. Our\nfindings reveal that a single generic offline power model or modeling method is\nnot applicable across diverse workloads, especially with concurrent MIG usage,\nand that online models constructed using partition-level utilization metrics of\nworkloads under execution can significantly improve accuracy. Using NVIDIA A100\nGPUs, we demonstrate this approach for accurate partition-level power\nestimation for workloads including matrix multiplication and Large Language\nModel inference, contributing to transparent and fair carbon reporting.",

Uncovering principles governing the development of\nsuch structure is a priority for the science of deep learning. In this paper,\nwe explore the transient ridge phenomenon: when transformers are trained on\nin-context linear regression tasks with intermediate task diversity, they\ninitially behave like ridge regression before specializing to the tasks in\ntheir training distribution. This transition from a general solution to a\nspecialized solution is revealed by joint trajectory principal component\nanalysis. Further, we draw on the theory of Bayesian internal model selection\nto suggest a general explanation for the phenomena of transient structure in\ntransformers, based on an evolving tradeoff between loss and complexity. We\nempirically validate this explanation by measuring the model complexity of our\ntransformers as defined by the local learning coefficient.",

We investigate what happens to this\nsymmetry structure once the theory is reduced on a circle to 5d and on a torus\nto 4d, especially when a non-trivial Stiefel-Whitney class for the flavor\nsymmetry is turned on.

Namely, we investigate the situation in which\nthe agents involved in a flocking process can possibly suspend the exchange of\ninformation among themselves at some times. Under a so-called Persistence\nExcitation Condition, we establish the exponential flocking for the considered\nmodel. The exponential decay estimates on the velocity diameters we obtain are\nindependent of the number of agents, which is convenient especially when the\nnumber of agents becomes too large. Exponential decay estimates with decay rate\ndepending on the number of agents appear instead in the case of pair-dependent\ntime delays and non-universal interaction, i.e. not all the agents are able to\nexchange information among themselves. In this paper, we rather consider a\nuniversal interaction and the time delay functions do not depend on the pair of\nagents. The analysis is then extended to a model with distributed time delay,\nnamely the time delay is not pointwise but the agents are influenced by the\ninformation received from the other components of the system in a certain time\ninterval.",

There is thus a need\nfor efficient and precise bug prioritization based on exploitability. In this\nwork, we explore the notion of control of an attacker over a vulnerability's\nparameters, which is an often overlooked factor of exploitability. We show that\ntaint as well as straightforward qualitative and quantitative notions of\ncontrol are not enough to effectively differentiate vulnerabilities. Instead,\nwe propose to focus analysis on feasible value sets, which we call domains of\ncontrol, in order to better take into account threat models and expert insight.\nOur new Shrink and Split algorithm efficiently extracts domains of control from\npath constraints obtained with symbolic execution and renders them in an easily\nprocessed, human-readable form. This in turn allows to automatically compute\nmore complex control metrics, such as weighted Quantitative Control, which\nfactors in the varying threat levels of different values. Experiments show that\nour method is both efficient and precise. In particular, it is the only one\nable to distinguish between vulnerabilities such as cve-2019-14192 and\ncve-2022-30552, while revealing a mistake in the human evaluation of\ncve-2022-30790.

Aims: Building on previous research, this study provides an in-depth\ninvestigation of testing practices in research software, focusing on test case\ndesign, challenges with expected outputs, use of quality metrics, execution\nmethods, tools, and desired tool features. Additionally, we explore whether\ndemographic factors influence testing processes. Method: We survey research\nsoftware developers to understand how they design test cases, handle output\nchallenges, use metrics, execute tests, and select tools. Results: Research\nsoftware testing varies widely. The primary challenges are test case design,\nevaluating test quality, and evaluating the correctness of test outputs.\nOverall, research software developers are not familiar with existing testing\ntools and have a need for new tools to support their specific needs.\nConclusion: Allocating human resources to testing and providing developers with\nknowledge about effective testing techniques are important steps toward\nimproving the testing process of research software. While many industrial\ntesting tools exist, they are inadequate for testing research software due to\nits complexity, specialized algorithms, continuous updates, and need for\nflexible, custom testing approaches.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing and other assay\ntechnologies has resulted in the generation of large and complex multi-omics\ndatasets, offering unprecedented opportunities for advancing precision medicine\nstrategies. However, multi-omics data integration presents significant\nchallenges due to the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, experimental gaps,\nand frequency of missing values across data types. Computational methods have\nbeen developed to address these issues, employing statistical and machine\nlearning approaches to uncover complex biological patterns and provide deeper\ninsights into our understanding of disease mechanisms. Here, we comprehensively\nreview state-of-the-art multi-omics data integration methods with a focus on\ndeep generative models, particularly variational autoencoders (VAEs) that have\nbeen widely used for data imputation and augmentation, joint embedding\ncreation, and batch effect correction. We explore the technical aspects of loss\nfunctions and regularisation techniques including adversarial training,\ndisentanglement and contrastive learning. Moreover, we discuss recent\nadvancements in foundation models and the integration of emerging data\nmodalities, while describing the current limitations and outlining future\ndirections for enhancing multi-modal methodologies in biomedical research.",

We aim to\ninvestigate whether NIRSpec/PRISM JWST transmission spectroscopy observations,\nin addition to being useful to detect and determine the abundance of gases more\naccurately than any previous instruments, are also capable of studying the\nphysical properties of the aerosols in exoplanetary atmospheres. We perform\nnested sampling Bayesian retrievals with MultiNest library.

Retrievals indicate that models including an aerosol\nextinction weakly increasing or sharply decreasing with wavelength are\ndecisively better than those with a flat transmission and that this increased\ndegree of complexity is supported by the kind of data that JWST/NIRSpec can\nprovide. Given other physical constraints from previous works, the scenario of\nweakly increasing particle extinction is favoured. We also find that this also\nhas an effect on the retrieved gas abundances.

By comparing features between the original and generated images, we\nintroduce a dual-scoring system: one score quantifies localization accuracy,\nwhile the other evaluates semantic consistency. This approach significantly\noutperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in pathology\nlocalization and text-to-image alignment.

We\nutilize user-chatbot conversations that were self-posted on a Korean\nReddit-like community, containing specific testing and gaming intentions with a\nsocial chatbot. With these prompts, we aim to evaluate LLMs' ability to\nidentify the type of conversation and users' testing purposes to derive chatbot\ndesign implications for mitigating jailbreaking risks. Our dataset will be made\npublicly available via GitHub.",

Finding new systems\nwith optimized bulk superconducting properties is therefore important for\nadvancing our understanding of these materials. Unlike cupates, where trilayer\ncompounds typically exhibit the highest transition temperature (Tc), the\nbilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has thus far outperformed the trilayer La4Ni3O10 in\nreported Tc. Whether the trilayer nickelates have achieved the optimal Tc\nremains unclear, with various scenarios suggesting different possibilities.\nHere, we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in pressurized\nPr4Ni3O10 single crystals, achieving a maximum onset Tc of 40.5 K at 80.1 GPa,\nsignificantly exceeding the 30 K observed in La4Ni3O10. The bulk nature of\nsuperconductivity is confirmed by zero resistance and a strong diamagnetic\nresponse below Tc with a superconducting volume fraction exceeding 80%.

    "abstract": "Peaked-spectrum (PS) sources, known for their distinct peaked radio spectra,\nrepresent a type of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN). Among these,\nmegahertz-peaked spectrum (MPS) sources, which exhibit a spectral peak at a\nfrequency of a hundred megahertz, have emerged as a potential tool for\nidentifying high-redshift candidates. However, the potential evolutionary link\nbetween the fraction of these sources and redshift remains unclear and requires\nfurther investigation. The recent, high sensitivity Low Frequency Array (LOFAR)\nsurveys enable statistical studies of these objects to ultra-low frequencies (<\n150 MHz). In this study, we first use the multiradio data to investigate the\nevolution of spectral index with redshift for 1,187 quasars from the SDSS 16th\nquasar catalog. For each quasar, we analyze available data from the LOFAR Low\nBand Antenna (LBA) at 54 MHz, High Band Antenna (HBA) at 144 MHz, and the Very\nLarge Array (VLA) the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) at 1.4\nGHz. We measure the spectral index ($\\alpha^{144}_{54}$ and\n$\\alpha^{1400}_{144}$) and find no significant change in their median values\nwith the redshift. Extended sources have steeper spectral indices than compact\nsources, which is consistent with previous findings. Based on the spectral\nindices information, we identify MPS sources using these criteria: $\\rm\n\\alpha^{144}_{54} >= 0.1$ and $\\rm \\alpha^{1400}_{144} < 0$, and analyze their\nproperties. We find that the fraction of MPS sources is constant with the\nredshift ($0.1-4.8$), bolometric luminosity ($\\rm 10^{44}-10^{48} erg/s$), and\nsupermassive black hole mass ($\\rm 10^{7}-10^{10.5} M_{\\odot}$), which suggests\nthat MPS sources have relatively stable physical conditions or formation\nmechanisms across various evolutionary stages and environments.",

NutMaat successfully identified chemically peculiar stars, tested on\nLAMOST DR7 ACV variables, and processed the SDSS-IV MaStar library -- which\nlacks native MK classifications -- to produce a stellar catalog, demonstrating\nsurvey readiness. Future development of NutMaat will focus on extending\nwavelength coverage beyond the 3800--5600 $\\r{A}$ range, computational\nacceleration via Cython, and refining peculiarity classification. Beyond its\ntechnical design, NutMaat can provide consistent, MK-standard classification\nacross large-scale spectroscopic surveys, facilitating reliable stellar\npopulation analyses, identification of rare objects, and the construction of\nhigh-quality spectral catalogs essential for galactic archaeology and stellar\nevolution studies.

On the smallest scales studied so far,\nnamely within individual granules, two mechanisms have been identified:\nemergence in tiny magnetic loops and emergence in the form of magnetic flux\nsheets covering the granule. While there are abundant observations of tiny\nmagnetic loops within granules, the evidence for the emergence of\ngranule-covering magnetic sheets is much more limited. This work aims to\nstatistically analyze magnetic flux sheets, quantify their frequency on the\nsolar surface and their potential contribution to the solar magnetic budget in\nthe photosphere, and investigate the plasma dynamics and granular-scale\nphenomena associated with their emergence. Using spectro-polarimetric datasets\nfrom the solar optical telescope aboard the Hinode satellite and the\nground-based Swedish Solar telescope, we developed a two-step method to\nidentify magnetic flux sheet emergence events, detecting magnetic flux patches\nbased on the calculation of the transverse and longitudinal magnetic flux\ndensity and associating them with their host granules based on velocity field\nanalysis. We identified 42 events of magnetic flux sheet emergence and\ncharacterized their magnetic properties and the associated plasma dynamics of\ntheir host granules. Our results align with numerical simulations, indicating a\nsimilar occurrence rate. We investigated the relationship between magnetic flux\nemergence and granular phenomena, finding that flux sheets often emerge in\nassociation with standard nascent granules, as well as exploding granules, or\ngranules with granular lanes. In particular, we highlight the potential role of\nrecycled magnetic flux from downflow regions in facilitating flux sheet\nemergence.",

This harvested energy is dependent on\nunpredictable environmental conditions; therefore, device operations, including\nthose of its networking stack, must be resilient to power failures. Reactive\nintermittent computing provides an approach for solving this by notifications\nof impending power failures, which is implemented by monitoring the harvested\nenergy buffered in a capacitor. However, to use this power-failure notification\nand guarantee forward progress, systems must break down tasks into atomic\ntransactions that can be predictably finished before the energy runs out. Thus,\nstatic program-code analysis must determine the worst-case energy consumption\n(WCEC) of all transactions. In Wi-Fi-capable devices, drivers are often\nclosed-source, which avoids the determination of WCEC bounds for transactions\nsince static analysis requires all code along with its semantics.\n  In this work, we integrate an energy-aware networking stack with\nreverse-engineered Wi-Fi drivers to enable full-stack WCEC analysis for\nphysical transmission and reception of packets. Further, we extended a static\nworst-case analysis tool with a resource-consumption model of our Wi-Fi driver.\nOur evaluation with the RISC-V-based ESP32-C3 platform gives worst-case bounds\nwith our static analysis approach for the transactions of the full\ncommunication stack, therefore showing that Wi-Fi-based reactive intermittent\ncomputing is feasible.",

A\npredominant approach to implementing contrastive learning is applying InfoNCE\nloss: By capturing the similarities between pairs, InfoNCE loss enables\nlearning the representation of data. Albeit its success, adopting InfoNCE loss\nrequires tuning a temperature, which is a core hyperparameter for calibrating\nsimilarity scores. Despite its significance and sensitivity to performance\nbeing emphasized by several studies, searching for a valid temperature requires\nextensive trial-and-error-based experiments, which increases the difficulty of\nadopting InfoNCE loss. To address this difficulty, we propose a novel method to\ndeploy InfoNCE loss without temperature. Specifically, we replace temperature\nscaling with the inverse hyperbolic tangent function, resulting in a modified\nInfoNCE loss. In addition to hyperparameter-free deployment, we observed that\nthe proposed method even yielded a performance gain in contrastive learning.\nOur detailed theoretical analysis discovers that the current practice of\ntemperature scaling in InfoNCE loss causes serious problems in gradient\ndescent, whereas our method provides desirable gradient properties.

While it has been\nobserved in various sources, its detection in Sgr B2 is notable as the\n2$_{11}$-2$_{12}$ rotational transition exhibits maser features. This indicates\nthat local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions are not fulfilled, and an\naccurate estimation of the molecular abundance in such conditions involves\nsolving the statistical equilibrium equations taking into account the\ncompetition between the radiative and collisional processes. This in turn\nrequires the knowledge of rotational excitation data for collisions with the\nmost abundant species - He or H$_2$. In this paper the first three-dimensional\nCH$_2$CHCN - He potential energy surface is computed using explicitly\ncorrelated coupled-cluster theory [(CCSD(T)-F12] with a combination of two\nbasis sets. Scattering calculations of the rotational (de-)excitation of\nCH$_2$CHCN induced by He atoms are performed with the quantum-mechanical\nclose-coupling method in the low-energy regime. Rotational state-to-state cross\nsections derived from these calculations are used to compute the corresponding\nrate coefficients. The interaction potential exhibits a high anisotropy, with a\nglobal minimum of $-53.5$ cm$^{-1}$ and multiple local minima. Collisional\ncross sections are calculated for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$. By\nthermally averaging the cross-sections, collisional rate coefficients are\ndetermined for temperatures up to 20 K. A propensity favouring the transitions\nwith $\\Delta k_a=0$ is observed.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress across\nvarious domains, but their increasing scale results in high computational and\nmemory costs. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity,\nproviding the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques.\nHowever, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune\nparadigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their\ndirect removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a\nsubstantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then\nprunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a\nsimple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for\nLLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be\npruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining\nparts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the\ninformation loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language\nmodeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS\nsignificantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning\nratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.",

Existing work typically adds noise to the next\nitem and progressively denoises it guided by the user's interaction sequence,\ngenerating items that closely align with user interests. However, we identify\ntwo key issues in this paradigm. First, the sequences are often heterogeneous\nin length and content, exhibiting noise due to stochastic user behaviors. Using\nsuch sequences as guidance may hinder DMs from accurately understanding user\ninterests. Second, DMs are prone to data bias and tend to generate only the\npopular items that dominate the training dataset, thus failing to meet the\npersonalized needs of different users. To address these issues, we propose\nDistinguished Quantized Guidance for Diffusion-based Sequence Recommendation\n(DiQDiff), which aims to extract robust guidance to understand user interests\nand generate distinguished items for personalized user interests within DMs. To\nextract robust guidance, DiQDiff introduces Semantic Vector Quantization (SVQ)\nto quantize sequences into semantic vectors (e.g., collaborative signals and\ncategory interests) using a codebook, which can enrich the guidance to better\nunderstand user interests. To generate distinguished items, DiQDiff\npersonalizes the generation through Contrastive Discrepancy Maximization (CDM),\nwhich maximizes the distance between denoising trajectories using contrastive\nloss to prevent biased generation for different users. Extensive experiments\nare conducted to compare DiQDiff with multiple baseline models across four\nwidely-used datasets.

Recent efforts have focused on addressing these\nrobustness issues by establishing rigorous theoretical guarantees for the\nreturns achieved by DRL agents in adversarial settings. Among these approaches,\npolicy smoothing has proven to be an effective and scalable method for\ncertifying the robustness of DRL agents.

    "abstract": "As industries increasingly adopt large robotic fleets, there is a pressing\nneed for computationally efficient, practical, and optimal conflict-free path\nplanning for multiple robots. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) is a popular method\nfor multi-agent path finding (MAPF) due to its completeness and optimality;\nhowever, it is often impractical for real-world applications, as it is\ncomputationally intensive to solve and relies on assumptions about agents and\noperating environments that are difficult to realize. This article proposes a\nsolution to overcome computational challenges and practicality issues of CBS by\nutilizing structural-semantic topometric maps. Instead of running CBS over\nlarge grid-based maps, the proposed solution runs CBS over a sparse topometric\nmap containing structural-semantic cells representing intersections, pathways,\nand dead ends. This approach significantly accelerates the MAPF process and\nreduces the number of conflict resolutions handled by CBS while operating in\ncontinuous time. In the proposed method, robots are assigned time ranges to\nmove between topometric regions, departing from the traditional CBS assumption\nthat a robot can move to any connected cell in a single time step. The approach\nis validated through real-world multi-robot path-finding experiments and\nbenchmarking simulations. The results demonstrate that the proposed MAPF method\ncan be applied to real-world non-holonomic robots and yields significant\nimprovement in computational efficiency compared to traditional CBS methods\nwhile improving conflict detection and resolution in cases of corridor\nsymmetries.",

The breakthrough of the autonomous car brings\nconcerns about ride comfort, while the pollution concerns have arisen in recent\nyears. In the model of automated automobiles, drivers are expected to become\npassengers, so, they will be more prone to suffer from ride discomfort or\nmotion sickness. Conversely, the eco-driving implications should not be set\naside because of the influence of pollution on climate and people's health. For\nthat reason, a joint assessment of the aforementioned points would have a\npositive impact. Thus, this work presents a self-organised map-based solution\nto assess ride comfort features of individuals considering their driving style\nfrom the viewpoint of eco-driving. For this purpose, a previously acquired\ndataset from an instrumented car was used to classify drivers regarding the\ncauses of their lack of ride comfort and eco-friendliness. Once drivers are\nclassified regarding their driving style, natural-language-based\nrecommendations are proposed to increase the engagement with the system.

However, neither the centers nor surfaces of\nthe Gaussians are accurately aligned to the object surface, complicating their\ndirect use in point cloud and mesh reconstruction. Additionally, 3DGS typically\nproduces floater artifacts, increasing the number of Gaussians and storage\nrequirements. To address these issues, we present FeatureGS, which incorporates\nan additional geometric loss term based on an eigenvalue-derived 3D shape\nfeature into the optimization process of 3DGS. The goal is to improve geometric\naccuracy and enhance properties of planar surfaces with reduced structural\nentropy in local 3D neighborhoods.We present four alternative formulations for\nthe geometric loss term based on 'planarity' of Gaussians, as well as\n'planarity', 'omnivariance', and 'eigenentropy' of Gaussian neighborhoods. We\nprovide quantitative and qualitative evaluations on 15 scenes of the DTU\nbenchmark dataset focusing on following key aspects: Geometric accuracy and\nartifact-reduction, measured by the Chamfer distance, and memory efficiency,\nevaluated by the total number of Gaussians. Additionally, rendering quality is\nmonitored by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio. FeatureGS achieves a 30 % improvement\nin geometric accuracy, reduces the number of Gaussians by 90 %, and suppresses\nfloater artifacts, while maintaining comparable photometric rendering quality.\nThe geometric loss with 'planarity' from Gaussians provides the highest\ngeometric accuracy, while 'omnivariance' in Gaussian neighborhoods reduces\nfloater artifacts and number of Gaussians the most.

An electrode array inserted in\nthe cochlea bypasses the natural transducer mechanism that transforms\nmechanical sound waves into neural activity by artificially stimulating the\nauditory nerve fibers with electrical pulses. The perception of sounds is\npossible because the brain extracts features from this neural activity, and\nloudness is among the most fundamental perceptual features.\n  A computational model that uses a three-dimensional (3D) representation of\nthe peripheral auditory system of CI users was developed to predict categorical\nloudness from the simulated peripheral neural activity. In contrast, current\nstate-of-the-art computational loudness models predict loudness from the\nelectrical pulses with minimal parametrization of the electrode-nerve\ninterface. In the proposed model, the spikes produced in a population of\nauditory nerve fibers were grouped by cochlear places, a physiological\nrepresentation of the auditory filters in psychoacoustics, to be transformed\ninto loudness contribution. Then, a loudness index was obtained with a\nspatiotemporal integration over this loudness contribution. This index served\nto define the simulated threshold of hearing (THL) and most comfortable\nloudness (MCL) levels resembling the growth function in CI users.\n  The performance of real CI users in loudness summation experiments was also\nused to validate the computational model. These experiments studied the effect\nof stimulation rate, electrode separation and amplitude modulation.

In\nparticular, recent studies have claimed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can\npass the Turing Test-a goal for AI since the 1950s-and therefore can \"think\".\nLarge-scale impacts on society have been predicted as a result. Upon detailed\nexamination, however, none of these studies has faithfully applied Turing's\noriginal instructions. Consequently, we conducted a rigorous Turing Test with\nGPT-4-Turbo that adhered closely to Turing's instructions for a three-player\nimitation game. We followed established scientific standards where Turing's\ninstructions were ambiguous or missing. For example, we performed a\nComputer-Imitates-Human Game (CIHG) without constraining the time duration and\nconducted a Man-Imitates-Woman Game (MIWG) as a benchmark. All but one\nparticipant correctly identified the LLM, showing that one of today's most\nadvanced LLMs is unable to pass a rigorous Turing Test. We conclude that recent\nextravagant claims for such models are unsupported, and do not warrant either\noptimism or concern about the social impact of thinking machines.",

Applied to\ndistributed Gaussian process regression (D-GPR), the method facilitates\nlow-latency, low-complexity, and high-accuracy distributed regression across a\nrange of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

    "abstract": "Despite remarkable advancements in recent voice conversion (VC) systems,\nenhancing speaker similarity in zero-shot scenarios remains challenging. This\nchallenge arises from the difficulty of generalizing and adapting speaker\ncharacteristics in speech within zero-shot environments, which is further\ncomplicated by mismatch between the training and inference processes. To\naddress these challenges, we propose VoicePrompter, a robust zero-shot VC model\nthat leverages in-context learning with voice prompts. VoicePrompter is\ncomposed of (1) a factorization method that disentangles speech components and\n(2) a DiT-based conditional flow matching (CFM) decoder that conditions on\nthese factorized features and voice prompts. Additionally, (3) latent mixup is\nused to enhance in-context learning by combining various speaker features. This\napproach improves speaker similarity and naturalness in zero-shot VC by\napplying mixup to latent representations. Experimental results demonstrate that\nVoicePrompter outperforms existing zero-shot VC systems in terms of speaker\nsimilarity, speech intelligibility, and audio quality.

We especially focus on the violated\nrelative intensities between different optical FeII lines, whose relative\nstrengths do not follow the expected values according to atomic parameters. We\ninvestigated the connection between this effect and the ratio of optical to UV\nFeII lines (FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$). We divided the optical FeII lines into\ntwo large line groups: consistent (FeII$_{cons}$), whose relative intensities\nare in accordance with their atomic properties, and inconsistent\n(FeII$_{incons}$), whose relative intensities are significantly stronger than\ntheoretically expected. We fitted the spectra with a flexible optical FeII\nmodel, where Fe II lines were divided into several line groups and fitted\nindependently. We focused particularly on understanding the processes that\nproduce strong inconsistent Fe II lines, and therefore, we investigated their\ncorrelations with FeII$_{cons}$ and with UV FeII lines. The ratios of\nFeII$_{incons}$/FeII$_{cons}$ and FeII$_{opt}$/FeII$_{UV}$ increase as the\nEddington ratio increases and as the line widths decrease. It is possible that\nboth ratios are affected by the process of self-absorption of stronger lines,\nwhich is responsible for the transmission of energy from the UV to the optical\nFeII emission lines and, analogously, from the FeII$_{cons}$ to the\nFeII$_{incons}$ lines. In this scenario, the high Eddington ratio causes an\nincrease in the optical depth in FeII lines, which results in the triggering of\nthe process of self-absorption. The observed FeII spectrum is probably a\ncomplex mixture of radiation from emission regions with different physical\nconditions.",

Each time step, therefore,\nconsists of evolution under the transverse Ising Hamiltonian for a time $\\tau$,\nfollowed by a measurement that provides a ``yes/no'' answer to the question,\n``Are all spins up?''. The survival probability after $n$ time-steps is defined\nas the probability that the answer is ``no'' in all the $n$ time-steps. For\nvarious $\\tau$ values, we compute the survival probability, entanglement in\nbipartition, and the generalized geometric measure, a genuine multiparty\nentanglement, for a chain of size $L \\sim 26$, and identify a transition at\n$\\tau_c \\sim 0.2$ for field strength $h=1/2$.

Two TMU variants address different constraints: a Tiny-Counter\nsolution for tightly area-constrained systems and a Full-Counter solution for\ncritical subordinates in mixed-criticality SoCs. The Tiny-Counter employs a\nsingle counter per outstanding transaction, while the Full-Counter uses\nmultiple counters to track distinct transaction stages, offering finer-grained\nmonitoring and reducing detection latencies by up to hundreds of cycles at\nroughly 2.5x the area cost. The Full-Counter also provides detailed error logs\nfor performance and bottleneck analysis. Evaluations at both IP and system\nlevels confirm the TMU's effectiveness and low overhead. In GF12 technology,\nmonitoring 16-32 outstanding transactions occupies 1330-2616 um2 for the\nTiny-Counter and 3452-6787 um2 for the Full-Counter; moderate prescaler steps\nreduce these figures by 18-39% and 19-32%, respectively, with no loss of\nfunctionality.

Using a hybrid Particle-In-Cell/Monte-Carlo Collisions (PIC/MCC)\nsimulation, the study systematically varies the applied voltage and driving\nfrequency to explore the operation modes and their relations. The results\nreveal that at low input power, the COST-Jet operates in a non-neutral mode,\ncharacterized by a discharge close to extinction, analogous to the chaotic mode\nobserved in other plasma devices. As power increases, the jet transitions to a\nquasi-neutral mode, which aligns with the well-known {\\Omega}- and Penning\nmodes, comparable to the bullet mode in parallel-field jets. At the highest\npower levels, the COST-Jet enters a constricted mode, where the plasma\nsignificantly densifies and constricts towards the electrodes along the entire\ndischarge channel. Experimental validation using phase-resolved optical\nemission spectroscopy (PROES) supports the simulation findings, particularly\nidentifying the constricted mode as a distinct operational regime.

    "abstract": "Modeling spatial heterogeneity in the data generation process is essential\nfor understanding and predicting geographical phenomena. Despite their\nprevalence in geospatial tasks, neural network models usually assume spatial\nstationarity, which could limit their performance in the presence of spatial\nprocess heterogeneity. By allowing model parameters to vary over space, several\napproaches have been proposed to incorporate spatial heterogeneity into neural\nnetworks. However, current geographically weighting approaches are ineffective\non graph neural networks, yielding no significant improvement in prediction\naccuracy. We assume the crux lies in the over-fitting risk brought by a large\nnumber of local parameters. Accordingly, we propose to model spatial process\nheterogeneity at the regional level rather than at the individual level, which\nlargely reduces the number of spatially varying parameters. We further develop\na heuristic optimization procedure to learn the region partition adaptively in\nthe process of model training. Our proposed spatial-heterogeneity-aware graph\nconvolutional network, named RegionGCN, is applied to the spatial prediction of\ncounty-level vote share in the 2016 US presidential election based on\nsocioeconomic attributes. Results show that RegionGCN achieves significant\nimprovement over the basic and geographically weighted GCNs. We also offer an\nexploratory analysis tool for the spatial variation of non-linear relationships\nthrough ensemble learning of regional partitions from RegionGCN. Our work\ncontributes to the practice of Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI) in\ntackling spatial heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Accurate sentiment analysis of texts is crucial for a variety of\napplications, such as understanding customer feedback, monitoring market\ntrends, and detecting public sentiment. However, manually annotating large\nsentiment corpora for supervised learning is labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. Therefore, it is essential and effective to develop a\nsemi-supervised method for the sentiment analysis task. Although some methods\nhave been proposed for semi-supervised text classification, they rely on the\nintrinsic information within the unlabeled data and the learning capability of\nthe NLP model, which lack generalization ability to the sentiment analysis\nscenario and may prone to overfit. Inspired by the ability of pretrained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) in following instructions and generating coherent text,\nwe propose a Semantic Consistency Regularization with Large Language Models\n(SCR) framework for semi-supervised sentiment analysis. We introduce two\nprompting strategies to semantically enhance unlabeled text using LLMs. The\nfirst is Entity-based Enhancement (SCR-EE), which involves extracting entities\nand numerical information, and querying the LLM to reconstruct the textual\ninformation. The second is Concept-based Enhancement (SCR-CE), which directly\nqueries the LLM with the original sentence for semantic reconstruction.\nSubsequently, the LLM-augmented data is utilized for a consistency loss with\nconfidence thresholding, which preserves high-quality agreement samples to\nprovide additional supervision signals during training. Furthermore, to fully\nutilize the uncertain unlabeled data samples, we propose a class re-assembling\nstrategy inspired by the class space shrinking theorem.

A promising solution to this is\nthe use of invariant modes to whom the medium appears transparent. While the\ncreation and robustness of these modes has been experimentally demonstrated,\nthey are difficult to implement in many important applications due to large\nchannel matrices, a susceptibility to numerical artefacts, non-physical\nsolutions and unreliable performance. In this work, we outline a procedure for\ndetermining these invariant modes using a modal basis, which results in a set\nof eigenmodes that are free of these issues, are consistently realisable and\nrequire a much smaller channel matrix to compute. Using atmospheric turbulence\nand LG modes as the underlying basis as an illustrative example, we find robust\nmodes for a variety of turbulence strengths with a basis of only 231 modes, one\norder of magnitude smaller than previous approaches. These modes consistently\nshow a fidelity of above 80% after propagating through the complex channel, a\nsignificant improvement over sending the individual LG modes themselves and\nreveal an invariant modal spectrum through the channel.

    "abstract": "Gas-phase hydroxylamine (NH$_2$OH) has recently been detected within dense\nclouds in the interstellar medium. However, it is also likely present within\ninterstellar ices, as well as on the icy surfaces of outer Solar System bodies,\nwhere it may react to form more complex prebiotic molecules such as amino\nacids. In this work, we aimed to provide IR spectra of NH$_2$OH in\nastrophysical ice analogues that will help in the search for this molecule in\nvarious astrophysical environments. Furthermore, we aimed to provide\nquantitative information on the stability of NH$_2$OH upon exposure to ionizing\nradiation analogous to cosmic rays, as well as on the ensuing chemistry and\npotential formation of complex prebiotic molecules. Ices composed of NH$_2$OH,\nH$_2$O, and CO were prepared by vapor deposition and IR spectra were acquired\nbetween $4000-500$~cm$^{-1}$ ($2.5-20 \\mu$m) prior and during irradiation using\n15 keV protons. In interstellar ice analogues, the most prominent IR absorption\nband of NH$_2$OH is that at about 1188~cm$^{-1}$, which may be a good candidate\nto use in searches of this species in icy space environments. Calculated\neffective destruction cross-sections and G-values for the NH$_2$OH-rich ices\nstudied show that NH$_2$OH is rapidly destroyed upon exposure to ionizing\nradiation (more rapidly than a number of previously studied organic molecules),\nand that this destruction is slightly enhanced when it is mixed with other icy\nspecies. The irradiation of a NH$_2$OH:H$_2$O:CO ternary ice mixture leads to a\nrich chemistry that includes the formation of simple inorganic molecules such\nas NH$_3$, CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and H$_2$O$_2$, as well as ammonium salts and,\npossibly, complex organic molecules relevant to life such as formamide, formic\nacid, urea, and glycine.",

Thermal sensing using inexpensive and\nminiature thermal arrays emerges with an excellent utility-privacy balance,\noffering an imaging resolution significantly lower than cameras but far\nsuperior to RF signals like radar or WiFi. The design of TAPOR, however, is\nchallenging, mainly because the captured temperature maps are low-resolution\nand textureless. To overcome the challenges, we investigate thermo-depth and\nthermo-pose properties, proposing a novel physics-inspired neural network that\nlearns effective 3D spatial representations of potential hand poses. We then\nformulate the 3D pose reconstruction problem as a distinct retrieval task,\nenabling accurate hand pose determination from the input temperature map. To\ndeploy TAPOR on IoT devices, we introduce an effective heterogeneous knowledge\ndistillation method, reducing computation by 377x. TAPOR is fully implemented\nand tested in real-world scenarios, showing remarkable performance, supported\nby four gesture control and finger tracking case studies.

    "abstract": "The mechanical response of a cantilever made of a magnetoactive elastomer\n(MAE) that is positioned on a solid plane surface and is subjected to a uniform\nmagnetic field is studied. The MAE is of the magnetically soft type, i.e., its\nfiller particles become magnetized only in the presence of external field. Test\nobservations with the applied field normal to the plane reveal two possible\nperturbed configurations of the cantilever: either its free end just bends\nupward or the cantilever folds into an arc, so that its free end does not\ndetach from the supporting plane. The tests evidence that under cyclic\nvariation of the field both deformation modes exhibit quite a wide bistability\nregion, i.e., a magnetomechanical hysteresis takes place. Theoretical analysis\nshows that the cantilever bending scenario is indeed similar to that of the\nfirst-order transition. However, unlike the customary case, hereby the initial\nstate never ceases to exist and remains stable against infinitesimal\nperturbations under arbitrary strong fields. Although this conclusion is valid\nonly for an ideal situation, its nontrivial consequence is that the field value\nunder which the transition to the bent state occurs is, in fact, unpredictable.\nThe discovered effect is essentially different from the previously investigated\nbehaviour of MAE cantilevers under an in-plane field; there the transition is\nof the second-order kind and is completely reversible. Finally, if to consider\na horizontal MAE cantilever as an element of an assembly of magnetic cilia, it\nturns out that it behaves in the way opposite to that of conventional systems\nwhere in the initial state the MAE cilia stand normally to the supporting\nsurface.",

However, the current need to manually inspect\nimages places a heavy burden on healthcare systems, spurring a desire for\nautomated diagnostic protocols. Techniques based on deep neural networks have\nbeen shown effective in some studies, but their tendency to overfit leaves\nconsiderable risk for poor generalisation and misdiagnosis, preventing their\nwidespread adoption in clinical settings. Data augmentation schemes based on\nunpaired neural style transfer models have been proposed that improve\ngeneralisability by diversifying the representations of training image features\nin the absence of paired training data (images of the same tissue in either\nimage style). But these models are similarly prone to various pathologies, and\nevaluating their performance is challenging without ground truths/large\ndatasets (as is often the case in medical imaging). Here, we consider two\nframeworks/architectures: a GAN-based cycleGAN, and the more recently developed\ndiffusion-based SynDiff. We evaluate their performance when trained on image\npatches parsed from three open access mammography datasets and one non-medical\nimage dataset. We consider the use of uncertainty quantification to assess\nmodel trustworthiness, and propose a scheme to evaluate calibration quality in\nunpaired training scenarios.

While existing research\nhas primarily focused on batch learning from static datasets, limited attention\nhas been given to imbalanced regression in online learning scenarios. Intending\nto address this gap, in prior work, we proposed sampling strategies based on\nChebyshevs inequality as the first methodologies designed explicitly for data\nstreams. However, these approaches operated under the restrictive assumption\nthat rare instances exclusively reside at distribution extremes. This study\nintroduces histogram-based sampling strategies to overcome this constraint,\nproposing flexible solutions for imbalanced regression in evolving data\nstreams. The proposed techniques -- Histogram-based Undersampling (HistUS) and\nHistogram-based Oversampling (HistOS) -- employ incremental online histograms\nto dynamically detect and prioritize rare instances across arbitrary regions of\nthe target distribution to improve predictions in the rare cases.

Here, we report anomalous Raman spectra in\nsingle-crystalline AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$, a layered antiferromagnetic material.\nDensity functional theory calculations and experimental measurements reveal\nseveral unique features in the Raman spectra of bulk and exfoliated\nAgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ crystals including three helical vibrational modes.

We also observe\nstrong excitation energy dependent peak intensities as well as a decrease in\nanti-Stokes peak intensities at room temperature with increasing excitation\nenergy, resulting in an apparent cooling by up to 220 K. All of these anomalies\nin bulk and exfoliated flakes are attributed to the unique ABC layer stacking\nstructure of AgCrP$_2$Se$_6$ and to the smaller unit cell volume that causes\nhybridization between the Se and Ag/Cr electron densities, resulting in charge\ntransfer and strongly a^ecting the electron-phonon coupling.

Golinsky proposed a linear programming (LP) relaxation of the\nproblem of computing an optimal static STT over a given tree topology. He used\nthis LP formulation to compute an STT that is a $2$-approximation to an optimal\nSTT, and conjectured that it is, in fact, an extended formulation of the\nconvex-hull of all depths-vectors of STTs, and thus always gives an optimal\nsolution. In this work we study this LP approach further. We show that the\nconjecture is false and that Golinsky's LP does not always give an optimal\nsolution. To show this we use what we call the ``normals method''. We use this\nmethod to enumerate over vertices of Golinsky's polytope for all tree\ntopologies of no more than 8 nodes. We give a lower bound on the integrality\ngap of the LP and on the approximation ratio of Golinsky's rounding method.

To facilitate the\ndevelopment of designing efficient learning algorithms for solving multiplayer\ngames, we propose a multiplayer game platform for solving Urban Network\nSecurity Games (\\textbf{UNSG}) that model real-world scenarios. That is,\npreventing criminal activity is a highly significant responsibility assigned to\npolice officers in cities, and police officers have to allocate their limited\nsecurity resources to interdict the escaping criminal when a crime takes place\nin a city. This interaction between multiple police officers and the escaping\ncriminal can be modeled as a UNSG. The variants of UNSGs can model different\nreal-world settings, e.g., whether real-time information is available or not,\nand whether police officers can communicate or not. The main challenges of\nsolving this game include the large size of the game and the co-existence of\ncooperation and competition. While previous efforts have been made to tackle\nUNSGs, they have been hampered by performance and scalability issues.\nTherefore, we propose an open-source UNSG platform (\\textbf{GraphChase}) for\ndesigning efficient learning algorithms for solving UNSGs. Specifically,\nGraphChase offers a unified and flexible game environment for modeling various\nvariants of UNSGs, supporting the development, testing, and benchmarking of\nalgorithms.

VQ-based methods, such as\nTimeVQVAE, have demonstrated success in generating time series but are hindered\nby two critical bottlenecks: information loss during compression into discrete\nlatent spaces and deviations in the learned prior distribution from the ground\ntruth distribution. These challenges result in synthetic time series with\ncompromised fidelity and distributional accuracy. To overcome these\nlimitations, NM-VQTSG leverages a U-Net-based neural mapping model to bridge\nthe distributional gap between synthetic and ground truth time series. To be\nmore specific, the model refines synthetic data by addressing artifacts\nintroduced during generation, effectively aligning the distributions of\nsynthetic and real data. Importantly, NM-VQTSG can be used for synthetic time\nseries generated by any VQ-based generative method. We evaluate NM-VQTSG across\ndiverse datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification archive, demonstrating\nits capability to consistently enhance fidelity in both unconditional and\nconditional generation tasks. The improvements are evidenced by significant\nimprovements in FID, IS, and conditional FID, additionally backed up by visual\ninspection in a data space and a latent space.

    "abstract": "Context. The evolution and the surrounding of stripped-envelope supernova\nprogenitors are still under debate: some studies suggest single-star, while\nothers prefer massive binary progenitors. Moreover, the basic physical\nproperties of the exploding star and its interaction with circumstellar matter\ncould significantly modify the overall light curve features of these objects.\nTo better understand the effect of stellar evolution and circumstellar\ninteraction, systematic hydrodynamic calculations are needed.\n  Aims. Here, we test the hypothesis that circumstellar matter generated by an\nextreme episodic $\\eta$ Carinae-like eruption that occurs days or weeks before\nthe supernova explosion may explain the controversies related to the general\nlight curve features of stripped-envelope supernovae.\n  Methods. In this work, we present our bolometric light curve calculations of\nboth single- and binary progenitors generated by hydrodynamic simulations via\nMESA and SNEC. We also studied the effect of an interaction with a close,\nlow-mass circumstellar matter assumed to be created just a few days or weeks\nbefore the explosion. Beyond generating a model light curve grid, we compared\nour results with some observational data.\n  Results. We found that merely the shape of the supernova light curve could\nindicate that the cataclysmic death of the massive star happened in a binary\nsystem or was related to the explosion of a single star. Moreover, our study\nalso shows that a confined dense circumstellar matter may be responsible for\nthe strange light curve features (bumps, re-brightening, or steeper tail) of\nsome Type Ib/c supernovae.",

    "abstract": "This work considers an Inertial version of Bregman Proximal Gradient\nalgorithm (IBPG) for minimizing the sum of two single-valued functions in\nfinite dimension. We suppose that one of the functions is proper, closed, and\nconvex but non-necessarily smooth whilst the second is a smooth enough function\nbut not necessarily convex. For the latter, we ask the smooth adaptable\nproperty (smad) with respect to some kernel or entropy which allows to remove\nthe very popular global Lipschitz continuity requirement on the gradient of the\nsmooth part. We consider the IBPG under the framework of the triangle scaling\nproperty (TSP) which is a geometrical property for which one can provably\nensure acceleration for a certain subset of kernel/entropy functions in the\nconvex setting. Based on this property, we provide global convergence\nguarantees when the entropy is strongly convex under the framework of the\nKurdyka-\\L{}ojasiewicz (KL) property. Turning to the local convergence\nproperties, we show that when the nonsmooth part is partly smooth relative to a\nsmooth submanifold, IBPG has a finite activity identification property before\nentering a local linear convergence regime for which we establish a sharp\nestimate of the convergence rate. We report numerical simulations to illustrate\nour theoretical results on low complexity regularized phase retrieval.",

    "abstract": "NMR acquisitions based on Ernst-angle excitations are widely used in\nanalytical spectroscopy, as for over half a century they have been considered\nthe optimal way for maximizing spectral sensitivity without compromising\nbandwidth or peak resolution. However, if as often happens in liquid state NMR\nrelaxation times T1, T2 are long and similar, steady-state free-precession\n(SSFP) experiments can actually provide higher signal-to-noise ratios per\nsquare root of acquisition time (SNRt) than Ernst-angle-based counterparts.\nAlthough a strong offset dependence and a requirement for pulsing at repetition\ntimes TR << T2 leading to poor spectral resolution have impeded widespread\nanalytical applications of SSFP, phase-incremented (PI) SSFP schemes could\novercome these drawbacks. The present study explores if, when and how, can this\napproach to high resolution NMR improve SNRt over the performance afforded by\nErnst-angle-based FT acquisitions. It is found that PI-SSFP can indeed often\nprovide a superior SNRt than FT-NMR, but that achieving this requires\nimplementing the acquisitions using relatively large flip angles. As also\nexplained, however, this can restrict PI-SSFP's spectral resolution, and lead\nto distorted line shapes. To deal with this problem we introduce here a new\noutlook on SSFP experiments that can overcome this dichotomy, and lead to high\nspectral resolution even when utilizing relatively the large flip angles that\nprovide optimal sensitivity. This new outlook also leads to a processing\npipeline for PI-SSFP acquisitions, which is here introduced and exemplified.\nThe enhanced SNRt that the ensuing method can provide over FT-based NMR\ncounterparts collected under Ernst-angle excitation conditions, is examined\nwith a series of 13C and 15N natural abundance investigations on organic\ncompounds.",

Our approach leverages\nlow-rank updates of the Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs) to\nrepresent substation splits, line outages, and reconfigurations without ever\nrefactorizing the system. Furthermore, we implement the core routines on\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs), thereby exploiting their high-throughput\narchitecture for linear algebra. A two-level decomposition separates changes in\nbranch topology from changes in nodal injections, enabling additional speed-ups\nby an in-the-loop brute force search over injection variations at minimal\nadditional cost. We demonstrate billion-loadflow-per-second performance on\npower grids of varying sizes in workload settings which are typical for\ngradient-free topology optimization such as Reinforcement Learning or Quality\nDiversity methods. While adopting the DC approximation sacrifices some accuracy\nand prohibits the computation of voltage magnitudes, we show that this\nsacrifice unlocks new scales of computational feasibility, offering a powerful\ntool for large-scale grid planning and operational topology optimization.",

The prospects for doing so turn out to depend on the assumed\nlocation of the hidden states that appear in Bell's inequality. In this paper,\nI consider the following two views on such states: (1) that they are states of\nthe two-particle system at the moment of preparation, and (2) that they are\nstates of thick slices of the past light cones of measurements.

    "abstract": "On a complete Riemannian manifold $M$, we study the spectral flow of a family\nof Callias operators. We derive a codimension zero formula when the dimension\nof $M$ is odd and a codimension one formula when the dimension of $M$ is even.\nThese can be seen as analogues of Gromov--Lawson's relative index theorem and\nclassical Callias index theorem, respectively. Secondly, we introduce an\nintrinsic definition of K-cowaist on odd-dimensional manifolds, making use of\nthe odd Chern character of a smooth map from the manifold to a unitary group.\nIt behaves just like the usual K-cowaist on even-dimensional manifolds. We then\napply the notion of odd K-cowaist and the tool of spectral flow to investigate\nproblems related to positive scalar curvature on spin manifolds. In particular,\nwe prove infinite odd K-cowaist to be an obstruction to the existence of PSC\nmetrics. We obtain quantitative scalar curvature estimates on complete\nnon-compact manifolds and scalar-mean curvature estimates on compact manifolds\nwith boundary. They extend several previous results optimally, which unfolds a\nmajor advantage of our method via spectral flow and odd K-cowaist.",

    "abstract": "We consider the initial value problem for a nonlinear shallow water model in\nhorizontal dimension d = 2 and in the presence of a fixed partially immersed\nsolid body on the water surface. We assume that the bottom of the solid body is\nthe graph of a smooth function and part of it is in contact with the water. As\na result, we have a contact line where the solid body, the water, and the air\nmeet. In our setting of the problem, the projection of the contact line on the\nhorizontal plane moves freely due to the motion of the water surface even if\nthe solid body is fixed. This wave-structure interaction problem reduces to an\ninitial boundary value problem for the nonlinear shallow water equations in an\nexterior domain with a free boundary, which is the projection of the contact\nline. The objective of this paper is to derive a priori energy estimates\nlocally in time for solutions at the quasilinear regularity threshold under\nassumptions that the initial flow is irrotational and subcritical and that the\ninitial water surface is transversal to the bottom of the solid body at the\ncontact line. The key ingredients of the proof are the weak dissipativity of\nthe system, the introduction of second order Alinhac good unknowns associated\nwith a regularizing diffeomorphism, and a new type of hidden boundary\nregularity for the nonlinear shallow water equations. This last point is\ncrucial to control the regularity of the contact line; it is obtained by\ncombining the use of the characteristic fields related to the eigenvalues of\nthe boundary matrix together with Rellich type identities.",

In\nparticular, when the map components belong to $W^{1,p}$ with $p>2$, the spinor\ncomponents are uniquely determined by boundary values and map components. For\ncoupled Dirac-harmonic maps, the map components are not harmonic maps. So the\nuniqueness problem is more difficult to solve. In this paper, we study the\nuniqueness problem on a compact surface with boundary. More precisely, we prove\nthe energy convexity for weakly Dirac-harmonic maps from the unit disk with\nsmall energy. This yields the first uniqueness result about Dirac-harmonic maps\nfrom a surface conformal to the unit disk with small energy and arbitrary\nboundary values.",

    "abstract": "Recent high-resolution observations have enabled detailed investigations of\nthe circumstellar environments around Class 0/I protostars. Several studies\nhave reported that the infall velocity of the envelope is a few times smaller\nthan the free-fall velocity inferred from protostellar masses estimated via the\nobserved rotational velocity of their Keplerian disks. To explore the physical\norigins of the slow infall, we perform a set of three-dimensional resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star formation process, extending to\n$10^5$ yr after protostar formation. Our simulations show that the infall\nvelocity decreases markedly at the outer edge of the pseudo-disk (at radii of\n$\\sim\\!100-1000$ au) and is much slower than the expected free-fall velocity.\nThe degree of this reduction depends on (1) the initial magnetic field\nstrength, (2) the alignment between the initial field and the rotation axis,\nand (3) the evolutionary stage of the system. Across our parameter space, the\nratio of the infall velocity to the free-fall velocity is as small as\n$0.2-0.5$, which is consistent with the observations. We further examine the\nreliability of protostellar mass estimates derived from infall and rotational\nvelocities. While the mass derived from disk rotation closely matches the true\nvalue, deviation by a factor of $0.3-2$ is found for the estimates using the\ninfall velocity; it is underestimated due to slow infall, but could also be\noverestimated due to the contribution of disk mass. These findings underscore\nthe critical role of magnetic fields in shaping star formation dynamics and\nhighlight the uncertainties associated with protostellar mass estimates.",

We vary SV\nfrom zero to three times its cosmic root-mean-square value, $v_{\\rm\nSV}/\\sigma_{\\rm SV}=0-3$, and identify 20 representative halos from\ncosmological simulations.

In each model, higher\nSV systematically delays the formation of primordial clouds, formed inside more\nmassive halos ($10^{5}-10^{7}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$), and promotes cloud-scale\nfragmentation and multiple-core formation. The number and total mass of dense\ncores increase with increasing SV. More than half of models with $v_{\\rm\nSV}/\\sigma_{\\rm SV} \\ge 1.5$ form three or more dense cores in a single halo.\nIn extreme cases, up to 25 cores form at once, which leaves a massive first\nstar cluster.

In addition, HD-cooling is often\nenabled in models with low SV, especially in low-z, where HD-cooling is enabled\nin more than 50% of models. This leads to the formation of the low-mass first\nstar.

We performed an analysis of the disk-wind candidate\nG11.92-0.61 MM1 by estimating the physical parameters of the system and\nconstraining the wind-launching mechanism. Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations were conducted in\nSeptember 2021 with ALMA's longest baselines, which provided a synthesised beam\nof $\\sim$30 mas. We obtained high-resolution images of the CH$_3$CN ($v_8=1$\nand $v=0$), CH$_3$OH, SO$_2$, and SO molecular lines, and the 1.3 mm continuum.\nOur molecular data allowed us to refine the parameters of the disk-outflow\nsystem in MM1. The rotating disk is resolved into two regions with distinct\nkinematics: the inner region ($<$300 au) is traced by high-velocity emission of\nhigh-excitation CH$_3$CN lines and shows a Keplerian rotation; the outer region\n($>$300 au), traced by mid-velocity CH$_3$CN emission, rotates in a\nsub-Keplerian regime. The central source is estimated to be $\\sim$20\n$M_{\\odot}$, which is about half the mass estimated in previous\nlower-resolution studies. A strong collimated outflow is traced by SO and\nSO$_2$ emission up to $\\sim$3400 au around MM1a. The SO and SO$_2$ emissions\nshow a rotation-dominated velocity pattern, a constant specific angular\nmomentum, and a Keplerian profile that suggests a magneto-centrifugal disk-wind\norigin with launching radii of $\\sim$50-100 au. G11.92-0.61 MM1 appears to be\none of the clearest cases of molecular line-traced disk-winds detected around\nmassive protostars.",

In SSVEP BCI\nsystems, supervised learning models significantly enhance performance over\nunsupervised models, achieving higher accuracy in less time. However, prolonged\ndata collection can cause user fatigue and even trigger photosensitive\nepilepsy, creating a negative user experience. Thus, reducing calibration time\nis crucial. To address this, Cross-Stimulus transfer learning (CSTL) can\nshorten calibration by utilizing only partial frequencies. Traditional CSTL\nmethods, affected by time-domain impulse response variations, are suitable only\nfor adjacent frequency transfers, limiting their general applicability. We\nintroduce an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) Based Fuzzy Model (EMD-Fuzzy),\nwhich employs EMD to extract crucial frequency information and achieves\nstimulus transfer in the frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)\nto mitigate time-domain differences. Combined with a Fuzzy Decoder that uses\nfuzzy logic for representation learning, our approach delivers promising\npreliminary results in offline tests and state-of-the-art performance. With\nonly 4 frequencies, our method achieved an accuracy of 82.75% (16.30%) and an\ninformation transfer rate (ITR) of 186.56 (52.09) bits/min on the 40-target\nBenchmark dataset.

In the\nsemiclassical regime, where the Schwarzian is weakly coupled, we recover the\nuniversal result that the cross-section equals the horizon area. However, in\nthe strongly coupled regime, where quantum fluctuations dominate, we find that\nthe absorption cross-section exceeds the semiclassical prediction.

Sub-PeV gamma rays and neutrinos are produced when\nrelativistic protons interact with the thermal protons and the radiation by\nthermal electrons in the disk. We discuss the perspectives of observing sub-PeV\nmulti-messenger signals from individual BHXBs. Finally, we evaluate the\nintegrated fluxes of the quiescent and hard-state BHXB population and find that\nBHXBs may contribute to the Galactic diffuse emission above $\\sim 100$ TeV.",

While PUD\npromises high throughput at low energy and area cost, we uncover three\nlimitations of existing PUD approaches that lead to significant inefficiencies:\n(i) static data representation, i.e., two's complement with fixed\nbit-precision, leading to unnecessary computation over useless (i.e.,\ninconsequential) data; (ii) support for only throughput-oriented execution,\nwhere the high latency of individual PUD operations can only be hidden in the\npresence of bulk data-level parallelism; and (iii) high latency for\nhigh-precision (e.g., 32-bit) operations.\n  To address these issues, we propose Proteus, the first hardware framework\nthat addresses the high execution latency of bulk bitwise PUD operations by\nimplementing a data-aware runtime engine for PUD. Proteus reduces the latency\nof PUD operations in three different ways: (i) Proteus dynamically reduces the\nbit-precision (and thus the latency and energy consumption) of PUD operations\nby exploiting narrow values (i.e., values with many leading zeros or ones);\n(ii) Proteus concurrently executes independent in-DRAM primitives belonging to\na single PUD operation across multiple DRAM arrays; (iii) Proteus chooses and\nuses the most appropriate data representation and arithmetic algorithm\nimplementation for a given PUD instruction transparently to the programmer.",

Unlike most existing methods that rely on code, AugmenTest\nutilizes the semantic capabilities of LLMs to infer the intended behavior of a\nmethod from documentation and developer comments, without looking at the code.\nAugmenTest includes four variants: Simple Prompt, Extended Prompt, RAG with a\ngeneric prompt (without the context of class or method under test), and RAG\nwith Simple Prompt, each offering different levels of contextual information to\nthe LLMs. To evaluate our work, we selected 142 Java classes and generated\nmultiple mutants for each. We then generated tests from these mutants, focusing\nonly on tests that passed on the mutant but failed on the original class, to\nensure that the tests effectively captured bugs.

Policy mixes\naffect saving incentives differently according to their effect on the liquidity\npremium -- the return difference between less liquid assets and public debt.

This underscores\nthe presence of a transmission mechanism through which the interaction of\nmonetary and fiscal policy shapes economic stability via its effect on the\nportfolio choice of private agents.

For thin films, $T_{\\rm c}$ exhibits a slight\nincrease up to approximately 4 K compared to the bulk value, attributable to\nthe crystalline size and lattice disorder. By applying pressure on a bulk Sn,\n$T_{\\rm c}$ initially decreases from 3.72 K as the pressure increases. Further\nincreasing pressure up to 10 GPa, $T_{\\rm c}$ increases to 5.3 K with the\nstructural transformation. However, the combination of these effects on thin\nfilms of Sn, namely, thin-film growth and pressure effects, remains\nunderexplored. In this study, we combined film-growth and pressure-application\ntechniques to further increase $T_{\\rm c}$ using a diamond anvil cell with\nboron-doped diamond electrodes. The drop of the electrical resistance\nsuggesting the onset of $T_{\\rm c}$ on the thin film reached above 6 K in\n$\\gamma$-Sn phase. Further, the upper critical magnetic field was drastically\nenhanced. Atomic force microscopy suggests that the refinement of the grain\nsize of the thin film under the non-hydrostatic pressure conditions contributes\nto stabilizing the higher $T_{\\rm c}$ of $\\gamma$-Sn.",

Easy-to-generate background meshes (e.g., a simple Cartesian mesh)\nthat cut the domain boundary (i.e., they do not conform to it) are used to\nbuild suitable trial and test finite element spaces. The method seeks a neural\nnetwork that, when interpolated onto the trial space, minimises a discrete norm\nof the weak residual functional on the test space associated to the equation.\nAs with unfitted finite elements, essential boundary conditions are weakly\nimposed by Nitsche's method. The method is robust to variations in Nitsche\ncoefficient values, and to small cut cells. We experimentally demonstrate the\nmethod's effectiveness in solving both forward and inverse problems across\nvarious 2D and 3D complex geometries, including those defined by implicit\nlevel-set functions and explicit stereolithography meshes. For forward problems\nwith smooth analytical solutions, the trained neural networks achieve several\norders of magnitude smaller $H^1$ errors compared to their interpolation\ncounterparts.

Using the same amount of training points, the method is\nfaster than standard PINNs (on both GPU and CPU architectures) while achieving\nsimilar or superior accuracy. Moreover, using a discrete dual norm of the\nresidual (achieved by cut cell stabilisation) remarkably accelerates neural\nnetwork training and further enhances robustness to the choice of Nitsche\ncoefficient values.

This framework is further extended to the case of staggered DID\nsettings, allowing for multiple time periods and varying treatment timings.

An increase in the coupling strength leads\nto a transition from periodic oscillations to an exponential decay in time of\nthe Loschmidt echo.

These types of memory all have different\ncharacteristics. Some of these have an impact on the overall system\nperformance.

For risk mitigation, a guardrail is\ntypically used to filter out harmful samples before fine-tuning. By designing a\nnew red-teaming method, we in this paper show that purely relying on the\nmoderation guardrail for data filtration is not reliable. Our proposed attack\nmethod, dubbed Virus, easily bypasses the guardrail moderation by slightly\nmodifying the harmful data. Experimental results show that the harmful data\noptimized by Virus is not detectable by the guardrail with up to 100\\% leakage\nratio, and can simultaneously achieve superior attack performance. Finally, the\nkey message we want to convey through this paper is that: \\textbf{it is\nreckless to consider guardrail moderation as a clutch at straws towards harmful\nfine-tuning attack}, as it cannot solve the inherent safety issue of the\npre-trained LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/git-disl/Virus",

Our results show that state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant\nsociodemographic disparities in nearly all simulations, with more advanced\nmodels exhibiting greater implicit biases despite reducing explicit biases.\nFurthermore, when comparing our findings to real-world disparities reported in\nempirical studies, we find that the biases we uncovered are directionally\naligned but markedly amplified. This directional alignment highlights the\nutility of our technique in uncovering systematic biases in LLMs rather than\nrandom variations; moreover, the presence and amplification of implicit biases\nemphasizes the need for novel strategies to address these biases.",

Here we investigate the process of tidal\ndisruption of such \"snow clouds\" by close passage of field stars. We construct\na suite of simulations using the hydrodynamic formalism introduced by Carter\nand Luminet, and use it to explore the properties of the resulting tidal\ndebris. The debris streams are tiny structures that are highly over-pressured\nrelative to the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). They are also unusual in\ntheir composition--initially consisting of cold, gaseous He together with\n$\\text{H}_{2}$ \"snowballs\" that may be as much as a metre in size. Each stream\nexpands and cools and is subsequently shocked as it plows through the ISM; the\nsnowballs are gradually eroded by the shocked gas. Snowballs streaming through\nthe shocked ISM create microstructured plasma that is somewhat reminiscent of\nthe \"scattering screens\" revealed by radio-wave scintillation studies. However,\nthe tidal disruption rate is too low to account for the observed number of\nscattering screens if, as we assume here, the stars and clouds have no prior\nphysical association so that disruptions occur as a result of chance encounters\nbetween stars and clouds.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning\n(ML) in query optimization to select more efficient plans. Existing\nlearning-based query optimizers use certain model architectures to convert\ntree-structured query plans into representations suitable for downstream ML\ntasks. As the design of these architectures significantly impacts cost\nestimation, we propose a tree model architecture based on Bidirectional Graph\nNeural Networks (Bi-GNN) aggregated by Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to achieve\nmore accurate cost estimates. The inherent uncertainty of data and model\nparameters also leads to inaccurate cost estimates, resulting in suboptimal\nplans and less robust query performance. To address this, we implement a novel\nlearning-to-rank cost model that effectively quantifies the uncertainty in cost\nestimates using approximate probabilistic ML. This model adaptively integrates\nquantified uncertainty with estimated costs and learns from comparing pairwise\nplans, achieving more robust performance. In addition, we propose the first\nexplainability technique specifically designed for learning-based cost models.\nThis technique explains the contribution of any subgraphs in the query plan to\nthe final predicted cost, which can be integrated and trained with any\nlearning-based cost model to significantly boost the model's explainability. By\nincorporating these innovations, we propose a cost model for a Robust and\nExplainable Query Optimizer, Reqo, that improves the accuracy, robustness, and\nexplainability of cost estimation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in\nall three dimensions.",

The effect of the elastic-plastic mismatch\nbetween the two materials on the crack driving force, as well as the size of\nthe fully developed plastic zone in Ti have been quantified in this work for\nthe first time. It is shown that incorporating a Ti layer thickness of 250 nm\ncan improve the fracture resistance by nearly ten times compared to the\ninitiation fracture toughness in TiN, preventing catastrophic fracture of these\nmulti-layered films. These results will aid in physics informed design of\noptimised thickness of metallic interlayers in multi-layered thin films.",

    "abstract": "In quantum mechanics time is generally treated as a parameter rather than an\nobservable. For instance wave functions are treated as extending in space, but\nnot in time. But from relativity we expect time and space should be treated on\nthe same basis. What are the effects if time is an observable? Are these\neffects observable with current technology?\n  In earlier work we showed we should see effects in various high energy\nscattering processes. We here extend that work to include bound states. The\ncritical advantage of working with bound states is that the predictions are\nsignificantly more definite, taking the predictions from testable to\nfalsifiable.\n  We estimate the time dispersion for hydrogen as $.177$ attoseconds, possibly\nbelow the current threshold for detection. But the time dispersion should scale\nas the $3/2$ power of the principle quantum number $n$. Rydberg atoms can have\n$n$ of order $100$, implying a boost by a factor of $1000$. This takes the the\ntime dispersion to $177$ attoseconds, well within reach of current technology.\n  There are a wide variety of experimental targets: any time-dependent\nprocesses should show effects. Falsification will be technically challenging\n(due to the short time scales) but immediate and unambiguous. Confirmation\nwould have significant implications for attosecond physics, quantum computing\nand communications, quantum gravity, and the measurement problem. And would\nsuggest practical uses in these areas as well as circuit design, high speed\nbiochemistry, cryptography, fusion research, and any area involving change at\nattosecond time scales.",

    "abstract": "Proton therapy can achieve a highly targeted treatment by utilising the\nadvantageous dosimetric characteristics of the Bragg Peak. Protons traversing\nthrough a material will deposit their maximum energy at the Bragg Peak through\nionisation and other interactions, transferring minimal excess dose to\nsurrounding tissue and organs. This rate of energy loss is also quantified by\nthe linear energy transfer (LET), which is indicative of radiation quality and\nradiobiological effects. However it is a challenging physical quantity to\nmeasure, as characterisation of radiation fields and the impact of LET on\ntreatment requires advanced tools and technology. The MiniPIX-Timepix is a\nminiaturised, hybrid semiconductor pixel detector capable of high resolution\nspectrometric tracking, enabling wide-range detection of the deposited energy,\nposition and direction of single particles. Experimental measurements were\nperformed at a clinical facility, the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre which houses\na 60 MeV ocular proton therapy beamline. A realistic end-to-end model of the\nfacility was developed in the Monte Carlo code TOPAS (TOol for PArticle\nSimulation) and was used to simulate the experimental conditions. The detector\nwas held at 45$^{\\circ}$ and 60$^{\\circ}$ perpendicular to the beam, and placed\ndownstream of various thickness Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blocks to\nacquire data along the dose deposition depth. Empirical cluster data providing\ntrack length and the energy deposition distributions were used to obtain the\nLET spectra. The determined values for the LET in silicon and dose averaged LET\nacross the BP show general agreement with simulated results, supporting the\napplicability of the TOPAS CCC model.

However, real-world navigation robots often operate in\npersistent environments with relatively consistent physical layouts, visual\nobservations, and language styles from instructors. Such a gap in the task\nsetting presents an opportunity to improve VLN agents by incorporating\ncontinuous adaptation to specific environments. To better reflect these\nreal-world conditions, we introduce GSA-VLN, a novel task requiring agents to\nexecute navigation instructions within a specific scene and simultaneously\nadapt to it for improved performance over time. To evaluate the proposed task,\none has to address two challenges in existing VLN datasets: the lack of OOD\ndata, and the limited number and style diversity of instructions for each\nscene. Therefore, we propose a new dataset, GSA-R2R, which significantly\nexpands the diversity and quantity of environments and instructions for the R2R\ndataset to evaluate agent adaptability in both ID and OOD contexts.\nFurthermore, we design a three-stage instruction orchestration pipeline that\nleverages LLMs to refine speaker-generated instructions and apply role-playing\ntechniques to rephrase instructions into different speaking styles. This is\nmotivated by the observation that each individual user often has consistent\nsignatures or preferences in their instructions. We conducted extensive\nexperiments on GSA-R2R to thoroughly evaluate our dataset and benchmark various\nmethods.

    "abstract": "Designing the physical encoder is crucial for accurate image reconstruction\nin computational imaging (CI) systems. Currently, these systems are designed\nvia end-to-end (E2E) optimization, where the encoder is modeled as a neural\nnetwork layer and is jointly optimized with the decoder. However, the\nperformance of E2E optimization is significantly reduced by the physical\nconstraints imposed on the encoder. Also, since the E2E learns the parameters\nof the encoder by backpropagating the reconstruction error, it does not promote\noptimal intermediate outputs and suffers from gradient vanishing. To address\nthese limitations, we reinterpret the concept of knowledge distillation (KD)\nfor designing a physically constrained CI system by transferring the knowledge\nof a pretrained, less-constrained CI system. Our approach involves three steps:\n(1) Given the original CI system (student), a teacher system is created by\nrelaxing the constraints on the student's encoder. (2) The teacher is optimized\nto solve a less-constrained version of the student's problem. (3) The teacher\nguides the training of the student through two proposed knowledge transfer\nfunctions, targeting both the encoder and the decoder feature space. The\nproposed method can be employed to any imaging modality since the relaxation\nscheme and the loss functions can be adapted according to the physical\nacquisition and the employed decoder. This approach was validated on three\nrepresentative CI modalities: magnetic resonance, single-pixel, and compressive\nspectral imaging. Simulations show that a teacher system with an encoder that\nhas a structure similar to that of the student encoder provides effective\nguidance. Our approach achieves significantly improved reconstruction\nperformance and encoder design, outperforming both E2E optimization and\ntraditional non-data-driven encoder designs.",

A perturbation approach is\nused to split the compressible Navier-Stokes equations into two sub-systems: a\nfirst-order harmonic system and a time-averaged second-order mean system. Prior\nacoustofluidic numerical studies have typically employed simplifying\nassumptions regarding the second-order mass balance equation and boundary\nconditions. These assumptions -- frequently left unjustified -- result in an\nincongruent problem statement where the boundary conditions are not consistent\nwith the governing equations. To clarify these assumptions and mitigate the\nassociated confusion, we systematically formulate the second-order mass balance\nequation into two analytically equivalent but numerically distinct forms by\nintroducing the fluid's Lagrangian and mass transport velocity. We clarify the\nrelation between these quantities to illustrate that a zero mass transport\nvelocity does not necessarily imply a zero Lagrangian velocity. A second-order\naccurate finite difference/volume scheme is used to discretize the governing\nequations and boundary conditions expressed in Eulerian form. We solve the\nfirst-order coupled Helmholtz system via a sparse direct solver while the\nsecond-order system is solved via a Krylov (FGMRES) solver with a projection\nmethod-based preconditioner. To ascertain the spatial accuracy and consistency\nof numerical implementation of the split system of equations and boundary\nconditions, we demonstrate verification results and convergence rates using\nmanufactured solutions.

However, its distributed nature makes it\nsusceptible to poisoning attacks, where malicious clients can compromise the\nglobal model by sending harmful local model updates to the server. To unlearn\nan accurate global model from a poisoned one after identifying malicious\nclients, federated unlearning has been introduced. Yet, current research on\nfederated unlearning has primarily concentrated on its effectiveness and\nefficiency, overlooking the security challenges it presents. In this work, we\nbridge the gap via proposing BadUnlearn, the first poisoning attacks targeting\nfederated unlearning. In BadUnlearn, malicious clients send specifically\ndesigned local model updates to the server during the unlearning process,\naiming to ensure that the resulting unlearned model remains poisoned. To\nmitigate these threats, we propose UnlearnGuard, a robust federated unlearning\nframework that is provably robust against both existing poisoning attacks and\nour BadUnlearn. The core concept of UnlearnGuard is for the server to estimate\nthe clients' local model updates during the unlearning process and employ a\nfiltering strategy to verify the accuracy of these estimations. Theoretically,\nwe prove that the model unlearned through UnlearnGuard closely resembles one\nobtained by train-from-scratch. Empirically, we show that BadUnlearn can\neffectively corrupt existing federated unlearning methods, while UnlearnGuard\nremains secure against poisoning attacks.",

To flesh this\nout, we consider concepts $F$ and $W$ defined by sets of properties\n$\\left\\{F_{1}, F_{2}, \\ldots, F_{n}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{W_{1}, W_{2}, \\ldots,\nW_{m}\\right\\}$ with associated degrees $\\left\\{d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots,\nd_{n}\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{e_{1}, e_{2}, \\ldots, e_{m}\\right\\}$, respectively,\nwhere the properties may overlap. We then derive formulas for the intensional\ninheritance using both Shannon information theory and algorithmic information\ntheory, incorporating interaction information among properties. We examine a\nspecial case where all properties are mutually exclusive and calculate the\nintensional inheritance in this case in both frameworks.

The momentum-dependent\nspin-splitting observed in these materials reflects their unique symmetry\ncharacteristics which also establish the conditions for chiral magnons to\nemerge. Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence for a chiral\nmagnon in the altermagnetic candidate MnTe, revealed by circular-dichroism\nresonant inelastic X-ray scattering (CD-RIXS). This mode which we term chiral\naltermagnon exhibits a distinct momentum dependence consistent with the\nproposed altermagnetic $g-$wave symmetry of MnTe.

    "abstract": "Finding the shortest-path distance between two arbitrary vertices is an\nimportant problem in road networks. Due to real-time traffic conditions, road\nnetworks undergo dynamic changes all the time. Current state-of-the-art methods\nincrementally maintain a distance labelling based on a hierarchy among vertices\nto support efficient distance computation. However, their labelling sizes are\noften large and cannot be efficiently maintained. To combat these issues, we\npresent a simple yet efficient labelling method, namely \\emph{Stable Tree\nLabelling} (STL), for answering distance queries on dynamic road networks. We\nobserve that the properties of an underlying hierarchy play an important role\nin improving and balancing query and update performance. Thus, we introduce the\nnotion of \\emph{stable tree hierarchy} which lays the ground for developing\nefficient maintenance algorithms on dynamic road networks. Based on stable tree\nhierarchy, STL can be efficiently constructed as a 2-hop labelling. A crucial\ningredient of STL is to only store distances within subgraphs in labels, rather\nthan distances in the entire graph, which restricts the labels affected by\ndynamic changes. We further develop two efficient maintenance algorithms upon\nSTL: \\emph{Label Search algorithm} and \\emph{Pareto Search algorithm}. Label\nSearch algorithm identifies affected ancestors in a stable tree hierarchy and\nperforms efficient searches to update labels from those ancestors. Pareto\nSearch algorithm explores the interaction between search spaces of different\nancestors, and combines searches from multiple ancestors into only two searches\nfor each update, eliminating duplicate graph traversals. The experiments show\nthat our algorithms significantly outperform state-of-the-art dynamic methods\nin maintaining the labelling and query processing, while requiring an order of\nmagnitude less space.",

Instead, we\nuse purely planimetric methods, including the Joachimsthal notation, to fully\ndescribe such polygons and associated circles and parabolas. We prove that a\ncircle contains the focus of a parabola if and only if there is a triangle\ninscribed in the circle and circumscribed about the parabola.

Factors\nthat reduced the Dice coefficient included metal artifacts caused by dental\ncrowns in the bolus and the speed of movement for the thyroid cartilage and\nepiglottis. In practical verification of the AI, no significant misrecognition\nwas observed for facial bones, jaw bones, or the tongue. However, regions such\nas the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and epiglottis were not fully delineated\nduring fast movement. It is expected that future research will improve the\naccuracy of the AI's region segmentation, though the risk of misrecognition\nwill always exist. Therefore, the development of tools for efficiently\ncorrecting the AI's segmentation results is necessary.

However, their low\nthermal conductivity and heterogeneous interfaces suggest that their\nperformance may be severely limited by self-heating, especially at higher power\nand device densities. Here, we investigate the high-field breakdown of\nultrathin (~4 nm) amorphous indium tin oxide (ITO) transistors with scanning\nthermal microscopy (SThM) and multiphysics simulations. The ITO devices break\nirreversibly at channel temperatures of ~180 {\\deg}C and ~340 {\\deg}C on\nSiO${_2}$ and HfO${_2}$ substrates, respectively, with failure primarily caused\nby thermally-induced compressive strain near the device contacts. Combining\nSThM measurements with simulations allows us to estimate a thermal boundary\nconductance (TBC) of 35 ${\\pm}$ 12 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on\nSiO${_2}$, and 51 ${\\pm}$ 14 MWm${^-}$${^2}$K${^-}$${^1}$ for ITO on HfO${_2}$.\nThe latter also enables significantly higher breakdown power due to better heat\ndissipation and closer thermal expansion matching.

Traditional models such\nas ARIMA and GARCH perform well with linear data but struggle with non-linear\ndependencies. Machine learning and deep learning models, particularly Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, address these challenges by capturing\nintricate patterns and long-term dependencies. This report compares ARIMA and\nLSTM models in predicting the S&P 500 index, a major financial benchmark.\n  Using historical price data and technical indicators, we evaluated these\nmodels using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The\nARIMA model showed reasonable performance with an MAE of 462.1, RMSE of 614,\nand 89.8 percent accuracy, effectively capturing short-term trends but limited\nby its linear assumptions. The LSTM model, leveraging sequential processing\ncapabilities, outperformed ARIMA with an MAE of 369.32, RMSE of 412.84, and\n92.46 percent accuracy, capturing both short- and long-term dependencies.\nNotably, the LSTM model without additional features performed best, achieving\nan MAE of 175.9, RMSE of 207.34, and 96.41 percent accuracy, showcasing its\nability to handle market data efficiently.\n  Accurately predicting stock movements is crucial for investment strategies,\nrisk assessments, and market stability. Our findings confirm the potential of\ndeep learning models in handling volatile financial data compared to\ntraditional ones.

This research is an attempt to apply different machine learning\n(ML) algorithms to classify various types of seismic events into chemical\nexplosions, collapses, nuclear explosions, damaging earthquakes, felt\nearthquakes, generic earthquakes and generic explosions for a dataset obtained\nfrom IRIS-DMC. One major objective of this research has been to identify some\nof the best ML algorithms for such seismic events classification. The ML\nalgorithms we are implementing in this study include logistic regression,\nsupport vector machine (SVM), Na\\\"ive Bayes, random forest, K-nearest neighbors\n(KNN), decision trees, and linear discriminant analysis. Our implementation of\nthe above ML classifier algorithms required to prepare and preprocess the\ndataset we obtained so that it will be fit for the ML training and testing\napplications we sought. After the implementation of the ML algorithms, we were\nable to classify the seismic event types into seven classes in the dataset, and\na comparison of each classifier is made to identify the best algorithm for the\nseismic data classification. Finally, we made predictions of the different\nevent types using the different classifier algorithms, and evaluated each of\nthe various classifier algorithms for seismic prediction using different\nevaluation metrics. These evaluation metrics helped us to measure the\nperformance of each algorithm. After implementing the seven ML algorithms and a\ncomparison among those various ML algorithms, it has been demonstrated that the\nbest accuracy among these classifiers happened for the Random Forest (RF)\nalgorithm, with an accuracy of 93.5%.",

Moreover, current evaluation metrics prioritise performance over\nefficiency, lacking a balanced approach for assessing architectures suitable\nfor constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, this paper introduces\nthe M-factor, a novel metric combining model accuracy and size. Four diverse\nNAS techniques are compared: Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning, Regularised\nEvolution, Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE), and Multi-trial Random\nSearch. These techniques represent different NAS paradigms, providing a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the M-factor. The study analyses ResNet\nconfigurations on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a search space of 19,683\nconfigurations. Experiments reveal that Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning and\nRegularised Evolution achieved M-factor values of 0.84 and 0.82, respectively,\nwhile Multi-trial Random Search attained 0.75, and TPE reached 0.67.\nPolicy-Based Reinforcement Learning exhibited performance changes after 39\ntrials, while Regularised Evolution optimised within 20 trials.

The growing complexity of\ndigital ecosystems necessitates watermarks for different uses to be embedded in\nthe same media. However, to detect and decode all watermarks, they need to\ncoexist well with one another. We perform the first study of coexistence of\ndeep image watermarking methods and, contrary to intuition, we find that\nvarious open-source watermarks can coexist with only minor impacts on image\nquality and decoding robustness. The coexistence of watermarks also opens the\navenue for ensembling watermarking methods. We show how ensembling can increase\nthe overall message capacity and enable new trade-offs between capacity,\naccuracy, robustness and image quality, without needing to retrain the base\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "The time-dependent reproduction number Rt can be used to track pathogen\ntransmission and to assess the efficacy of interventions. This quantity can be\nestimated by fitting renewal equation models to time series of infectious\ndisease case counts. These models almost invariably assume a homogeneous\npopulation. Individuals are assumed not to differ systematically in the rates\nat which they come into contact with others. It is also assumed that the\ntypical time that elapses between one case and those it causes (known as the\ngeneration time distribution) does not differ across groups. But contact\npatterns are known to widely differ by age and according to other demographic\ngroupings, and infection risk and transmission rates have been shown to vary\nacross groups for a range of directly transmitted diseases. Here, we derive\nfrom first principles a renewal equation framework which accounts for these\ndifferences in transmission across groups. We use a generalisation of the\nclassic McKendrick-von Foerster equation to handle populations structured into\ninteracting groups. This system of partial differential equations allows us to\nderive a simple analytical expression for Rt which involves only group-level\ncontact patterns and infection risks. We show that the same expression emerges\nfrom both deterministic and stochastic discrete-time versions of the model and\ndemonstrate via simulations that our Rt expression governs the long-run fate of\nepidemics. Our renewal equation model provides a basis from which to account\nfor more realistic, diverse populations in epidemiological models and opens the\ndoor to inferential approaches which use known group characteristics to\nestimate Rt.",

    "abstract": "Pursuing invariant prediction from heterogeneous environments opens the door\nto learning causality in a purely data-driven way and has several applications\nin causal discovery and robust transfer learning. However, existing methods\nsuch as ICP [Peters et al., 2016] and EILLS [Fan et al., 2024] that can attain\nsample-efficient estimation are based on exponential time algorithms. In this\npaper, we show that such a problem is intrinsically hard in computation: the\ndecision problem, testing whether a non-trivial prediction-invariant solution\nexists across two environments, is NP-hard even for the linear causal\nrelationship. In the world where P$\\neq$NP, our results imply that the\nestimation error rate can be arbitrarily slow using any computationally\nefficient algorithm. This suggests that pursuing causality is fundamentally\nharder than detecting associations when no prior assumption is pre-offered.\n  Given there is almost no hope of computational improvement under the worst\ncase, this paper proposes a method capable of attaining both computationally\nand statistically efficient estimation under additional conditions.\nFurthermore, our estimator is a distributionally robust estimator with an\nellipse-shaped uncertain set where more uncertainty is placed on spurious\ndirections than invariant directions, resulting in a smooth interpolation\nbetween the most predictive solution and the causal solution by varying the\ninvariance hyper-parameter. Non-asymptotic results and empirical applications\nsupport the claim.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to continue the classification of non-smooth regular curves,\nbut over fields of characteristic three. These curves were originally\nintroduced by Zariski as generic fibers of counterexamples to Bertini's theorem\non the variation of singular points of linear series. Such a classification has\nbeen introduced by St\\\"ohr, taking advantage of the equivalent theory of\nnon-conservative function fields, which in turn occurs only over non-perfect\nfields $K$ of characteristic $p>0$. We propose here a different way of\napproach, relying on the fact that a non-smooth regular curve in\n$\\mathbb{P}^n_K$ provides a singular curve when viewed inside\n$\\mathbb{P}^n_{K^{1/p}}$. Hence we were naturally induced to the question of\ncharacterizing singular curves in $\\mathbb{P}^n_{K^{1/p}}$ coming from regular\ncurves in $\\mathbb{P}^n_K$. To understand this phenomenon we consider the\nnotion of integrable connections with zero $p$-curvature to extend Katz's\nversion of Cartier's theorem for purely inseparable morphisms, where we solve\nthe above characterization for the slightly general setup of coherent sheaves.\nMoreover, we also had to introduce some new local invariants attached to\nnon-smooth points, as the differential degree. As an application of the theory\ndeveloped here, we classify complete, geometrically integral, non-smooth\nregular curves $C$ of genus $3$, over a separably closed field $K$ of\ncharacteristic $3$, whose base extension $C \\times_{\\operatorname{Spec}\nK}{\\operatorname{Spec} \\overline{K}}$ is non-hyperelliptic with normalization\nhaving geometric genus $1$.",

However, challenges exist in meeting many nanostructuring\ndemands--particularly in emerging optical materials and component\narchitectures. Here, we report a nanofabrication workflow that overcomes\nlong-standing challenges in deterministic and top-down sample preparation\nprocedures. The salient feature is a carbon mask with a low sputter yield that\ncan be readily shaped using high resolution electron beam processing\ntechniques. When combined with focused ion beam processing, the masking\ntechnique yields structures with ultra-smooth, near-vertical side walls. We\ntarget different material platforms to showcase the broad utility of the\ntechnique. As a first test case, we prepared nanometric gaps in evaporated Au.\nGap widths of 7 plus/minus 2 nm, aspect ratios of 17, and line edge roughness\nvalues of 3sigma = 2.04 nm are achieved. Furthermore, the gap widths represent\nan order of magnitude improvement on system resolution limits. As a second test\ncase, we designed and fabricated dielectric resonators in the ternary compounds\nMnPSe3 and NiPS3; a class of van der Waals material resistant to chemical etch\napproaches. Nanoantenna arrays with incrementally increasing diameter were\nfabricated in crystalline, exfoliated flakes. The optical response was measured\nby dark field spectroscopy and is in agreement with simulations. The workflow\nreported here leverages established techniques in material processing without\nthe need for custom or specialized hardware.

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction\nforces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are\nsignificant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation\nof angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and\nunsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such\ncases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the\nstability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for\nfast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time\nnonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running.
