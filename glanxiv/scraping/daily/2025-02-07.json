    "abstract": "Modeling spin-wave (magnon) dynamics in novel materials is important to\nadvance spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies. The interactions\nbetween magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for\nmagnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging.\nHere we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on\nthe ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph\ncoupling matrices and compute them in 2D ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated\ngraphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and\nmag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling\ncan exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon\nmodes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the\ninelastic magnon relaxation time is found to decrease abruptly above the\nthreshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, thereby defining a\nlow-energy window for efficient magnon transport. By averaging in this window,\nwe compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean-free path, a key figure of\nmerit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and\ncomputational tools shown in this work enable studies of magnon interactions,\nscattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic\nsystems and magnon- and spin-based devices.",

To address this\nchallenge, we introduce AutoSketch, a styleaware vector sketch completion\nmethod that accommodates diverse sketch styles. Our key observation is that the\nstyle descriptions of a sketch in natural language preserve the style during\nautomatic sketch completion. Thus, we use a pretrained vision-language model\n(VLM) to describe the styles of the partial sketches in natural language and\nreplicate these styles using newly generated strokes. We initially optimize the\nstrokes to match an input prompt augmented by style descriptions extracted from\nthe VLM. Such descriptions allow the method to establish a diffusion prior in\nclose alignment with that of the partial sketch. Next, we utilize the VLM to\ngenerate an executable style adjustment code that adjusts the strokes to\nconform to the desired style. We compare our method with existing methods\nacross various sketch styles and prompts, performed extensive ablation studies\nand qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrate that AutoSketch\ncan support various sketch scenarios.",

Our experiments,\nsupported by numerical simulations, show that right- and left-handed circularly\npolarized modes produce clearly distinct velocities of optically trapped\nnanocubes along the nanofiber axis, whereas non-chiral gold nanospheres of a\nsimilar size do not show any such dissymmetry. Furthermore, using a\ncounterpropagating mode configuration, the non-chiral component of the optical\nforce can be effectively zeroed out, yielding selective forward and backward\ntransport of chiral nanocubes. In addition, the chiral optical force was found\nto be significant even for particle ensembles with natural variations in size\nand form, showing average behavior in agreement with numerical simulations.\nThis is a clear implementation of optical separation of chiral enantiomers at\nthe scale of 100 nm.

Our analysis reveals\nthat an information theoretic quantity, which we call the Normalized High-\nDimensional Kullback-Leibler divergence (NHDKL), governs the high-dimensional\nasymptotic performance of QCD procedures.

However, model discrepancy is\nubiquitous in most digital twin models and has significant impacts on the\nperformance of using those models. In recent years, data-driven modeling\ntechniques have been demonstrated promising in characterizing the model\ndiscrepancy in existing models, while the training data for the learning of\nmodel discrepancy is often obtained in an empirical way and an active approach\nof gathering informative data can potentially benefit the learning of model\ndiscrepancy. On the other hand, Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a\nsystematic approach to gathering the most informative data, but its performance\nis often negatively impacted by the model discrepancy. In this work, we build\non sequential BED and propose an efficient approach to iteratively learn the\nmodel discrepancy based on the data from the BED. The performance of the\nproposed method is validated by a classical numerical example governed by a\nconvection-diffusion equation, for which full BED is still feasible. The\nproposed method is then further studied in the same numerical example with a\nhigh-dimensional model discrepancy, which serves as a demonstration for the\nscenarios where full BED is not practical anymore. An ensemble-based\napproximation of information gain is further utilized to assess the data\ninformativeness and to enhance learning model discrepancy.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained immense success in revolutionizing\nvarious applications, including content generation, search and recommendation,\nand AI-assisted operation. To reduce high training costs, Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) architecture has become a popular backbone for modern LLMs. However,\ndespite the benefits, serving MoE-based LLMs experience severe memory\ninefficiency due to sparsely activated experts. Recent studies propose to\noffload inactive experts from GPU memory to CPU memory to improve the serving\nefficiency of MoE models. However, they either incur high inference latency or\nhigh model memory footprints due to coarse-grained designs. To tame the\nlatency-memory trade-off in MoE serving, we present fMoE, a fine-grained expert\noffloading system for MoE serving that achieves low inference latency with\nmemory efficiency. We design fMoE to extract fine-grained expert selection\npatterns from MoE models and semantic hints from input prompts to efficiently\nguide expert prefetching, caching, and offloading decisions. fMoE is prototyped\non top of HuggingFace Transformers and deployed on a six-GPU testbed.\nExperiments with open-source MoE models and real-world workloads show that fMoE\nreduces inference latency by 47% and improves expert hit rate by 36% over\nstate-of-the-art solutions.",

Although traditional learned indexes focus exclusively on optimizing\nindex lookups, they often overlook the impact of data access from storage,\nresulting in performance bottlenecks. DobLIX addresses this by incorporating a\nsecond objective, data access optimization, into the learned index training\nprocess. This dual-objective approach ensures that both index lookup efficiency\nand data access costs are minimized, leading to significant improvements in\nread performance while maintaining write efficiency in real-world LSM-tree\nsystems. Additionally, DobLIX features a reinforcement learning agent that\ndynamically tunes the system parameters, allowing it to adapt to varying\nworkloads in real-time. Experimental results using real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that DobLIX reduces indexing overhead and improves throughput by\n1.19 to 2.21 times compared to state-of-the-art methods within RocksDB, a\nwidely used LSM-tree-based storage engine.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that black hole quasinormal modes are subject to spectral\ninstability, typically triggered by metric perturbations. These perturbations,\nwhich can introduce a minor bump in the effective potential of the wave\nequation, give rise to a novel branch of asymptotic quasinormal modes, dubbed\nthe {\\it echo modes}, which lie mainly parallel to the real frequency axis.\nThis study explores the evolution of the echo modes and their interplay with\nthe outward spiral motion observed in low-lying quasinormal modes. As the bump\nin the effective potential moves away from the central black hole, the echo\nmodes collectively shift toward the real axis, with the spacing between\nsuccessive modes decreasing uniformly. This collective motion occurs\nsimultaneously with the spiral of the low-lying modes until the echo modes\neventually take over the fundamental quasinormal mode. In the time domain, such\na takeover coincides with a transition point for the temporal waveform, where\nthe distinction between the original black hole's ringdown and the echoes\nbecomes clear. This marks a transition in the characteristics of the waveform\nfrom primarily damped oscillations, dominated by the damping rate of the\nfundamental mode, to echo waves, characterized by periodic echo pulses. We\nargue that this phenomenon is universal by employing analytical and numerical\nanalyses. We first elucidate our arguments using explicit but simplified toy\nmodels, where the effective potential barriers are disjoint. The derivations\nare then generalized to scenarios where perturbations are introduced on top of\na black hole metric with a continuous effective potential. The observational\nimplications, particularly the causality dilemma, are elaborated. We show that\nthe echo modes can be extracted by applying the Fourier transform to ringdown\nwaveforms, which can be important for gravitational wave observations.",

In this study, we integrate three types of machine\nlearning models to generate solar magnetic patches in a physically\ninterpretable manner and use those as a query to find matching patches in real\nobservations. We use the magnetic field measurements from Space-weather HMI\nActive Region Patches (SHARPs) to train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).\nWe connect the physical properties of GAN-generated images with their latent\nvectors to train Support Vector Machines (SVMs) that do mapping between\nphysical and latent spaces.

We train a\nself-supervised learner (SSL) to make queries with generated images and find\nmatches from real data. We find that the GAN-SVM combination enables users to\nproduce high-quality patches that change smoothly only with a prescribed\nphysical quantity, making generative models physically interpretable. We also\nshow that GAN outputs can be used to retrieve real data that shares the same\nphysical properties as the generated query.

Depending on the context, they have been called the\ninterdiction, most vital vertex, most vital edge, blocker, or vertex deletion\nproblem. Despite their apparent popularity, surprisingly little is known about\nthe computational complexity of interdiction problems in the case where the\noriginal problem is already NP-complete. In this paper, we fill that gap of\nknowledge by showing that a large amount of interdiction problems are even\nharder than NP-hard. Namely, they are complete for the second stage of\nStockmeyer's polynomial hierarchy, the complexity class $\\Sigma^p_2$. Such\ncomplexity insights are important because they imply that all these problems\ncan not be modelled by a compact integer program (unless the unlikely\nconjecture NP $= \\Sigma_2^p$ holds).

This paper presents a new model for\ncalculating the derived discount rate for a society that includes different\ngroups with varying desirable discount rates.

The derived\ndiscount rate is a useful tool for examining the social planner's approach to\npolicies related to the future of society. If the discount rate is determined\ncorrectly, it can help determine the amount of growth and equality in society,\nas well as the level of attention paid to long-term public projects.

A novel approach based on Neural Encrypted State\nTransduction (NEST) is introduced to analyze cryptographic flow residuals and\nclassify threats through their encrypted state transitions, mitigating evasion\ntactics employed through polymorphic and obfuscated attack strategies. The\nmathematical formulation of NEST leverages transduction principles to map state\ntransitions dynamically, enabling high-confidence classification without\nrequiring direct access to decrypted execution traces. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework achieves improved detection accuracy\nacross multiple ransomware families while exhibiting resilience against\nadversarial perturbations and previously unseen attack variants. The model\nmaintains competitive processing efficiency, offering a practical balance\nbetween classification performance and computational resource constraints,\nmaking it suitable for large-scale security deployments. Comparative\nassessments reveal that NEST consistently outperforms baseline classification\nmodels, particularly in detecting ransomware samples employing delayed\nencryption, entropy-based obfuscation, and memory-resident execution\ntechniques. The capacity to generalize across diverse execution environments\nreinforces the applicability of encrypted transduction methodologies in\nadversarial classification tasks beyond conventional malware detection\npipelines.

By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system\nstate from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we\ngain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive\nphysical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular\ninterest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of\nhigh demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and\ntemporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence.\n  We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead,\nincorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with\nrandomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc)\nfacilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We\ndemonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios,\nincluding artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution.\n  Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding\nvortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior\nperformance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to\nexisting spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables\nunique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation.

These limitations can compromise decision-making in\nhuman-centric evaluations, where survey instruments inform adaptive interfaces,\ncognitive workload assessments, and human-AI trust models. Monotone Delta\naddresses these issues by quantifying internal consistency through the\nminimization of ordinal contradictions and alignment with a unidimensional\nlatent order using weighted tournaments. Unlike traditional approaches, it\noperates without parametric or model-based assumptions. We conducted\ntheoretical analyses and experimental evaluations on four challenging\nscenarios: tau-equivalence, redundancy, multidimensionality, and non-normal\ndistributions, and proved that Monotone Delta provides more stable reliability\nassessments compared to existing methods.

Many meta-learning approaches have been applied successfully to\nsingle systems, but falter when confronted with sparse, loosely related\ndatasets requiring multiple hierarchies to be learned. Mixture of Experts (MoE)\noffers a natural paradigm to address these challenges. Despite their potential,\nwe demonstrate that naive MoEs are inadequate for the nuanced demands of\nhierarchical DSR, largely due to their gradient descent-based gating update\nmechanism which leads to slow updates and conflicted routing during training.\nTo overcome this limitation, we introduce MixER: Mixture of Expert\nReconstructors, a novel sparse top-1 MoE layer employing a custom gating update\nalgorithm based on $K$-means and least squares. Extensive experiments validate\nMixER's capabilities, demonstrating efficient training and scalability to\nsystems of up to ten parametric ordinary differential equations. However, our\nlayer underperforms state-of-the-art meta-learners in high-data regimes,\nparticularly when each expert is constrained to process only a fraction of a\ndataset composed of highly related data points. Further analysis with synthetic\nand neuroscientific time series suggests that the quality of the contextual\nrepresentations generated by MixER is closely linked to the presence of\nhierarchical structure in the data.",

Furthermore, no\nopen-source dataset is currently available to support the development of\nmulti-class aortic segmentation methods. To address this gap, we organized the\nAortaSeg24 MICCAI Challenge, introducing the first dataset of 100 CTA volumes\nannotated for 23 clinically relevant aortic branches and zones. This dataset\nwas designed to facilitate both model development and validation. The challenge\nattracted 121 teams worldwide, with participants leveraging state-of-the-art\nframeworks such as nnU-Net and exploring novel techniques, including cascaded\nmodels, data augmentation strategies, and custom loss functions. We evaluated\nthe submitted algorithms using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and\nNormalized Surface Distance (NSD), highlighting the approaches adopted by the\ntop five performing teams. This paper presents the challenge design, dataset\ndetails, evaluation metrics, and an in-depth analysis of the top-performing\nalgorithms. The annotated dataset, evaluation code, and implementations of the\nleading methods are publicly available to support further research.

    "abstract": "Observations and theory suggest that Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) heating and\nmass loss from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars play a crucial role in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) of massive galaxies. We perform 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulations of the central few kiloparsecs of massive galaxies, including\nradiative cooling and mass and energy injection from AGB winds and SNIa\n(resolving each SNIa remnant, a few $\\times10~\\mathrm{pc}$ in size), excluding\nblack hole feedback. We study systems with different initial core thermodynamic\nprofiles, focusing on NGC 1399. Our simulations reproduce its observed density\nand entropy profiles well. Over $100~\\mathrm{Myr}$, two steady-state profiles\nemerge, depending on the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) pressure and the\nratio of Ia heating to cooling: (i) if SNIa heating is less than cooling, a\ncooling flow develops; (ii) if SNIa heating is comparable to or exceeds\ncooling, SNIa heating drives a slow subsonic outflow of AGB ejecta, with black\nhole accretion at small radii. This outflow, pressure-confined by the CGM,\nadapts the ISM to the CGM properties: a low entropy CGM results in a dense, low\nentropy ISM with higher black hole accretion, while a high entropy CGM leads to\na less dense, high entropy ISM with lower accretion. This suggests that the\nAGB-SNIa regulated ISM connects CGM and galaxy scales, potentially influencing\nblack hole feedback in massive halos. Approximate methods of modeling Ia\nheating, such as clustered SNIa and smoothly distributed heating, produce\nunrealistic ISM profiles over $100~\\mathrm{Myr}$, highlighting the importance\nof resolving SNIa in simulations.",

However, very little is known about their\nmolecular gas, which fuels star formation and quasar activity. In this study,\nwe map the kinematics of the cold molecular gas in J0749+2255, a 3.8 kpc\nseparation dual quasar at z=2.17 using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array\n(ALMA) Band 4. We detect CO(4-3)650um, which shows remarkably complex\nmorphological and kinematic structures. While the integrated CO map suggested a\nlens-like ring, this feature disappears with kinematic decomposition. The\nkinematic analysis with ALMA resolves the ambiguities introduced by previous\nobservations, further supporting the dual quasar interpretation of J0749+2255.\nWe find two kinematically distinct molecular gas components: spatially\nextended, yet dynamically complex slow-moving gas (FWHM~130 km/s), and a\ncompact, blueshifted, fast-moving, turbulent gas (FWHM~300 km/s). The disturbed\nkinematics, likely driven by the merger, show hints of rotation but no\nmolecular outflows, suggesting circumnuclear flows. We estimate a large\nmolecular gas reservoir ($M_{H2}\\sim10^{10} M_{\\odot}$), yet the starburst\nactivity appears to exceed the available fuel. We detect an extended continuum\nin excess at rest-frame 455 GHz. The kinematic complexity of CO implicates the\nconnection of mergers on the starburst and quasar activity in J0749+2255, yet\nwhether J0749+2255 represents the dual quasar population remains unclear.\nTargeted kinematic studies of larger dual quasar samples will be essential to\ndisentangling the nature of dual quasars.",

To address this, we present a\nnovel outer-bound on the region of partial identifiability (and establish\nconditions under which it is tight) that depends only on certain conditional\nfirst and second moments. This allows us to derive semiparametrically efficient\nestimators of our endpoint outer-bounds that only require the standard machine\nlearning toolbox which learns conditional means.

    "abstract": "We consider simple stochastic games with terminal-node rewards and multiple\nplayers, who have differing perceptions of risk. Specifically, we study\nrisk-sensitive equilibria (RSEs), where no player can improve their perceived\nreward -- based on their risk parameter -- by deviating from their strategy. We\nstart with the entropic risk (ER) measure, which is widely studied in finance.\nER characterises the players on a quantitative spectrum, with positive risk\nparameters representing optimists and negative parameters representing\npessimists. Building on known results for Nash equilibira, we show that RSEs\nexist under ER for all games with non-negative terminal rewards. However, using\nsimilar techniques, we also show that the corresponding constrained existence\nproblem -- to determine whether an RSE exists under ER with the payoffs in\ngiven intervals -- is undecidable.\n  To address this, we introduce a new, qualitative risk measure -- called\nextreme risk (XR) -- which coincides with the limit cases of positively\ninfinite and negatively infinite ER parameters. Under XR, every player is an\nextremist: an extreme optimist perceives their reward as the maximum payoff\nthat can be achieved with positive probability, while an extreme pessimist\nexpects the minimum payoff achievable with positive probability. Our first main\nresult proves the existence of RSEs also under XR for non-negative terminal\nrewards. Our second main result shows that under XR the constrained existence\nproblem is not only decidable, but NP-complete. Moreover, when all players are\nextreme optimists, the problem becomes PTIME-complete. Our algorithmic results\napply to all rewards, positive or negative, establishing the first decidable\nfragment for equilibria in simple stochastic games with terminal objectives\nwithout restrictions on strategy types or number of players.",

    "abstract": "Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not\nexhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive\nground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics\nbetween these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin\nliquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter\ncharacterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized\nexcitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB)\nstate formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice.\nIn this work, we unveil a \\textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of\narchetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized\ninfinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these\nsystems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of\nclose-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly\nhyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid\nthat was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that\nthe QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite\ndensity of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is\nstill largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the\nframework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other\nproximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL\ncandidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced,\ncomputationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true\nQSLs.",

However, current\napproaches often lack diversity or are too simplistic to generate the wide\nrange of grammatical errors made by humans, especially for low-resource\nlanguages such as Arabic. In this paper, we will develop the error tagging\nmodel and the synthetic data generation model to create a large synthetic\ndataset in Arabic for grammatical error correction. In the error tagging model,\nthe correct sentence is categorized into multiple error types by using the\nDeBERTav3 model. Arabic Error Type Annotation tool (ARETA) is used to guide\nmulti-label classification tasks in an error tagging model in which each\nsentence is classified into 26 error tags. The synthetic data generation model\nis a back-translation-based model that generates incorrect sentences by\nappending error tags before the correct sentence that was generated from the\nerror tagging model using the ARAT5 model. In the QALB-14 and QALB-15 Test\nsets, the error tagging model achieved 94.42% F1, which is state-of-the-art in\nidentifying error tags in clean sentences. As a result of our syntactic data\ntraining in grammatical error correction, we achieved a new state-of-the-art\nresult of F1-Score: 79.36% in the QALB-14 Test set.

In response, researchers have proposed\nadvanced pipelines that leverage domain-specific knowledge to chain smaller\nprompts, provide intermediate feedback and improve performance through search.\nHowever, the current complexity of writing, tuning, maintaining and improving\nsuch pipelines has limited their sophistication. We propose oracular\nprogramming, a foundational paradigm for building LLM-enabled applications that\nlets domain experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs\nwith unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by\nLLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect\ndecisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a\nstrategy that consists in a nondeterministic program with choice points that\ncan be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this\ntree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe\nsuccessful and unsuccessful search tree navigation scenarios across diverse\nproblem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming\nlanguage and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key\nprogramming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs\nand enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve.",

However, no\nmethods have been proposed to estimate this covariance matrix in a nonsmooth\nand potentially non-monotone (nonconvex) setting.

Its\nconstruction does not require prior knowledge of the total sample size, and\nupdates can be performed recursively as new data arrives. We establish that, as\nlong as the batch size sequence is properly specified (depending on the\nstepsize sequence), the estimator achieves a convergence rate of order\n$O(\\sqrt{d}n^{-1/8+\\varepsilon})$ for any $\\varepsilon>0$, where $d$ and $n$\ndenote the problem dimensionality and the number of iterations (or samples)\nused.

    "abstract": "Science communication increases public interest in science by educating,\nengaging, and encouraging everyday people to participate in the sciences. But\ntraditional science communication is often too formal and inaccessible for\ngeneral audiences. However, there is a growing trend on social media to make it\nmore approachable using three techniques: relatable examples to make\nexplanations concrete, step-by-step walkthroughs to improve understanding, and\npersonal language to drive engagement. These techniques are flashy and often\ngarner more engagement from social media users, but the effectiveness of these\ntechniques in actually explaining the science is unknown. Furthermore, many\nscientists struggle with adopting these science communication strategies for\nsocial media, fearing it might undermine their authority. We conduct a reader\nstudy to understand how these science communication techniques on social media\naffect readers' understanding and engagement of the science. We found that\nwhile most readers prefer these techniques, they had diverse preferences for\nwhen and where these techniques are used. With these findings, we conducted a\nwriter study to understand how scientists' varying comfort levels with these\nstrategies can be supported by presenting different structure and style\noptions. We found that the side-by-side comparison of options helped writers\nmake editorial decisions. Instead of adhering to one direction of science\ncommunication, writers explored a continuum of options which helped them\nidentify which communication strategies they wanted to implement.",

This approach is generically\napplicable to any hypothesis class, provided that a mathematical formulation of\nthe model learning task exists. It offers a structured framework to define the\nnotion of business necessity and evaluate how fairness can be improved or\ndegraded towards a specific protected group, while remaining within the\nRashomon set and maintaining any desired sparsity level.\n  We apply our approach to two hypothesis classes: scoring systems and decision\ndiagrams, leveraging recent mathematical programming formulations for training\nsuch models. As seen in our experiments, the method comprehensively and\ncertifiably quantifies trade-offs between predictive performance, sparsity, and\nfairness. We observe that a wide range of fairness values are attainable,\nranging from highly favorable to significantly unfavorable for a protected\ngroup, while staying within less than 1% of the best possible training accuracy\nfor the hypothesis class. Additionally, we observe that sparsity constraints\nlimit these trade-offs and may disproportionately harm specific subgroups.

    "abstract": "This study introduces an advanced multiphysics and multiscale modeling\napproach to investigate intestinal motility. We propose a generalized\nelectromechanical framework that incorporates contact mechanics, enabling the\ndevelopment of a unique and innovative model for intestinal motility. The\ntheoretical framework includes an electromechanical model coupling a\nmicrostructural material model, which describes the intestinal structure, with\nan electrophysiological model that captures the propagation of slow waves.\nAdditionally, it integrates a self-contact detection algorithm based on a\nnearest-neighbour search and the penalty method, along with boundary conditions\nthat account for the influence of surrounding organs. A staggered finite\nelement scheme implemented in FEniCS is employed to solve the governing\nequations using the finite element method. The model is applied to study cases\nof moderate and severe strangulation hernia, as well as intestinal adhesion\nsyndrome. The results demonstrate that low peristalsis takes place in the\npre-strangulation zone. At the same time, very high pressure is recorded in the\nstrangulation zone, and peristaltic contractions persisted in the healthy\nregion. For adhesions, the results indicate a complete absence of peristalsis\nin the adherent region. The model successfully reproduces both qualitatively\nand quantitatively propagative contractions in complex scenarios, such as pre-\nand post-surgical conditions, thereby highlighting its potential to provide\nvaluable insights for clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Shortest Vector Problem is believed to be hard both for classical and quantum\ncomputers. Two of the three NIST post-quantum cryptosystems standardised by\nNIST rely on its hardness. Research on theoretical and practical performance of\nquantum algorithms to solve SVP is crucial to establish confidence in them.\nExploring the capabilities that Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) that can\nrun on NISQ devices have in solving SVP has been an active research area. The\nqubit-requirement for doing so has been analysed and it was demonstrated that\nit is plausible to encode SVP on the ground state of a Hamiltonian efficiently.\nDue to the heuristic nature of VQAs no analysis of the time complexity of those\napproaches for scales beyond the non-interesting classically simulatable sizes\nhas been performed. Motivated by Boulebnane and Montanaro work on the k-SAT\nproblem, we propose to use angle pretraining of the QAOA for SVP and we\ndemonstrate that it performs well on much larger instances than those used in\ntraining. Avoiding the limitations that arise due to the use of optimiser, we\nare able to extrapolate the observed performance and observe the probability of\nsuccess scaling as $2^{-0.695n}$ with n being dimensionality of the search\nspace for a depth $p=3$ pre-trained QAOA. We observe time complexity\n$O(2^{0.695n})$, a bit worse than the fault-tolerant Grover approach of\n$O(2^{0.5n})$. However, both the number of qubits, and the depth of each\nquantum computation, are considerably better-Grover requires exponential depth,\nwhile each run of constant p fixed-angles QAOA requires polynomial depth. We\nalso propose a novel method to avoid the zero vector solution to SVP without\nintroducing more logical qubits. This improves upon the previous works as it\nresults in more space efficient encoding of SVP on NISQ architectures without\nignoring the zero vector problem.",

Using new and archival ALMA data, we observed the OH\n119um doublet lines in order to search for cold molecular outflows in a sample\nof 11 unobscured, IR-luminous quasars at z>6. This represents the first survey\nfor molecular winds in reionization-era quasars, and we detect unambiguous\noutflows in 8/11 (73%) of the quasars. The outflows we find are substantially\nfaster, by ~300km/s on average, than outflows observed in a roughly co-eval\nsample of non-quasar IR-luminous galaxies, suggesting that the AGN drive the\nwinds to higher velocities. On the other hand, the implied molecular outflow\nrates are relatively modest given the high luminosities, suggesting typical\nmass loading factors ~0.5 in the cold gas. The outflows are consistent with\nexpectations for momentum-driven winds regardless of the driving source, but\nthe kinetic energy in the outflows suggests that the AGN must be at least\npartially responsible for driving the winds. Accordingly, we find trends\nbetween the outflow properties and the Eddington ratio of the black hole\naccretion, though this may be linked to the underlying trend with AGN\nluminosity. We find that the kinetic power carried in the cold outflow phase is\ntypically only ~0.1% of the total AGN luminosity. Our study provides evidence\nin favor of AGN feedback on the cold molecular gas in $z>6$ quasar host\ngalaxies, demonstrating that cold outflows are very common and powerful in the\nmost extreme reionization-era quasars.",

In this paper, we propose GEoMetric\nvIsual deNse sImilarity (GEMINI) learning which embeds the homeomorphism prior\nto DCRL and enables a reliable correspondence discovery for effective dense\ncontrast.

It\neffectively reduces the searching space of pairing and drives an implicit and\nsoft learning of negative pairs via a gradient. We also propose a geometric\nsemantic similarity (GSS) which extracts semantic information in features to\nmeasure the alignment degree for the correspondence learning.

One can, however, derive the zeroth law from first principles\nstarting from a classical Hamiltonian using basic mechanics and a geometric\nrepresentation of the phase space of kinetic energy configurations - the\nvelocity hypersphere. In this approach there is no difficulty in providing a\nmolecular interpretation of temperature, nor in deriving equality of\ntemperature as the condition of thermal equilibrium. The approach to the\nmacroscopic limit as a function of the number of atoms is easily determined.\nOne also obtains with little difficulty the Boltzmann probability distribution,\nthe statistical mechanical definition of entropy and the configuration\npartition function.

The focus is on cross-chain\nprotocols in which a collection of parties, some honest and some perhaps not,\ninteract through trusted smart contracts residing on multiple, independent\nledgers.\n  While cross-chain protocols are capable of general computations, they are\nprimarily used to track ownership of assets such as cryptocurrencies or other\nvaluable data.

As in the classical model, the parties\nprovide task inputs and agree on a desired sequence of proposed asset\ntransfers.

We incorporate this Interaction Chain into a reward function and train\npolicies in simulation using domain randomization to enable zero-shot transfer\nto real-world robots. The resulting policies allow a Spot robot to manipulate\nvarious large objects, including chairs, tables, and standing lamps. Through\nextensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we show that\nRobotMover achieves strong performance in terms of capability, robustness, and\ncontrollability, outperforming both learned and teleoperation baselines.

Here, using 3D hydrodynamics\nand 1D radiative-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and\nobservables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between\nterminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision\nconfigurations. The ejecta produce bright ultraviolet (UV) flares with\nbolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\ndeclining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra\nevolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to\noptical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from\nmetals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines.\nThese properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as\nobtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit\nclear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter,\nrelative velocity, and stellar masses.

Existing quantum machine learning schemes\ntypically employ a quantum-classical hybrid approach that relies crucially on\ngradients of model parameters. Such an approach lacks provable convergence to\nglobal minima and will become infeasible as quantum learning models scale up.\nHere, we introduce quantum automated learning, where no variational parameter\nis involved and the training process is converted to quantum state preparation.\nIn particular, we encode training data into unitary operations and iteratively\nevolve a random initial state under these unitaries and their inverses, with a\ntarget-oriented perturbation towards higher prediction accuracy sandwiched in\nbetween. Under reasonable assumptions, we rigorously prove that the evolution\nconverges exponentially to the desired state corresponding to the global\nminimum of the loss function. We show that such a training process can be\nunderstood from the perspective of preparing quantum states by imaginary time\nevolution, where the data-encoded unitaries together with target-oriented\nperturbations would train the quantum learning model in an automated fashion.\nWe further prove that the quantum automated learning paradigm features good\ngeneralization ability with the generalization error upper bounded by the ratio\nbetween a logarithmic function of the Hilbert space dimension and the number of\ntraining samples. In addition, we carry out extensive numerical simulations on\nreal-life images and quantum data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach and validate the assumptions.

We present a set of\nneural-based emulators for void summary statistics of watershed voids, which\nretain more information about the full void population than simplified\nanalytical models.

PolySpec\nincludes a python/cython implementation of each estimator derived in Paper 1\nand has been carefully optimized to ensure efficient use of computational\nresources. We perform a broad range of validation tests, which demonstrate that\nthe estimator is unbiased and minimum-variance, both in Gaussian and\nnon-Gaussian regimes. In addition, we forecast constraints on various types of\ntrispectra; this highlights the utility of CMB polarization and demonstrates\nthat many models of primordial physics are poorly correlated with the simple\ntemplates considered in previous studies. This work lays the foundation for the\nPlanck trispectrum analyses performed in Paper 3.",

Using JWST in Cycle 2, we extend JAGB measurements to 6\nhosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) (NGC 2525, NGC 3147, NGC 3370, NGC 3447,\nNGC 5468, and NGC 5861), with two at $D \\sim 40$ Mpc, all calibrated by the\nmaser host NGC 4258. We investigate the effects of incompleteness and find that\nwe are unable to recover a robust JAGB measurement in one of the two most\ndistant hosts at $R \\sim 40$ Mpc, NGC 3147. We compile all JWST JAGB\nobservations in SNe Ia hosts, 15 galaxies hosting 18 SNe Ia, from the SH0ES and\nCCHP programs and employ all literature measures (mode, mean, median, model).\nWe find no significant mean difference between these distances and those from\nHST Cepheids, $-0.03\\pm0.02$ (stat) $\\pm$ 0.05 (sys) mag. We find a difference\nof 0.11 $\\pm$ 0.02 mag between JAGB mode measurements in the CCHP analyses of\ntwo fields in NGC 4258, a feature also seen in two SH0ES fields (see\nfield-to-field variations in Li et al. 2024a), indicating significant\nfield-to-field variation of JAGB measurements in NGC 4258 which produce a large\nabsolute calibration uncertainty. Variations are also seen in the shape of the\nJAGB LF across galaxies so that different measures produce different values of\nthe Hubble constant. We look for but do not (yet) find a standardizing relation\nbetween JAGB LF skew or color dependence and the apparent variation.

Realistic\nand visually appealing details are typically reflected in high resolution\noutputs, further amplifying computational demands especially for single stage\nDiT models. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two stage\nframework, FlashVideo, which strategically allocates model capacity and NFEs\nacross stages to balance generation fidelity and quality. In the first stage,\nprompt fidelity is prioritized through a low resolution generation process\nutilizing large parameters and sufficient NFEs to enhance computational\nefficiency. The second stage establishes flow matching between low and high\nresolutions, effectively generating fine details with minimal NFEs.\nQuantitative and visual results demonstrate that FlashVideo achieves\nstate-of-the-art high resolution video generation with superior computational\nefficiency.

An explanation for this amplification is proposed using a\ntheoretical model based on a dynamic instability of electromagnetic waves\ninteracting with infrared-active oscillators of impurity acceptor states in\ntellurium to form an amplifying polariton. Our work not only uncovers the\npresence of a magneto-chiral instability but also highlights its promise for\nTHz-wave amplification in chiral materials.",

A popular method for evaluating these capabilities is the\nneedle-in-a-haystack (NIAH) test, which involves retrieving a \"needle\"\n(relevant information) from a \"haystack\" (long irrelevant context). Extensions\nof this approach include increasing distractors, fact chaining, and in-context\nreasoning. However, in these benchmarks, models can exploit existing literal\nmatches between the needle and haystack to simplify the task. To address this,\nwe introduce NoLiMa, a benchmark extending NIAH with a carefully designed\nneedle set, where questions and needles have minimal lexical overlap, requiring\nmodels to infer latent associations to locate the needle within the haystack.\nWe evaluate 13 popular LLMs that claim to support contexts of at least 128K\ntokens. While they perform well in short contexts (<1K), performance degrades\nsignificantly as context length increases. At 32K, for instance, 11 models drop\nbelow 50% of their strong short-length baselines. Even GPT-4o, one of the\ntop-performing exceptions, experiences a reduction from an almost-perfect\nbaseline of 99.3% to 69.7%. Our analysis suggests these declines stem from the\nincreased difficulty the attention mechanism faces in longer contexts when\nliteral matches are absent, making it harder to retrieve relevant information.\nEven models enhanced with reasoning capabilities or CoT prompting struggle to\nmaintain performance in long contexts.

    "abstract": "While diffusion models are powerful in generating high-quality, diverse\nsynthetic data for object-centric tasks, existing methods struggle with\nscene-aware tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Human-Object\nInteraction (HOI) Reasoning, where it is critical to preserve scene attributes\nin generated images consistent with a multimodal context, i.e. a reference\nimage with accompanying text guidance query. To address this, we introduce\n$\\textbf{Hummingbird}$, the first diffusion-based image generator which, given\na multimodal context, generates highly diverse images w.r.t. the reference\nimage while ensuring high fidelity by accurately preserving scene attributes,\nsuch as object interactions and spatial relationships from the text guidance.\nHummingbird employs a novel Multimodal Context Evaluator that simultaneously\noptimizes our formulated Global Semantic and Fine-grained Consistency Rewards\nto ensure generated images preserve the scene attributes of reference images in\nrelation to the text guidance while maintaining diversity. As the first model\nto address the task of maintaining both diversity and fidelity given a\nmultimodal context, we introduce a new benchmark formulation incorporating MME\nPerception and Bongard HOI datasets.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses stochastic charger location and allocation (SCLA)\nproblems under queue congestion for last-mile delivery using electric vehicles\n(EVs). The objective is to decide where to open charging stations and how many\nchargers of each type to install, subject to budgetary and waiting-time\nconstraints. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program,\nwhere each station-charger pair is modeled as a multiserver queue with\nstochastic arrivals and service times to capture the notion of waiting in fleet\noperations. The model is extremely large, with billions of variables and\nconstraints for a typical metropolitan area; and even loading the model in\nsolver memory is difficult, let alone solving it. To address this challenge, we\ndevelop a Lagrangian-based dual decomposition framework that decomposes the\nproblem by station and leverages parallelization on high-performance computing\nsystems, where the subproblems are solved by using a cutting plane method and\ntheir solutions are collected at the master level. We also develop a three-step\nrounding heuristic to transform the fractional subproblem solutions into\nfeasible integral solutions. Computational experiments on data from the Chicago\nmetropolitan area with hundreds of thousands of households and thousands of\ncandidate stations show that our approach produces high-quality solutions in\ncases where existing exact methods cannot even load the model in memory. We\nalso analyze various policy scenarios, demonstrating that combining existing\ndepots with newly built stations under multiagency collaboration substantially\nreduces costs and congestion. These findings offer a scalable and efficient\nframework for developing sustainable large-scale EV charging networks.",

Traditional methods often depend on\nhuman listeners for evaluation, leading to inconsistencies and high resource\ndemands. This paper addresses the growing need for automated systems capable of\npredicting audio aesthetics without human intervention. Such systems are\ncrucial for applications like data filtering, pseudo-labeling large datasets,\nand evaluating generative audio models, especially as these models become more\nsophisticated. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to audio aesthetic\nevaluation by proposing new annotation guidelines that decompose human\nlistening perspectives into four distinct axes. We develop and train\nno-reference, per-item prediction models that offer a more nuanced assessment\nof audio quality. Our models are evaluated against human mean opinion scores\n(MOS) and existing methods, demonstrating comparable or superior performance.\nThis research not only advances the field of audio aesthetics but also provides\nopen-source models and datasets to facilitate future work and benchmarking.

Our\ndefinitions come from the fact that these games are classical property tests\nfor the corresponding matching conditions. We use the existence of perfect\nquantum and nonsignaling strategies for these games to define quantum and\nnonsignaling versions of perfect matchings. Finally, we provide\ncharacterizations of when graphs exhibit these extended properties:\n  - For nonsignaling matchings, we give a complete combinatorial\ncharacterizations. In particular, a graph has a nonsignaling perfect matching\nif and only if it admits a fractional perfect matching that has bounded value\non triangles. \\item In bipartite graphs, the nonsignaling $L$-perfect matching\nproperty is achieved exactly when the left component of the graph can be split\ninto two disjoint subgraphs: one with a classical $L$-perfect matching and\nanother with left-degree 2.\n  - In the quantum setting, we show that complete graphs $K_n$ with odd $n \\geq\n7$ have quantum perfect matchings.

Among these, inventory\nmanagement plays a crucial role in minimizing organizational expenses by\noptimizing the storage and transportation of materials. In this context, this\nstudy introduces an optimization model for the lot-sizing problem based on a\nphysical system approach. By establishing that the material supply problem is\nisomorphic to a one-dimensional mechanical system of point particles connected\nby elastic elements, we leverage this analogy to derive cost optimization\nconditions naturally and obtain an exact solution. This approach determines lot\nsizes that minimize the combined ordering and inventory holding costs in a\nsignificantly shorter time, eliminating the need for heuristic methods. The\noptimal lot sizes are defined in terms of the parameter $ \\gamma = 2C_O / C_H\n$, which represents the relationship between the ordering cost per order ($ C_O\n$) and the holding cost per period for the material required in one period ($\nC_H $). This parameter fully dictates the system's behavior: when $ \\gamma \\leq\n1 $, the optimal strategy is to place one order per period, whereas for $\n\\gamma > 1 $, the number of orders $ N $ is reduced relative to the planning\nhorizon $ M $, meaning $ N < M $. By formulating the total cost function in\nterms of the intensive variable $ N/M $, we consolidate the entire optimization\nproblem into a single function of $ \\gamma $. This eliminates the need for\ncomplex algorithms, enabling faster and more precise purchasing decisions. The\nproposed model was validated through a real-world case study and benchmarked\nagainst classical algorithms, demonstrating superior cost optimization and\nreduced execution time.

We first investigate the\nspectrum aliasing problem in spectrum-based audio generation caused by existing\njoint diffusion methods. Through a comparative analysis of the VAE latent\nrepresentation of Mel-spectra and RGB images, we identify that the failure\narises from excessive suppression of high-frequency components during the\nspectrum denoising process due to the averaging operator. To address this\nissue, we propose Self-Loop Latent Swap, a frame-level bidirectional swap\napplied to the overlapping region of adjacent views. Leveraging stepwise\ndifferentiated trajectories of adjacent subviews, this swap operator adaptively\nenhances high-frequency components and avoid spectrum distortion. Furthermore,\nto improve global cross-view consistency in non-overlapping regions, we\nintroduce Reference-Guided Latent Swap, a unidirectional latent swap operator\nthat provides a centralized reference trajectory to synchronize subview\ndiffusions. By refining swap timing and intervals, we can achieve a cross-view\nsimilarity-diversity balance in a forward-only manner. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments demonstrate that SaFa significantly outperforms\nexisting joint diffusion methods and even training-based methods in audio\ngeneration using both U-Net and DiT models, along with effective longer length\nadaptation. It also adapts well to panorama generation, achieving comparable\nperformance with 2 $\\sim$ 20 $\\times$ faster speed and greater model\ngeneralizability.

    "abstract": "Most image restoration problems are ill-conditioned or ill-posed and hence\ninvolve significant uncertainty. Quantifying this uncertainty is crucial for\nreliably interpreting experimental results, particularly when reconstructed\nimages inform critical decisions and science. However, most existing image\nrestoration methods either fail to quantify uncertainty or provide estimates\nthat are highly inaccurate. Conformal prediction has recently emerged as a\nflexible framework to equip any estimator with uncertainty quantification\ncapabilities that, by construction, have nearly exact marginal coverage. To\nachieve this, conformal prediction relies on abundant ground truth data for\ncalibration. However, in image restoration problems, reliable ground truth data\nis often expensive or not possible to acquire. Also, reliance on ground truth\ndata can introduce large biases in situations of distribution shift between\ncalibration and deployment. This paper seeks to develop a more robust approach\nto conformal prediction for image restoration problems by proposing a\nself-supervised conformal prediction method that leverages Stein's Unbiased\nRisk Estimator (SURE) to self-calibrate itself directly from the observed noisy\nmeasurements, bypassing the need for ground truth. The method is suitable for\nany linear imaging inverse problem that is ill-conditioned, and it is\nespecially powerful when used with modern self-supervised image restoration\ntechniques that can also be trained directly from measurement data. The\nproposed approach is demonstrated through numerical experiments on image\ndenoising and deblurring, where it delivers results that are remarkably\naccurate and comparable to those obtained by supervised conformal prediction\nwith ground truth data.",

However, real-time systems must process the\nincoming data at a fixed rate, necessitating a fixed-throughput decoder in\norder to avoid losing data. We propose a first-in first-out (FIFO) scheduling\narchitecture that enables a fixed throughput while improving the block error\nrate (BLER) compared to the common approach of imposing a maximum runtime\nconstraint per received codeword.

Motivated by the observations that prompt quality\nmanifests directly in LLM outputs and LLMs can effectively assess adherence to\ntask requirements, we derive evaluation and optimization signals purely from\noutput comparisons. Specifically, SPO selects superior prompts through pairwise\noutput comparisons evaluated by an LLM evaluator, followed by an LLM optimizer\nthat aligns outputs with task requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat SPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods, achieving\ncomparable or superior results with significantly lower costs (e.g., 1.1% to\n5.6% of existing methods) and fewer samples (e.g., three samples).

The considered network includes a set\nof base stations (BSs) that must allocate its limited spectrum resources to\nserve a set of users while also transmitting its partially observed physical\nnetwork information to a cloud server to generate the DNT. Since the DNT can\npredict the physical network status based on its historical status, the BSs may\nnot need to send their physical network information at each time slot, allowing\nthem to conserve spectrum resources to serve the users. However, if the DNT\ndoes not receive the physical network information of the BSs over a large time\nperiod, the DNT's accuracy in representing the physical network may degrade. To\nthis end, each BS must decide when to send the physical network information to\nthe cloud server to update the DNT, while also determining the spectrum\nresource allocation policy for both DNT synchronization and serving the users.\nWe formulate this resource allocation task as an optimization problem, aiming\nto maximize the total data rate of all users while minimizing the\nasynchronization between the physical network and the DNT.

    "abstract": "This article explores the requirements for corpus compilation within the\nGiesKaNe project (University of Giessen and Kassel, Syntactic Basic Structures\nof New High German). The project is defined by three central characteristics:\nit is a reference corpus, a historical corpus, and a syntactically deeply\nannotated treebank. As a historical corpus, GiesKaNe aims to establish\nconnections with both historical and contemporary corpora, ensuring its\nrelevance across temporal and linguistic contexts. The compilation process\nstrikes the balance between innovation and adherence to standards, addressing\nboth internal project goals and the broader interests of the research\ncommunity. The methodological complexity of such a project is managed through a\ncomplementary interplay of human expertise and machine-assisted processes. The\narticle discusses foundational topics such as tokenization, normalization,\nsentence definition, tagging, parsing, and inter-annotator agreement, alongside\nadvanced considerations. These include comparisons between grammatical models,\nannotation schemas, and established de facto annotation standards as well as\nthe integration of human and machine collaboration. Notably, a novel method for\nmachine-assisted classification of texts along the continuum of conceptual\norality and literacy is proposed, offering new perspectives on text selection.\nFurthermore, the article introduces an approach to deriving de facto standard\nannotations from existing ones, mediating between standardization and\ninnovation. In the course of describing the workflow the article demonstrates\nthat even ambitious projects like GiesKaNe can be effectively implemented using\nexisting research infrastructure, requiring no specialized annotation tools.\nInstead, it is shown that the workflow can be based on the strategic use of a\nsimple spreadsheet and integrates the capabilities of the existing\ninfrastructure.",

    "abstract": "As the use of automated employment decision tools (AEDTs) has rapidly\nincreased in hiring contexts, especially for computing jobs, there is still\nlimited work on applicants' perceptions of these emerging tools and their\nexperiences navigating them. To investigate, we conducted a survey with 448\ncomputer science students (young, current technology job-seekers) about\nperceptions of the procedural fairness of AEDTs, their willingness to be\nevaluated by different AEDTs, the strategies they use relating to automation in\nthe hiring process, and their job seeking success. We find that young job\nseekers' procedural fairness perceptions of and willingness to be evaluated by\nAEDTs varied with the level of automation involved in the AEDT, the technical\nnature of the task being evaluated, and their own use of strategies, such as\njob referrals. Examining the relationship of their strategies with job\noutcomes, notably, we find that referrals and family household income have\nsignificant and positive impacts on hiring success, while more egalitarian\nstrategies (using free online coding assessment practice or adding keywords to\nresumes) did not. Overall, our work speaks to young job seekers' distrust of\nautomation in hiring contexts, as well as the continued role of social and\nsocioeconomic privilege in job seeking, despite the use of AEDTs that promise\nto make hiring \"unbiased.\"",

This paper\nsystematically investigates the challenges classifiers trained with empirical\nrisk minimization (ERM) face against such distribution shifts and attributes\ntheir shortcomings to their inability to learn stable discriminative features.\nInvariant learning theory offers a promising solution by encouraging models to\ngenerate stable representations crossing environments that expose the\ninstability of the training set. However, the lack of prior environment labels,\nthe diversity of drift factors, and low-quality representations caused by\ndiverse families make this task challenging. To address these issues, we\npropose TIF, the first temporal invariant training framework for malware\ndetection, which aims to enhance the ability of detectors to learn stable\nrepresentations across time. TIF organizes environments based on application\nobservation dates to reveal temporal drift, integrating specialized multi-proxy\ncontrastive learning and invariant gradient alignment to generate and align\nenvironments with high-quality, stable representations. TIF can be seamlessly\nintegrated into any learning-based detector.

    "abstract": "Effective and reliable evaluation is essential for advancing empirical\nmachine learning. However, the increasing accessibility of generalist models\nand the progress towards ever more complex, high-level tasks make systematic\nevaluation more challenging. Benchmarks are plagued by various biases,\nartifacts, or leakage, while models may behave unreliably due to poorly\nexplored failure modes. Haphazard treatments and inconsistent formulations of\nsuch \"monsters\" can contribute to a duplication of efforts, a lack of trust in\nresults, and unsupported inferences. In this position paper, we argue causality\noffers an ideal framework to systematically address these challenges. By making\ncausal assumptions in an approach explicit, we can faithfully model phenomena,\nformulate testable hypotheses with explanatory power, and leverage principled\ntools for analysis. To make causal model design more accessible, we identify\nseveral useful Common Abstract Topologies (CATs) in causal graphs which help\ngain insight into the reasoning abilities in large language models. Through a\nseries of case studies, we demonstrate how the precise yet pragmatic language\nof causality clarifies the strengths and limitations of a method and inspires\nnew approaches for systematic progress.",

This study presents a framework for implementing\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) in Fortran,\nallowing for native execution without TensorFlow's C API, Python runtime, or\nONNX conversion. Designed for ease of use and computational efficiency, the\nframework can be implemented in any Fortran code, supporting iterative solvers\nand UQ via ensembles or BNNs. Verification was performed using a two-input,\none-output test case composed of a noisy sinusoid to compare Fortran-based\npredictions to those from TensorFlow. The DNN predictions showed negligible\ndifferences and achieved a 19.6x speedup, whereas the BNN predictions exhibited\nminor disagreement, plausibly due to differences in random number generation.\nAn 8.0x speedup was noted for BNN inference. The approach was then further\nverified on a nuclear-relevant problem predicting critical heat flux (CHF),\nwhich demonstrated similar behavior along with significant computational gains.\nDiscussion regarding the framework's successful integration into the CTF\nthermal-hydraulics code is also included, outlining its practical usefulness.\nOverall, this framework was shown to be effective at implementing both DNN and\nBNN model inference within Fortran, allowing for the continued study of\nML-based methods in real-world nuclear applications.",

The goal is twofold: on one\nhand, to determine how far we can advance in the technical study of the model;\non the other, to assess whether at least some of the deterministic outcomes\nremain valid in the stochastic setting. The resulting optimal control problem\nproves to be challenging, primarily due to the lack of concavity in the\nobjective function. This feature is present in the model even in the\ndeterministic case (see, e.g., Bambi and Gozzi [2020]).

In this work, we introduce Adaptive Graph of\nThoughts (AGoT), a dynamic, graph-based inference framework that enhances LLM\nreasoning solely at test time. Rather than relying on fixed-step methods like\nChain of Thought (CoT) or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), AGoT recursively decomposes\ncomplex queries into structured subproblems, forming an dynamic directed\nacyclic graph (DAG) of interdependent reasoning steps. By selectively expanding\nonly those subproblems that require further analysis, AGoT unifies the\nstrengths of chain, tree, and graph paradigms into a cohesive framework that\nallocates computation where it is most needed. We validate our approach on\ndiverse benchmarks spanning multi-hop retrieval, scientific reasoning, and\nmathematical problem-solving, achieving up to 46.2% improvement on scientific\nreasoning tasks (GPQA) - comparable to gains achieved through computationally\nintensive reinforcement learning approaches and outperforming state-of-the-art\niterative approaches.

Geomagnetic navigation for autonomous\nvehicles has drawn increasing attention with its independence from GPS or\ninertial navigation devices. While geomagnetic navigation approaches have been\nextensively investigated, the generalizability of learned geomagnetic\nnavigation strategies remains unexplored. The performance of a learned strategy\ncan degrade outside of its source domain where the strategy is learned, due to\na lack of knowledge about the geomagnetic characteristics in newly entered\nareas. This paper explores the generalization of learned geomagnetic navigation\nstrategies via deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Particularly, we employ DRL\nagents to learn multiple teacher models from distributed domains that represent\ndispersed navigation strategies, and amalgamate the teacher models for\ngeneralizability across navigation areas. We design a reward shaping mechanism\nin training teacher models where we integrate both potential-based and\nintrinsic-motivated rewards. The designed reward shaping can enhance the\nexploration efficiency of the DRL agent and improve the representation of the\nteacher models. Upon the gained teacher models, we employ multi-teacher policy\ndistillation to merge the policies learned by individual teachers, leading to a\nnavigation strategy with generalizability across navigation domains.

    "abstract": "We identify a new universality class of phase transitions that emerges in\nnon-normal systems, extending the classical framework beyond eigenvalue\ninstabilities. Unlike traditional critical phenomena, where transitions occur\nwhen eigenvalues cross zero, we show that the geometry of eigenvectors alone\ncan trigger qualitative changes in dynamics. Within a large-deviation\nframework, transient amplification intrinsic to non-normal operators\nrenormalizes the effective noise amplitude, acting as an emergent temperature.\nOnce the non-normality index $\\kappa$ exceeds a critical threshold\n$\\kappa_c$--the balance between restoring curvature and non-normal\nshear--stable equilibria lose practical relevance: fluctuations are amplified\nenough to induce escapes even though spectral stability is preserved. This\nmechanism defines a fundamentally new route to criticality (pseudo-criticality)\nthat generalizes Kramers' escape beyond potential barriers and can dominate\nnoise-driven transitions in natural and engineered systems. In biology, we\ndemonstrate that DNA methylation, a cornerstone of epigenetic regulation,\noperates in this regime: by extending a bistable CpG dyad model to include\nnon-normality, we reconcile long-term epigenetic memory with rapid stochastic\nswitching observed on minute timescales. More broadly, the same mechanism\nunderlies abrupt tipping in climate, ecological collapse, financial crises, and\nengineered network failures. By showing that phase transitions can arise from\nnon-normal amplification rather than spectral instabilities, our work provides\na predictive framework for sudden transitions across disciplines.",

Recent experimental advances include the\ntime-dependent local control of chemical potentials and tunnelings, and thus\nenable to operate this platform digitally as a programmable quantum simulator.\nHere, we explore these opportunities and develop ground-state preparation\nalgorithms for different fermionic models, based on the ability to implement\nboth single-particle and many-body, high-fidelity fermionic gates, as provided\nby the native FH Hamiltonian. In particular, we first design variational,\npre-compiled quantum circuits to prepare the ground state of the natively\nimplemented FH model, with significant speedups relative to competing adiabatic\nprotocols. Besides, the versatility of this variational approach enables to\ntarget extended FH models, i.e., including terms that are not natively realized\non the platform. As an illustration, we include next-nearest-neighbor\ntunnelings at finite dopings, relevant in the context of $d$-wave\nsuperconductivity. Furthermore, we discuss how to approximate the\nimaginary-time evolution using variational fermionic circuits, both as an\nalternative state-preparation strategy, and as a subroutine for the Quantum\nLanczos algorithm to further improve the energy estimation. We benchmark our\nprotocols for ladder geometries, though they can be readily applied to 2D\nexperimental setups to address regimes beyond the capabilities of current\nclassical methods. These results pave the way for more efficient and\ncomprehensive explorations of relevant many-body phases with existing\nprogrammable fermionic quantum simulators.",

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that\nexisting mitigation techniques, effective for visual content, fail to prevent\nharmful text generation while substantially degrading benign text generation.\nAs an initial step toward addressing this threat, we introduce a novel\nfine-tuning strategy that targets only the text-generation layers in DMs.\nTherefore, we construct a safety fine-tuning dataset by pairing each NSFW\nprompt with two images: one with the NSFW term, and another where that term is\nreplaced with a carefully crafted benign alternative while leaving the image\nunchanged otherwise. By training on this dataset, the model learns to avoid\ngenerating harmful text while preserving benign content and overall image\nquality. Finally, to advance research in the area, we release ToxicBench, an\nopen-source benchmark for evaluating NSFW text generation in images.

The spectrum shows an unusually\nweak water emission spectrum for a disk around a star of its spectral type, but\nstrong emission from CO$_2$, HCN, and isotopologues of both molecules. This\nincludes the first ever detection of C$^{18}$O$^{16}$O and H$^{13}$CN in an\ninner disk, as well as tentative detections of C$^{17}$O$^{16}$O and\nHC$^{15}$N. Slab modeling provides molecular temperatures, column densities and\nemitting areas of the detected molecules. The emitting molecular gas is cold\ncompared to that of other observed protoplanetary disk spectra. We estimate the\nisotopologue ratios of CO$_2$ and HCN, albeit with significant uncertainty. We\nsuggest that the unusual spectrum of MY Lup arises from a combination of inner\ndisk clearing, which removes emission from warm water, and its nearly edge-on\ninclination, which enhances line-of-sight column densities, although unusual\nchemistry may also be required. MY Lup's spectrum highlights the potential to\ndetect and measure trace isotopologues to study isotopic fractionation in\nprotoplanetary disks; observations at higher spectral resolving power is needed\nto constrain the isotopologue ratios to greater precision.",

However, the\nsuccess of an on-demand platform that utilizes crowdsourcing relies on finding\na compensation policy that strikes a balance between creating attractive offers\nfor gig workers and ensuring profitability. In this work, we examine a dynamic\npricing problem for an on-demand platform that sets request-specific\ncompensation of gig workers in a discrete-time framework, where requests and\nworkers arrive stochastically. The operator's goal is to determine a\ncompensation policy that maximizes the total expected reward over the time\nhorizon. Our approach introduces compensation strategies that explicitly\naccount for gig worker request preferences. To achieve this, we employ the\nMultinomial Logit model to represent the acceptance probabilities of gig\nworkers, and, as a result, derive an analytical solution that utilizes\npost-decision states. Subsequently, we integrate this solution into an\napproximate dynamic programming algorithm. We compare our algorithm against\nbenchmark algorithms, including formula-based policies and an upper bound\nprovided by the full information linear programming solution. Our algorithm\ndemonstrates consistent performance across diverse settings, achieving\nimprovements of at least 2.5-7.5% in homogeneous gig worker populations and 9%\nin heterogeneous populations over benchmarks, based on fully synthetic data.\nFor real-world data, it surpasses benchmarks by 8% in weak and 20% in strong\nlocation preference scenarios.",

We detect H$_2$O in the atmospheres of KELT-8 b and KELT-23 Ab with an\nS/N = 6.6 and S/N = 4.2, respectively. The two retrievals indicate a water-rich\natmosphere for both targets.

Recently,\ndifferentiable display photometric stereo (DDPS) demonstrated improved normal\nreconstruction accuracy by using learned display patterns. However, DDPS faced\nlimitations in practicality, requiring a fixed desktop imaging setup using a\npolarization camera and a desktop-scale monitor. In this paper, we propose a\nmore practical physics-based photometric stereo, differentiable mobile display\nphotometric stereo (DMDPS), that leverages a mobile phone consisting of a\ndisplay and a camera. We overcome the limitations of using a mobile device by\ndeveloping a mobile app and method that simultaneously displays patterns and\ncaptures high-quality HDR images. Using this technique, we capture real-world\n3D-printed objects and learn display patterns via a differentiable learning\nprocess. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMDPS on both a 3D printed dataset\nand a first dataset of fallen leaves. The leaf dataset contains reconstructed\nsurface normals and albedos of fallen leaves that may enable future research\nbeyond computer graphics and vision. We believe that DMDPS takes a step forward\nfor practical physics-based photometric stereo.",

    "abstract": "Medical ultrasound has been widely used to examine vascular structure in\nmodern clinical practice. However, traditional ultrasound examination often\nfaces challenges related to inter- and intra-operator variation. The robotic\nultrasound system (RUSS) appears as a potential solution for such challenges\nbecause of its superiority in stability and reproducibility. Given the complex\nanatomy of human vasculature, multiple vessels often appear in ultrasound\nimages, or a single vessel bifurcates into branches, complicating the\nexamination process. To tackle this challenge, this work presents a gaze-guided\nRUSS for vascular applications. A gaze tracker captures the eye movements of\nthe operator. The extracted gaze signal guides the RUSS to follow the correct\nvessel when it bifurcates. Additionally, a gaze-guided segmentation network is\nproposed to enhance segmentation robustness by exploiting gaze information.\nHowever, gaze signals are often noisy, requiring interpretation to accurately\ndiscern the operator's true intentions. To this end, this study proposes a\nstabilization module to process raw gaze data. The inferred attention heatmap\nis utilized as a region proposal to aid segmentation and serve as a trigger\nsignal when the operator needs to adjust the scanning target, such as when a\nbifurcation appears. To ensure appropriate contact between the probe and\nsurface during scanning, an automatic ultrasound confidence-based orientation\ncorrection method is developed. In experiments, we demonstrated the efficiency\nof the proposed gaze-guided segmentation pipeline by comparing it with other\nmethods. Besides, the performance of the proposed gaze-guided RUSS was also\nvalidated as a whole on a realistic arm phantom with an uneven surface.",

    "abstract": "In the context of biology, unlike the comprehensively established Standard\nModel in physics, many biological processes lack a complete theoretical\nframework and are often described phenomenologically. A pertinent example is\nolfaction -- the process through which humans and animals distinguish various\nodors. The conventional biological explanation for olfaction relies on the lock\nand key model, which, while useful, does not fully account for all observed\nphenomena. As an alternative or complement to this model, vibration-assisted\nelectron tunneling has been proposed. Drawing inspiration from the\nvibration-assisted electron tunneling model for olfaction, we have developed a\ntheoretical model for electron tunneling in SARS-CoV-2 virus infection within a\nnon-Markovian framework. We approach this by solving the non-Markovian quantum\nstochastic Schrodinger equation. In our model, the spike protein and the GPCR\nreceptor are conceptualized as a dimer, utilizing the spin-Boson model to\nfacilitate the description of electron tunneling. Our analysis demonstrates\nthat electron tunneling in this context exhibits inherently non-Markovian\ncharacteristics, extending into the intermediate and strong coupling regimes\nbetween the dimer components. This behavior stands in stark contrast to\npredictions from Markovian models, which fail to accurately describe electron\ntunneling in the strong coupling limit. Notably, Markovian approximations often\nlead to unphysical negative probabilities in this regime, underscoring their\nlimitations and highlighting the necessity of incorporating non-Markovian\ndynamics for a more realistic description of biological quantum processes. This\napproach not only broadens our understanding of viral infection mechanisms but\nalso enhances the biological accuracy and relevance of our theoretical\nframework in describing complex biological interactions.",

Samples\nselected based on the luminosity of the SMBH would preferentially find overly\nmassive black holes relative to their host stellar mass, missing the population\nof lower-mass SMBHs that are underrepresented. Here we report the discovery of\n13 moderate-luminosity broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei from a galaxy-based\nselection of 52 massive galaxies at z~3-5. The derived SMBH masses for these\nAGNs yield a mean SMBH-to-stellar mass ratio of ~0.1%, consistent with the\nlocal value.

Four\nmethodologies were evaluated: Single Scale Method (SSM), Simple Upscaling\nMethod (SUM), Scale-Bridging Method (SBM), and Fully Resolved Model (FRM). SSM,\nthe simplest method, neglects microscale permeability and exhibited\npermeability values deviating by up to 150\\% of the FRM model, which was taken\nas ground truth at an equivalent lower fiber volume content. SUM improved\npredictions by considering uniform microscale permeability, yielding closer\nvalues under similar conditions, but still lacked structural variability.

    "abstract": "The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline (1300 km)\nneutrino experiment hosted at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL).\nIt aims to measure neutrino mass ordering and CP violation through neutrino\noscillations from a characterized muon neutrino beam. DUNE will deploy four\nLiquid-Argon Time-Projection-Chamber (LArTPC) detectors with a total mass of\napproximately 70 kT. The reconstruction of particle interactions, both from the\nbeam and external neutrino sources is achieved by collecting two distinct\ninteraction signals: ionization electrons with the Time Projection Chamber\n(TPC) and scintillation photons (127 nm) with the Photon Detection System\n(PDS). Regarding the latter, to fulfil the physics requirements of the\nexperiment, a uniform and efficient collection of the argon scintillation light\nacross the 62 m x 15 m x 14 m detector volume is required to achieve an average\ndetected light yield of at least 20 PE/MeV. For the case of DUNE's far detector\nmodule with vertical drift direction (FD-VD), the system relies on 672\nX-ARAPUCA (XA) tiles, which trap photons inside its highly reflective box by\nshifting VUV light to visible wavelengths. An intensive R&D campaign, involving\nmultiple international institutions, has optimized the design and component\nselection for the next-generation PDS modules, which have been tested in liquid\nargon using a dedicated cryogenic setup developed at CIEMAT to evaluate their\nphoton detection efficiency (PDE). Several configurations have been chosen to\nevaluate the possible design improvements in terms of different light-trapping\nstrategies and reflectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is crucial in the energy sector to identify irregular\npatterns indicating equipment failures, energy theft, or other issues. Machine\nlearning techniques for anomaly detection have achieved great success, but are\ntypically centralized, involving sharing local data with a central server which\nraises privacy and security concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining\npopularity as it enables distributed learning without sharing local data.\nHowever, FL depends on neural networks, which are vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks that manipulate data, leading models to make erroneous predictions.\nWhile adversarial attacks have been explored in the image domain, they remain\nlargely unexplored in time series problems, especially in the energy domain.\nMoreover, the effect of adversarial attacks in the FL setting is also mostly\nunknown. This paper assesses the vulnerability of FL-based anomaly detection in\nenergy data to adversarial attacks. Specifically, two state-of-the-art models,\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformers, are used to detect anomalies in\nan FL setting, and two white-box attack methods, Fast Gradient Sign Method\n(FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), are employed to perturb the data.\nThe results show that FL is more sensitive to PGD attacks than to FGSM attacks,\nattributed to PGD's iterative nature, resulting in an accuracy drop of over 10%\neven with naive, weaker attacks. Moreover, FL is more affected by these attacks\nthan centralized learning, highlighting the need for defense mechanisms in FL.",

Recent advances in 3D occupancy prediction have\nimproved scene representation but often suffer from visual inconsistencies,\nleading to floating artifacts and poor surface localization. Existing\nvoxel-wise losses (e.g., cross-entropy) fail to enforce visible geometric\ncoherence. In this paper, we propose GaussRender, a module that improves 3D\noccupancy learning by enforcing projective consistency. Our key idea is to\nproject both predicted and ground-truth 3D occupancy into 2D camera views,\nwhere we apply supervision. Our method penalizes 3D configurations that produce\ninconsistent 2D projections, thereby enforcing a more coherent 3D structure. To\nachieve this efficiently, we leverage differentiable rendering with Gaussian\nsplatting. GaussRender seamlessly integrates with existing architectures while\nmaintaining efficiency and requiring no inference-time modifications. Extensive\nevaluations on multiple benchmarks (SurroundOcc-nuScenes, Occ3D-nuScenes,\nSSCBench-KITTI360) demonstrate that GaussRender significantly improves\ngeometric fidelity across various 3D occupancy models (TPVFormer, SurroundOcc,\nSymphonies), achieving state-of-the-art results, particularly on\nsurface-sensitive metrics such as RayIoU.

The\nearly stages of atherosclerosis are driven by interactions between lipids and\nmonocyte-derived-macrophages (MDMs). The mechanisms that govern the spatial\ndistribution of lipids and MDMs in the lesion remain poorly understood. In this\npaper, we develop a spatially-resolved and lipid-structured model for early\natherosclerosis. The model development and analysis are guided by images of\nhuman coronary lesions by Nakashima et al. 2007. Consistent with their\nfindings, the model predicts that lipid initially accumulates deep in the\nintima due to a spatially non-uniform LDL retention capacity. The model also\nqualitatively reproduces the global internal maxima in the Nakashima images\nonly when the MDM mobility is sufficiently sensitive to lipid content, and MDM\nlifespan sufficiently insensitive. Introducing lipid content-dependence to MDM\nmobility and mean lifespan produced minimal impact on model behaviour at early\ntimes, but strongly impacted lesion composition at steady state. Increases to\nthe sensitivity of MDM lifespan to lipid content yield lesions with fewer MDMs,\nless total lesion lipid content and reduced mean MDM infiltration depth.\nIncreases to the sensitivity of MDM mobility to lipid content also reduces the\nMDM infiltration depth, but increases the proportion of lipid-laden MDMs. We\nfind that MDM lipid content increases with spatial depth, regardless of blood\nLDL and HDL content. These results shed light on the mechanisms that drive\nspatial variation in the composition of early atherosclerotic lesions, and the\nrole of macrophage lipid content in disease progression.",

However, existing simulators often lack high-level autonomy, hindering\ntheir immediate applicability to complex tasks such as autonomous navigation in\nunknown environments. This limitation stems from the challenge of integrating\nrealistic physics, photorealistic rendering, and diverse sensor modalities into\na single simulation environment. At the same time, the existing photorealistic\nUAV simulators use mostly hand-crafted environments with limited environment\nsizes, which prevents the testing of long-range missions. This restricts the\nusage of existing simulators to only low-level tasks such as control and\ncollision avoidance. To this end, we propose the novel FlightForge UAV\nopen-source simulator. FlightForge offers advanced rendering capabilities,\ndiverse control modalities, and, foremost, procedural generation of\nenvironments. Moreover, the simulator is already integrated with a fully\nautonomous UAV system capable of long-range flights in cluttered unknown\nenvironments. The key innovation lies in novel procedural environment\ngeneration and seamless integration of high-level autonomy into the simulation\nenvironment. Experimental results demonstrate superior sensor rendering\ncapability compared to existing simulators, and also the ability of autonomous\nnavigation in almost infinite environments.",

Prior work shows that such representations can be learned\nthrough contrastive learning if counterfactual supervision is available in\nobservational data. However, since counterfactuals are rare, other works have\nexplored using simulators that offer synthetic counterfactual supervision. Our\ngoal in this paper is to systematically analyze the role of simulators in\nestimating CATE. We analyze the CATE error of several baselines and highlight\ntheir limitations. We then establish a generalization bound that characterizes\nthe CATE error from jointly training on real and simulated distributions, as a\nfunction of the real-simulator mismatch. Finally, we introduce SimPONet, a\nnovel method whose loss function is inspired from our generalization bound. We\nfurther show how SimPONet adjusts the simulator's influence on the learning\nobjective based on the simulator's relevance to the CATE task.

In this work we consider a set of\n$N$ identical two-state systems that we call ``harmonic qubits'', because the\nkinetic part of their Hamiltonian is of the form $\\omega_0 \\sum_i a^\\dagger_i\na_i$, coupled through a multi-state ``photon'' mode subject to dissipation. It\nhas been proven numerically that when the coupling between the qubits and the\nphoton is sufficiently strong, the ensemble condenses into a ground state with\nnegative energy, the energy gap is proportional to $N$ and there are clear\ncross correlations $\\langle a^\\dagger_i a_j \\rangle$. Here we are interested\ninto the energy spectrum of the excited states of this system. In order to\nobtain information on this spectrum we introduce a weak coupling of each qubit\nwith an external oscillator of variable frequency $\\omega$ and we check via\nMonte Carlo time evolution for which values of $\\omega$ variations in the\noccupation of the external oscillator occur. After adding a second external\noscillator coupled to the first only through the $N$ qubits, we also look at\nthe energy transfer between the two external oscillators in dependence on their\nfrequency, a transfer which is possible only through the excited states of the\nqubits. We find that below the threshold of strong coupling between qubits and\nphoton mode (when the ground state energy $E_0$ is zero), the energy transfer\nonly occurs at frequencies close to the base frequency $\\omega_0$. On the other\nhand, above threshold (when $E_0<0$) one finds resonant transfer at frequencies\nwhich are definitely higher, and growing with $N$.

    "abstract": "In the present manuscript, we formulate a 3D mathematical model describing\nthe capture of a contaminant in an adsorption column. The novelty of our\napproach involves the description of mass transfer by adsorption via a\nnonlinear evolution equation defined on the surface of the porous media, while\nStokes flow and an advection-diffusion equation describe the contaminant\ntransport through the interstices. Simulations of 3D models with varying\nmicrostructures but identical porosity reveal a minimal impact of the\nmicrostructure on contaminant distribution within the column, particularly in\nthe radial direction. Using homogenization theory and a periodic\nmicrostructure, we rigorously derive a 1D adsorption model that matches the\nstandard form that is found in the literature, but contains two effective\ncoefficients, the dispersion and the permeability, that explicitly incorporate\nmicrostructural details of the porous medium. The 1D model closely reproduces\n3D results, the 1D concentration profiles closely match the cross-section\naveraged 3D profiles, and the outlet breakthrough curves are nearly identical.\nWe also demonstrate how the 3D simulations converge to the solution of the 1D\nmodel as the microstructure is refined. Consequently, our model offers a\ntheoretical foundation for the widely used 1D model, confirming its reliability\nfor investigating, optimizing, and aiding in the design of column adsorption\nprocesses for practical applications.",

The existing approaches, such as\nthe OSG algorithm, are often hindered by their poor approximation guarantees\nand the rigid requirement for a fully connected communication graph. To address\nthese challenges, we firstly present a $\\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ algorithm, which\nemploys the multi-linear extension to transfer the discrete submodular\nmaximization problem into a continuous optimization, thereby allowing us to\nreduce the strict dependence on a complete graph through consensus techniques.\nMoreover, $\\textbf{MA-OSMA}$ leverages a novel surrogate gradient to avoid\nsub-optimal stationary points. To eliminate the computationally intensive\nprojection operations in $\\textbf{MA-OSMA}$, we also introduce a\nprojection-free $\\textbf{MA-OSEA}$ algorithm, which effectively utilizes the KL\ndivergence by mixing a uniform distribution. Theoretically, we confirm that\nboth algorithms achieve a regret bound of\n$\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\frac{C_{T}T}{1-\\beta}})$ against a\n$(\\frac{1-e^{-c}}{c})$-approximation to the best comparator in hindsight, where\n$C_{T}$ is the deviation of maximizer sequence, $\\beta$ is the spectral gap of\nthe network and $c$ is the joint curvature of submodular objectives.

Specifically, the outer\nloop divides data into trusted and untrusted spaces, redirecting distillation\ntoward trusted samples to guarantee trust in the distillation process. This\nstep minimizes the impact of mislabeled samples on dataset distillation. The\ninner loop maximizes the distillation objective by recalibrating untrusted\nsamples, thus transforming them into valuable ones for distillation. This\ndual-loop iteratively refines and compensates for each other, gradually\nexpanding the trusted space and shrinking the untrusted space. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method can significantly improve the performance of\nexisting dataset distillation methods on three widely used benchmarks (CIFAR10,\nCIFAR100, and Tiny ImageNet) in three challenging mislabeled settings\n(symmetric, asymmetric, and real-world).",

For both filter types, we derive novel sufficient\nconditions that ensure the exponential stability of the filtered parameter path\nand the existence of a finite mean squared error (MSE) bound relative to the\npseudo-true parameter path. Our (non-)asymptotic MSE bounds rely on mild moment\nconditions on the data-generating process, while our stability results are\nagnostic about the true process. For the ISD filter, concavity of the\npostulated log density combined with simple parameter restrictions is\nsufficient to guarantee stability.

Inspired by this, we use simulation results to investigate the\nperformance drop when there is a mismatch between the signal model in the MUSIC\nalgorithm and the propagation regime. For direction of arrival (DOA)\nestimation, we consider the cases when the receiver is in the near-field region\nbut uses i) the near-field model, ii) the approximate near-field model (ANM)\nmodel, and iii) the far-field model to design the beamforming matrix in the\nMUSIC algorithm. We also consider the case when the receiver is in the\nfar-field region, and we use the correct far-field model to design the\nbeamforming matrix in the MUSIC algorithm. One contribution is that in the\nnear-field, we have quantified the loss in performance when the ANM and the\nfar-field model are used to create the beamforming matrix for the MUSIC\nalgorithm, causing a reduction in estimation accuracy compared to the case when\nthe correct near-field model is used to design the beamforming matrix. Another\nresult is that in the near-field, when we incorrectly assume that the receiver\nis in the far-field and subsequently use the far-field beamforming matrix, we\nunderestimate the DOA estimation error. Finally, we show that the MUSIC\nalgorithm can provide very accurate range estimates for distances less than the\nFraunhofer distance. This estimate gradually becomes inaccurate as the\ndistances exceed the Fraunhofer distance.",

This study aims\nto elucidate the origin of the continuum emission in Cen A and determine the\ngeometrical arrangement of matter in the nuclear region by the mean of optical\nand near-infrared spectropolarimetry. We obtained spectropolarimetric data of\nCen A using the VLT/FORS2. The analysis revealed a region showing strong and\nnarrow emission lines associated with AGN activity. After correction for\ninterstellar polarization in the dust lane (but not for starlight), the\nintrinsic polarization of the scattered AGN light exhibits a polarization\ndegree of 2-4%, decreasing from optical to near-infrared, associated with a\npolarization position angle perpendicular to the radio jet axis. We exclude the\npresence of hidden broad line in our polarized flux spectrum at more than 99%\nprobability. Narrow emission lines are found to be strongly polarized and\northogonal to the jet position angle. We demonstrate that a beamed synchrotron\njet, scattering onto the narrow line region (NLR) best fits all the\nobservational properties reported in this paper and the literature. In this\nmodel, the base of the NLR is obscured by a giant circumnuclear region and can\nonly become visible through perpendicular scattering onto the outermost part of\nthe NLR, naturally producing high polarization degrees and polarization angles\nperpendicular to the radio structure.

This paper introduces LITune, a\nnovel framework for end-to-end automatic tuning of Learned Index Structures.\nLITune employs an adaptive training pipeline equipped with a tailor-made Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL) approach to ensure stable and efficient tuning. To\naccommodate long-term dynamics arising from online tuning, we further enhance\nLITune with an on-the-fly updating mechanism termed the O2 system. These\ninnovations allow LITune to effectively capture state transitions in online\ntuning scenarios and dynamically adjust to changing data distributions and\nworkloads, marking a significant improvement over other tuning methods. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that LITune achieves up to a 98% reduction in\nruntime and a 17-fold increase in throughput compared to default parameter\nsettings given a selected Learned Index instance. These findings highlight\nLITune's effectiveness and its potential to facilitate broader adoption of LIS\nin real-world applications.",

However, existing works rely on priors about clean graphs or attacking\nstrategies, which are often heuristic and inconsistent. To achieve robust graph\nlearning over different types of evasion attacks and diverse datasets, we\ninvestigate this problem from a prior-free structure purification perspective.\nSpecifically, we propose a novel Diffusion-based Structure Purification\nframework named DiffSP, which creatively incorporates the graph diffusion model\nto learn intrinsic distributions of clean graphs and purify the perturbed\nstructures by removing adversaries under the direction of the captured\npredictive patterns without relying on priors. DiffSP is divided into the\nforward diffusion process and the reverse denoising process, during which\nstructure purification is achieved. To avoid valuable information loss during\nthe forward process, we propose an LID-driven nonisotropic diffusion mechanism\nto selectively inject noise anisotropically. To promote semantic alignment\nbetween the clean graph and the purified graph generated during the reverse\nprocess, we reduce the generation uncertainty by the proposed graph transfer\nentropy guided denoising mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperior robustness of DiffSP against evasion attacks.",

Understanding turbulent transport on spherical tokamaks (STs) is\nchallenging due to their unique geometry characteristics. ST40 hot ion plasmas\nare typically unstable to ion scale Trapped Electron Modes (TEMs) and\nUbiquitous Modes (UMs), driven from the kinetic response of trapped particles\nand passing ions, and electron scale Electron Temperature Gradient Modes (ETGs)\nat the edge of the plasma. A comparison between the linear unstable modes of\nthe gyro-kinetic code GS2 and the gyro-fluid code TGLF showed that both models\nagree to a satisfactory level. However, some discrepancy was observed at the\ncore of the plasma where a large fraction of beams ions exists, and\nelectromagnetic effects are potentially important. Turbulent fluxes were also\nobserved to be somewhat overpredicted with TGLF. The core heat ion transport is\nobserved to be close to neoclassical levels due to turbulence suppression from\nhigh rotation and fast ion stabilisation, while the edge region is dominated by\nanomalous transport in both ions and electrons. As a result, enhanced energy\nconfinement is observed in those plasmas driven by the reduced turbulent core\nregion and the confined beam ions. Fully predictive simulations using the ASTRA\ntransport solver coupled with SPIDER, NUBEAM, NCLASS and TGLF together with a\nnovel reduced scrape of layer (SOL) model for the simulation of the last closed\nflux surface (LCFS) boundary conditions was attempted.

However,\nachieving high rate-distortion performance while maintaining low computational\ncomplexity (\\ie, parameters, FLOPs, and latency) remains challenging. In this\npaper, we propose a hybrid Convolution and State Space Models (SSMs) based\nimage compression framework, termed \\textit{CMamba}, to achieve superior\nrate-distortion performance with low computational complexity. Specifically,\nCMamba introduces two key components: a Content-Adaptive SSM (CA-SSM) module\nand a Context-Aware Entropy (CAE) module. First, we observed that SSMs excel in\nmodeling overall content but tend to lose high-frequency details. In contrast,\nCNNs are proficient at capturing local details. Motivated by this, we propose\nthe CA-SSM module that can dynamically fuse global content extracted by SSM\nblocks and local details captured by CNN blocks in both encoding and decoding\nstages. As a result, important image content is well preserved during\ncompression. Second, our proposed CAE module is designed to reduce spatial and\nchannel redundancies in latent representations after encoding. Specifically,\nour CAE leverages SSMs to parameterize the spatial content in latent\nrepresentations. Benefiting from SSMs, CAE significantly improves spatial\ncompression efficiency while reducing spatial content redundancies. Moreover,\nalong the channel dimension, CAE reduces inter-channel redundancies of latent\nrepresentations via an autoregressive manner, which can fully exploit prior\nknowledge from previous channels without sacrificing efficiency. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that CMamba achieves superior rate-distortion performance.",

In this paper, we show that a particular\nchoice of the observer gain gives rise to passivity properties of the\ncontroller that are independent of the plant structure. Furthermore, we state\nconditions for the controller to have a port-Hamiltonian realization and show\nthat a model order reduction scheme can be deduced using the framework of\nnonlinear balanced truncation. In addition, we propose a novel passivity\npreserving discrete gradient scheme for the time discretization of passive\nsystems. To illustrate our results, we numerically realize the controller using\nthe policy iteration and compare it to a controller where the observer gain is\ngiven by the extended Kalman filter.",

The model is trained primarily on\nresting-state data from the evaluation dataset, without direct exposure to\ntheir exercise data. To address variability, DE-PADA incorporates ECG-specific\ninnovations, including heartbeat segmentation into the PQRS interval, known for\nits relative temporal consistency, and the heart rate-sensitive ST interval,\nenabling targeted feature extraction tailored to each region's unique\ncharacteristics. Personalized augmentation simulates subject-specific T-wave\nvariability across heart rates using individual T-wave peak predictions to\nadapt augmentation ranges. Domain adaptation further improves generalization by\nleveraging auxiliary data from supplementary subjects used exclusively for\ntraining, including both resting and exercise conditions. Experiments on the\nUniversity of Toronto ECG Database demonstrate the model's effectiveness.\nDE-PADA achieves relative improvements in post-exercise identification rates of\n26.75% in the initial recovery phase and 11.72% in the late recovery phase,\nwhile maintaining a 98.12% identification rate in the sitting position.

We introduce the concept of\nEinstein-Grassmann algebra as a superalgebra (defining a supermanifold) which\nis also an Einstein algebra. We employ this concept to confront the\nsupermanifold structure with the structure of strong singularity, the so-called\nmalicious singularity, in general relativity. Einstein-Grassmann algebras\nconsist of two parts: a part called body and a part called soul. For the body\npart, the singularity theorems apply and the singularities persist as the\nconclusions of the classical theorems on the existence of singularities\nrequire. We prove that, if we relax algebraical requirements, the soul part of\nthe algebra can survive the malicious singularity. In particular, we study the\nbehaviour of supercurves in the presence of malicious singularity.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents data for the physical aging of the three monoalcohols\n2-ethyl-1-butanol, 5-methyl-2-hexanol, and 1-phenyl-1-propanol. Aging is\nstudied by monitoring the dielectric loss at a fixed frequency in the kHz range\nfollowing temperature jumps of a few Kelvin's magnitude, starting from states\nof equilibrium. The three alcohols differ in the Debye relaxation strength and\nhow much the Debye process is separated from the $\\alpha$ process. We first\ndemonstrate that single-parameter aging describes all data well and proceed to\nutilize this fact to identify the linear-limit normalized aging relaxation\nfunctions. From the Laplace transform of these functions, the linear-limit\naging loss-peak angular frequency defines the inverse of the linear aging\nrelaxation time. This allows for a comparison to the temperature dependence of\nthe Debye and $\\alpha$ dielectric relaxation times of the three monoalcohols.\nWe conclude that the aging response for 5-methyl-2-hexanol and\n2-ethyl-1-butanol follows the $\\alpha$ relaxation, not the Debye process, while\nno firm conclusion can be reached for 1-phenyl-1-propanol because its Debye and\n$\\alpha$ processes are too close to be reliably distinguished.",

Reinforcement learning has enabled breakthroughs in complex\ngames such as Go and challenging robotics tasks such as quadrupedal locomotion.\n  A key aspect of intelligence is to not only make predictions, but reason\nabout the uncertainty in these predictions, and to consider this uncertainty\nwhen making decisions. This is what this manuscript on \"Probabilistic\nArtificial Intelligence\" is about. The first part covers probabilistic\napproaches to machine learning. We discuss the differentiation between\n\"epistemic\" uncertainty due to lack of data and \"aleatoric\" uncertainty, which\nis irreducible and stems, e.g., from noisy observations and outcomes. We\ndiscuss concrete approaches towards probabilistic inference and modern\napproaches to efficient approximate inference.\n  The second part of the manuscript is about taking uncertainty into account in\nsequential decision tasks. We consider active learning and Bayesian\noptimization -- approaches that collect data by proposing experiments that are\ninformative for reducing the epistemic uncertainty. We then consider\nreinforcement learning and modern deep RL approaches that use neural network\nfunction approximation.

Although the emerging deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) based dynamic channel access approach could achieve the Nash equilibrium\nunder fast-changing jamming attacks, it requires extensive training episodes.\nTo address this issue, we propose a fast adaptive anti-jamming channel access\napproach guided by the intuition of ``learning faster than the jammer\", where a\nsynchronously updated coarse-grained spectrum prediction serves as an auxiliary\ntask for the deep Q learning (DQN) based anti-jamming model.

    "abstract": "Model merging integrates the weights of multiple task-specific models into a\nsingle multi-task model. Despite recent interest in the problem, a significant\nperformance gap between the combined and single-task models remains. In this\npaper, we investigate the key characteristics of task matrices -- weight update\nmatrices applied to a pre-trained model -- that enable effective merging. We\nshow that alignment between singular components of task-specific and merged\nmatrices strongly correlates with performance improvement over the pre-trained\nmodel. Based on this, we propose an isotropic merging framework that flattens\nthe singular value spectrum of task matrices, enhances alignment, and reduces\nthe performance gap. Additionally, we incorporate both common and task-specific\nsubspaces to further improve alignment and performance. Our proposed approach\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on vision and language tasks across\nvarious sets of tasks and model scales. This work advances the understanding of\nmodel merging dynamics, offering an effective methodology to merge models\nwithout requiring additional training.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), address this challenge by introducing additional\nadaptation parameters into pre-trained weight matrices. However, LoRA's\nperformance varies across different insertion points within the model,\nhighlighting potential parameter inefficiency due to unnecessary insertions. To\nthis end, we propose SSMLoRA (State Space Model Low-Rank Adaptation), an\nextension of LoRA that incorporates a State Space Model (SSM) to interconnect\nlow-rank matrices. SSMLoRA ensures that performance is maintained even with\nsparser insertions. SSMLoRA allows the model to not only map inputs to a\nlow-rank space for better feature extraction but also leverage the computations\nfrom the previous low-rank space. Our method achieves comparable performance to\nLoRA on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark while\nusing only half the parameters. Additionally, due to its structure, SSMLoRA\nshows promise in handling tasks with longer input sequences. .You can find our\ncode here:https://github.com/yuhkalhic/SSMLoRA.",

We\npresent observations of multiple methanol and formaldehyde transitions toward\nthe Herbig Ae disk HD 100546 obtained with ALMA, building upon the previous\nserendipitous detection of methanol in this source. We find that methanol has a\nhigher rotational temperature ($T_\\mathrm{rot}$) than formaldehyde towards both\nthe centrally concentrated emission component in the inner disk ($0-110$ au)\nand a radially separate dust ring farther out in the disk ($180-260$ au).\n$T_\\mathrm{rot}$ decreases for methanol and formaldehyde from the inner\n($152^{+35}_{-27}$ K and $76^{+9}_{-8}$ K) to the outer disk ($52^{+8}_{-6}$ K\nand $31^{+2}_{-2}$ K), suggesting that we are tracing two different chemical\nenvironments. $T_\\mathrm{rot}$ for both species in the inner disk is consistent\nwith thermal desorption as the origin, while the outer disk reservoir is driven\nby non-thermal desorption. The CH$_3$OH/H$_2$CO column density ratio decreases\nfrom $14.6^{+5.2}_{-4.6}$ in the inner disk to $1.3^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ in the outer\ndisk, consistent with modelling predictions.

    "abstract": "The universal relations in neutron stars form an essential entity to\nunderstand their properties. The moment of inertia, dimensionless tidal\ndeformability, mass quadrupole moment, and oscillation modes are some of the\nproperties that have been studied previously in the context of universal\nrelations. All of these quantities are measurable; thus, analyzing them is of\nutmost importance. In this article we provide new universal relations in the\ncontext of a neutron star's gravitational redshift. Using the redshift\nmeasurements of RBS 1223, RX J0720.4-3125, and RX J1856.5-3754, we provide\ntheoretical estimates of moment of inertia, dimensionless tidal deformability,\nmass quadrupole moment, the mass of the star times the ratio of angular\nfrequency over the spin angular moment, and the average of the speed of sound\nsquared. In the case of the redshift measurement of RX J0720.4-3125, we found\nthat the theoretical estimate using universal relations aligns closely with the\nBayesian estimate. Our findings indicate that such theoretical predictions are\nhighly reliable for observations with low uncertainty and can be used as an\nalternative for statistical analysis. Additionally, we report a violation of\nthe universality of the dimensionless tidal deformability and average of the\nspeed of sound squared with respect to the gravitational redshift. Our\ncalculations further indicate that, under current astrophysical constraints,\nthe maximum gravitational redshift attainable by neutron stars does not exceed\n$0.763$.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian hierarchical Poisson models are an essential tool for analyzing\ncount data. However, designing efficient algorithms to sample from the\nposterior distribution of the target parameters remains a challenging task for\nthis class of models. Auxiliary mixture sampling algorithms have been proposed\nto address this issue. They involve two steps of data augmentations: the first\nleverages the theory of Poisson processes, and the second approximates the\nresidual distribution of the resulting model through a mixture of Gaussian\ndistributions. In this way, an approximated Gibbs sampler is obtained. In this\npaper, we focus on the accuracy of the approximation step, highlighting\nscenarios where the mixture fails to accurately represent the true underlying\ndistribution, leading to a lack of convergence in the algorithm. We outline key\nfeatures to monitor, in order to assess if the approximation performs as\nintended. Building on this, we propose a robust version of the auxiliary\nmixture sampling algorithm, which can detect approximation failures and\nincorporate a Metropolis-Hastings step when necessary. Finally, we evaluate the\nproposed algorithm together with the original mixture sampling algorithms on\nboth simulated and real datasets.",

While\ndwell-time alleviates a part of the Midas touch problem (referring to the fact\nthat an element fixed by the user will be activated even if it was not intended\nto do so), it doesn't completely remove it: users should not gaze too long on\nan item, or they may trigger an unintended activation.

This\ninteraction allows users' gaze to rest in areas that don't have crossing\ntriggers, and it removes the need to pause in the interaction.

The subsystem operator algebras are finite dimensional and correspond\nto a UV cutoff $1 + 1$ dimensional field theory of fermions living on a\n\"stretched horizon\" near each diamond's holographic screen. The fields can be\nthought of as fluctuations of solutions of the screen's Dirac operator around\nthat of the background geometry, expanded up to a maximal Dirac eigenvalue\ndetermined by the Carlip-Solodukhin relation between area and central charge.\nThis cutoff renders the screen geometry \"fuzzy\". Quantum dynamics is defined in\na Hilbert bundle over the space of time-like geodesics on the background\ngeometry. A nesting of diamonds along a given geodesic defines a series of\nunitary embedding maps of diamond Hilbert spaces into each other, analogous to\nhalf sided modular flows in quantum field theory. These can be extended into a\nconsistent set of unitary maps of each fiber Hilbert space into itself by a\nquantum version of the principle of relativity. According to the QPR, the\nlargest diamond in the overlap between any two diamonds is identified with a\ntensor factor in each individual diamond Hilbert space, and must have the a\ndensity matrix with the same entanglement spectrum no matter which fiber\ndynamics is used to compute it.

In this paper, we initially investigate the role of LoRAs in the\ndenoising process through the lens of the Fourier frequency domain. Based on\nthe hypothesis that applying multiple LoRAs could lead to \"semantic conflicts\",\nwe find that certain LoRAs amplify high-frequency features such as edges and\ntextures, whereas others mainly focus on low-frequency elements, including the\noverall structure and smooth color gradients. Building on these insights, we\ndevise a frequency domain based sequencing strategy to determine the optimal\norder in which LoRAs should be integrated during inference. This strategy\noffers a methodical and generalizable solution compared to the naive\nintegration commonly found in existing LoRA fusion techniques. To fully\nleverage our proposed LoRA order sequence determination method in multi-LoRA\ncomposition tasks, we introduce a novel, training-free framework, Cached\nMulti-LoRA (CMLoRA), designed to efficiently integrate multiple LoRAs while\nmaintaining cohesive image generation. With its flexible backbone for\nmulti-LoRA fusion and a non-uniform caching strategy tailored to individual\nLoRAs, CMLoRA has the potential to reduce semantic conflicts in LoRA\ncomposition and improve computational efficiency.

Among the various ab initio methods, linear response time-dependent\ndensity functional theory (LR-TDDFT) is a key framework for simulating the DSF.\nThe standard approach in LR-TDDFT for computing the DSF relies on the orbital\nrepresentation.

The observed\nquadratic dependence originates from chiral next-nearest-neighbor hopping\nprocesses that acquire magnetic-exchange-driven Zeeman energies and\nHaldane-like chiral flux phases.

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has emerged as a promising tool for\nidentifying physiological changes associated with neuropsychiatric conditions.\nThe relationship between cardiovascular health and neuropsychiatric disorders\nsuggests that ECG abnormalities could serve as valuable biomarkers for more\nefficient detection, therapy monitoring, and risk stratification. However, the\npotential of the ECG to accurately distinguish neuropsychiatric conditions,\nparticularly among diverse patient populations, remains underexplored. This\nstudy utilized ECG markers and basic demographic data to predict\nneuropsychiatric conditions using machine learning models, with targets defined\nthrough ICD-10 codes. Both internal and external validation were performed\nusing the MIMIC-IV and ECG-View datasets respectively. Performance was assessed\nusing AUROC scores. To enhance model interpretability, Shapley values were\napplied to provide insights into the contributions of individual ECG features\nto the predictions. Significant predictive performance was observed for\nconditions within the neurological and psychiatric groups. For the neurological\ngroup, Alzheimer's disease (G30) achieved an internal AUROC of 0.813\n(0.812-0.814) and an external AUROC of 0.868 (0.867-0.868). In the psychiatric\ngroup, unspecified dementia (F03) showed an internal AUROC of 0.849\n(0.848-0.849) and an external AUROC of 0.862 (0.861-0.863). Discriminative\nfeatures align with known ECG markers but also provide hints on potentially new\nmarkers. ECG offers significant promise for diagnosing and monitoring\nneuropsychiatric conditions, with robust predictive performance across internal\nand external cohorts. Future work should focus on addressing potential\nconfounders, such as therapy-related cardiotoxicity, and expanding the scope of\nECG applications, including personalized care and early intervention\nstrategies.",

    "abstract": "New regulations are introduced to ensure software development aligns with\nethical concerns and protects public safety. Showing compliance requires\ntracing requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a key\ntask where engineers must analyze technical requirements against target\nartifacts, often within limited time. Manually analyzing complex systems with\nhundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension adds challenges\nthat increase effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions\nbased on language models, including large ones (LLMs). The first solution,\nKashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers and semantic\nsimilarity. The second solution, RICE_LRT, prompts a recent generative LLM\nbased on RICE, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we\nempirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against five different baseline\nclassifiers from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with a recall\nof 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline\nby a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen,\nmore complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average\nrecall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%.\nOn the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of\n84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%. RICE achieved\na remarkable improvement of 47.5 pp over Kashif in terms of F2 score. Our\nresults suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be\nsimply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize\nand fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to\ngenerative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising\nalternative.",

This morphology arises from the interaction between\nthe diffuse radio-emitting plasma and the surrounding environment. Sometimes\nrevived fossil plasma is found in galaxy clusters, tracing old active galactic\nnucleus ejecta with a very steep spectrum re-energized through processes in the\nICM, unrelated to the progenitor galaxy. We aim to study the central region of\nAbell 1775, a galaxy cluster in an unclear dynamical state at z = 0.072. It\nhosts two giant radio-loud elliptical galaxies, the head-tail radio galaxy that\n\"breaks\" at the position of a cold front detected in the X-rays, filamentary\nrevived fossil plasma, and central diffuse emission. This study aims to\ninvestigate and constrain the spectral properties and trends along the\nhead-tail, as well as the revived fossil plasma, to better understand the\nformation process of the non-thermal phenomena in A1775. We make use of LOFAR\n(144 MHz), and new deep uGMRT observations (400 and 650 MHz). We observe an\noverall steepening along the tail of the head-tail radio galaxy. In the radio\ncolour-colour diagram, ageing models reproduce the emission of the head-tail.\nAn unexpected brightness increase at the head of the tail suggests a complex\nbending of the jets. We derived the equipartition magnetic field and minimum\npressure along the tail. We recovered the structure of the revived fossil\nplasma, which appears as thin filaments with ultra-steep spectra. We show that\nhigh-sensitivity, high-resolution observations at low frequencies are essential\nfor detecting the full extent of the tail, enabling a deeper spectral analysis\nand resolving the structure and spectral properties of revived fossil plasma.",

To ensure\nthe accuracy of sensing while preventing the eavesdropping, a base station\ntransmits a signal consisting of information symbols and sensing waveform, in\nwhich the sensing waveform can be also used as artificial noise to interfere\nwith eavesdroppers. Under this setup, we propose an alternating\noptimization-based two stage scheme (AO-TSS) for improving the sensing and\ncommunication performance. In the first stage, based on the assumptions that\nthe perfect channel state information (CSI) of the AE and statistical CSI of\nthe PE are known, the communication and sensing beamforming problem is\nformulated with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of the beampattern\nmatching mean squared error (MSE) and cross-correlation, subject to the secure\ntransmission constraint. To tackle the non-convexity, we propose a\nsemi-definite relaxation (SDR) algorithm and a reduced-complexity zero-forcing\n(ZF) algorithm. Then, the scenarios are further extended to more general cases\nwith imperfect AE CSI and unknown PE CSI. To further improve the communication\nperformance, the second-stage problem is developed to optimize the secrecy rate\nthreshold under the radar performance constraint. Finally, numerical results\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of sensing and\nsecure communication.",

There have\nbeen different realizations of bolometers using superconducting thin films,\nnanowires, quantum dots, and various 2D materials in the recent past. The\nchallenge is to have a single device that combines high sensitivity, broad\nbandwidth, a fast readout mechanism, and low noise. Here we demonstrate the\nfirst usage of a Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) as a highly sensitive\nbolometer. Our key finding is the Kerr non-linearity of the JPA boosts the\ndevice's sensitivity. When the bolometer is biased in the non-linear regime, it\nenhances the sideband signals (~100 times), resulting in an order of magnitude\nimprovement in sensitivity compared to the linear regime. In the non-linear\nbiasing of the device, we achieve a NEP~500 aW/sqrt(Hz). Our bolometer offers a\nfast detection scheme with a thermal time constant of 4.26 us and an intrinsic\nJPA time constant of 70 ns. Our device's broadband and fast operation are key\nand new compared to previously studied graphene-based bolometers. In our\ndevice, the gate voltage tunability and the possibility of multiplexing\ncombined with the sensitive bolometric performance offer an opportunity for\nintegrated quantum sensor arrays.

Although pansharpening in the frequency domain\noffers clear advantages, most existing methods either continue to operate\nsolely in the spatial domain or fail to fully exploit the benefits of the\nfrequency domain. To address this issue, we innovatively propose\nMulti-Frequency Fusion Attention (MFFA), which leverages wavelet transforms to\ncleanly separate frequencies and enable lossless reconstruction across\ndifferent frequency domains. Then, we generate Frequency-Query, Spatial-Key,\nand Fusion-Value based on the physical meanings represented by different\nfeatures, which enables a more effective capture of specific information in the\nfrequency domain. Additionally, we focus on the preservation of frequency\nfeatures across different operations. On a broader level, our network employs a\nwavelet pyramid to progressively fuse information across multiple scales.\nCompared to previous frequency domain approaches, our network better prevents\nconfusion and loss of different frequency features during the fusion process.\nQuantitative and qualitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that\nour method outperforms existing approaches and shows significant generalization\ncapabilities for real-world scenarios.",

Here, we\ninvestigate spin orientation in MAPbI3 lead halide perovskite crystals at the\ncryogenic temperature of 1.6 K, where the material has an orthorhombic crystal\nstructure. The recombination and spin dynamics of excitons and carriers are\nmeasured by time-resolved photoluminescence after circularly polarized\nexcitation. The optical orientation of excitons reaches 85\\%, which persists\nwithin their lifetime of 15-80 ps. This high orientation is maintained for\nexcitation laser detunings from the exciton resonance to higher energies by up\nto 0.3 eV, then decreases and vanishes above 1.5 eV detuning. This indicates\nthat the Dyakonov-Perel spin relaxation mechanism based on inversion symmetry\nbreaking is inactive in MAPbI3 crystals with orthorhombic symmetry. The optical\norientation of localized and spatially-separated electrons and holes results in\n40\\% circular polarization of their emission. Their contributions can be\nidentified from the complex spin beats dynamics in transverse magnetic field.\nThe dynamics analysis gives values of the Land\\'e g-factors of 2.83 for\nelectrons and 0.54 for holes. Also, the magnetic-field-induced polarization of\nexcitons and carriers is analyzed in magnetic fields up to 6 T, showing that\ntheir spin relaxation times are longer than their lifetimes. Namely, for the\nexcitons, the spin relaxation time exceeds the lifetime by a factor of 6. We\nmodel the dynamics of optical orientation degree for cumulative contributions\nof excitons and carriers and show that the exciton recombination dynamics can\ncontrol these dynamics. The polarized emission of excitons and localized\ncarriers, produced by their polarization on Zeeman-split levels in magnetic\nfields, is modeled.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a foundational model for brain dynamics that utilizes stochastic\noptimal control (SOC) and amortized inference. Our method features a\ncontinuous-discrete state space model (SSM) that can robustly handle the\nintricate and noisy nature of fMRI signals. To address computational\nlimitations, we implement an approximation strategy grounded in the SOC\nframework. Additionally, we present a simulation-free latent dynamics approach\nthat employs locally linear approximations, facilitating efficient and scalable\ninference. For effective representation learning, we derive an Evidence Lower\nBound (ELBO) from the SOC formulation, which integrates smoothly with recent\nadvancements in self-supervised learning (SSL), thereby promoting robust and\ntransferable representations. Pre-trained on extensive datasets such as the\nUKB, our model attains state-of-the-art results across a variety of downstream\ntasks, including demographic prediction, trait analysis, disease diagnosis, and\nprognosis. Moreover, evaluating on external datasets such as HCP-A, ABIDE, and\nADHD200 further validates its superior abilities and resilience across\ndifferent demographic and clinical distributions. Our foundational model\nprovides a scalable and efficient approach for deciphering brain dynamics,\nopening up numerous applications in neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Maximizing the spectral gap through graph rewiring has been proposed to\nenhance the performance of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) by\naddressing over-squashing. However, as we show, minimizing the spectral gap can\nalso improve generalization. To explain this, we analyze how rewiring can\nbenefit GNNs within the context of stochastic block models. Since spectral gap\noptimization primarily influences community strength, it improves performance\nwhen the community structure aligns with node labels. Building on this insight,\nwe propose three distinct rewiring strategies that explicitly target community\nstructure, node labels, and their alignment: (a) community structure-based\nrewiring (ComMa), a more computationally efficient alternative to spectral gap\noptimization that achieves similar goals; (b) feature similarity-based rewiring\n(FeaSt), which focuses on maximizing global homophily; and (c) a hybrid\napproach (ComFy), which enhances local feature similarity while preserving\ncommunity structure to optimize label-community alignment. Extensive\nexperiments confirm the effectiveness of these strategies and support our\ntheoretical insights.",

Most current Byzantine defenses share a common inductive bias: among\nall the gradients, the densely distributed ones are more likely to be honest.\nHowever, such a bias is a poison to Byzantine robustness due to a newly\ndiscovered phenomenon in this paper - gradient skew. We discover that a group\nof densely distributed honest gradients skew away from the optimal gradient\n(the average of honest gradients) due to heterogeneous data. This gradient skew\nphenomenon allows Byzantine gradients to hide within the densely distributed\nskewed gradients. As a result, Byzantine defenses are confused into believing\nthat Byzantine gradients are honest. Motivated by this observation, we propose\na novel skew-aware attack called STRIKE: first, we search for the skewed\ngradients; then, we construct Byzantine gradients within the skewed gradients.\nExperiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our\nattack",

    "abstract": "The gradient descent (GD) has been one of the most common optimizer in\nmachine learning. In particular, the loss landscape of a neural network is\ntypically sharpened during the initial phase of training, making the training\ndynamics hover on the edge of stability. This is beyond our standard\nunderstanding of GD convergence in the stable regime where arbitrarily chosen\nstepsize is sufficiently smaller than the edge of stability. Recently, Wu et\nal. (COLT2024) have showed that GD converges with arbitrary stepsize under\nlinearly separable logistic regression. Although their analysis hinges on the\nself-bounding property of the logistic loss, which seems to be a cornerstone to\nestablish a modified descent lemma, our pilot study shows that other loss\nfunctions without the self-bounding property can make GD converge with\narbitrary stepsize. To further understand what property of a loss function\nmatters in GD, we aim to show arbitrary-stepsize GD convergence for a general\nloss function based on the framework of \\emph{Fenchel--Young losses}. We\nessentially leverage the classical perceptron argument to derive the\nconvergence rate for achieving $\\epsilon$-optimal loss, which is possible for a\nmajority of Fenchel--Young losses. Among typical loss functions, the Tsallis\nentropy achieves the GD convergence rate $T=\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$, and the\nR{\\'e}nyi entropy achieves the far better rate $T=\\Omega(\\epsilon^{-1/3})$. We\nargue that these better rate is possible because of \\emph{separation margin} of\nloss functions, instead of the self-bounding property.",

Here we consider a multi-band,\nnon-Hermitian ladder model with the two legs being the nonreciprocal\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger chains. We thoroughly study how the non-Abelian geometry,\ntopology, and dynamics emerge in this model at the onset of inter-leg coupling.\nUnder periodic boundary conditions, by defining a gauge-invariant winding\nnumber for chiral symmetric systems, we analytically give the exact topological\nphase diagram. With the aid of underlying symmetries generalized for\nnon-Hermitian systems, we further refine the phase diagram by the geometry of\nband structure. In the pseudo-Hermitian symmetric regime, we find that the\nstable non-Abelian dynamics of a Bloch state under an external constant force\ncan be well described in some conditions of the force by the Wilson line\nconstructed for non-Hermitian systems. Under open boundary conditions, we also\nfind that the bulk-boundary correspondence survives in the thermodynamic limit\nbut breaks down for finite-size systems with the leg-dependent non-Hermitian\nskin effect (NHSE), demonstrating the so-called critical NHSE, of which the\ndecaying length of the bulk skin modes $\\xi$ varies with the system size $L$\nand is numerically verified to satisfy the scale-free power law $\\xi\\propto L$.\nOur work may stimulate more focuses on the non-Abelian properties of the\nnon-Hermitian/open quantum systems.",

The former mechanism\ngives rise to non-monotonic temperature dependence in a wide range of electron\ndensity and, in some cases, a sign reversal of Hall resistivity as the\ntemperature decreases. On the other hand, the latter mechanism is responsible\nfor the sign reversal of Hall conductivity in the high field, which sign\nreversal generally occurs in magnets with antiferromagnetic interactions.

To be precise, starting from\nmany-body quantum mechanics, where the problem is linear and regular but\ninvolving non commutative operators, we justify the emergence of the $\\Phi^4_3$\nmeasure as a semiclassical limit which captures the formation of Bose--Einstein\ncondensation just above the critical temperature. We employ and develop several\ntools from both stochastic quantization and many-body quantum mechanics.

Further increase of the temperature forces\nthe conductance to grow again due to the Gurzhi effect, associated with the\ncrossover from ballistic to hydrodynamic transport.

    "abstract": "A common goal of mechanistic interpretability is to decompose the activations\nof neural networks into features: interpretable properties of the input\ncomputed by the model. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are a popular method for\nfinding these features in LLMs, and it has been postulated that they can be\nused to find a \\textit{canonical} set of units: a unique and complete list of\natomic features. We cast doubt on this belief using two novel techniques: SAE\nstitching to show they are incomplete, and meta-SAEs to show they are not\natomic. SAE stitching involves inserting or swapping latents from a larger SAE\ninto a smaller one. Latents from the larger SAE can be divided into two\ncategories: \\emph{novel latents}, which improve performance when added to the\nsmaller SAE, indicating they capture novel information, and\n\\emph{reconstruction latents}, which can replace corresponding latents in the\nsmaller SAE that have similar behavior. The existence of novel features\nindicates incompleteness of smaller SAEs. Using meta-SAEs -- SAEs trained on\nthe decoder matrix of another SAE -- we find that latents in SAEs often\ndecompose into combinations of latents from a smaller SAE, showing that larger\nSAE latents are not atomic. The resulting decompositions are often\ninterpretable; e.g. a latent representing ``Einstein'' decomposes into\n``scientist'', ``Germany'', and ``famous person''. Even if SAEs do not find\ncanonical units of analysis, they may still be useful tools. We suggest that\nfuture research should either pursue different approaches for identifying such\nunits, or pragmatically choose the SAE size suited to their task.

    "abstract": "Class incremental learning aims to enable models to learn from sequential,\nnon-stationary data streams across different tasks without catastrophic\nforgetting. In class incremental semantic segmentation (CISS), the semantic\ncontent of image pixels evolves over incremental phases, known as semantic\ndrift. In this work, we identify two critical challenges in CISS that\ncontribute to semantic drift and degrade performance. First, we highlight the\nissue of separate optimization, where different parts of the model are\noptimized in distinct incremental stages, leading to misaligned probability\nscales. Second, we identify noisy semantics arising from inappropriate\npseudo-labeling, which results in sub-optimal results. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel and effective approach, Image Posterior and\nSemantics Decoupling for Segmentation (IPSeg). IPSeg introduces two key\nmechanisms: (1) leveraging image posterior probabilities to align optimization\nacross stages and mitigate the effects of separate optimization, and (2)\nemploying semantics decoupling to handle noisy semantics and tailor learning\nstrategies for different semantics. Extensive experiments on the Pascal VOC\n2012 and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that IPSeg achieves superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging long-term\nincremental scenarios.",

Methods for detecting AI-generated media have evolved rapidly,\nparalleling the advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).\nCurrent detection approaches can be categorized into two main groups:\nNon-MLLM-based and MLLM-based methods. The former employs high-precision,\ndomain-specific detectors powered by deep learning techniques, while the latter\nutilizes general-purpose detectors based on MLLMs that integrate authenticity\nverification, explainability, and localization capabilities. Despite\nsignificant progress in this field, there remains a gap in literature regarding\na comprehensive survey that examines the transition from domain-specific to\ngeneral-purpose detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by providing a\nsystematic review of both approaches, analyzing them from single-modal and\nmulti-modal perspectives. We present a detailed comparative analysis of these\ncategories, examining their methodological similarities and differences.\nThrough this analysis, we explore potential hybrid approaches and identify key\nchallenges in forgery detection, providing direction for future research.\nAdditionally, as MLLMs become increasingly prevalent in detection tasks,\nethical and security considerations have emerged as critical global concerns.\nWe examine the regulatory landscape surrounding Generative AI (GenAI) across\nvarious jurisdictions, offering valuable insights for researchers and\npractitioners in this field.",

We present an integrated approach called Invariant Image\nReparameterisation (IIR) that incorporates key elements of these methods in a\nnew way. Our approach replaces symbolic computations with numerical\ncalculations at a single reference estimate and an invariance condition that\ndetermines when this local calculation holds globally. Parameter combinations\ndetermined by this method are naturally ordered by degree of identifiability,\nand this supports model reduction by replacing a practically non-identified\nmodel with a structurally non-identified approximate model. This approximate\nmodel can be further parameterised in terms of identified parameters only. By\ntreating parameter combinations determined by our approach as interest\nparameters within our established likelihood-based Profile-Wise Analysis (PWA)\nframework, we incorporate uncertainty quantification in terms of likelihood\nprofiles and confidence sets.

We present several\nanalytical expressions for the localization length, which is proportional to\nthe inverse of the electric field. Using the density matrix renormalization\ngroup numerical technique, we observe that the ground state exhibits a decrease\nof the occupation on the chain sites from the `bulk', with occupation 1, to the\nvacuum, with occupation 0. The width of this intermediate `edge' region is also\ninversely proportional to the electric field, increasing linearly with the\nstrength of the nearest-neighbor repulsion. For strong interactions, the\noccupations in the intermediate region exhibit a charge density wave. We also\npresent the local density of states for sites in the `edge' region. For the\nnon-interacting case, the spectrum shows an increasing energy-localized\nstructure as the field is increased, which is a consequence of the uniform\nenergy distribution of the localized states (Wannier-Stark ladder). This\nstructure survives for small interactions, and it smears out in the strongly\ninteracting limit.

Theoretically, we show that $TAR^2$ (i) aligns\nwith potential-based reward shaping, preserving the same optimal policies as\nthe original environment, and (ii) maintains policy gradient update directions\nidentical to those under the original sparse reward, ensuring unbiased credit\nsignals. Empirical results on two challenging benchmarks, SMACLite and Google\nResearch Football, demonstrate that $TAR^2$ significantly stabilizes and\naccelerates convergence, outperforming strong baselines like AREL and STAS in\nboth learning speed and final performance.

Using computational fluid dynamic simulations of the blast\nwave resulting from energy deposition in the interelectrode volume during the\nnanosecond pulse, we analyze the various sources of vorticity during the\npost-discharge period. The non-uniform strength of the leading shock of the\nblast wave is found to be the primary promoter of vorticity. Other sources,\nsuch as the barocline torque, play a secondary role in explaining the overall\nrecirculation pattern. In addition, the discharge cooling mechanisms are also\ninvestigated. The cooling regimes and their efficiencies are classified\naccording to the discharge parameters, such as the inter-electrode gap, the\ninitial kernel temperature, or the frequency of repetitive pulses. Finally, a\nphysics-based, non-dimensional number PI* , equal to the ratio of the initial\nkernel temperature to the ambient temperature, is introduced.

Although\nBP runs in linear time using real arithmetic operations, recent research\nindicates that it requires non-trivial computational complexity using more\nrefined complexity measures.\n  Moitra, Mossel, and Sandon demonstrated such complexity by constructing a\nMarkov chain for which estimating the root better than random guessing (for\ntypical inputs) is $NC^1$-complete. Kohler and Mossel constructed chains where,\nfor trees with $N$ leaves, achieving better-than-random root recovery requires\npolynomials of degree $N^{\\Omega(1)}$.

These calculations are essential for analyzing\ncomplex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation\nprobabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where\nexact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition\nto these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for\noptimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task\nin the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem\n1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a\nmatrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a\nrecursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with\nvarying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems.\nTogether, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global\nentanglement, Shannon-R\\'enyi entropies, formation probabilities, and\nperforming efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the\ncomputational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we\nutilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy,\nreflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes\nwith conformal field theory predictions.",

    "abstract": "According to the von Laue condition, the volume integral of the proper\npressure inside isolated particles with a fixed structure and finite mass\nvanishes in the Minkowski limit of general relativity. In this work, we\nconsider a simple illustrative example: nonstandard static global monopoles\nwith finite energy, for which the von Laue condition is satisfied when the\nproper pressure is integrated over the whole space. We demonstrate, however,\nthat the absolute value of this integral, when calculated up to a finite\ndistance from the center of the global monopole, generally deviates from zero\nby no more than the energy located outside the specified volume (under the\nassumption of the dominant energy condition). Furthermore, we find that the\nmaximum deviation from unity of the ratio between the volume averages of the\non-shell Lagrangian and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor cannot exceed\nthree times the outer energy fraction. Extending these results to real\nparticles, we demonstrate that these constraints generally hold for finite-mass\nsystems with fixed structure, including stable atomic nuclei, provided the\ndominant energy condition is satisfied. Specifically, we show that, except in\nextremely dense environments with energy densities comparable to that of the\nparticles themselves, the volume average of the aforementioned ratio must be\nextremely close to unity. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our\nfindings for the form of the on-shell Lagrangian of real fluids, which is often\na crucial element for accurately modeling the dynamics of the gravity and\nmatter, especially in scenarios involving nonminimal couplings to other matter\nfields or gravity. We find that, in general, the ideal gas on-shell Lagrangian\nprovides an accurate approximation of the true on-shell Lagrangian, even for\nnonideal gases with significant interparticle interactions.",

To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided\nDiffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset\ncontaining 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos\nwith fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT,\nsupports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating\nlearning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent\nreference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended\nsequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to\ngenerate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static\nimages or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose\ntransfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior\nperformance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse\nscenarios.",

This\nletter proposes a novel UAV-based cell-free mMIMO framework that leverages\ndistributed UAV-APs to serve UEs while addressing the capacity constraints of\nwireless fronthaul links. We evaluate functional split Options 7.2 and 8 for\nthe fronthaul links, aiming to maximize the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among the UEs and minimize the\npower consumption by optimizing the transmit powers of UAV-APs and selectively\nactivating them. Our analysis compares sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave)\nbands for the fronthaul, showing that mmWave achieves superior SINR with lower\npower consumption, particularly under Option 8. Additionally, we determine the\nminimum fronthaul bandwidth required to activate a single UAV-AP under\ndifferent split options.",

The\n$tqg$ FCNC events can be produced with a top quark and either an associated\ngluon or quark, while SM only has events with a top quark and an associated\nquark. We apply machine learning techniques to distinguish the $tqg$ FCNC\nevents from the SM backgrounds, including $qg$-discrimination variables. We use\nthe Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) method as a baseline classifier, assuming that\nthe leading jet originates from the associated parton. We compare with a\nTransformer-based deep learning method known as the Self-Attention for\nJet-parton Assignment (SAJA) network, which allows us to include information\nfrom all jets in the event, regardless of their number, eliminating the\nnecessity to match the associated parton to the leading jet.

However, images generated by these\nmethods are often plagued by spatial artifacts such as blurring and ghosting,\nundermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This\nlimitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR)\nmethods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering\nartifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and\ndiscards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates\ntwo concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient\nthreshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual\nlocalization problems in sparse-input scenarios, it becomes even more necessary\nto use NVS-generated data to assist localization. We design a coarse-to-fine\nPoints of Interest (PoI) variant using sparse-input NVS to solve this problem.\nExperiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy,\nachieving state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Higher Education\n(HE) is transforming personalized learning, administrative automation, and\ndecision-making. However, this progress presents a duality, as AI adoption also\nintroduces ethical and institutional challenges, including algorithmic bias,\ndata privacy risks, and governance inconsistencies. To address these concerns,\nthis study introduces the Human-Driven AI in Higher Education (HD-AIHED)\nFramework, ensuring compliance with UNESCO and OECD ethical standards. This\nconceptual research employs a qualitative meta-synthesis approach, integrating\nqualitative and quantitative studies to identify patterns, contradictions, and\ngaps in AI adoption within HE. It reinterprets existing datasets through\ntheoretical and ethical lenses to develop governance frameworks. The study\napplies a participatory integrated co-system, Phased Human Intelligence, SWOC\nanalysis, and AI ethical review boards to assess AI readiness and governance\nstrategies for universities and HE institutions. The HD-AIHED model bridges AI\nresearch gaps, addresses global real-time challenges, and provides tailored,\nscalable, and ethical strategies for diverse educational contexts. By\nemphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration among stakeholders, this study\nenvisions AIHED as a transparent and equitable force for innovation. The\nHD-AIHED framework ensures AI acts as a collaborative and ethical enabler\nrather than a disruptive replacement for human intelligence while advocating\nfor responsible AI implementation in HE.",

However, most of the\nexisting motion planning methods are incompatible with above requirement. A\npotential reason is that the existing navigation algorithms usually intend to\ntreat people as another kind of obstacle, and hardly take the social principle\nor awareness into consideration. In this paper, we attempt to model the\nproxemics of group and blend it into the scenario perception and navigation of\nrobot. For this purpose, a group clustering method considering both social\nrelevance and spatial confidence is introduced. It can enable robot to identify\nindividuals and divide them into groups. Next, we propose defining the\nindividual proxemics within magnetic dipole model, and further established the\ngroup proxemics and scenario map through vector-field superposition. On the\nbasis of the group clustering and proxemics modeling, we present the method to\nobtain the optimal observation positions (OOPs) of group. Once the OOPs grid\nand scenario map are established, a heuristic path is employed to generate path\nthat guide robot cruising among the groups for interactive purpose. A series of\nexperiments are conducted to validate the proposed methodology on the practical\nrobot, the results have demonstrated that our methodology has achieved\npromising performance on group recognition accuracy and path-generation\nefficiency. This concludes that the group awareness evolved as an important\nmodule to make robot socially behave in the practical scenario.",

The repeating structure of the idealized\ncase allows us to construct a large ensemble of 3 240 members with a reasonable\ncompute time. The results indicate that the use of plain time averaging instead\nof an ensemble average can severely reduce the accuracy of both the mean and\nvariance. These errors are the largest when the averaging time is of the same\norder as the time scale associated with the turning. Utilizing Taylor diagrams,\nwe show that a reasonable compromise between ensemble size and accuracy can be\nachieved by calculating the ensemble statistics from temporally averaged\nresults with an averaging time that is clearly smaller than the characteristic\ntime scale. This allows the use of reasonably-sized ensembles with 10-50\nmembers.

The studies using cosmological and zoom-in simulations, which\nassume CDM, failed to replicate galaxies with the structural properties of\nNube. However, the simulation box or the examined population of UDGs may be too\nnarrow to fully capture the range of effects that can lead to the formation of\nsuch extraordinary galaxies. In this work we present a case study of a\nNube-like galaxy from TNG100, the most extended simulated UDG examined to date\nthat closely mirrors the structural properties of the observed Nube galaxy.\nSince its formation, the simulated Nube-like galaxy has already been\nultra-diffuse and evolved mainly in isolated regions with occasional\ninteractions. Its last major merger was finalized about 1.336 Gyr ago and left\nno trace of interaction apart from further extending the stellar size. This\nevolutionary pathway, featuring a recent merger that expanded an already\nultra-diffuse stellar system, is unique and innovative compared to previous\nstudies. We argue that multiple proposed formation mechanisms can operate\nsimultaneously, further expanding the UDGs and making them extreme outliers of\nthe mass-size relation under favorable conditions. Therefore, it is essential\nto study these simulated extreme outliers, their formation, and, more\nimportantly, their evolution. We also highlight the necessity of carefully\nanalyzing and interpreting the simulated data and better understanding the\nlimitations of a chosen simulation. Thus, if Nube is considered an extreme\noutlier, its properties are not in tension with the standard cosmological\nmodel.",

The efficiency of the MEC service is hence primarily influenced by\nthe RSMA-aided task offloading phase and the subsequent task computation phase,\nwhere reliable and low-latency communication is required. For this practical\nconsideration, short-packet communication in the Finite Blocklength (FBL)\nregime is introduced. In this context, we propose a novel uplink RSMA-aided MEC\nframework and derive the overall Successful Computation Probability (SCP) with\nFBL consideration. To maximize the SCP of our proposed RSMA-aided MEC, we\nstrategically optimize: (1) the task offloading factor which determines the\nnumber of tasks to be offloaded and processed by the MEC server; (2) the\ntransmit power allocation between different RSMA streams; and (3) the\ntask-splitting factor which decides how many tasks are allocated to splitting\nstreams, while adhering to FBL constraints. To address the strong coupling\nbetween these variables in the SCP expression, we apply the Alternative\nOptimization method, which formulates tractable subproblems to optimize each\nvariable iteratively. The resultant non-convex subproblems are then tackled by\nSuccessive Convex Approximation.

Our investigation was triggered by Radio U-Net, a\nnovel machine learning algorithm for detecting diffuse radio emission, which\nwas previously applied to the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS). Methods. We\nre-processed LoTSS (120-168 MHz) data and analyzed archival XMM-Newton (0.7-1.2\nkeV) observations. We also analyzed optical and near-infrared data from the\nDESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and asses the mass distribution with weak-lensing\nanalysis based on archival Subaru Suprime-Cam and CFHT MegaPrime/MegaCam\nobservations. Results. We report the discovery of large-scale diffuse radio\nemission around PSZ2 G083.29-31.03, with a projected largest linear size of 5\nMpc at 144 MHz. The radio emission is aligned with the thermal X-ray emission\nand the distribution of galaxies, unveiling the presence of two low-mass\nsystems, at similar redshifts on either side of the central cluster. The weak\nlensing analysis supports this scenario, demonstrating the presence of an\nextended and complex mass distribution. Conclusions. We propose to interpret\nthe two faint radio sources as connected to the central cluster, thus\nilluminating the presence of two substructures merging into a massive node of\nthe cosmic web. However, because of uncertainties in redshift and mass\nestimates, combined with the low resolution required to detect these sources,\nthe classification of the two sources as independent radio halos associated\nwith nearby low-mass clusters or even as a mixture of different types of\ndiffuse radio emission cannot be definitively ruled out.",

The\npresented solution is capable of generating a metadescription of the data\nstream, separating chunks into groups describing specific concepts on its\nbasis, and visualizing the frequencies in the original spatial domain. The\nexperimental analysis compared the proposed solution with two state-of-the-art\nstrategies and with the PCA baseline in the post-hoc concept identification\ntask. The research is followed by the identification of concepts in the\nreal-world data streams. The generalization in the frequency domain adapted in\nthe proposed solution allows to capture the complex feature dependencies as a\nreduced number of frequency components, while maintaining the semantic meaning\nof data.",

    "abstract": "In a string of recent papers starting with (Transport in Porous Media, 125,\n  565 (2018)), a theory of immiscible two-phase flow in porous media based on\n  Euler homogeneity of the total volumetric flow rate has been investigated.\nThe\n  thermodynamic-like theory has an associated statistical mechanics based on a\n  maximum entropy principle. A quantity called the co-moving velocity connects\n  the equations of state of the intensive thermodynamic velocities and the\n  physical seepage velocities of two flowing fluids. The obtained relations\nhave\n  a structure that can be interpreted using affine- and projective geometry.\nThe\n  co-moving velocity can be expressed as a transformation of the saturation\n  using projective duality of points and lines. One obtains an exact\n  constitutive relation depending on a projective invariant, the cross-ratio,\n  which allows the co-moving velocity to be expressed in terms of a simple\n  steady-state advection equation. A kinematic view of the\n  velocity relations is presented, modeled by a well-known non-trivial geometry\nwhich turns\n  out to be pseudo-Euclidean. The cross-ratio determines a hyperbolic angle in\n  this space, and can be parametrized in terms of three numbers using a linear\n  fractional transformation. Knowing these parameters, the pore velocity and\n  the derivative of the pore velocity with respect to the saturation, an\n  approximation for the co-moving velocity can be obtained for a range of\napplied\n  pressures, viscosity ratios and surface tensions. The parametrization is\n  demonstrated using data from a dynamic pore network model and\n  relative permeability data from the literature.

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a flexible framework for calibrating machine learning\npredictions, providing distribution-free statistical guarantees. In outlier\ndetection, this calibration relies on a reference set of labeled inlier data to\ncontrol the type-I error rate. However, obtaining a perfectly labeled inlier\nreference set is often unrealistic, and a more practical scenario involves\naccess to a contaminated reference set containing a small fraction of outliers.\nThis paper analyzes the impact of such contamination on the validity of\nconformal methods. We prove that under realistic, non-adversarial settings,\ncalibration on contaminated data yields conservative type-I error control,\nshedding light on the inherent robustness of conformal methods. This\nconservativeness, however, typically results in a loss of power. To alleviate\nthis limitation, we propose a novel, active data-cleaning framework that\nleverages a limited labeling budget and an outlier detection model to\nselectively annotate data points in the contaminated reference set that are\nsuspected as outliers. By removing only the annotated outliers in this\n``suspicious'' subset, we can effectively enhance power while mitigating the\nrisk of inflating the type-I error rate, as supported by our theoretical\nanalysis. Experiments on real datasets validate the conservative behavior of\nconformal methods under contamination and show that the proposed data-cleaning\nstrategy improves power without sacrificing validity.",

Resulting composite systems are usually classified as\neither active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the\nbiological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these\ntwo limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge\nthe gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive\na unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and\nelastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by\ncoarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our\nsubsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting\nsubstrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control\nparameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of\ntransitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective\nmigration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A\nstationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed\nfor rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state\nobserved in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing\nelasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic\nanchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially\nuniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description\nallows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via\nviscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter.\nTherefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex\nsystems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.",

    "abstract": "Radio maps enrich radio propagation and spectrum occupancy information, which\nprovides fundamental support for the operation and optimization of wireless\ncommunication systems. Traditional radio maps are mainly achieved by extensive\nmanual channel measurements, which is time-consuming and inefficient. To reduce\nthe complexity of channel measurements, radio map estimation (RME) through\nnovel artificial intelligence techniques has emerged to attain higher\nresolution radio maps from sparse measurements or few observations. However,\nblack box problems and strong dependency on training data make learning-based\nmethods less explainable, while model-based methods offer strong theoretical\ngrounding but perform inferior to the learning-based methods. In this paper, we\ndevelop a deep unrolled low-rank tensor completion network (DULRTC-RME) for\nradio map estimation, which integrates theoretical interpretability and\nlearning ability by unrolling the tedious low-rank tensor completion\noptimization into a deep network. It is the first time that algorithm unrolling\ntechnology has been used in the RME field. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat DULRTC-RME outperforms existing RME methods.",

The statistical $t$-test comparing\ndifferences in means is the most commonly used method for assessing treatment\neffects, often justified through the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT\nascertains that, as the sample size grows, the sampling distribution of the\nAverage Treatment Effect converges to normality, making the $t$-test valid for\nsufficiently large sample sizes. When outcome measures are skewed or\nnon-normal, quantifying what \"sufficiently large\" entails is not\nstraightforward.\n  To ensure that confidence intervals maintain proper coverage and that\n$p$-values accurately reflect the false positive rate, it is critical to\nvalidate this normality assumption. We propose a practical method to test this,\nby analysing repeatedly resampled A/A-tests. When the normality assumption\nholds, the resulting $p$-value distribution should be uniform, and this\nproperty can be tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. This provides an\nefficient and effective way to empirically assess whether the $t$-test's\nassumptions are met, and the A/B-test is valid.

The sensors are thinned down to a\nthickness of 50 $\\mu$m and 100 $\\mu$m for the three innermost layers and for\nthe four outer layers, respectively. The material budget of the innermost\nlayers is as low as 0.36% $X_{0}$/ layer compared to 1.14% $X_{0}$/ layer of\nthe previous ITS1. In combination with a radius of 23 mm for the innermost\nlayer and a position resolution of about 5 $\\mu$m, the low material budget\ngreatly enhances the reconstruction capabilities of heavy-flavour and\nlow-$p_{\\rm T}$ particles compared to Run 2.

The analysis of each system and\nof its Galerkin discretization is done through the passage to the Laplace\ndomain, which allows for the use of convolution quadrature for time\ndiscretization. Since the operators of the acustic and elastic Calder\\'on\ncalculus appear independently of each other, the formulation is well suited for\nnon-intrusive numerical impementations (i.e. existing codes for acoustic and\nelastic problems can be used without any modification).",

    "abstract": "With the rapid growth of mobile data traffic and the increasing prevalence of\nvideo streaming, proactive content caching in edge computing has become crucial\nfor reducing latency and alleviating network congestion. However, traditional\ncaching strategies such as FIFO, LRU, and LFU fail to effectively predict\nfuture content popularity, while existing proactive caching approaches often\nrequire users to upload data to a central server, raising concerns regarding\nprivacy and scalability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a\nGraph Federated Learning-based Proactive Content Caching (GFPCC) scheme that\nenhances caching efficiency while preserving user privacy. The proposed\napproach integrates federated learning and graph neural networks, enabling\nusers to locally train Light Graph Convolutional Networks (LightGCN) to capture\nuser-item relationships and predict content popularity. Instead of sharing raw\ndata, only the trained model parameters are transmitted to the central server,\nwhere a federated averaging algorithm aggregates updates, refines the global\nmodel, and selects the most popular files for proactive caching. Experimental\nevaluations on real-world datasets, such as MovieLens, demonstrate that GFPCC\noutperforms baseline caching algorithms by achieving higher cache efficiency\nthrough more accurate content popularity predictions. Moreover, the federated\nlearning framework strengthens privacy protection while maintaining efficient\nmodel training; however, scalability remains a challenge in large-scale\nnetworks with dynamic user preferences.",

    "abstract": "In the era of vast digital information, the sheer volume and heterogeneity of\navailable information present significant challenges for intricate information\nseeking. Users frequently face multistep web search tasks that involve\nnavigating vast and varied data sources. This complexity demands every step\nremains comprehensive, accurate, and relevant. However, traditional search\nmethods often struggle to balance the need for localized precision with the\nbroader context required for holistic understanding, leaving critical facets of\nintricate queries underexplored. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based\nsearch assistant that adopts a new information seeking paradigm with\nholistically guided Monte Carlo tree search (HG-MCTS). We reformulate the task\nas a progressive information collection process with a knowledge memory and\nunite an adaptive checklist with multi-perspective reward modeling in MCTS. The\nadaptive checklist provides explicit sub-goals to guide the MCTS process toward\ncomprehensive coverage of complex user queries. Simultaneously, our\nmulti-perspective reward modeling offers both exploration and retrieval\nrewards, along with progress feedback that tracks completed and remaining\nsub-goals, refining the checklist as the tree search progresses. By striking a\nbalance between localized tree expansion and global guidance, HG-MCTS reduces\nredundancy in search paths and ensures that all crucial aspects of an intricate\nquery are properly addressed. Extensive experiments on real-world intricate\ninformation seeking tasks demonstrate that HG-MCTS acquires thorough knowledge\ncollections and delivers more accurate final responses compared with existing\nbaselines.",

This study investigates self-supervised learning\nmethods for pre-training capsule networks in polyp diagnostics for colon\ncancer. We used the PICCOLO dataset, comprising 3,433 samples, which\nexemplifies typical challenges in medical datasets: small size, class\nimbalance, and distribution shifts between data splits. Capsule networks offer\ninherent interpretability due to their architecture and inter-layer information\nrouting mechanism. However, their limited native implementation in mainstream\ndeep learning frameworks and the lack of pre-trained versions pose a\nsignificant challenge. This is particularly true if aiming to train them on\nsmall medical datasets, where leveraging pre-trained weights as initial\nparameters would be beneficial. We explored two auxiliary self-supervised\nlearning tasks, colourisation and contrastive learning, for capsule network\npre-training. We compared self-supervised pre-trained models against\nalternative initialisation strategies. Our findings suggest that contrastive\nlearning and in-painting techniques are suitable auxiliary tasks for\nself-supervised learning in the medical domain.

Existing works for schema\nlinking focus on the table level and perform it once, ignoring the\nmulti-granularity semantics and chainable cyclicity of schemas. In this paper,\nwe propose a progressive schema linking with multi-granularity semantics\n(PSM-SQL) framework to reduce the redundant database schemas for text-to-SQL.\nUsing the multi-granularity schema linking (MSL) module, PSM-SQL learns the\nschema semantics at the column, table, and database levels. More specifically,\na triplet loss is used at the column level to learn embeddings, while\nfine-tuning LLMs is employed at the database level for schema reasoning. MSL\nemploys classifier and similarity scores to model schema interactions for\nschema linking at the table level. In particular, PSM-SQL adopts a chain loop\nstrategy to reduce the task difficulty of schema linking by continuously\nreducing the number of redundant schemas. Experiments conducted on text-to-SQL\ndatasets show that the proposed PSM-SQL is 1-3 percentage points higher than\nthe existing methods.",

In this work we show how superconducting\nphases with mixed singlet-triplet symmetries can arise below $T_c$ for a\ngeneric tight-binding model. We first examine the 1D case to better illustrate\nthe prevalence of symmetry-breaking transitions below $T_c$, and then the more\nrealistic 2D case. In both cases we illustrate the implication for\nspectroscopic investigations of the energy gap by calculating the density of\nstates for different temperatures below $T_c$. We find that the structure of\nthe density of states near $T_c$ can vary dramatically from its form near\n$T=0$. A complete picture of the superconducting symmetry can only be attained\nif measurements are made over the entire temperature range.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the perfect encounter of deep learning and\nquantitative trading has achieved great success in stock investment. Numerous\ndeep learning-based models have been developed for forecasting stock returns,\nleveraging the powerful representation capabilities of neural networks to\nidentify patterns and factors influencing stock prices. These models can\neffectively capture general patterns in the market, such as stock price trends,\nvolume-price relationships, and time variations. However, the impact of special\nirrationality factors -- such as market sentiment, speculative behavior, market\nmanipulation, and psychological biases -- have not been fully considered in\nexisting deep stock forecasting models due to their relative abstraction as\nwell as lack of explicit labels and data description. To fill this gap, we\npropose UMI, a Universal multi-level Market Irrationality factor model to\nenhance stock return forecasting. The UMI model learns factors that can reflect\nirrational behaviors in market from both individual stock and overall market\nlevels. For the stock-level, UMI construct an estimated rational price for each\nstock, which is cointegrated with the stock's actual price. The discrepancy\nbetween the actual and the rational prices serves as a factor to indicate\nstock-level irrational events. Additionally, we define market-level irrational\nbehaviors as anomalous synchronous fluctuations of stocks within a market.\nUsing two self-supervised representation learning tasks, i.e., sub-market\ncomparative learning and market synchronism prediction, the UMI model\nincorporates market-level irrationalities into a market representation vector,\nwhich is then used as the market-level irrationality factor.",

The experiment is based on real\nfinancial data sets. The results show that the model is significantly superior\nto traditional single models (such as BiLSTM, CNN, Transformer, and TCN) in\nterms of accuracy, recall, and F1 score. The F1-score reaches 0.88, showing\nextremely high discriminant ability. This shows that the joint strategy of\ncombining CNN and BiLSTM can not only fully capture the complex patterns of\nmarket data but also effectively deal with the long-term dependency problem in\ntime series data. In addition, this study also explores the robustness of the\nmodel in dealing with data noise and processing high-dimensional data,\nproviding strong support for intelligent financial risk management.

To overcome such ambiguity, Planning Domain Definition\nLanguage (PDDL) is leveraged as a planning abstraction that enables precise and\nformal state descriptions. With PDDL, we can generate a symbolic world model\nwhere classic searching algorithms, such as A*, can be seamlessly applied to\nfind optimal plans. However, directly generating PDDL domains with current LLMs\nremains an open challenge due to the lack of PDDL training data. To address\nthis challenge, we propose to scale up the test-time computation of LLMs to\nenhance their PDDL reasoning capabilities, thereby enabling the generation of\nhigh-quality PDDL domains. Specifically, we introduce a simple yet effective\nalgorithm, which first employs a Best-of-N sampling approach to improve the\nquality of the initial solution and then refines the solution in a fine-grained\nmanner with verbalized machine learning. Our method outperforms o1-mini by a\nconsiderable margin in the generation of PDDL domains, achieving over 50\\%\nsuccess rate on two tasks (i.e., generating PDDL domains from natural language\ndescription or PDDL problems).

In this paper we introduced two important ingredients absent in the\nprevious work: the torsion mass, significant for the torsion detection the\nLarge Hadron Collider, and the quantum correction proportional to the\n4-divergent of torsion squared. Without the quantum correction, a simple\nanalytical solution is obtained, while the more complicated field equations\nincorporating the BI field are obtained also analytically. The lower bound of\nquantum correction parameter is determined in terms of the torsion trace mass\nsquared and axial torsion squared. Our findings reveal that in the late\nuniverse, the BI parameter approaches infinity restoring to the Einstein-Cartan\ntheory in the early universe with the dynamical reduction of the Immirzi\nparameter to a constant BI parameter. Additionally, we derive analytical\nsolutions for magnetic dynamos in the early universe, demonstrating that\nmagnetic helicity is proportional to chiral chemical potential. A magnetic\nfield at the QCD phase is found out of $10^{17}$ G, without quantum correction.\nFurthermore, from this dark magnetogenesis, we estimate light torsion with mass\nof the order of 1 TeV, An example of unitary preserved Lagrangian with axion as\nan Immirzi field is obtained. In the present universe we find a magnetic field\nstrength of approximately $10^{-12}$ G which is quite close to the range found\nby Miniati at the QCD threshold, between $10^{-18}-10^{-15}$ G.

Specifically, for image data with dependent features ($\\mathbf{x}$)\nand ($\\mathbf{y}$) (e.g., the height of the sun ($\\mathbf{x}$) and the length\nof the shadow ($\\mathbf{y}$)), we investigate whether DMs can accurately\ncapture the inter-feature rule ($p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x})$). Empirical\nevaluations on mainstream DMs (e.g., Stable Diffusion 3.5) reveal consistent\nfailures, such as inconsistent lighting-shadow relationships and mismatched\nobject-mirror reflections. Inspired by these findings, we design four synthetic\ntasks with strongly correlated features to assess DMs' rule-learning abilities.\nExtensive experiments show that while DMs can identify coarse-grained rules,\nthey struggle with fine-grained ones. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates\nthat DMs trained via denoising score matching (DSM) exhibit constant errors in\nlearning hidden rules, as the DSM objective is not compatible with rule\nconformity. To mitigate this, we introduce a common technique - incorporating\nadditional classifier guidance during sampling, which achieves (limited)\nimprovements. Our analysis reveals that the subtle signals of fine-grained\nrules are challenging for the classifier to capture, providing insights for\nfuture exploration.",

We also delve into essential performance\nmeasures such as communication costs and strategies for fault tolerance, then\nbranch into specialized variants, such as k-mutual exclusion and\nself-stabilizing algorithms.\n  Furthermore, a specialized approach that relies on finite projective planes\nis introduced to highlight how certain protocols can perform efficiently under\nboth best- and worst-case conditions. Lastly, we explore future directions\ninvolving machine learning for token predictive routing and blockchain\ntechniques to resist adversarial behavior. This aims to provide a thorough yet\naccessible overview of token-based DME approaches, together with insights on\nemerging research trends.",

The amplitude of these\nvariations is negatively correlated with misalignment angle for models with\nmisalignment angles less than 90{\\deg}, and positively correlated for models\nwith misalignment angles greater than 90{\\deg}.

The break becomes more pronounced at\nlonger wavelengths, with the counts slope flattening smoothly with apparent\nmagnitude in the shortest band used at 0.9 microns, trending towards an\nincreasingly broken slope by the longest wavelength passband of JWST NIRCam,\n4.4 microns. This behaviour is remarkably well predicted by the GALFORM\nsemi-analytical model of galaxy formation. We use the model to diagnose the\norigin of this behaviour. We find that the features that are responsible for\nthe break are: 1) the inherent break in the luminosity function; 2) the change\nin the volume element with redshift and 3) the redshift-dependent nature of the\nk-correction. We study the contribution to these effects by early and late-type\ngalaxies, using as a proxy for morphology the bulge-to-total stellar mass\nratio. We find that the way in which ellipticals populate the bright end of the\nluminosity function while spirals dominate the faint end is preserved in the\ngalaxy number counts, with a characteristic stellar mass at the break of\napproximately 10^10 M_sun. We also find that the shape of the number counts is\nmainly driven by galaxies with relatively low redshift (z < 2) for the PEARLS\nobservational limit of m_AB < 28. We give a comprehensive description of why\nthe galaxy number counts in the near-infrared PEARLS-JWST observation look the\nway they do and which population of galaxies is dominant at each apparent\nmagnitude.",

In this paper, we propose an\nadaptive path tracking (APT) control method to dynamically adjust drift states\nto follow the reference path, improving the commonly utilized predictive path\ntracking methods with released computation burden. Furthermore, existing\ncontrol strategies necessitate a precise system model to calculate the DEP,\nwhich can be more intractable due to the highly nonlinear drift dynamics and\nsensitive vehicle parameters. To tackle this problem, an adaptive\nlearning-based model predictive control (ALMPC) strategy is proposed based on\nthe APT method, where an upper-level Bayesian optimization is employed to learn\nthe DEP and APT control law to instruct a lower-level MPC drift controller.\nThis hierarchical system architecture can also resolve the inherent control\nconflict between path tracking and drifting by separating these objectives into\ndifferent layers.

In\nthis article, we take a radical approach and utilize the channel fading\nphenomenon to our advantage.

Conventional optimization strategies, such as\njitter buffer, bitrate adaptation, and customized encoding, either sacrifice\nclarity, average delay, or compatibility. To address this issue, we propose\nPDStream, a novel pseudo-dual streaming algorithm, aimed at minimizing E2E\ndelay while maintaining video clarity. The core idea is to split the two\nfunctions, delay-sensitive playback and delay-tolerant reference, on keyframes\nthrough dual streaming. Specifically, the playback function is held by a second\nparallel stream, which comprises much smaller non-keyframes and is allocated\nmore immediate bandwidth for real-time performance. The reference function is\nensured by the first stream with keyframe preservation, allocated more\nsubsequent bandwidth to smooth out bursty traffic. Additionally, ``pseudo''\nminimizes computational and transmission overheads by restricting dual streams\nto brief activation only when keyframes appear, supported by corresponding\ndual-stream bitrate allocation and adaptation to ensure delay and clarity. We\nimplement PDStream on a WebRTC-based IVS testbed with real-world network\ntraces. Results show that PDStream significantly outperforms prior algorithms,\nreducing average E2E delay by 17.5\\% and slashing its 97th percentile by\n33.3\\%, while keeping clarity under varying bandwidth.",

The turbulent dynamo can amplify magnetic fields to such\nlevels by converting turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic energy. While\nextensively studied in collisional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, the\nweakly-collisional regime has only been explored recently. Here, we determine\nthe properties of the weakly-collisional turbulent dynamo in the exponential\n``kinematic\" growth phase in both the subsonic and the previously unexplored\nsupersonic regime of turbulence, using hybrid particle-in-cell (HPIC) and MHD\nsimulations. We conduct a large parameter study, fixing the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber, Rm = 500, and the initial ratio of the magnetic to kinetic energy,\n$(E_{\\rm{mag}}/E_{\\rm{kin}})_{0} = 10^{-10}$, and then vary the kinetic\nReynolds number, Re = 500, 50, and 5, for the MHD simulations. In the HPIC\nruns, only Rm = 500 is controlled, while Re emerges self-consistently from\nwave-particle interactions. We find that the velocity and magnetic field\nstructures, probability distribution functions, and power spectra of the HPIC\nruns are similar to that of the MHD dynamo with Re ~ 50-500 and Re ~ 500 in the\nsubsonic and supersonic regimes, respectively.

However, it remains challenging for these agents to solve\nstrategic language games, such as Werewolf, which demand both strategic\ndecision-making and free-form language interactions. Existing LLM agents often\nsuffer from intrinsic bias in their action distributions and limited\nexploration of the unbounded text action space, resulting in suboptimal\nperformance. To address these challenges, we propose Latent Space Policy\nOptimization (LSPO), an iterative framework that combines game-theoretic\nmethods with LLM fine-tuning to build strategic language agents. LSPO leverages\nthe observation that while the language space is combinatorially large, the\nunderlying strategy space is relatively compact. We first map free-form\nutterances into a finite latent strategy space, yielding an abstracted\nextensive-form game. Then we apply game-theoretic methods like Counterfactual\nRegret Minimization (CFR) to optimize the policy in the latent space. Finally,\nwe fine-tune the LLM via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align with the\nlearned policy. By iteratively alternating between these steps, our LSPO agents\nprogressively enhance both strategic reasoning and language communication.\nExperiment on the Werewolf game shows that our agents iteratively expand the\nstrategy space with improving performance and outperform existing Werewolf\nagents, underscoring their effectiveness in free-form language games with\nstrategic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Fingerprint recognition remains one of the most reliable biometric\ntechnologies due to its high accuracy and uniqueness. Traditional systems rely\non contact-based scanners, which are prone to issues such as image degradation\nfrom surface contamination and inconsistent user interaction. To address these\nlimitations, contactless fingerprint recognition has emerged as a promising\nalternative, providing non-intrusive and hygienic authentication. This study\nevaluates the impact of image enhancement tech-niques on the performance of\npre-trained deep learning models using transfer learning for touchless\nfingerprint recognition. The IIT-Bombay Touchless and Touch-Based Fingerprint\nDatabase, containing data from 200 subjects, was employed to test the\nper-formance of deep learning architectures such as VGG-16, VGG-19,\nInception-V3, and ResNet-50. Experimental results reveal that transfer learning\nmethods with fingerprint image enhance-ment (indirect method) significantly\noutperform those without enhancement (direct method). Specifically, VGG-16\nachieved an accuracy of 98% in training and 93% in testing when using the\nenhanced images, demonstrating superior performance compared to the direct\nmethod.\n  This paper provides a detailed comparison of the effectiveness of image\nenhancement in improving the accuracy of transfer learning models for touchless\nfingerprint recognition, offering key insights for developing more efficient\nbiometric systems.",

We demonstrate NeuroShield-ViT's effectiveness\nacross various attacks, particularly excelling against strong iterative\nattacks, and showcase its remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities.\nWithout fine-tuning, our method achieves a competitive accuracy of 77.8% on\nadversarial examples, surpassing conventional robustness methods.

    "abstract": "The cross-learning contextual bandit problem with graphical feedback has\nrecently attracted significant attention. In this setting, there is a\ncontextual bandit with a feedback graph over the arms, and pulling an arm\nreveals the loss for all neighboring arms in the feedback graph across all\ncontexts. Initially proposed by Han et al. (2024), this problem has broad\napplications in areas such as bidding in first price auctions, and explores a\nnovel frontier in the feedback structure of bandit problems. A key theoretical\nquestion is whether an algorithm with $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\alpha T})$ regret\nexists, where $\\alpha$ represents the independence number of the feedback\ngraph. This question is particularly interesting because it concerns whether an\nalgorithm can achieve a regret bound entirely independent of the number of\ncontexts and matching the minimax regret of vanilla graphical bandits. Previous\nwork has demonstrated that such an algorithm is impossible for adversarial\ncontexts, but the question remains open for stochastic contexts. In this work,\nwe affirmatively answer this open question by presenting an algorithm that\nachieves the minimax $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\alpha T})$ regret for cross-learning\ncontextual bandits with graphical feedback and stochastic contexts.

This\nwork investigates (1) \\textit{how} CoT training reshapes internal model\nrepresentations and (2) \\textit{why} it improves both in-distribution (ID) and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) reasoning generalization. Through controlled\nexperiments and theoretical analysis, we derive the following key insights.\n\\textbf{1)} Structural Advantage: CoT training internalizes reasoning into a\ntwo-stage generalizing circuit, where the number of stages corresponds to the\nexplicit reasoning steps during training. Notably, CoT-trained models resolve\nintermediate results at shallower layers compared to non-CoT counterparts,\nfreeing up deeper layers to specialize in subsequent reasoning steps.\n\\textbf{2)} Theoretical Analysis: the information-theoretic generalization\nbounds via distributional divergence can be decomposed into ID and OOD\ncomponents. While ID error diminishes with sufficient training regardless of\nCoT, OOD error critically depends on CoT: Non-CoT training fails to generalize\nto OOD samples due to unseen reasoning patterns, whereas CoT training achieves\nnear-perfect OOD generalization by mastering subtasks and reasoning\ncompositions during training. The identified mechanisms explain our\nexperimental results: CoT training accelerates convergence and enhances\ngeneralization from ID to both ID and OOD scenarios while maintaining robust\nperformance even with tolerable noise. These findings are further validated on\ncomplex real-world datasets. This paper offers valuable insights for designing\nCoT strategies to enhance LLM reasoning robustness.",

    "abstract": "The exponential surge in online health information, coupled with its\nincreasing use by non-experts, highlights the pressing need for advanced Health\nInformation Retrieval models that consider not only topical relevance but also\nthe factual accuracy of the retrieved information, given the potential risks\nassociated with health misinformation. To this aim, this paper introduces a\nsolution driven by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which leverages the\ncapabilities of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the\nretrieval of health-related documents grounded in scientific evidence. In\nparticular, we propose a three-stage model: in the first stage, the user's\nquery is employed to retrieve topically relevant passages with associated\nreferences from a knowledge base constituted by scientific literature. In the\nsecond stage, these passages, alongside the initial query, are processed by\nLLMs to generate a contextually relevant rich text (GenText). In the last\nstage, the documents to be retrieved are evaluated and ranked both from the\npoint of view of topical relevance and factual accuracy by means of their\ncomparison with GenText, either through stance detection or semantic\nsimilarity. In addition to calculating factual accuracy, GenText can offer a\nlayer of explainability for it, aiding users in understanding the reasoning\nbehind the retrieval. Experimental evaluation of our model on benchmark\ndatasets and against baseline models demonstrates its effectiveness in\nenhancing the retrieval of both topically relevant and factually accurate\nhealth information, thus presenting a significant step forward in the health\nmisinformation mitigation problem.",

However, achieving a fine radar resolution often\nrequires high-rate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and substantial storage,\nmaking it both expensive and impractical for many commercial applications. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes an orthogonal time frequency\nspace (OTFS)-based ISAC architecture that operates at reduced ADC sampling\nrates, yet preserves accurate radar estimation and supports simultaneous\ncommunication. The proposed architecture introduces pilot symbols directly in\nthe delay-Doppler (DD) domain to leverage the transformation mapping between\nthe DD and time-frequency (TF) domains to keep selected subcarriers active\nwhile others are inactive, allowing the radar receiver to exploit\nunder-sampling aliasing and recover the original DD signal at much lower\nsampling rates. To further enhance the radar accuracy, we develop an iterative\ninterference estimation and cancellation algorithm that mitigates data symbol\ninterference. We propose a code-based spreading technique that distributes data\nacross the DD domain to preserve the maximum unambiguous radar sensing range.\nFor communication, we implement a complete transceiver pipeline optimized for\nreduced sampling rate system, including synchronization, channel estimation,\nand iterative data detection.

    "abstract": "One of the most basic problems in reinforcement learning (RL) is policy\nevaluation: estimating the long-term return, i.e., value function,\ncorresponding to a given fixed policy. The celebrated Temporal Difference (TD)\nlearning algorithm addresses this problem, and recent work has investigated\nfinite-time convergence guarantees for this algorithm and variants thereof.\nHowever, these guarantees hinge on the reward observations being always\ngenerated from a well-behaved (e.g., sub-Gaussian) true reward distribution.\nMotivated by harsh, real-world environments where such an idealistic assumption\nmay no longer hold, we revisit the policy evaluation problem from the\nperspective of adversarial robustness. In particular, we consider a\nHuber-contaminated reward model where an adversary can arbitrarily corrupt each\nreward sample with a small probability $\\epsilon$. Under this observation\nmodel, we first show that the adversary can cause the vanilla TD algorithm to\nconverge to any arbitrary value function. We then develop a novel algorithm\ncalled Robust-TD and prove that its finite-time guarantees match that of\nvanilla TD with linear function approximation up to a small $O(\\epsilon)$ term\nthat captures the effect of corruption. We complement this result with a\nminimax lower bound, revealing that such an additive corruption-induced term is\nunavoidable. To our knowledge, these results are the first of their kind in the\ncontext of adversarial robustness of stochastic approximation schemes driven by\nMarkov noise. The key new technical tool that enables our results is an\nanalysis of the Median-of-Means estimator with corrupted, time-correlated data\nthat might be of independent interest to the literature on robust statistics.",

Re-accreted gas from the\ncircumbinary disk alters the photospheric chemistry of the post-AGB star,\nproducing a characteristic underabundance of refractory elements that\ncorrelates with condensation temperature $\\unicode{x2013}$a phenomenon known as\nchemical depletion. This work investigates how re-accretion from a disk drives\nchemical depletion, and the impact accreted matter has on post-AGB evolution.\nWe used the MESA code to evolve 0.55 and 0.60 M$_{\\odot}$ post-AGB stars with\nthe accretion of refractory element-depleted gas from a circumbinary disk. Our\nstudy adopts observationally-constrained initial accretion rates and disk\nmasses to reproduce the chemical depletion patterns of six well-studied\npost-AGB binary stars: EP Lyr, HP Lyr, IRAS 17038-4815, IRAS 09144-4933, HD\n131356, and SX Cen. We find high accretion rates ($>\\,$10$^{-7}$\nM$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$) and large disk masses ($\\geq\\,$10$^{-2}$ M$_{\\odot}$)\nnecessary to reproduce observed depletion, particularly in higher-mass, hotter\npost-AGB stars (T$_{\\textrm{eff}}\\geq$ 6000 K). A slower evolution (lower core\nmass) is required to reproduce cooler (T$_{\\textrm{eff}}\\leq$ 5000 K) depleted\npost-AGB stars. Rapid accretion significantly impacts post-AGB evolution,\nstalling stars at cooler effective temperatures and extending post-AGB\nlifetimes by factors of around 3 to 10. Despite this, extended post-AGB\ntimescales remain within or below the planetary nebula (PN) visibility\ntimescale, suggesting accretion cannot account for the observed lack of ionised\nPNe in post-AGB binaries.

We investigate the nature of the UV\ncontrasts exhibited by Venus clouds by examining possible correlations between\nthe thermal structure inferred from radio occultation data and UV brightness\nfrom imagery data, both observed with Venus Express. We analyse Venus Express\nimages obtained from 11 hours before to a few hours after the time of radio\noccultation measurements of the same area.

We find a possible\nanti-correlation between UV-brightness and atmospheric temperature in the 65-70\nkm altitude range for low latitudes. Heating in this altitude and latitude\nregion due to an increase in the UV-absorber has been predicted by radiative\nforcing studies. The predictions roughly match our observed temperature\namplitude between UV-dark and UV-bright regions. We find no evidence for any\ncorrelation between UV-brightness and static stability in the atmosphere in the\n50-80 km altitude region.

While the Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) model addresses gaps in LLMs' training data and knowledge\nlimits, it is hindered by token limit restrictions and dependency on the\nretrieval system's accuracy. Our proposed architecture incorporates in-context\nvectors (ICV) to overcome these challenges. ICV recasts in-context learning by\nusing latent embeddings of LLMs to create a vector that captures essential task\ninformation. This vector is then used to shift the latent states of the LLM,\nenhancing the generation process without adding demonstration examples to the\nprompt. ICV directly integrates information into the model, enabling it to\nprocess this information more effectively. Our extensive experimental\nevaluation demonstrates that ICV outperforms standard in-context learning and\nfine-tuning across question-answering, information retrieval, and other tasks.\nThis approach mitigates the limitations of current RAG models and offers a more\nrobust solution for handling extensive and diverse datasets. Despite leveraging\na fraction of the parameters, our ICV-enhanced model achieves competitive\nperformance against models like LLaMA-3, Gemma, and Phi-3, significantly\nreducing computational costs and memory requirements.

Currently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with billions of parameters suffer from adversarial\nattacks just like their earlier, smaller counterparts. However, the threat\nmodels have changed. Previously, having gray-box access, where input embeddings\nor output logits/probabilities were visible to the user, might have been\nreasonable. However, with the introduction of closed-source models, no\ninformation about the model is available apart from the generated output. This\nmeans that current black-box attacks can only utilize the final prediction to\ndetect if an attack is successful. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate\nthe potential of attack guidance, akin to using output probabilities, while\nhaving only black-box access in a classification setting. This is achieved\nthrough the ability to elicit confidence from the model. We empirically show\nthat the elicited confidence is calibrated and not hallucinated for current\nLLMs. By minimizing the elicited confidence, we can therefore increase the\nlikelihood of misclassification.

    "abstract": "The Android ecosystem is vulnerable to issues such as app repackaging,\ncounterfeiting, and piracy, threatening both developers and users. To mitigate\nthese risks, developers often employ code obfuscation techniques. However,\nwhile effective in protecting legitimate applications, obfuscation also hinders\nsecurity investigations as it is often exploited for malicious purposes. As\nsuch, it is important to understand code obfuscation practices in Android apps.\nIn this paper, we analyze over 500,000 Android APKs from Google Play, spanning\nan eight-year period, to investigate the evolution and prevalence of code\nobfuscation techniques. First, we propose a set of classifiers to detect\nobfuscated code, tools, and techniques and then conduct a longitudinal analysis\nto identify trends. Our results show a 13% increase in obfuscation from 2016 to\n2023, with ProGuard and Allatori as the most commonly used tools. We also show\nthat obfuscation is more prevalent in top-ranked apps and gaming genres such as\nCasino apps. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study of\nobfuscation adoption in the Google Play Store, providing insights for\ndevelopers and security analysts.",

While it is\nknown that frustration in soft matter assemblies has the ability to propagate\nup to mesoscopic, multi-particle size scales, notably through the selection of\nself-limiting domain, little is understood about how the symmetry of\nshape-misfit at the particle scale influences emergent morphologies at the\nmesoscale. Here we show that polarity in the shape-misfit of warped-jigsaw\npuzzles manifests at a larger scale in the morphology and thermodynamics of the\nground-state assembly of self-limiting domains. We use a combination of\ncontinuum theory and discrete particle simulations to show that the polar\nmisfit gives rise to two mesoscopically distinct polar, self-limiting ribbon\ndomains. Thermodynamic selection between the two ribbon morphologies is\ncontrolled by a combination of the binding anisotropy along distinct neighbor\ndirections and the orientation of polar shape-misfit. These predictions are\nvaluable as design features for ongoing efforts to program self-limiting\nassemblies through the synthesis of intentionally frustrated particles, and\nfurther suggests a generic classification of frustrated assembly behavior in\nterms of the relative symmetries of shape-misfit and the underlying long-range\ninter-particle order it frustrates.",

In this paper, we obtain tight bounds on the noisy query complexity of\nseveral fundamental problems.\n  Our first contribution is to show that any Boolean function with total\ninfluence $\\Omega(n)$ has noisy query complexity $\\Theta(n\\log n)$. Previous\nworks often focus on specific problems, and it is of great interest to have a\ncharacterization of noisy query complexity for general functions. Our result is\nthe first noisy query complexity lower bound of this generality, beyond what\nwas known for random Boolean functions [Reischuk and Schmeltz, FOCS 1991].\n  Our second contribution is to prove that Graph Connectivity has noisy query\ncomplexity $\\Theta(n^2 \\log n)$. In this problem, the goal is to determine\nwhether an undirected graph is connected using noisy edge queries. While the\nupper bound can be achieved by a simple algorithm, no non-trivial lower bounds\nwere known prior to this work.\n  Last but not least, we determine the exact number of noisy queries (up to\nlower order terms) needed to solve the $k$-Threshold problem and the Counting\nproblem. The $k$-Threshold problem asks to decide whether there are at least\n$k$ ones among $n$ bits, given noisy query access to the bits.

However, they also have a detrimental impact on the sparsity of\nthe one-particle density matrix (1-PDM), to a degree stronger than the spatial\nextent of the basis functions alone could explain. This is despite the fact\nthat the matrix elements of the 1-PDM of insulators (systems with significant\nHOMO-LUMO gaps) are expected to decay exponentially with increasing real-space\ndistance from the diagonal and the asymptotic decay rate is expected to have a\nwell-defined basis set limit. The observed low sparsity of the 1-PDM appears to\nbe independent of representation and even persists after projecting the 1-PDM\nonto a real-space grid, leading to the conclusion that this \"curse of sparsity\"\nis solely a basis set artifact, which, counterintuitively, becomes worse for\nlarger basis sets, seemingly contradicting the notion of a well-defined basis\nset limit. We show that this is a consequence of the low locality of the\ncontra-variant basis functions as quantified by the inverse overlap matrix\n$\\mathbf{S}^{-1}$ being significantly less sparse than its covariant dual.\nIntroducing the model system of an infinite non-interacting chain of helium\natoms, we are able to quantify the exponential decay rate to be proportional to\nthe diffuseness as well as local incompleteness of the basis set, meaning small\nand diffuse basis sets are affected the most.

To unify the underlying scene representation across these modalities,\nwe represent the scene using deformable 3D Gaussians. To handle rapid scene\nmovements, we jointly optimize the 3D Gaussian parameters and their temporal\ndeformation fields by integrating data from all three sensor modalities. This\nfusion enables efficient, high-quality imaging of fast and complex scenes, even\nunder challenging conditions such as low light, narrow baselines, or rapid\nmotion.

However, most existing methods underestimate\nthe information loss incurred by weight quantization, resulting in significant\nperformance deterioration, particularly in low-bit cases. Furthermore, a common\npractice in quantizing post-Softmax activations of ViTs is to employ\nlogarithmic transformations, which unfortunately prioritize less informative\nvalues around zero. This approach introduces additional redundancies,\nultimately leading to suboptimal quantization efficacy. To handle these, this\npaper proposes an innovative PTQ method tailored for ViTs, termed AIQViT\n(Architecture-Informed Post-training Quantization for ViTs). First, we design\nan architecture-informed low rank compensation mechanism, wherein learnable\nlow-rank weights are introduced to compensate for the degradation caused by\nweight quantization. Second, we design a dynamic focusing quantizer to\naccommodate the unbalanced distribution of post-Softmax activations, which\ndynamically selects the most valuable interval for higher quantization\nresolution. Extensive experiments on five vision tasks, including image\nclassification, object detection, instance segmentation, point cloud\nclassification, and point cloud part segmentation, demonstrate the superiority\nof AIQViT over state-of-the-art PTQ methods.",

    "abstract": "Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems are strongly interacting electron\nsystems with topological order. These systems are characterized by novel ground\nstates, fractionally charged and neutral excitations. The neutral excitations\nare dominated by a low-energy collective magnetoroton mode. Here we derive and\nuse a quasi-one-dimensional model to investigate the ultrafast nonequilibrium\ndynamics of a laser-driven FQH system within a two-Landau-level approximation.\nAs opposed to the traditional and synthetic bilayers, our model accounts for\ninteractions where electrons can scatter from one Landau-level to another. By\nperforming exact time evolution of the system, we create an out-of-equilibrium\nstate following the laser pulse that shows rich physics. Our calculations show\nthe presence of non-trivial excited modes. One of these modes is\nelectromagnetically active and represent density oscillations of\n\\emph{magnetoplasmon} mode. Another mode is identified by evaluating the\noverlap of the initial state and the out-of-equilibrium state following the\nlaser pulse with a quadrupole operator. This mode is analogous to the\nchiral-graviton mode for FQH systems recently measured in experiments [Nature\n{\\bf 628}, 78 (2024)]. Our results show that a linearly-polarized pulse field\ncan excite the graviton mode when inter-Landau level scattering occurs.",

A key finding reveals a trend in\n\"Publish-Before-Patch\" scenarios: maintainers prioritize patching severe\nvulnerabilities more quickly after public disclosure, reducing response time by\n48.3% from low (151 days) to critical severity (78 days). Additionally, project\ncharacteristics, such as contributor absence factor and issue activity,\nstrongly correlate with the presence of CVEs.

There exists the\nproblem that the effect of strongly curved harmonics and fringe fields on\ncompact accelerator beam dynamics is not well represented: existing approaches\nuse integrated cylindrical multipoles to describe and model the fields for beam\ndynamics studies, which are invalid in curved coordinate systems and assume\nindividual errors cancel out over the full machine.

Together with this novel functional and standard central\ndifference stencil, we then propose a linear, second-order variable-step BDF2\ntype stabilized exponential SAV scheme, namely BDF2-sESAV-I, which is shown to\npreserve both the discrete modified energy dissipation law under the temporal\nstepsize ratio $ 0 < r_{k} := \\tau_{k}/\\tau_{k-1} < 4.864 - \\delta $ with a\npositive constant $\\delta$ and the MBP under $ 0 < r_{k} < 1 + \\sqrt{2} $.\nMoreover, an analysis of the approximation to the original energy by the\nmodified one is presented. With the help of the kernel recombination technique,\noptimal $ H^{1}$- and $ L^{\\infty}$-norm error estimates of the variable-step\nBDF2-sESAV-I scheme are rigorously established.

However, the underlying\nmechanisms of tissue interaction and sparing are not fully understood. In this\nstudy, we aim to investigate a multi-part probe designed to mimic the\nreciprocating motion of ovipositors. A reciprocal insertion model was developed\nto study the interaction between the probe and soft tissue, and experimental\ntesting was conducted using a force sensor and laser optical technique to gain\ninsights into interacting forces and tissue deformation. The results reveal\nthat during the cutting phase of reciprocal motion, the peak force and average\ndisplacement of the soft substrate were approximately 19% and 20% lower,\nrespectively, compared to direct insertion at an overall probe velocity of 1\nmm/s. This study presents a novel approach combining mechanical modeling and\nexperimental analysis to explore the force mechanics of the reciprocating\ninsertion method, providing a better understanding of the interaction between\nthe probe and soft tissue.",

The\nMicroservices architecture, known for its modularity, flexibility and\nscalability, offers a solution for large-scale applications allowing them to\nadapt and meet the demand on an ever increasing user base. Despite its\nadvantages, migrating from a monolithic to a microservices architecture is\noften costly and complex, with the decomposition step being a significant\nchallenge. This research addresses this issue by introducing MonoEmbed, a\nLanguage Model based approach for automating the decomposition process.\nMonoEmbed leverages state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nrepresentation learning techniques to generate representation vectors for\nmonolithic components, which are then clustered to form microservices. By\nevaluating various pre-trained models and applying fine-tuning techniques such\nas Contrastive Learning and Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), MonoEmbed aims to\noptimize these representations for microservice partitioning. The evaluation of\nthe fine-tuned models showcases that they were able to significantly improve\nthe quality of the representation vectors when compared with pre-trained models\nand traditional representations.

The formation\nenergy of the resultant 1147 Janus 2D-bulk heterostructures were analyzed and\n828 were found to be thermodynamically stable.

However, the process typically\nrequires substantial data and computation resources. Recent studies have\nrevealed that alignment might be attainable at lower costs through simpler\nmethods, such as in-context learning. This leads to the question: Is alignment\npredominantly superficial? In this paper, we delve into this question and\nprovide a quantitative analysis. We formalize the concept of superficial\nknowledge, defining it as knowledge that can be acquired through easily token\nrestyling, without affecting the model's ability to capture underlying causal\nrelationships between tokens. We propose a method to extract and isolate\nsuperficial knowledge from aligned models, focusing on the shallow\nmodifications to the final token selection process. By comparing models\naugmented only with superficial knowledge to fully aligned models, we quantify\nthe superficial portion of alignment. Our findings reveal that while\nsuperficial knowledge constitutes a significant portion of alignment,\nparticularly in safety and detoxification tasks, it is not the whole story.\nTasks requiring reasoning and contextual understanding still rely on deeper\nknowledge. Additionally, we demonstrate two practical advantages of isolated\nsuperficial knowledge: (1) it can be transferred between models, enabling\nefficient offsite alignment of larger models using extracted superficial\nknowledge from smaller models, and (2) it is recoverable, allowing for the\nrestoration of alignment in compromised models without sacrificing performance.",

Nonetheless, these solutions have predominantly been\ncrafted for and assessed in the context of synchronous FL systems, with minimal\nfocus on asynchronous FL. This gap arises in part due to the unique challenges\nposed by the asynchronous setting, such as the lack of coordinated updates,\nincreased variability in client participation, and the potential for more\nsevere privacy risks. These concerns have stymied the adoption of asynchronous\nFL. In this work, we first demonstrate the privacy vulnerabilities of\nasynchronous FL through a novel data reconstruction attack that exploits\ngradient updates to recover sensitive client data. To address these\nvulnerabilities, we propose a privacy-preserving framework that combines a\ngradient obfuscation mechanism with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for\nsecure asynchronous FL aggregation at the network edge. To overcome the\nlimitations of conventional enclave attestation, we introduce a novel\ndata-centric attestation mechanism based on Multi-Authority Attribute-Based\nEncryption. This mechanism enables clients to implicitly verify TEE-based\naggregation services, effectively handle on-demand client participation, and\nscale seamlessly with an increasing number of asynchronous connections. Our\ngradient obfuscation mechanism reduces the structural similarity index of data\nreconstruction by 85% and increases reconstruction error by 400%, while our\nframework improves attestation efficiency by lowering average latency by up to\n1500% compared to RA-TLS, without additional overhead.",

The $\\alpha$-Alternator leverages the Vendi Score (VS), a flexible\nsimilarity-based diversity metric, to adjust, at each time step $t$, the\ninfluence of the sequence element at time $t$ and the latent representation of\nthe dynamics up to that time step on the predicted future dynamics. This\ninfluence is captured by a parameter that is learned and shared across all\nsequences in a given dataset. The sign of this parameter determines the\ndirection of influence. A negative value indicates a noisy dataset, where a\nsequence element that increases the VS is considered noisy, and the model\nrelies more on the latent history when processing that element. Conversely,\nwhen the parameter is positive, a sequence element that increases the VS is\nconsidered informative, and the $\\alpha$-Alternator relies more on this new\ninput than on the latent history when updating its predicted latent dynamics.\nThe $\\alpha$-Alternator is trained using a combination of observation masking\nand Alternator loss minimization. Masking simulates varying noise levels in\nsequences, enabling the model to be more robust to these fluctuations and\nimproving its performance in trajectory prediction, imputation, and\nforecasting. Our experimental results demonstrate that the $\\alpha$-Alternator\noutperforms both Alternators and state-of-the-art state-space models across\nneural decoding and time-series forecasting benchmarks.",

Salient events like monetary policy decisions and\nemployment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of\neconomic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between\nevents and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either\non textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the\nmulti-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between\nevents and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF\n(Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a\nmulti-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series\ndata with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event\naugmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our\ncontributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal\nrelationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new\nfinancial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April\n2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets;\nand (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy.

    "abstract": "Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as\nthe number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar,\nand model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been\nquantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node\nfeatures, such as the Dirichlet energy. While these metrics are related to\noversmoothing, we argue they have critical limitations and fail to reliably\ncapture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide\nmeaningful insights only for very deep networks and under somewhat strict\nconditions on the norm of network weights and feature representations. As an\nalternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or\neffective rank of the feature representations. We provide theoretical support\nfor this approach, demonstrating that the numerical rank of feature\nrepresentations converges to one for a broad family of nonlinear activation\nfunctions under the assumption of nonnegative trained weights. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first result that proves the occurrence of\noversmoothing in the nonlinear setting without assumptions on the boundedness\nof the weight matrices. Along with the theoretical findings, we provide\nextensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures. Our results\nshow that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas\nenergy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that a significant drop in\nthe rank aligns closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where\nenergy metrics remain unchanged.",

The proposed method inserts fiber-aligned\nseams sequentially until each resulting sub-ply can be manufactured from\navailable materials, while simultaneously enforcing constraints to avoid\nquality issues induced by the stacking of seams across multiple plies.\nLeveraging the developable nature of individual plies, the partitioning problem\nis cast as a sequence of one-dimensional piecewise linear optimization\nproblems, thus allowing for efficient local optimization via linear\nprogramming. We experimentally demonstrate that coupling the local search with\na greedy global search produces the same results as an exhaustive search. The\nresulting automated method provides an efficient and robust alternative to the\nexisting trial-and-error approach, and can be readily integrated into\nstate-of-the-art composite design workflows. In addition, this formulation\nenables the inclusion of common constraints regarding laminate thickness\ntolerance, sub-ply geometry, stay-out zones, material wastage, etc. The\nefficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through its application to the\nsurface of an airplane wing and to the body panels of an armored vehicle, each\nsubject to various performance and manufacturing-related geometric constraints.",

    "abstract": "Vibrational microscopy provides label-free, bond-selective chemical contrast\nby detecting molecular vibrations, making it invaluable for biomedical\nresearch. While conventional methods rely on the direct detection of Raman\nscattering or infrared absorption, recently developed vibrational photothermal\n(ViP) microscopy achieves chemical contrast indirectly through refractive index\n(RI) changes. This indirect approach enables unique imaging capabilities beyond\ntraditional chemical imaging. Here, we introduce a novel application of ViP\nmicroscopy: label-free intracellular thermophoretic (Soret) imaging, which\nvisualizes biomolecular transport driven by temperature gradients. ViP-induced\nSoret (ViPS) imaging leverages a steady-state temperature distribution\ngenerated by optical heating through vibrational photothermal effect, combined\nwith time-resolved RI imaging via optical diffraction tomography (ODT). Using\nViPS imaging, we measured thermophoretic behavior in living COS7 cells,\ndetermining intracellular diffusion and Soret coefficients. Notably, we\nobserved a reversed direction of molecular transport (negative Soret effect) in\nthe cytoplasm compared to the nucleus, possibly driven by\nthermophoresis-induced diffusiophoresis. Furthermore, time-lapse imaging under\nCO2-depleted conditions revealed a remarkable reduction in thermophoretic\nactivity, suggesting glass formation during the dying process, likely due to\npolymer aggregation. ViPS imaging represents a new frontier in intracellular\nthermophoretic studies, expanding the capabilities of vibrational microscopy.",

    "abstract": "A widely used strategy to discover and understand language model mechanisms\nis circuit analysis. A circuit is a minimal subgraph of a model's computation\ngraph that executes a specific task. We identify a gap in existing circuit\ndiscovery methods: they assume circuits are position-invariant, treating model\ncomponents as equally relevant across input positions. This limits their\nability to capture cross-positional interactions or mechanisms that vary across\npositions. To address this gap, we propose two improvements to incorporate\npositionality into circuits, even on tasks containing variable-length examples.\nFirst, we extend edge attribution patching, a gradient-based method for circuit\ndiscovery, to differentiate between token positions. Second, we introduce the\nconcept of a dataset schema, which defines token spans with similar semantics\nacross examples, enabling position-aware circuit discovery in datasets with\nvariable length examples. We additionally develop an automated pipeline for\nschema generation and application using large language models. Our approach\nenables fully automated discovery of position-sensitive circuits, yielding\nbetter trade-offs between circuit size and faithfulness compared to prior work.",

    "abstract": "Human intelligence involves metacognitive abilities like self-regulation,\nrecognizing limitations, and seeking assistance only when needed. While LLM\nAgents excel in many domains, they often lack this awareness. Overconfident\nagents risk catastrophic failures, while those that seek help excessively\nhinder efficiency. A key challenge is enabling agents with a limited\nintervention budget $C$ is to decide when to request assistance. In this paper,\nwe propose an offline framework that trains a \"helper\" policy to request\ninterventions, such as more powerful models or test-time compute, by combining\nLLM-based process reward models (PRMs) with tabular reinforcement learning.\nUsing state transitions collected offline, we score optimal intervention timing\nwith PRMs and train the helper model on these labeled trajectories. This\noffline approach significantly reduces costly intervention calls during\ntraining. Furthermore, the integration of PRMs with tabular RL enhances\nrobustness to off-policy data while avoiding the inefficiencies of deep RL. We\nempirically find that our method delivers optimal helper behavior.",

    "abstract": "Given an unnormalized probability density $\\pi\\propto\\mathrm{e}^{-V}$,\nestimating its normalizing constant\n$Z=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d}\\mathrm{e}^{-V(x)}\\mathrm{d}x$ or free energy $F=-\\log Z$\nis a crucial problem in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and machine\nlearning. It is challenging especially in high dimensions or when $\\pi$ is\nmultimodal. To mitigate the high variance of conventional importance sampling\nestimators, annealing-based methods such as Jarzynski equality and annealed\nimportance sampling are commonly adopted, yet their quantitative complexity\nguarantees remain largely unexplored. We take a first step toward a\nnon-asymptotic analysis of annealed importance sampling. In particular, we\nderive an oracle complexity of\n$\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d\\beta^2{\\mathcal{A}}^2}{\\varepsilon^4}\\right)$ for\nestimating $Z$ within $\\varepsilon$ relative error with high probability, where\n$\\beta$ is the smoothness of $V$ and $\\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action of a\ncurve of probability measures interpolating $\\pi$ and a tractable reference\ndistribution. Our analysis, leveraging Girsanov theorem and optimal transport,\ndoes not explicitly require isoperimetric assumptions on the target\ndistribution. Finally, to tackle the large action of the widely used geometric\ninterpolation of probability distributions, we propose a new normalizing\nconstant estimation algorithm based on reverse diffusion samplers and establish\na framework for analyzing its complexity.",
