The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed\nbetween minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a\nnovel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot\nexpansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and\n(4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to\ngroup-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically\ndiverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing\nPortuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks,\nexperiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields\nstrong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets,\ndemonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset\nis publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech\ndetection in low-resource settings.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the growing need to leverage sensitive data across\ninstitutions has led to increased attention on federated learning (FL), a\ndecentralized machine learning paradigm that enables model training without\nsharing raw data. However, existing FL-based clustering methods, known as\nfederated clustering, typically assume simple data partitioning scenarios such\nas horizontal or vertical splits, and cannot handle more complex distributed\nstructures. This study proposes data collaboration clustering (DC-Clustering),\na novel federated clustering method that supports clustering over complex data\npartitioning scenarios where horizontal and vertical splits coexist. In\nDC-Clustering, each institution shares only intermediate representations\ninstead of raw data, ensuring privacy preservation while enabling collaborative\nclustering. The method allows flexible selection between k-means and spectral\nclustering, and achieves final results with a single round of communication\nwith the central server. We conducted extensive experiments using synthetic and\nopen benchmark datasets. The results show that our method achieves clustering\nperformance comparable to centralized clustering where all data are pooled.\nDC-Clustering addresses an important gap in current FL research by enabling\neffective knowledge discovery from distributed heterogeneous data. Its\npractical properties -- privacy preservation, communication efficiency, and\nflexibility -- make it a promising tool for privacy-sensitive domains such as\nhealthcare and finance.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, with the advancements in machine learning and neural\nnetworks, algorithms using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve\nPDEs have gained widespread applications. While these algorithms are\nwell-suited for a wide range of equations, they often exhibit suboptimal\nperformance when applied to equations with large local gradients, resulting in\nsubstantial localized errors. To address this issue, this paper proposes an\nadaptive PINN algorithm designed to improve accuracy in such cases. The core\nidea of the algorithm is to adaptively adjust the distribution of collocation\npoints based on the recovery-type a-posterior error of the current numerical\nsolution, enabling a better approximation of the true solution. This approach\nis inspired by the adaptive finite element method. By combining the\nrecovery-type a-posteriori estimator, a gradient-recovery estimator commonly\nused in the adaptive finite element method (FEM) with PINNs, we introduce the\nRecovery-type a-posteriori estimator enhanced adaptive PINN (R-PINN) and\ncompare its performance with a typical adaptive PINN algorithm, FI-PINN. Our\nresults demonstrate that R-PINN achieves faster convergence with fewer adaptive\npoints and significantly outperforms in the cases with multiple regions of\nlarge errors than FI-PINN. Notably, our method is a hybrid numerical approach\nfor solving partial differential equations, integrating adaptive FEM with\nPINNs.",

Earlier methods rely on dense\nBEV features, which are costly to construct. More recent works explore sparse\nquery-based detection. However, they still require a large number of queries\nand can become expensive to run when more video frames are used. In this paper,\nwe propose DySS, a novel method that employs state-space learning and dynamic\nqueries. More specifically, DySS leverages a state-space model (SSM) to\nsequentially process the sampled features over time steps. In order to\nencourage the model to better capture the underlying motion and correspondence\ninformation, we introduce auxiliary tasks of future prediction and masked\nreconstruction to better train the SSM. The state of the SSM then provides an\ninformative yet efficient summarization of the scene. Based on the state-space\nlearned features, we dynamically update the queries via merge, remove, and\nsplit operations, which help maintain a useful, lean set of detection queries\nthroughout the network. Our proposed DySS achieves both superior detection\nperformance and efficient inference. Specifically, on the nuScenes test split,\nDySS achieves 65.31 NDS and 57.4 mAP, outperforming the latest state of the\nart. On the val split, DySS achieves 56.2 NDS and 46.2 mAP, as well as a\nreal-time inference speed of 33 FPS.",

A designed feature estimation loop ensures\nstable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of\nview. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback\nloop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period.\nAlso, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the\nsystem in the entire range of operations. The nonlinear camera and robot\nmanipulator model is linearized and decoupled online by an adaptive algorithm.\nThe adaptive controller is then computed based on the linearized model\nevaluated at current linearized point.

    "abstract": "Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity\nchallenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However,\nmedical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders,\nnon-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance\nand scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to\naddress these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient\nLarge Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach\nthat simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports\nand radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework\ncentered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate\nour method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a\ndownstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our\nmethod. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited\n3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model\nwith FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction,\nadding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves\nclassifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our\nmethod's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real\nimages alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image\nquality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal\nhuman annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables\nradiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical\nimage synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving\nLDM performance and scientific accessibility.

These results are\ncompared against those from a canonical two-bladed rotor producing similar\nlift. The aerial screw demonstrates 42.2% lower mechanical power consumption\nand 72.3% lower acoustic intensity per unit lift, primarily due to its larger\nwetted area and correspondingly lower rotational speed. Although the aerial\nscrew exhibits a lower lift coefficient and much of its surface contributes\nminimally to lift generation, the net performance under iso-lift conditions\nhighlights its efficiency and reduced noise signature. The continuous spiral\ngeometry of the aerial screw also helps suppress blade-vortex interaction noise\ncommon in multi-bladed systems.

This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and\nDF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It\nhas been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two\ngas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are\nkinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a\nfunction of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and\nDF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven\nadditional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses\npresented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain\nmeasurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag\narcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a\nnovel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on\nKeck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity\ntrend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly\noccurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly\nhigher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate,\nkinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail\nof galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event. A\n'bullet dwarf' collision remains the only known explanation for all the unusual\nproperties of DF2, DF4, and the associated trail of galaxies.",

With every $\\mathscr{B}$ one associates\nthe corresponding taut set $\\mathscr{B}'$ (determined uniquely among all taut\nsets by the condition that the associated Mirsky measures agree) and the\nminimal set $\\mathscr{B}^*$ (determined uniquely among all minimal sets by the\ncondition that every configuration appearing on $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathscr{B}^*}$\nappears on $\\mathcal{M}_\\mathscr{B}$: for every $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$, there exists\n$k\\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathscr{B}^*}\\cap\n[0,n]=\\mathcal{M}_\\mathscr{B} \\cap[k,k+n]-k$). Besicovitch [2] gave an example\nof $\\mathscr{B}$ whose set of multiples does not have the natural density. It\nwas proved in [7, Lemma 4.18] that if $\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathscr{B}'}$ posses the\nnatural density then so does $\\mathcal{M}_\\mathscr{B}$. In this paper we show\nthat this is the only obstruction: every configuration $ijk\\in \\{0,1\\}^3$ (with\n$ij\\neq 01$), encoding the information on the existence of the natural density\nfor the triple\n$\\mathcal{M}_\\mathscr{B},\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathscr{B'}},\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathscr{B}^*}$,\ncan occur.

Since DFT itself is based on several approximations, MLIPs may\ninherit systematic errors that lead to discrepancies with experimental data. In\nthis paper, we use a trajectory re-weighting technique to refine DFT\npre-trained MLIPs to match the target experimental Extended X-ray Absorption\nFine Structure (EXAFS) spectra. EXAFS spectra are sensitive to the local\nstructural environment around an absorbing atom. Thus, refining an MLIP to\nimprove agreement with experimental EXAFS spectra also improves the MLIP\nprediction of other structural properties that are not directly involved in the\nrefinement process. We combine this re-weighting technique with transfer\nlearning and a minimal number of training epochs to avoid overfitting to the\nlimited experimental data. The refinement approach demonstrates significant\nimprovement for two MLIPs reported in previous work, one for an established\nnuclear fuel: uranium dioxide (UO$_2$) and second one for a nuclear fuel\ncandidate: uranium mononitride (UN). We validate the effectiveness of our\napproach by comparing the results obtained from the original (unrefined)\nDFT-based MLIP and the EXAFS-refined MLIP across various properties, such as\nlattice parameters, bulk modulus, heat capacity, point defect energies, elastic\nconstants, phonon dispersion spectra, and diffusion coefficients. An accurate\nMLIP for nuclear fuels is extremely beneficial as it enables reliable atomistic\nsimulation, which greatly reduces the need for large number of expensive and\ninherently dangerous experimental nuclear integral tests, traditionally\nrequired for the qualification of efficient and resilient fuel candidates.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the integration of Additive Manufacturing (or 3D\nprinting) into decentralized supply chains, focusing on the strategic decisions\nmanufacturers and retailers make when facing capacity constraints. Using a\nStackelberg game framework, we analyze how AM impacts traditional wholesale\npricing across two scenarios. First, a manufacturer producing two distinct\nproducts and second, a case involving multiple products, each affected by AM's\ncapacity limitations. For the first scenario, we derive sufficient conditions\nto find the equilibrium under a generic demand distribution, and for a uniform\ndistribution, we fully derive the equilibrium and identify the critical cost\nthreshold below which AM adoption is preferable. For the second scenario, we\ndetermine the conditions for the equilibrium, offering insights into the\nfeasibility of AM relative to traditional manufacturing. Furthermore, we find\nthat, contrary to some literature, even when AM incurs higher per-unit costs\nthan traditional methods, it remains viable for some supply chains. However,\nlimited AM capacity, particularly under high demand, may restrict its adoption,\nhighlighting capacity constraints as a pivotal factor in AM decision-making.\nThis study extends current research by examining multi-product and\ncapacity-driven scenarios, providing valuable guidance for supply chain\nmanagers weighing the benefits of traditional manufacturing against those of\nAM.",

Using exact diagonalization and\nspecialized numerical solvers, we map the system's phase space through its\nspectral properties and localization characteristics, quantified by the Inverse\nParticipation Ratio (IPR).

Some of our sample stars are enhanced in Sr, with [Sr/Ba] reaching\nup to 0.7. These stars gained their high Sr abundance from a poorly understood\nprocess, which may appear to be a weak s-process or a weak r-process.

We compute Ba isotope mixtures corresponding to different r- to\ns-process contributions and determine the corresponding abundances from the Ba\nII resonance lines in each sample star.

We then compare the Ba abundances derived from the\nsubordinate lines with those from the Ba II resonance lines. We find a higher\ns-process contribution to Ba isotopes in stars with greater [Sr/Eu] and [Sr/Ba]\noverabundances, suggesting that the additional Sr synthesis was due to the\nearly s-process occurring in massive stars. We estimate the [Sr/Ba] ratio\nproduced by the early s-process and obtain [Sr/Ba]_earlyS = 1.1 +- 0.2.\nRegarding the potential synthesis of Sr and Ba in the i-process in massive\nstars, our results argue that there was no detectable contribution from this\nprocess within the error bars in our sample stars.

However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and\nmulti-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness,\ntransparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical\ndeterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed\nobservations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also\nimplement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated\nautonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use\nof these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness\nshields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in\nsequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By\noptimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints,\nthis method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For\ntransparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing\nintentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing\nquantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to\npropose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining\nresponsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify\nthese contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework,\nproviding a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches.\nCollectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the\nrealization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the\nfoundations for future research in trustworthy AI.",

In dynamics with fast\nentanglement generation, quantum observables generally become insensitive to\nthe details of the underlying dynamics at long times due to the effects of\nscrambling. In experimental systems, repeated time-reversal protocols have been\nsuccessfully implemented to restore sensitivities of quantum observables. Using\na 103-qubit superconducting quantum processor, we characterize ergodic dynamics\nusing the second-order out-of-time-order correlators, OTOC$^{(2)}$. In contrast\nto dynamics without time reversal, OTOC$^{(2)}$ are observed to remain\nsensitive to the underlying dynamics at long time scales. Furthermore, by\ninserting Pauli operators during quantum evolution and randomizing the phases\nof Pauli strings in the Heisenberg picture, we observe substantial changes in\nOTOC$^{(2)}$ values. This indicates that OTOC$^{(2)}$ is dominated by\nconstructive interference between Pauli strings that form large loops in\nconfiguration space. The observed interference mechanism endows OTOC$^{(2)}$\nwith a high degree of classical simulation complexity, which culminates in a\nset of large-scale OTOC$^{(2)}$ measurements exceeding the simulation capacity\nof known classical algorithms. Further supported by an example of Hamiltonian\nlearning through OTOC$^{(2)}$, our results indicate a viable path to practical\nquantum advantage.",

These\nfeatures make such states particularly well-suited for a wide range of quantum\ninformation tasks. Here, we provide a pedagogic analysis of the mathematical\nstructure and relevant physical properties of this class of states. Beyond the\ntheoretical framework, robust tools for certifying and verifying the properties\nof symmetric states in experimental settings are essential. In this regard, we\nexplore how standard techniques -- such as quantum state tomography, Bell\ntests, and entanglement witnesses -- can be specifically adapted for symmetric\nsystems. Next, we provide an up-to-date overview of the most relevant\napplications in which these states outperform other classes of states in\nspecific tasks. Specifically, we address their central role in quantum\nmetrology, highlight their use in quantum error correction codes, and examine\ntheir contribution in computation and communication tasks. Finally, we present\nthe current state-of-the-art in their experimental generation, ranging from\nsystems of cold atoms to implementations via quantum algorithms. We also review\nthe most significant results obtained in the different experimental\nrealizations.

However, ensuring adequate\ndiversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a\nchallenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the\ndiversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion\nacross semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance\nvia diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we\nextend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable\nPrompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for\nprompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for\ndiversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on\nsimilar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the\nentropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance\non the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in\nlarge-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case\nof Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and\ngradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy\nmeasures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for\ndiversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on\ndifferent prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several\ntext-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves\nthe prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant\ncomputational costs.

    "abstract": "DeepPolar codes have recently emerged as a promising approach for channel\ncoding, demonstrating superior bit error rate (BER) performance compared to\nconventional polar codes. Despite their excellent BER characteristics, these\ncodes exhibit suboptimal block error rate (BLER) performance, creating a\nfundamental BER-BLER trade-off that severely limits their practical deployment\nin communication systems. This paper introduces DeepPolar+, an enhanced neural\npolar coding framework that systematically eliminates this BER-BLER trade-off\nby simultaneously improving BLER performance while maintaining the superior BER\ncharacteristics of DeepPolar codes. Our approach achieves this breakthrough\nthrough three key innovations: (1) an attention-enhanced decoder architecture\nthat leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to capture complex\ndependencies between bit positions, (2) a structured loss function that jointly\noptimizes for both bit-level accuracy and block-level reliability, and (3) an\nadaptive SNR-Matched Redundancy Technique (SMART) for decoding DeepPolar+ code\n(DP+SMART decoder) that combines specialized models with CRC verification for\nrobust performance across diverse channel conditions. For a (256,37) code\nconfiguration, DeepPolar+ demonstrates notable improvements in both BER and\nBLER performance compared to conventional successive cancellation decoding and\nDeepPolar, while achieving remarkably faster convergence through improved\narchitecture and optimization strategies. The DeepPolar+SMART variant further\namplifies these dual improvements, delivering significant gains in both error\nrate metrics over existing approaches. DeepPolar+ effectively bridges the gap\nbetween theoretical potential and practical implementation of neural polar\ncodes, offering a viable path forward for next-generation error correction\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "Eccentric white dwarf-massive black hole binaries can potentially source some\nextreme X-ray transients, including the recently observed quasi-periodic X-ray\neruptions and tidal disruption events at the galactic nuclei. Meanwhile, they\nare one of the target gravitational wave sources with extreme mass ratios for\nfuture millihertz gravitational wave missions. In this work, we focus on the\ntidal evolution and orbital dynamics of such binaries under the influence of\nthe tidal backreaction and the dissipative effect from gravitational wave\nemission. We find that the latter can cause the dynamical tide to evolve\nchaotically after more than one orbital harmonics encounter the mode resonance\nthrough orbital decay. Different from the tidal-driven chaos, which only occurs\nfor pericenter distances within around two times the tidal radius ($R_t$), this\ngravitational wave-driven chaos can happen at much larger pericenter distances.\nThe growth scales similarly to a diffusive process, in which the tidal energy\ngrows linearly with time on average over a long duration. If the tidal energy\neventually approaches the stellar binding energy, achievable when the\npericenter distance is less than $4R_t$, it can cause mass ejection as the wave\nbreaks due to nonlinear effects. We show that this can potentially lead to the\nrepeating partial tidal disruptions observed at galactic centers. That means\nthese disruptions can occur at a much larger pericenter distance than previous\nanalytical estimates. Furthermore, if the system can evolve to a close\npericenter distance of about 2.7$R_t$, the white dwarf can further lose mass\nvia tidal stripping at each pericenter passage.

In the\npresent study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL)\nframework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic\nlift in arbitrarily long gust sequences via pitch control. The random gusts\nproduce intermittent, high-variance flows observed only through limited surface\npressure sensors, making this control problem inherently challenging compared\nto stationary flows. The transformer addresses the challenge of partial\nobservability from the limited surface pressures. We demonstrate that the\ntraining can be accelerated with two techniques -- pretraining with an expert\npolicy (here, linear control) and task-level transfer learning (here, extending\na policy trained on isolated gusts to multiple gusts). We show that the learned\nstrategy outperforms the best proportional control, with the performance gap\nwidening as the number of gusts increases. The control strategy learned in an\nenvironment with a small number of successive gusts is shown to effectively\ngeneralize to an environment with an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We\ninvestigate the pivot configuration and show that quarter-chord pitching\ncontrol can achieve superior lift regulation with substantially less control\neffort compared to mid-chord pitching control. Through a decomposition of the\nlift, we attribute this advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution\naccessible via quarter-chord pitching.",

KLJN's security, grounded\nin the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental\nand radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions\nof satellite communications.

Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy\nto capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While\ngoal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on\nin-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to\ntasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial\ngeneralization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of\ntemporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally\nrelated states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the\nout-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence,\nencouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should\nfacilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which\nencode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely\nencapsulate this property.

    "abstract": "Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of\nmesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of\ndensely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core\nnodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the\nperipheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been\nmuch research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few\ncore-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e.,\n``temporal\") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal\nnetworks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we\ngeneralize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure\n\\cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In\ncontrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is\nassigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core),\nhierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested\nstructures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint\nor have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale\nstructures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in\nany way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery\nstructure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our\nmethod for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world\ntemporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in\nthese networks.",

By considering clear-sky irradiance as a dynamic upper bound\nof measurement, sCV provides a normalized, dimensionless measure of variability\nthat theoretically ranges from 0 to 1. F extends sCV by integrating temporal\ndependencies via maximum autocorrelation, thus linking sCV with F.

    "abstract": "This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off\nbetween provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively\nwatertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of\nits outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be\nnarrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input\nhigh-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary\ngenerative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error\nperformance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By\nmaking this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous\nverification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions\nand philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical\nmotivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in\ninformation-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in\nepistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then\noffers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of\nunderdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The\ndiscussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape\nevaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The\nconclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the\ninequality for the future of trustworthy AI.",

Secondly, we apply a\nless-traditional impedance eduction method that incorporates the sheared\nvelocity profile to data obtained from real-world experiments. The results\nsuggest that the Ingard--Myers boundary condition remains a good approximation\nto a realistic boundary layer profile, such as the universal law of the wall,\nat least in the two-dimensional case.

This formulation preserves the full perceptual\ndifficulty while providing a binary, exact-match reward that is easy to compute\nand unambiguous. Models trained with the ViCrit Task exhibit substantial gains\nacross a variety of VL benchmarks.

Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers\nbegan to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output.\nNevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals their problems, such as\nintroducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation.\n  In this paper, we present D-LIFT, an enhanced decompiler-LLM pipeline with a\nfine-tuned LLM using code quality-aware reinforcement learning. Unlike prior\nwork that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LIFT adheres to a key principle for\nenhancing the quality of decompiled code: preserving accuracy while improving\nreadability. Central to D-LIFT, we propose D-Score, an integrated code quality\nassessment system to score the decompiled source code from multiple aspects,\nand use it to guide reinforcement learning fine-tuning and to select the best\noutput during inference. In line with our principle, D-Score assigns low scores\nto any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code\nthat passes the accuracy check. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range\nof LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code\nfrom the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without\nD-Score-driven fine-tuning, our trained LLMs produce 55.3% more improved\ndecompiled functions, as measured by D-Score. Overall, D-LIFT improves the\nquality of 68.2% of all the functions produced by the native decompiler.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has transformed the\ntelecommunications industry by promoting interoperability, vendor diversity,\nand rapid innovation. However, its disaggregated architecture introduces\ncomplex testing challenges, particularly in validating multi-vendor components\nagainst O-RAN ALLIANCE and 3GPP specifications. Existing frameworks, such as\nthose provided by Open Testing and Integration Centres (OTICs), rely heavily on\nmanual processes, are fragmented and prone to human error, leading to\ninconsistency and scalability issues. To address these limitations, we present\nAI5GTest -- an AI-powered, specification-aware testing framework designed to\nautomate the validation of O-RAN components. AI5GTest leverages a cooperative\nLarge Language Models (LLM) framework consisting of Gen-LLM, Val-LLM, and\nDebug-LLM. Gen-LLM automatically generates expected procedural flows for test\ncases based on 3GPP and O-RAN specifications, while Val-LLM cross-references\nsignaling messages against these flows to validate compliance and detect\ndeviations. If anomalies arise, Debug-LLM performs root cause analysis,\nproviding insight to the failure cause. To enhance transparency and\ntrustworthiness, AI5GTest incorporates a human-in-the-loop mechanism, where the\nGen-LLM presents top-k relevant official specifications to the tester for\napproval before proceeding with validation. Evaluated using a range of test\ncases obtained from O-RAN TIFG and WG5-IOT test specifications, AI5GTest\ndemonstrates a significant reduction in overall test execution time compared to\ntraditional manual methods, while maintaining high validation accuracy.",

Although numerous methods exist for single source\nlocalization, many relying on pseudo-linear formulations or non convex\noptimization techniques, there remains a significant gap in research addressing\nmulti source localization in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we\npropose a deep learning-based framework that leverages semantic segmentation\nmodels for multi source localization. Specifically, we employ UNet and UNetPP\nas backbone models, processing input images that encode the platform's\npositions along with the corresponding direction finding lines at each\nposition. By analyzing the intersections of these lines, the models effectively\nidentify and localize multiple sources. Through simulations, we evaluate both\nsingle- and multi-source localization scenarios.

This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for\nlocal clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification\nheads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to\nenable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients\nas a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can\naccount for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer\nand prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based\napproach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities,\nmaximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges'\nweights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to\nhighly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive\ninteraction and preserving personalization.

    "abstract": "Quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) sources in galactic nuclei are often associated\nwith a stellar object orbiting a supermassive black hole with hours-days\nperiod, brought in as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI). In the presence of\nan accretion disk, repeated star-disk collisions lead to ablation of a small\nfraction of the stellar mass during each disk passage. We analytically follow\nthe evolution of the stellar debris as it is tidally stretched outside the\nEMRI's Hill sphere, forming an elongated, dilute stream, that subsequently\ncollides with the disk, half an orbit after the previous star-disk encounter.\nAt sufficiently long orbital periods ($\\gtrsim 12$ hr), the stream is too\ndilute to penetrate the disk, and is instead strongly shocked and deflected at\nits surface through a reverse shock. We obtain the resulting emission and\nexplore implications for QPE observations. Due to their low optical depth and\nprolonged interaction time, radiation from the shocked streams typically\ndominates over that from shocked disk gas directly impacted by the star or by\nejecta confined within its Hill sphere, as was first proposed by Yao et al.\n2025. We find that: (1) QPE flare durations reflect the stream-disk collision\ntimescale; (2) Flare luminosities of $10^{42-43}$ erg/s, consistent with\nobserved QPEs, are robustly produced; (3) Soft X-ray flares with temperatures\nof ${\\sim}$100 eV arise when the stream mass is sufficient to sustain a\nradiation mediated shock at the collision interface. Higher mass streams yield\nsofter flares, typically outshone by the disk, while lower mass streams result\nin collisionless shocks, which likely produce fainter and harder flares. We\ndiscuss observational implications of the temporal evolution of the underlying\ndisk, assuming it is the remnant of a prior tidal disruption event in the same\ngalaxy.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the dynamics of strong free-surface turbulence (SFST)\nusing direct numerical simulations (DNS). We focus on the energy exchange\nbetween the deformed free-surface and underlying turbulence, examining the\ninfluence of Reynolds ($Re$), Froude ($Fr$), and Weber ($We$) numbers. The\ntwo-fluid DNS of SFST at high $Fr$ and $We$ is able to incorporate air\nentrainment effects in a statistical steady-state. Results reveal that high\n$We$ primarily affects entrained bubble shapes (sphericity), while $Fr$\nsignificantly alters free-surface deformation, two-dimensional compressibility,\nand turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) modulation. Vorticity flux across the\ninterface occurs from viscous diffusion of surface-parallel structures. At\nlower $Fr$, kinetic energy is redistributed between horizontal and vertical\ncomponents, aligning with rapid distortion theory (RDT), whereas higher $Fr$\npreserves isotropy near the surface. Evidence of a reverse or dual energy\ncascade is verified through third-order structure functions, with a strong net\nreverse cascade near the integral length scale, and enhanced vertical kinetic\nenergy in upwelling eddies. Discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) of TKE show\nweaker decay at smallest scales near the interface, suggesting contributions\nfrom gravitational energy conversion and reduced dissipation. The wavelet\nenergy spectra also exhibits different scaling laws across the wavenumber\nrange, with a $-3$ slope within the inertial subrange. These findings highlight\nscale- and proximity-dependent effects on two-phase TKE transport, with\nimplications for sub-grid modeling.

In this\nway, the ES plays an important probe to detect the topological phases according\nto this bulk-edge correspondence. When a system is fully gapped, both in bulk\nand edge, the ES still remains similar to the virtual edge spectrum which can\nbe explained by the recently proposed wormhole effect in the path integral of\nreduced density matrix.

In this work, we argue this property imposes fundamental\nlimitations on Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems,\nprecisely because they operate within natural language itself. Using Kolmogorov\ncomplexity, we demonstrate that as an expression's complexity grows, the amount\nof contextual information required to reliably resolve its ambiguity explodes\ncombinatorially. The computational intractability of recovering a single\nintended meaning for complex or ambiguous text therefore suggests that the\nclassical view that linguistic forms possess intrinsic meaning in and of\nthemselves is conceptually inadequate. We argue instead that meaning is\ndynamically actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act, a\nprocess whose non-deterministic nature is most appropriately described by a\nnon-classical, quantum-like logic. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a\nsemantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents. Our experiments yielded\naverage CHSH expectation values from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs producing\nvalues (e.g., 2.3-2.4) in significant violation of the classical boundary\n($|S|\\leq2$), demonstrating that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can\nexhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human\ncognition experiments.

We propose a\npatient-specific deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for automated IMPT\nreplanning, with a reward-shaping mechanism based on a $150$-point plan quality\nscore addressing competing clinical objectives. We formulate the planning\nprocess as a reinforcement learning problem where agents learn control policies\nto adjust optimization priorities, maximizing plan quality. Unlike\npopulation-based approaches, our framework trains agents for each patient using\ntheir planning Computed Tomography (CT) and augmented anatomies simulating\nanatomical changes (tumor progression and regression). This patient-specific\napproach leverages anatomical similarities along the treatment course, enabling\neffective plan adaptation. We implemented two DRL algorithms, Deep Q-Network\nand Proximal Policy Optimization, using dose-volume histograms (DVHs) as state\nrepresentations and a $22$-dimensional action space of priority adjustments.\nEvaluation on eight HNC patients using actual replanning CT data showed that\nboth agents improved initial plan scores from $120.78 \\pm 17.18$ to $139.59 \\pm\n5.50$ (DQN) and $141.50 \\pm 4.69$ (PPO), surpassing the replans manually\ngenerated by a human planner ($136.32 \\pm 4.79$).

We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy\nmerger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and\nspectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin\ncollisional ring galaxies, exhibiting a nearly identical morphology.

This starburst\nis likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the\nAGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical\nsimulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of\nthis rare morphology.

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of\nsolving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty\nremains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in\nhigh-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source,\nblack-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can\nbe highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require\nsignificant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address\nthese challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We\ninterpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to\nuse a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts.\nThis novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both\nthe model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also\nincorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text.\nTo perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data\nmodalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a\nnovel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt\noptimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey\nmodification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively\non closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields\nimprovements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on\na range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a\nviable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into\nthe era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based\nsystems.",

When observed by radio\ninterferometers, this EoR signal is strongly obscured by foregrounds that are\nseveral orders of magnitude stronger. Due to its inherently non-Gaussian\nnature, the EoR signal requires robust statistical tools to accurately separate\nit from these foreground contaminants, but current foreground separation\ntechniques focus primarily on recovering the EoR power spectrum, often\nneglecting valuable non-Gaussian information. Recent developments in\nastrophysics, particularly in the context of the Galactic interstellar medium,\nhave demonstrated the efficacy of scattering transforms - novel summary\nstatistics for highly non-Gaussian processes - for component separation tasks.\nMotivated by these advances, we extend the scattering transform formalism from\ntwo-dimensional data sets to three-dimensional EoR lightcones. To this end, we\nintroduce a 3D wavelet set from the tensor product of 2D isotropic wavelets in\nthe sky plane domain and 1D wavelets in the redshift domain. As generative\nmodels form the basis of component separation, our focus here is on building\nand validating generative models that can be used for component separation in\nfuture projects. To achieve this, we construct maximum entropy generative\nmodels to synthesise EoR lightcones, and statistically validate the generative\nmodel by quantitatively comparing the synthesised EoR lightcones with the\nsingle target lightcone used to construct them, using independent statistics\nsuch as the power spectrum and Minkowski Functionals. The synthesised\nlightcones agree well with the target lightcone both statistically and\nvisually, opening up the possibility of developing for component separation\nmethods using 3D scattering transforms.",

    "abstract": "Recent JWST mid-infrared (mid-IR) images, tracing polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbons (PAHs) and dust continuum emission, provide detailed views of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. Leveraging PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1\nand PHANGS-MUSE data, we measure the PAH and dust continuum emission lifetimes\nof gas clouds across 17 nearby star-forming galaxies by analyzing the relative\nspatial distributions of mid-IR (7.7-11.3$\\mu$m) and H$\\alpha$ emission at\nvarious scales. We find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale of gas clouds in\ngalaxy disks (excluding centers) ranges from 10 to 30Myr. After star formation\nis detected in H$\\alpha$, mid-IR emission persists for 3-7Myr during the\nstellar feedback phase, covering 70-80% of the H$\\alpha$ emission. This\nsignificant overlap is due to intense radiation from star-forming regions,\nilluminating the surrounding PAHs and dust grains. In most galaxies, the mid-IR\ntime-scale closely matches the molecular cloud lifetime measured with CO.\nAlthough mid-IR emission is complex as influenced by ISM distribution,\nradiation, and abundances of dust and PAHs, the similarity between the two\ntime-scales suggests that once gas clouds form with compact mid-IR emission,\nthey quickly provide sufficient shielding for stable CO formation. This is\nlikely due to our focus on molecular gas-rich regions of galaxies with\nnear-solar metallicity. Finally, we find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale is\nlonger in galaxies with well-defined HII regions and less structured\nbackgrounds, allowing photons to more efficiently heat the ambient ISM\nsurrounding the HII regions, rather than contributing to diffuse emission. This\nsuggests that the shape of the ISM also influences mid-IR emission.",

However, most existing\nmodels are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of\nmoving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene\nreconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training\ndata and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms.

    "abstract": "Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing\ndiffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image\nrestoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in\ndegraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect\ntext-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In\nthis paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel\nrestoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and\ntextual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale\nbenchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and\ncomplex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion\nframework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion\nmodels into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from\njoint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations,\nwhich are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text\nrecognition accuracy.

    "abstract": "If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured\nenvironments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces\nduring physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and\neasily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific\nsolutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware,\nsensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a\nmagnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly\ncustomizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a\nhobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired\nshape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled,\nparameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and\nits mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts\nconvex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular\ndesign framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to\nadjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization\nexperiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE\nof 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for\nshear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to\nunseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that\nimprove manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving\n91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy\nfor successful completion.

In this study, we evaluate how large language models handle\ntoxic comments in Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, languages with limited\nlabeled data. We built and manually labeled a dataset of 4,500 YouTube and\nTikTok comments drawn from videos across diverse categories, including music,\npolitics, sports, modeling, influencer content, discussions of sexism, and\ngeneral topics. Four models (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4.1, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude\n3 Opus) were tested in two modes: zero-shot and context-augmented. We measured\nprecision, recall, F1 score, accuracy and false positive rates. Including a\nshort context snippet raised recall by about 0.12 on average and improved F1\nscore by up to 0.10, though it sometimes increased false positives. The best\nbalance came from Gemini in context-augmented mode, reaching an F1 score of\n0.82 and accuracy of 0.82, while zero-shot GPT-4.1 led on precision and had the\nlowest false alarms. We show how adding minimal context can improve toxic\nlanguage detection in low-resource settings and suggest practical strategies\nsuch as improved prompt design and threshold calibration. These results show\nthat prompt design alone can yield meaningful gains in toxicity detection for\nunderserved Balkan language communities.",

Next, we build a real-world Multiverse reasoning model with\nco-design of data, algorithm, and system, enabling rapid and seamless transfer\nfrom frontier AR-LLMs. For data creation, we develop Multiverse Curator, an\nautomated LLM-assisted pipeline that transforms sequential reasoning chains\ninto structured training data, avoiding costly human annotations.\nAlgorithmically, we design Multiverse Attention to separate parallel reasoning\nsteps while keeping compatibility with causal attention for efficient training.\nSystematically, we implement Multiverse Engine to support parallel inference.\nIt features a dedicated interpreter that dynamically switches between\nsequential and parallel generation, triggered directly by the model. After a\n3-hour fine-tuning with 1K examples, our Multiverse-32B stands as the only\nopen-sourced non-AR model achieving performance on par with leading AR-LLMs of\nthe same scale, evidenced by AIME24 & 25 scores of 54% and 46%, respectively.\nMoreover, our budget control experiments show that Multiverse-32B exhibits\nsuperior scaling, outperforming AR-LLMs by 1.87% on average using the same\ncontext length.

Unlike conventional approaches that\npredict next step action(s) forward, CoA generates an entire trajectory by\nexplicit backward reasoning with task-specific goals through an action-level\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) process. This process is unified within a single\nautoregressive structure: (1) the first token corresponds to a stable keyframe\naction that encodes the task-specific goals; and (2) subsequent action tokens\nare generated autoregressively, conditioned on the initial keyframe and\npreviously predicted actions. This backward action reasoning enforces a\nglobal-to-local structure, allowing each local action to be tightly constrained\nby the final goal. To further realize the action reasoning structure, CoA\nincorporates four complementary designs: continuous action token\nrepresentation; dynamic stopping for variable-length trajectory generation;\nreverse temporal ensemble; and multi-token prediction to balance action chunk\nmodeling with global structure. As a result, CoA gives strong spatial\ngeneralization capabilities while preserving the flexibility and simplicity of\na visuo-motor policy.

    "abstract": "End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text,\nimage and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However,\nmost existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions\nin a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in\nthe same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object\ninteractions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control\nof multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders\napplications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and\nintroduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of\nconditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given\nreference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer\nlayout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues\nbetween the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we\ninject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure\nlayout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the\nhigh-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos.\nEmpirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our\nexplicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit\ncounterparts and other existing methods.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn\nto act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach\nthat combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data\n(robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting,\nand planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free\njoint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset\ncomprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong\nperformance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something\nv2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7\nrecall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models.\nAdditionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we\ndemonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering\ntasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on\nTempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to\nrobotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world\nmodel, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the\nDroid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different\nlabs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals.\nNotably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these\nenvironments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work\ndemonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small\namount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in\nthe physical world.",

Recent driving world models, developed exclusively on\nreal-world driving data composed mainly of safe expert trajectories, struggle\nto follow hazardous or non-expert behaviors, which are rare in such data. This\nlimitation restricts their applicability to tasks such as policy evaluation. In\nthis work, we address this challenge by enriching real-world human\ndemonstrations with diverse non-expert data collected from a driving simulator\n(e.g., CARLA), and building a controllable world model trained on this\nheterogeneous corpus. Starting with a video generator featuring a diffusion\ntransformer architecture, we devise several strategies to effectively integrate\nconditioning signals and improve prediction controllability and fidelity. The\nresulting model, ReSim, enables Reliable Simulation of diverse open-world\ndriving scenarios under various actions, including hazardous non-expert ones.\nTo close the gap between high-fidelity simulation and applications that require\nreward signals to judge different actions, we introduce a Video2Reward module\nthat estimates a reward from ReSim's simulated future.

Toward this end, we investigate the\nquantum block Krylov subspace projector (QBKSP) algorithm - a multireference\nquantum Lanczos method designed to accurately compute low-lying eigenenergies,\nincluding degenerate ones, of quantum systems. We present three compact quantum\ncircuits tailored to different problem settings for evaluating the required\nexpectation values. To assess the impact of the number and fidelity of initial\nreference states, as well as time evolution duration, we perform error-free and\nlimited-precision numerical simulations and quantum circuit simulations. Our\nresults show that using multiple reference states significantly enhances\nconvergence, particularly in precision-limited scenarios and in cases where a\nsingle reference state fails to capture all target eigenvalues.

We answer this question with Resa,\na family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse\nautoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to\ncapture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE\nto guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in\na target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning\ntraces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL\npost-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's\nreasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \\$1\nand training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to\nlightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning\nperformance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only\naround \\$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via\nSAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities\nextracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and\noverlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math\ncan be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining,\nand yield comparable gains.

However,\nexisting methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward,\ntext-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted\npurely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal\ninput. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in\nspatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and\ncontinuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental\nvisualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing\nto reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through\nelementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with\nbasic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing\nauxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships\nthrough direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling\nimposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning\napproaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training\nframework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing\nabilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors,\nand reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms\nexisting methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze\nnavigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and\nmulti-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.",

The fundamental mechanisms underlying\nquantum computation required the development and construction of quantum\ncomputers. These devices are referred to as NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale\nQuantum) devices. Not only are NISQ devices extremely limited in their qubit\ncount but they also suffer from noise during computation and this problem only\ngets worse as the size of the circuit increases which limits the practical use\nof quantum computers for modern day applications. This paper will focus on\nutilizing quantum circuit partitioning to overcome the inherent issues of NISQ\ndevices. Partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits has allowed\nfor the execution of quantum circuits that are too large to fit on one quantum\ndevice. There have been many previous approaches to quantum circuit\npartitioning and each of these approaches differ in how they work with some\nfocusing on hardware-aware partitioning, optimal graph-based partitioning,\nmulti-processor architectures and many more. These approaches achieve success\nin their objective but they often fail to scale well which impacts cost and\nnoise. The ultimate goal of this paper is to mitigate these issues by\nminimizing 3 important metrics; noise, time and cost. To achieve this we use\ndynamic partitioning for practical circuit cutting and we take advantage of the\nbenefits of hybrid execution where classical computation will be used alongside\nquantum hardware. This approach has proved to be beneficial with respect to\nnoise with classical execution enabling a 42.30% reduction in noise and a 40%\nreduction in the number of qubits required in cases where a mixture of\nclassical and quantum computation were required.",

Building on recent\nresearch, we first formulate a mixed integer program to maximize the number of\nparking stalls using a flow-based approach. Parking lots are rasterized into a\ngrid, and the proposed MIP model optimizes them in a generic manner, adapting\nto the grid resolution and stall size without the need for custom formulations.\nThe constraints ensure the connectivity of parking stalls and driveways to the\nentrance/exit. This formulation is then extended to the case of one-way driving\nlanes. We also propose valid inequalities and a branch-and-cut algorithm for\nthe one-way and two-way lane configurations. This approach eliminates flow\nvariables, big-M type constraints, and improves solution times for medium-sized\ninstances. The effectiveness of the suggested models is showcased on 325\nparking lots in New York City. For instances in which the flow version could be\nsolved in 15 minutes, the branch-and-cut algorithm improved the median runtimes\nby 87.43% for the one-way case and by 79.36% for the two-way case and resulted\nin better optimality gaps for the other instances, compared to the baseline\nflow-based formulation. Similar advantages were observed when run with a time\nbudget of two hours. One-way configurations accommodated up to 18.63% more\nvehicles on average than their two-way counterparts across all the instances.\nModifications to the proposed formulations that consider the turning\ncharacteristics of vehicles and the presence of multiple entrances and exits\nare also examined.",

Of note, among the few existing results recent studies have\nrevealed a significant \"local-computational\" gap in the context of a\nwell-studied sparse tensor principal component analysis (PCA), where a broad\nclass of local Markov chain methods exhibits a notable underperformance\nrelative to other polynomial-time algorithms. In this work, we propose a series\nof local-search methods that provably \"close\" this gap to the best known\npolynomial-time procedures in multiple regimes of the model, including and\ngoing beyond the previously studied regimes in which the broad family of local\nMarkov chain methods underperforms. Our framework includes: (1) standard greedy\nand randomized greedy algorithms applied to the (regularized) posterior of the\nmodel; and (2) novel random-threshold variants, in which the randomized greedy\nalgorithm accepts a proposed transition if and only if the corresponding change\nin the Hamiltonian exceeds a random Gaussian threshold-rather that if and only\nif it is positive, as is customary. The introduction of the random thresholds\nenables a tight mathematical analysis of the randomized greedy algorithm's\ntrajectory by crucially breaking the dependencies between the iterations, and\ncould be of independent interest to the community.",

Their ability to model the full data distribution\nhas opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative\nlearning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the\nclass-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to\nextracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify\nCanonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM\nfeatures preserve essential categorical information while discarding\nnon-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative\nsamples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the\ncore class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we\ndevelop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While\nthe student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers\ncore class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the\ntraining data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial\nrobustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals\ninstead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve\nnot just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that\ncan drive robust representation learning.",

Towards this end,\nwe study the sampling requirements for recovery of a continuous domain image\nfrom its low-pass Fourier samples by fitting a single hidden-layer INR with\nReLU activation and a Fourier features layer using a generalized form of weight\ndecay regularization. Our key insight is to relate minimizers of this\nnon-convex parameter space optimization problem to minimizers of a convex\npenalty defined over an infinite-dimensional space of measures. We identify a\nsufficient number of Fourier samples for which an image realized by an INR is\nexactly recoverable by solving the INR training problem.

The reduced action\ninvolves the cosmological constant and admits black hole solutions; among\nthese, the solutions of interest are the evaporating black holes. We solve the\nequations of motion perturbatively by demanding that the initial state geometry\nis a Minkowski space-time. When the infalling matter intersects the space-time\nboundary, the black hole forms and begins to evaporate. We find that as the\nblack hole evaporates, its horizon shrinks and at a finite space-time point, it\nmeets the singularity and a shockwave occurs. Along this hypersurface, the\nmetric can be continuously matched to a static end-state geometry. This\nend-state geometry is Minkowski space-time within the first-order of\nperturbation theory.",

Using\na validated phase-field Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn framework, we linearize the\ngoverning equations to analyze the onset and development of interfacial\ninstability driven by solute-induced surface tension gradients. A critical\ninterfacial thickness scaling inversely with the Marangoni number,\n$\\delta_\\mathrm{cr} \\sim Ma^{-1}$, emerges from the balance between advective\nand diffusive transport. Unlike sharp-interface scenarios where matched\nviscosity and diffusivity stabilize the interface, finite thickness induces\nasymmetric solute distributions and tangential velocity shifts that destabilize\nthe system. We identify universal power-law scalings of velocity and\nconcentration offsets with a modified Marangoni number $Ma^\\delta$, independent\nof capillary number and interfacial mobility. A critical crossover at\n$Ma^\\delta \\approx 590$ distinguishes diffusion-dominated stabilization from\nadvection-driven destabilization.

In this paper, we introduce QRHEAD (Query-Focused\nRetrieval Head), an improved set of attention heads that enhance retrieval from\nlong context. We identify QRHEAD by aggregating attention scores with respect\nto the input query, using a handful of examples from real-world tasks (e.g.,\nlong-context QA). We further introduce QR- RETRIEVER, an efficient and\neffective retriever that uses the accumulated attention mass of QRHEAD as\nretrieval scores. We use QR- RETRIEVER for long-context reasoning by selecting\nthe most relevant parts with the highest retrieval scores. On multi-hop\nreasoning tasks LongMemEval and CLIPPER, this yields over 10% performance gains\nover full context and outperforms strong dense retrievers. We also evaluate\nQRRETRIEVER as a re-ranker on the BEIR benchmark and find that it achieves\nstrong zero-shot performance, outperforming other LLM-based re-rankers such as\nRankGPT. Further analysis shows that both the querycontext attention scoring\nand task selection are crucial for identifying QRHEAD with strong downstream\nutility. Overall, our work contributes a general-purpose retriever and offers\ninterpretability insights into the long-context capabilities of LMs.",

A key obstacle to developing 3D-VL\ngeneralists lies in data scalability, hindered by the lack of an efficient\nscene representation. We propose LEO-VL, a 3D-VL model built upon condensed\nfeature grid (CFG), an efficient scene representation that bridges 2D\nperception and 3D spatial structure while significantly reducing token\noverhead. This efficiency unlocks large-scale training towards 3D-VL\ngeneralist, for which we curate over 700k high-quality 3D-VL data spanning four\ndomains of real-world indoor scenes and five tasks such as captioning and\ndialogue. LEO-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of 3D QA\nbenchmarks, including SQA3D, MSQA, and Beacon3D. Ablation studies confirm the\nefficiency of our representation, the importance of task and scene diversity,\nand the validity of our data curation principle.

Currently, a\nsignificant perception burden is placed on interventionalists to mentally\nreconstruct and predict catheter motions from biplane fluoroscopy images.\nEfforts to track these catheters are limited to planar segmentation or bulky\nsensing instrumentation, which are incompatible with microcatheters used in\nneurointervention. In this work, a catheter is equipped with custom radiopaque\nmarkers arranged to enable simultaneous shape and pose estimation under biplane\nfluoroscopy. A design measure is proposed to guide the arrangement of these\nmarkers to minimize sensitivity to marker tracking uncertainty. This approach\nwas deployed for microcatheters smaller than 2mm OD navigating phantom\nvasculature with shape tracking errors less than 1mm and catheter roll errors\nbelow 40 degrees. This work can enable steerable catheters to autonomously\nnavigate under biplane imaging.",

Our derivations show that FTN is advantageous for ISAC, and reveal new\ninsights that these advantages come from the fact that FTN signaling can\neffectively avoid the spectral aliasing due to the mismatch between the symbol\nrate and the bandwidth of the shaping pulse. Specifically, the communication\nspectral efficiency advantages of FTN signaling over time-invariant multipath\nchannels are analytically shown, where both upper- and lower-bounds on the\nspectral efficiency are derived. We show that the gap between these two bounds\ncorresponds to the potential signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation due to the\npresence of multipath delay and spectral aliasing, which diminishes as the\nsymbol rate grows higher. Particularly, in the limiting case, this SNR\nvariation disappears while the degree of freedom (DoF) of the system attain the\nmaximum. Furthermore, the sensing advantages for FTN signals are verified in\nterms of the expected normalized squared ambiguity function. We show that FTN\nsignals generally enjoy a more robust ranging performance. More importantly, we\nprove that FTN signaling can effectively avoid the undesired peaks in the\nconsidered ambiguity function along the Doppler dimension, thereby reducing the\nambiguities in velocity estimation. All these conclusions are explicitly\nverified by numerical results.",

    "abstract": "One promise that Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models hold over traditional\nimitation learning for robotics is to leverage the broad generalization\ncapabilities of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to produce versatile,\n\"generalist\" robot policies. However, current evaluations of VLAs remain\ninsufficient. Traditional imitation learning benchmarks are unsuitable due to\nthe lack of language instructions. Emerging benchmarks for VLAs that\nincorporate language often come with limited evaluation tasks and do not intend\nto investigate how much VLM pretraining truly contributes to the generalization\ncapabilities of the downstream robotic policy. Meanwhile, much research relies\non real-world robot setups designed in isolation by different institutions,\nwhich creates a barrier for reproducibility and accessibility. To address this\ngap, we introduce a unified probing suite of 50 simulation-based tasks across\n10 subcategories spanning language instruction, vision, and objects. We\nsystematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLA architectures on this\nsuite to understand their generalization capability. Our results show that\nwhile VLM backbones endow VLAs with robust perceptual understanding and high\nlevel planning, which we refer to as good intentions, this does not reliably\ntranslate into precise motor execution: when faced with out-of-distribution\nobservations, policies often exhibit coherent intentions, but falter in action\nexecution. Moreover, finetuning on action data can erode the original VLM's\ngeneralist reasoning abilities. We release our task suite and evaluation code\nto serve as a standardized benchmark for future VLAs and to drive research on\nclosing the perception-to-action gap.

This paper explores an approach to\nassess how a safety case is supported by its claims and evidence, toward\nestablishing credibility for the overall case. Starting from a description of\nthe building blocks of a safety case (claims, evidence, and optional\nformat-dependent entries), this paper delves into the assessment of support of\neach claim through the provided evidence. Two domains of assessment are\noutlined for each claim: procedural support (formalizing process specification)\nand implementation support (demonstrating process application). Additionally,\nan assessment of evidence status is also undertaken, independently from the\nclaims support. Scoring strategies and evaluation guidelines are provided,\nincluding detailed scoring tables for claim support and evidence status\nassessment. The paper further discusses governance, continual improvement, and\ntiming considerations for safety case assessments. Reporting of results and\nfindings is contextualized within its primary use for internal decision-making\non continual improvement efforts. The presented approach builds on state of the\nart auditing practices, but specifically tackles the question of judging the\ncredibility of a safety case. While not conclusive on its own, it provides a\nstarting point toward a comprehensive \"Case Credibility Assessment\" (CCA),\nstarting from the evaluation of the support for each claim (individually and in\naggregate), as well as every piece of evidence provided.

While\nthis is an apt description for the majority of stars with thin-disk-like\nabundances, there are a number of interesting exceptions. In this analysis, we\nidentify and investigate $\\sim 70$ stars with thin-disk-like abundances and\nvery slow or retrograde Galactocentric azimuthal velocities. These stars could\nbe kinematical outliers of the thin disk or elemental abundance outliers of the\nhalo. Focusing first on the former, we introduce a number of mechanisms that\ncould alter a thin disk orbit and cause the azimuthal velocity to become slow\nor retrograde. We then determine signatures for each mechanism and assess\nwhether that mechanism is unlikely, plausible, or consistent given each star's\nreported properties. We find that at least one mechanism is plausible for each\nstar, and the mechanism with the highest number of consistent candidate stars\nis dynamical ejection from stellar clusters. We next discuss scenarios that\ncould produce halo stars with thin disk abundances, and again identify stars\nthat could be connected to these mechanisms.

In this study, we address the problem by presenting an\nall-optical analog of the spin pumping method.

The lower level then matches\nconverted agents to minimize operational costs, such as pooling riders with\nsimilar itineraries into the same vehicle or consolidating multiple delivery\norders into a single trip. Motivated by these applications, we study the\noptimal value (cost) function of a linear programming model with respect to\nagent arrival rates, originally proposed by Aouad and Saritac (2022) for\ncost-minimizing dynamic stochastic matching under limited time. In particular,\nwe investigate the concavity of this cost function. We show that weak concavity\nholds when there are fewer than or equal to three agent types with identical\npatience level. For an arbitrary number of agent types, (weak) concavity is\nmore likely to hold when agents have high or similar patience, or when agents\nare more heterogeneous in their matching efficiencies.

    "abstract": "We introduce MetricHMR (Metric Human Mesh Recovery), an approach for metric\nhuman mesh recovery with accurate global translation from monocular images. In\ncontrast to existing HMR methods that suffer from severe scale and depth\nambiguity, MetricHMR is able to produce geometrically reasonable body shape and\nglobal translation in the reconstruction results. To this end, we first\nsystematically analyze previous HMR methods on camera models to emphasize the\ncritical role of the standard perspective projection model in enabling\nmetric-scale HMR. We then validate the acceptable ambiguity range of metric HMR\nunder the standard perspective projection model. Finally, we contribute a novel\napproach that introduces a ray map based on the standard perspective projection\nto jointly encode bounding-box information, camera parameters, and geometric\ncues for End2End metric HMR without any additional metric-regularization\nmodules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, even compared with sequential HMR methods, in\nmetric pose, shape, and global translation estimation across both indoor and\nin-the-wild scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their strong capabilities in\nvarious domains, and have been recently integrated for graph analysis as graph\nlanguage models (GLMs). With LLMs as the predictor, some GLMs can interpret\nunseen tasks described by natural language, and learn from a few examples in\nthe prompts without parameter tuning, known as in-context learning (ICL).\nAnother subset of GLMs utilizes abundant training labels to enhance model\nperformance, known as instruction tuning. However, we argue that ICL on graphs\nhas effectiveness issues due to fixed parameters and efficiency issues due to\nlong context. Meanwhile, the large amount of labeled data required for\ninstruction tuning can be difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To this\nend, we aim to introduce an extra parameter adaptation stage that can\nefficiently tailor GLMs to an unseen graph and task with only a few labeled\nexamples, in exchange for better prediction accuracy and faster inference\nspeed. For implementation, in this paper we propose GraphLAMA method, with its\nmodel backbone and learning schemes specialized for efficient tuning and\ninference. Specifically, for model backbone, we use a graph neural network\n(GNN) with several well-designed components to transform nodes into the\nrepresentation space of LLM tokens. Task instructions can then be represented\nas a mixture of node and language tokens. In the pre-training stage, model\nparameters except the LLM will be trained with different tasks to capture\ngeneral knowledge. In the adaptation stage, only a few pre-trained parameters\nwill be updated based on few-shot examples. Extensive experiments on\nfew/zero-shot node classification and summary generation show that our proposed\nGraphLAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance with 4.91% absolution\nimprovement in accuracy.

State-of-the-art methods aiming for\nstyle-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content\nfrom stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as\na reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a\nmethod designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner\nwhile preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content\nleakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that\ncontrols the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches\ncontaining the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best\nbalances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the\nlocalization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a\nreference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any\nmethod-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the\nstylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to\nquantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired\ncontent leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over\nstate-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances,\nconsistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content\nleakage.",

    "abstract": "Conformity with Benford's Law is widely used to detect irregularities in\nnumerical datasets, particularly in accounting, finance, and economics.\nHowever, the statistical tools commonly used for this purpose (such as\nChi-squared, MAD, or KS) suffer from three key limitations: sensitivity to\nsample size, lack of interpretability of their scale, and the absence of a\ncommon metric that allows for comparison across different statistics. This\npaper introduces the Equivalent Contamination Proportion (ECP) to address these\nissues. Defined as the proportion of contamination in a hypothetical\nBenford-conforming sample such that the expected value of the divergence\nstatistic matches the one observed in the actual data, the ECP provides a\ncontinuous and interpretable measure of deviation (ranging from 0 to 1), is\nrobust to sample size, and offers consistent results across different\ndivergence statistics under mild conditions. Closed-form and simulation-based\nmethods are developed for estimating the ECP, and, through a retrospective\nanalysis of three influential studies, it is shown how the ECP can complement\nthe information provided by traditional divergence statistics and enhance the\ninterpretation of results.",

    "abstract": "When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they\nwill most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people\nother than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development\nsettings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like\nGitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the\nimpact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks\nremains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences\nundergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding\nwhen completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an\nunfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10\nundergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield\ndevelopment tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a\nmixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and\nexit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05)\nand made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover,\nour analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time\nmanually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p\n< 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in\nprogramming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not\nunderstanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the\nneed for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that\nleverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why\nGenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks.

Forecasting requires a large amount of research on the\ninternet, and evaluations require time for events to happen, making the\ndevelopment of forecasting benchmarks challenging. To date, no forecasting\nbenchmark provides a realistic, hermetic, and repeatable environment for LLM\nforecasters. We introduce Bench To the Future (BTF), a \"pastcasting\" benchmark\nwith hundreds of high-quality questions for which the resolution is already\nknown. Each question is accompanied by a large offline corpus of tens of\nthousands of relevant web pages, enabling a way to elicit realistic \"forecasts\"\non past events from LLMs. Results suggest that our pastcasting environment can\nproduce results comparable to those based on forecasts using the internet on\nat-the-time unresolved questions. We show results benchmarking agent and\nchain-of-thought forecasting approaches using several LLMs, including the\nrecently-released Claude 4 models, and demonstrate BTF's ability to track\nsteady forecasting capability progress over time. We intend this to be a living\nbenchmark, with new questions added continually to account for increasing\ntraining data cutoff dates.

Current metric learning methods aim to push negative items away\nfrom the corresponding users and positive items by an absolute geometrical\ndistance margin. However, items may come from imbalanced categories with\ndifferent intra-class variations. Thus, the absolute distance margin may not be\nideal for estimating the difference between user preferences over imbalanced\nitems. To this end, we propose a new method, named discrete scale-invariant\nmetric learning (DSIML), by adding binary constraints to users and items, which\nmaps users and items into binary codes of a shared Hamming subspace to speed up\nthe online recommendation. Specifically, we firstly propose a scale-invariant\nmargin based on angles at the negative item points in the shared Hamming\nsubspace. Then, we derive a scale-invariant triple hinge loss based on the\nmargin. To capture more preference difference information, we integrate a\npairwise ranking loss into the scale-invariant loss in the proposed model. Due\nto the difficulty of directly optimizing the mixed integer optimization problem\nformulated with \\textit{log-sum-exp} functions, we seek to optimize its\nvariational quadratic upper bound and learn hash codes with an alternating\noptimization strategy.

A central decision in designing a Bayesian optimization campaign to\nguide experiments is the choice of a batch acquisition function when little or\nnothing is known about the landscape of the \"black box\" function to be\noptimized. To inform this decision, we first compare the performance of serial\nand Monte Carlo batch acquisition functions on two mathematical functions that\nserve as proxies for typical materials synthesis and processing experiments.\nThe two functions, both in six dimensions, are the Ackley function, which\nepitomizes a \"needle-in-haystack\" search, and the Hartmann function, which\nexemplifies a \"false optimum\" problem. Our study evaluates the serial upper\nconfidence bound with local penalization (UCB/LP) batch acquisition policy\nagainst Monte Carlo-based parallel approaches: q-log expected improvement\n(qlogEI) and q-upper confidence bound (qUCB), where q is the batch size. Tests\non Ackley and Hartmann show that UCB/LP and qUCB perform well in noiseless\nconditions, both outperforming qlogEI. For the Hartmann function with noise,\nall Monte Carlo functions achieve faster convergence with less sensitivity to\ninitial conditions compared to UCB/LP.

Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs\noften resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has\nled to the widespread assumption that LLMs may \"think\" in English. However,\nmore recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing\nEnglish performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view.\nIn this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic\nparameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation\nresults in significant performance degradation across all languages. This\ncompact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to\ngeneralize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract\nthought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we\nidentify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the\nprocessing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared\n(active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs\nundergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both\nthe proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive\nneurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute\nthe backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the\nemergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose\nneuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels\nat different development stages.

This task remains fundamentally\nchallenging, as it requires inferring 3D structure from incomplete and\nambiguous 2D observations. Early approaches typically rely on strong 3D\nknowledge, including architectural 3D inductive biases (e.g., embedding\nexplicit 3D representations, such as NeRF or 3DGS, into network design) and\nground-truth camera poses for both input and target views. While recent efforts\nhave sought to reduce the 3D inductive bias or the dependence on known camera\nposes of input views, critical questions regarding the role of 3D knowledge and\nthe necessity of circumventing its use remain under-explored. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic analysis on the 3D knowledge and uncover a critical trend:\nthe performance of methods that requires less 3D knowledge accelerates more as\ndata scales, eventually achieving performance on par with their 3D\nknowledge-driven counterparts, which highlights the increasing importance of\nreducing dependence on 3D knowledge in the era of large-scale data. Motivated\nby and following this trend, we propose a novel NVS framework that minimizes 3D\ninductive bias and pose dependence for both input and target views. By\neliminating this 3D knowledge, our method fully leverages data scaling and\nlearns implicit 3D awareness directly from sparse 2D images, without any 3D\ninductive bias or pose annotation during training. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our model generates photorealistic and 3D-consistent novel\nviews, achieving even comparable performance with methods that rely on posed\ninputs, thereby validating the feasibility and effectiveness of our\ndata-centric paradigm.

In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr\ngeometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole\nparameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that\nend, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the\nKerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the\nfundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides\nexhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the\nrepresentants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of\nPetrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are\nencoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar\nangle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the\nradial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve,\nto which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to\nderive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term\nof the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result,\nwe confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like\nobjects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given\ninclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass\nand spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin\nparameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\\alpha$.

While traditional\nPlasma OPerating CONtour (POPCON) analyses guide design, they often overlook\nthe significant impact of uncertainties in scaling laws, plasma profiles, and\nimpurity concentrations on performance predictions. This work confronts these\nchallenges by introducing statistical POPCONs, which leverage Monte Carlo\nanalysis to quantify the sensitivity of SPARC's operating points [1] to these\ncrucial variables. For profiles, a physically motivated gradient-based\nfunctional form is introduced. We further develop a multi-fidelity Bayesian\noptimization workflow that effectively identifies operating points maximizing\nthe probability of meeting performance goals, which gives a significant\nspeed-up over brute force methods. Our findings reveal that accounting for\nthese uncertainties leads to an optimal operating point different from\ndeterministic predictions, which balances H-mode access, confinement, impurity\ndilution, and auxiliary power.",

A comparative U.S.\\ case study illustrates how mid-band contiguity,\ncomplemented by selective mmWave capacity layers, can improve both coverage and\nchurn when orchestrated through software-defined carrier aggregation. We derive\nanalytic capacity and latency bounds for Split 7.2 $\\times$ vRAN/O-RAN\ndeployments, quantify the throughput penalty of end-to-end 256-bit encryption,\nand show how GPU/FPGA off-load plus digital-twin--driven automation keeps the\nhybrid-automatic-repeat request (HARQ) round-trip within a 0.5 ms budget.

This effect, which we name subabsorption, can be viewed as\nthe absorptive analog of subradiance. The experiment is performed using a\ndilute ensemble of ultracold $^{87}$Rb atoms with a low optical depth, and\ntime-resolving the absorption of a weak (tens of photons per pulse) resonant\nlaser beam. In this dilute regime, the collective interaction relies on\nestablishing dipole-dipole correlations over many atoms; i.e., the interaction\nis not dominated by the nearest neighbors. As a result, subabsorption is highly\nsusceptible to motional dephasing: even a temperature increase of 60 $\\mu$K is\nenough to completely extinguish the subabsorption signal. We also present a\ntheoretical model whose results are in reasonable agreement with the\nexperimental observations.

Quantum Computing (QC) offers a\npromising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic\napproaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been\nexplored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the\ndimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches\neither simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work\nintroduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph\nautoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node\nfeatures. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream\nclassification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical\nclassifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a\nclassification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that\ninvolves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons.\nThe GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing\nstep and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results\ndemonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the\ntesting of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.",

Traditional\nexplanations often attribute the increase in attraction between hydrophobic\nsolutes with increasing temperature to entropy changes resulting from disrupted\nhydrogen bonding in water. Here, we present a different perspective based on\nthe physics of surface phase transitions, supported by extensive molecular\ndynamics simulations. Using well-tempered metadynamics, we quantify the\nsolvent-mediated potential of mean force between nanometer-scale hydrophobic\nsolutes in the monatomic water model (mW), the SPC/E water model, and a\nLennard-Jones solvent. We develop a morphometric model grounded in a scaling\ntheory of critical drying, linking the range and strength of hydrophobic\nattraction to interfacial thermodynamics and deviations from vapor-liquid\ncoexistence, rather than specific hydrogen-bonding effects. Our results\nreproduce the characteristic inverse temperature dependence of hydrophobicity\nand demonstrate that such behavior arises generically due to a rapid thermal\nexpansion of the solvation shell, independent of hydrogen bonding.

Beyond the widely studied Jeff= 1/2\nhoneycomb systems, S = 3/2 honeycomb lattices present a promising alternative\nroute to realizing the classical spin liquid-like state within the spin-S\nKitaev models. Herein, we present crystal structure, thermodynamic, neutron\ndiffraction and muon spin relaxation (muSR) measurements, complemented by\ndensity functional theory (DFT) calculations on an unexplored 3d transition\nmetal based compound Co2Te3O8, where Co2+ (S = 3/2) ions form a distorted\nhoneycomb lattice in the crystallographic bc-plane without any anti-side\ndisorder between constituent atoms. A clear lambda type anomaly around 55 K in\nboth magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data indicates the onset of a\nlong-range ordered state below TN= 55 K. The dominant antiferromagnetic\ninteraction between S = 3/2 moments is evidenced by a relatively large negative\nCurie-Weiss temperature of -103 K derived from magnetic susceptibility data and\nsupported by DFT calculations. The signature of long-range antiferomagnetic\norder state in the thermodynamic data is corroborated by neutron diffraction\nand muSR results. Furthermore, muSR experiments reveal the coexistence of\nstatic and dynamic local magnetic fields below TN, along with a complex\nmagnetic structure that can be associated with XY-like antiferromagnet, as\nconfirmed by neutron diffraction experiments.",

Character sets change over time, and\ncharacter frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions,\noften causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on\nspecific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that\nincorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency\ndistribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically\nderived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected\ndistributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under\ntemporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts.

However, previous navigation research is divided into different\ntasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task\nobjectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed\nindividually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents,\nwhich can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of\nmulti-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale\nbenchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1.\nSpecifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed\nvia a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory\npairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and\ncapability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within\nOctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1,\nwe build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce\nlow-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a\nHybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e.,\nAction-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains\nspecifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT\nand Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which\nshow impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to\ninvestigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation\nfield, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically,\nwe propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a\ncold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability.\nFinally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.",

However, existing ME\nresearch is limited to single visual modality, overlooking the rich emotional\ninformation conveyed by other physiological modalities, resulting in ME\nrecognition and spotting performance far below practical application needs.\nTherefore, exploring the cross-modal association mechanism between ME visual\nfeatures and physiological signals (PS), and developing a multimodal fusion\nframework, represents a pivotal step toward advancing ME analysis. This study\nintroduces a novel ME dataset, MMME, which, for the first time, enables\nsynchronized collection of facial action signals (MEs), central nervous system\nsignals (EEG), and peripheral PS (PPG, RSP, SKT, EDA, and ECG). By overcoming\nthe constraints of existing ME corpora, MMME comprises 634 MEs, 2,841\nmacro-expressions (MaEs), and 2,890 trials of synchronized multimodal PS,\nestablishing a robust foundation for investigating ME neural mechanisms and\nconducting multimodal fusion-based analyses. Extensive experiments validate the\ndataset's reliability and provide benchmarks for ME analysis, demonstrating\nthat integrating MEs with PS significantly enhances recognition and spotting\nperformance. To the best of our knowledge, MMME is the most comprehensive ME\ndataset to date in terms of modality diversity. It provides critical data\nsupport for exploring the neural mechanisms of MEs and uncovering the\nvisual-physiological synergistic effects, driving a paradigm shift in ME\nresearch from single-modality visual analysis to multimodal fusion. The dataset\nwill be publicly available upon acceptance of this paper.",

However, existing benchmarks and\nevaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or\nhomogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and\nlimited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic\nframework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to\nconstruct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\\textit{i.e.}, key\npoints) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This\niterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video\ndetails such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We\napply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark\ncovering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on\nthe video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source\nMLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively\nand comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with\nGemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we\nfine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the\nmodel achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on\nDREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption.

    "abstract": "The simulation of discrete karst networks presents a significant challenge\ndue to the complexity of the physicochemical processes occurring within various\ngeological and hydrogeological contexts over extended periods. This complex\ninterplay leads to a wide variety of karst network patterns, each intricately\nlinked to specific hydrogeological conditions. We explore a novel approach that\nrepresents karst networks as graphs and applies graph generative models (deep\nlearning techniques) to capture the intricate nature of karst environments. In\nthis representation, nodes retain spatial information and properties, while\nedges signify connections between nodes. Our generative process consists of two\nmain steps. First, we utilize graph recurrent neural networks (GraphRNN) to\nlearn the topological distribution of karst networks. GraphRNN decomposes the\ngraph simulation into a sequential generation of nodes and edges, informed by\npreviously generated structures. Second, we employ denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models on graphs (G-DDPM) to learn node features (spatial\ncoordinates and other properties). G-DDPMs enable the generation of nodes\nfeatures on the graphs produced by the GraphRNN that adhere to the learned\nstatistical properties by sampling from the derived probability distribution,\nensuring that the generated graphs are realistic and capture the essential\nfeatures of the original data. We test our approach using real-world karst\nnetworks and compare generated subgraphs with actual subgraphs from the\ndatabase, by using geometry and topology metrics. Our methodology allows\nstochastic simulation of discrete karst networks across various types of\nformations, a useful tool for studying the behavior of physical processes such\nas flow and transport.",

    "abstract": "The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved\nquestions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is\ntypically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS)\nparameter $w_{\\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason\nto exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this\nwork, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the\nphenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and\nproven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational\nconstraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2,\nthe cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia\nsupernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that\na negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios.\nSpecifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \\pm\n0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\\sigma$ level. However,\nthis deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies\nin the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\\sigma$ when using\nPantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble\ntension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\\rm dm}$ and $H_0$.\nFurthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\\Lambda$CDM model is strongly\npreferred over the PEDE+$w_{\\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it\nis not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the\nPEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.",

Increasingly, dynamical system models are learned\nfrom data, rendering identifiability a paramount concept. For systems that are\nnot identifiable from data, no guarantees can be given about their behavior\nunder new conditions and inputs, or about possible control mechanisms to steer\nthe system. It is known in the community that \"linear ordinary differential\nequations (ODE) are almost surely identifiable from a single trajectory.\"\nHowever, this only holds for dense matrices. The sparse regime remains\nunderexplored, despite its practical relevance with sparsity arising naturally\nin many biological, social, and physical systems. In this work, we address this\ngap by characterizing the identifiability of sparse linear ODEs. Contrary to\nthe dense case, we show that sparse systems are unidentifiable with a positive\nprobability in practically relevant sparsity regimes and provide lower bounds\nfor this probability. We further study empirically how this theoretical\nunidentifiability manifests in state-of-the-art methods to estimate linear ODEs\nfrom data. Our results corroborate that sparse systems are also practically\nunidentifiable. Theoretical limitations are not resolved through inductive\nbiases or optimization dynamics. Our findings call for rethinking what can be\nexpected from data-driven dynamical system modeling and allows for quantitative\nassessments of how much to trust a learned linear ODE.",

This approach has several advantages. It aligns with the physical\nprinciple that systems transit through energy-minimizing steady states. It is\nalso fully constructive and computationally implementable, with physical and\ncomputational costs governed by appropriate action functionals.

The large dipolar cross-correlations among distinct molecules\nthat give rise to the unusually large dielectric constant of water (and in turn\nowe their origin to the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network) can get perturbed\nby surfaces. The perturbation can propagate inwards and then interfere with the\none from the opposite surface if confinement is only a few layers wide.

This efficiency is low due to the\nsignificant mismatch between microwave and spin wave wavelengths in the GHz\nrange $10^{-2}$ m and $10^{-8}$ m, respectively, leading to high energy\nconsumption in magnonic circuits. To address this issue, we propose an approach\nbased on a planar inverse split-ring resonator (ISRR) loaded with a\nnanometer-thick Py film and exploiting the photon-magnon coupling effect. Our\nnumerical studies show that the ISRR-based antenna achieves more than a\nfourfold improvement in conversion efficiency compared to a conventional single\nmicrostrip transmission line at frequencies and bias magnetic fields around the\nanti-crossing frequency gap. This has been demonstrated in the weak\nphoton-magnon coupling regime for the nanometer-thin permalloy film with\nmicrometer lateral dimensions. Further optimization of the ISRR can help to\nachieve the strong coupling regime, making the system potentially useful for\nquantum technology. Our compact and efficient antenna design offers a\nsignificant advantage over standard microstrip lines, paving the way for\nscalable and powerful magnonic circuits for microwave signal processing.",

We\ninvestigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide\nneedle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning\nstage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan\nquality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of\none selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined\nreward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent\nthen moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple\nrounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached.\nPlan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for\ntesting) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric\nmetrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the\nclinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical\nplans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no\nstatistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate\nV150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans\nuse 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the\nfirst study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to\nautonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans.\nThis RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to\nconventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal\ndata requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial\npotential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability,\nand enhance patient outcomes.",

However, many\nreal-world graphs contain sensitive personal information, such as user profiles\nin social networks, raising serious privacy concerns when graph learning is\nperformed using GNNs. To address this issue, locally private graph learning\nprotocols have gained considerable attention. These protocols leverage the\nprivacy advantages of local differential privacy (LDP) and the effectiveness of\nGNN's message-passing in calibrating noisy data, offering strict privacy\nguarantees for users' local data while maintaining high utility (e.g., node\nclassification accuracy) for graph learning.

We assess human-AI emotional alignment\nacross linguistic-cultural groups and model-families, using interpretable LLM\nfeatures translated from concept-sets for over twenty nuanced emotion\ncategories (including six basic emotions). Our analyses reveal that LLM-derived\nemotion spaces are structurally congruent with human perception, underpinned by\nthe fundamental affective dimensions of valence and arousal. Furthermore, these\nemotion-related features also accurately predict large-scale behavioural data\non word ratings along these two core dimensions, reflecting both universal and\nlanguage-specific patterns. Finally, by leveraging steering vectors derived\nsolely from human-centric emotion concepts, we show that model expressions can\nbe stably and naturally modulated across distinct emotion categories, which\nprovides causal evidence that human emotion concepts can be used to\nsystematically induce LLMs to produce corresponding affective states when\nconveying content.

The generalisation of\noptimal transport tools from probability measures to quantum states has shown\ngreat promise over the last few years, particularly in the development of the\ntheory of Wasserstein-style distances and divergences between quantum states.\nSuch distances have already led to a broad range of developments in the quantum\nsetting such as functional inequalities, convergence of solutions in many-body\nphysics, improvements to quantum generative adversarial networks, and more.\nHowever, the literature in this field is quite scattered, with very few links\nbetween different works and no real consensus on a `true' quantum Wasserstein\ndistance. The aim of this review is to bring these works together under one\nroof and give a full overview of the state of the art in the development of\nquantum Wasserstein distances. We also present a variety of open problems and\nunexplored avenues in the field, and examine the future directions of this\npromising line of research. This review is written for those interested in\nquantum optimal transport in coming from both the fields of classical optimal\ntransport and of quantum information theory, and as a resource for those\nworking in one area of quantum optimal transport interested in how existing\nwork may relate to their own.",

    "abstract": "The single row facility layout problem (SRFLP) is a well-studied NP-hard\ncombinatorial optimization problem with applications in manufacturing and\nlogistics systems. In the SRFLP, a set of\n  facilities with lengths is given, as well as weights between each pair of\nfacilities. The facilities must be\n  arranged on a line, such that the sum of the weighted center-to-center\ndistances is minimized. In this\n  work, we introduce a novel matheuristic approach that integrates exact\noptimization into a metaheuristic framework based on simulated annealing to\neffectively solve large-scale SRFLP instances.\n  Specifically, we propose the window approach matheuristic, which solves\nsubsegments of the layout\n  to optimality using mixed-integer programming while preserving the ordering\nof facilities outside the\n  window. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first matheuristic\napproach specifically\n  designed for the SRFLP.

In essence, all individuals\npossess the autonomy to determine the issues with which they will engage\ndirectly, while for other matters, they may appoint a representative of their\nchoosing. So far, the literature has studied the delegation structures emerging\nin liquid democracy as static. As a result, transitivity defined as the\ncapacity to transfer acquired authority to another entity, has been identified\nas a concern as it would be conducive to unrestrained accumulation of power.\n  Focusing on the implementation of liquid democracy supported by the\nLiquidFeedback software, we propose a novel approach to assessing the influence\nof voting nodes in a transitive delegation graph, taking into account the\nprocess nature of real-world liquid democracy in which delegation and voting\nare distinct and increasingly independent activities. By introducing a novel\nmodel of delegations in liquid democracy, we show how transitivity may in fact\ncontribute to an effective regulation of deliberation influence and\ndecision-making power. While maintaining the one-person, one-vote paradigm for\nall votes cast, the anticipated influence of an agent, to the extent it is\nstemming from transitivity, experiences a precipitous decline following an\nexponential trajectory.\n  In general, it is our objective to move the first steps towards a rigorous\nanalysis of liquid democracy as an adaptive democratic representation process.\nThe adaptivity aspect of liquid democracy has not yet been explored within the\nexisting academic literature despite it being, we believe, one of its most\nimportant features. We therefore also outline a research agenda focusing on\nthis aspect of liquid democracy.",

The alerts\nare then ranked using a geometric distance such that the most \"Real\" and\n\"Extra-galactic\" receive high scores; the scores are updated when new light\ncurve data is obtained on subsequent visits. To assess the quality of the\ntraining we use the Recall at rank K, which is more informative to our science\ngoal than general metrics such as accuracy or F1-Scores. We also establish\nbenchmarks for our metric based on the pre-VRA eyeballing strategy, to ensure\nour models provide notable improvements before being added to the ATLAS\npipeline. Finally, policies are defined on the ranked list to select the most\npromising alerts for humans to eyeball and to automatically remove the bogus\nalerts. In production the VRA method has resulted in a reduction in eyeballing\nworkload by 85% with a loss of follow-up opportunity <0.08%. It also allows us\nto automatically trigger follow-up observations with the Lesedi telescope,\npaving the way to automated methods that will be required in the era of LSST.\ninally, this is a demonstration that feature-based methods remain extremely\nrelevant in our field, being trainable on only a few thousand samples and\nhighly interpretable; they also offer a direct way to inject expertise into\nmodels through feature engineering",

To illustrate the underlying physical\nmechanism, we compute the time-dependent current generated by the injection of\nmultiple anyons, and show that its behavior exhibits distinctive features\ngoverned by the anyonic statistical angle. The measured current reflects\nquantum interference effects due to the time-resolved braiding of anyons at the\njunction. To establish experimental relevance, we introduce a protocol where\nanyons are probabilistically injected upstream of the loop via a quantum point\ncontact (QPC) source. Unlike in Fabry-Perot interferometers, where phase jumps\noccur spontaneously due to stochastic quasi-particle motion, here the phase\njumps are deliberately induced by source injections. These events imprint\nmeasurable signatures in the cross-correlation noise, enabling a controlled\nstatistical analysis of the braiding phase. We further show that, by varying\nthe magnetic field while remaining within the same fractional quantum Hall\nplateau, the statistical angle can be extracted without relying on the\nknowledge of other non-universal system parameters. Our results provide a\nminimal and accessible platform for probing anyonic statistics using a single\nchiral edge.",

Results\nshow indigenous news articles have higher representation of culture and\nentertainment (19%, 10% higher than general news articles), and a\ndisproportionate focus on conflict and protest (9%, 7% higher than general\nnews). On the other hand, sentiment analysis reveals that 57% of articles on\nindigenous topics carry a negative tone, compared to 27% for non-indigenous\nrelated news. Drawing from communication studies, we further analyze framing,\npriming, and agenda-setting (frequency of themes) to support the case for\ndiscrimination in representation of indigenous news coverage. For the\nqualitative part of our analysis, we facilitated FGD, where participants\nfurther validated these findings. Participants unanimously expressed their\nfeeling of being under-represented, and that critical issues affecting their\ncommunities (such as education, healthcare, and land rights) are systematically\nmarginalized in news media coverage.

While prior research has demonstrated the potential of machine\nlearning (ML) models to increase picking success rates in large-scale robotic\nfleets by prioritizing high-probability picks and packages, these efforts\nprimarily focused on predicting success probabilities for picks sampled using\nheuristic methods. Limited attention has been given, however, to leveraging\ndata-driven approaches to directly optimize sampled picks for better\nperformance at scale. In this study, we propose an ML-based framework that\npredicts transform adjustments as well as improving the selection of suction\ncups for multi-suction end effectors for sampled picks to enhance their success\nprobabilities. The framework was integrated and evaluated in test workcells\nthat resemble the operations of Amazon Robotics' Robot Induction (Robin) fleet,\nwhich is used for package manipulation. Evaluated on over 2 million picks, the\nproposed method achieves a 20\\% reduction in pick failure rates compared to a\nheuristic-based pick sampling baseline, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nlarge-scale warehouse automation scenarios.",

An intensely debated question is whether\nnon-Hermitian systems, described by pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians with real\nspectra, can offer enhanced sensitivity for parameter estimation when they are\noperated at or close to exceptional points. However, much of the current\nanalysis and conclusions are based on mathematical formalism developed for\nHermitian quantum systems, which is questionable when applied to\npseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, whose Hilbert space is intrinsically curved.\nHere, we develop a covariant formulation of quantum Fisher information (QFI)\ndefined on the curved Hilbert space of pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians. This\ncovariant framework ensures the preservation of the state norm and enables a\nconsistent treatment of parameter sensitivity. We further show that the\ncovariant QFI of pseudo-Hermitian systems can be mapped to the ordinary QFI of\ncorresponding Hermitian systems, and establish conditions when they become dual\nto each other, thus revealing a deeper geometric connection between the two.\nImportantly, this correspondence naturally imposes an upper bound on the\ncovariant QFI and identifies the criteria under which quantum sensing in\npseudo-Hermitian systems can exhibit supremacy over Hermitian ones.",

Here we report single Cu atom sites (1.42 wt%) anchored on Co3O4\nnanoparticles (Cu1-Co3O4) that dramatically enhance reactivity and molecular\nsensing properties of the support at low temperature. The Cu1 are identified by\nX-ray adsorption near edge structure and feature strong metal-support\ninteraction between Cu2+ and Co3O4, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy. The ability of Cu1 to form interfacial Cu-O-Co linkages strongly\nreduces the temperature of lattice oxygen activation compared to CuO\nnanoparticles on Co3O4 (CuONP-Co3O4), as demonstrated by temperature-programmed\nreduction and desorption analyses. To demonstrate immediate practical impact,\nwe deploy such Cu1-Co3O4 nanoparticles as chemoresistive sensor for\nformaldehyde vapor that yields more than an order of magnitude higher response\nthan CuONP-Co3O4 and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sensors.

The proposed model supports efficient pricing of path-dependent\nexotic options via Monte Carlo simulation, using a straightforward and\ncomputationally efficient approach.

Vision-based absolute\nlocalization methods, which locate the current view of the UAV in a reference\nsatellite map to estimate its position, have become popular in GNSS-denied\nscenarios. However, existing methods mostly rely on traditional and low-level\nimage matching, suffering from difficulties due to significant differences\nintroduced by cross-source discrepancies and temporal variations. To overcome\nthese limitations, in this paper, we introduce a hierarchical cross-source\nimage matching method designed for UAV absolute localization, which integrates\na semantic-aware and structure-constrained coarse matching module with a\nlightweight fine-grained matching module. Specifically, in the coarse matching\nmodule, semantic features derived from a vision foundation model first\nestablish region-level correspondences under semantic and structural\nconstraints. Then, the fine-grained matching module is applied to extract fine\nfeatures and establish pixel-level correspondences. Building upon this, a UAV\nabsolute visual localization pipeline is constructed without any reliance on\nrelative localization techniques, mainly by employing an image retrieval module\nbefore the proposed hierarchical image matching modules.

Yet, the\ninherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated\nsequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant\nchallenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation.\nAlthough recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to\nensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose\na novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel\ncode translation to address the functional equivalence issue.

The Refactor step improves data\nrepresentation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus\non salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant\ninformation.

We have recently verified the validity of this framework for a broad\nvariety of loading histories and geometries in experimental granular packings,\nusing photoelastic disks to measure individual interparticle contact forces. By\ntracking both particle positions and interparticle contact force vectors, we\nmapped the anisotropy of the fabric and forces to the macroscale stress and\nstrain and found excellent agreement between the anisotropic particle-scale\nmeasures and the macroscale responses in experiments.

We propose a unified framework of\nmulti-modal graph data, task, and model, discovering the inherent\nmulti-granularity and multi-scale characteristics in multi-modal graphs.\nSpecifically, we present five key desired characteristics for MG-LLM: 1)\nunified space for multi-modal structures and attributes, 2) capability of\nhandling diverse multi-modal graph tasks, 3) multi-modal graph in-context\nlearning, 4) multi-modal graph interaction with natural language, and 5)\nmulti-modal graph reasoning. We then elaborate on the key challenges, review\nrelated works, and highlight promising future research directions towards\nrealizing these ambitious characteristics. Finally, we summarize existing\nmulti-modal graph datasets pertinent for model training. We believe this paper\ncan contribute to the ongoing advancement of the research towards MG-LLM for\ngeneralization across multi-modal graph data and tasks.",

With low migration, our model\ndisplays a bimodal species-abundance distribution, with a high-abundance mode\nassociated with a core of cooperating species. This core is responsible for\nmaintaining a diverse pool of long-lived species, which are present even at\nvery small migration rates. We derive analytical expressions of the\nsteady-state species abundance distribution, as well as scaling laws for\ndiversity, number of species, and residence times.

In a simple yet\nrevealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when\nprovided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance\nthan MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may\ngenerate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them\nduring reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation\nframework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic\nmodifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three\ntargeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup,\nand random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training\npipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across\nmultiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical\nreasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through\nalgorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among\nopen-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual\nperturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the\neffectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each\nperturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual\nreasoning.

However, achieving stable, long-range\nautoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge.\nPrevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as\nSFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard\nspatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the\nprevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce\nphysical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that\nassumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be\nachieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep\nconvolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical\nremapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion\n(GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error\naccumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that\nAtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days.\nIn quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy\nagainst models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a\nremarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU.

    "abstract": "Solving and optimising Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in geometrically\nparameterised domains often requires iterative methods, leading to high\ncomputational and time complexities. One potential solution is to learn a\ndirect mapping from the parameters to the PDE solution. Two prominent methods\nfor this are Data-driven Non-Intrusive Reduced Order Models (DROMs) and\nParametrised Physics Informed Neural Networks (PPINNs). However, their accuracy\ntends to degrade as the number of geometric parameters increases. To address\nthis, we propose adopting Generative Models to create new geometries,\neffectively reducing the number of parameters, and improving the performance of\nDROMs and PPINNs. The first section briefly reviews the general theory of\nGenerative Models and provides some examples, whereas the second focusses on\ntheir application to geometries with fixed or variable points, emphasising\ntheir integration with DROMs and PPINNs. DROMs trained on geometries generated\nby these models demonstrate enhanced accuracy due to reduced parameter\ndimensionality. For PPINNs, we introduce a methodology that leverages\nGenerative Models to reduce the parameter dimensions and improve convergence.\nThis approach is tested on a Poisson equation defined over deformed Stanford\nBunny domains.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks with short residual connections have demonstrated\nremarkable success across domains, but increasing depth often introduces\ncomputational redundancy without corresponding improvements in representation\nquality. In this work, we introduce Auto-Compressing Networks (ACNs), an\narchitectural variant where additive long feedforward connections from each\nlayer to the output replace traditional short residual connections. ACNs\nshowcase a unique property we coin as \"auto-compression\", the ability of a\nnetwork to organically compress information during training with gradient\ndescent, through architectural design alone. Through auto-compression,\ninformation is dynamically \"pushed\" into early layers during training,\nenhancing their representational quality and revealing potential redundancy in\ndeeper ones. We theoretically show that this property emerges from layer-wise\ntraining patterns present in ACNs, where layers are dynamically utilized during\ntraining based on task requirements. We also find that ACNs exhibit enhanced\nnoise robustness compared to residual networks, superior performance in\nlow-data settings, improved transfer learning capabilities, and mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting suggesting that they learn representations that\ngeneralize better despite using fewer parameters. Our results demonstrate up to\n18% reduction in catastrophic forgetting and 30-80% architectural compression\nwhile maintaining accuracy across vision transformers, MLP-mixers, and BERT\narchitectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coupling ACNs with traditional\npruning techniques, enables significantly better sparsity-performance\ntrade-offs compared to conventional architectures. These findings establish\nACNs as a practical approach to developing efficient neural architectures that\nautomatically adapt their computational footprint to task complexity, while\nlearning robust representations.",

    "abstract": "Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic\nstress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains\nlabor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We\npresent a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity\nelements -- identifying their start and stop times -- directly from session\naudio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained\naudio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process\nfocused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three\ncore protocol phases -- therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and\npost-imaginal processing (P3) -- are generated via LLM-based prompting and\nverified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary\noffsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of\n313 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows)\nachieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3 seconds across tasks. We further\nanalyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance\nof context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a scalable\nframework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support\nclinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.",

This paper develops a charged-current quasielastic\n(CCQE) neutrino-nucleus scattering model to explore the nuclear mean-field\ndynamics and short-range correlation effects. In this model, the nuclear\nstructure effect is depicted using the scaling function, while the\nneutrinonucleon interaction is represented by the elementary weak cross\nsection. Results indicate that the double-differential cross section of\nscattered muon is influenced by the energy and momentum of nucleon in nuclei,\nand the total cross section depends primarily on the incident neutrino energy.\nFurthermore, incorporating short-range correlations yields the flux-integrated\ndifferential cross sections at high-T region producing larger values, a longer\ntail, and achieving better experimental consistency. It eventually elucidates\nthe physical relationship between the neutrinonucleus scattering cross section\nand the variation in incident neutrino energy.

The evaluation framework combines technical insights with\npractical experimentation through criteria specifically designed to investigate\nthe practical and creative affordances of the systems within the iterative,\nnon-linear nature of music production. Employing a single-evaluator methodology\nas a preliminary phase, this research adopts a mixed approach utilizing\nqualitative methods to form hypotheses subsequently assessed through\nquantitative metrics. The selected systems represent architectural diversity\nacross both symbolic and audio-based music generation approaches, spanning\ncomposition, arrangement, and sound design tasks. The investigation addresses\nlimitations of current MGS in music production, challenges and opportunities\nfor workflow integration, and development potential as collaborative tools\nwhile maintaining artistic authenticity. Findings reveal these systems function\nprimarily as complementary tools enhancing rather than replacing human\nexpertise. They exhibit limitations in maintaining thematic and structural\ncoherence that emphasize the indispensable role of human creativity in tasks\ndemanding emotional depth and complex decision-making. This study contributes a\nstructured evaluation framework that considers the iterative nature of music\ncreation.

    "abstract": "We design strategies in nonlinear geometric analysis to temper the effects of\nadversarial learning for sufficiently smooth data of numerical method-type\ndynamics in encoder-decoder methods, variational and deterministic, through the\nuse of geometric flow regularization. We augment latent spaces with geometric\nflows to control structure. Our techniques rely on adaptations of curvature and\nRicci flow. We invent new geometric flows or discover them neurally and\nnon-parametrically. All of our flows are solved using physics-informed\nlearning. Traditional geometric meaning is traded for computing ability, but we\nmaintain key geometric invariants, the primary of which are maintained,\nintrinsically-low structure, canonicity or a lack of irregularity,\nnontriviality due to sufficient lower bounds on curvature, and distortion of\nvolume element, that develop quality in the inference stage. Our primary\ncontributions are fourfold. We develop a loss based on Gaussian curvature using\nclosed path circulation integration for surfaces, bypassing automatic\ndifferentiation of the Christoffel symbols through use of Stokes' theorem. We\ninvent a new parametric flow derived from a linear version of the Gauss\nequation and a Riemannian decomposition for a custom tensor defined with a\nnormal Hessian and Weyl tensor proxies. We develop two strategies based on time\ndifferentiation of functionals, one with a special case of scalar curvature for\nconformally-changed metrics, and another with harmonic maps, their energy, and\ninduced metrics. Our methods, while diminished analytically, maintain overall\nintegral latent structure.

They indicated\nthat a major source of discrepancies stems from how we model the solar corona.\nThus, enhancing predictive capabilities demands a thorough examination of\ncoronal modeling. The Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model has been a workhorse model\nthat provides the near-Sun SW conditions. An important component of it is the\nPotential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model. This study analyzes 15 different\nCarrington Rotations(CRs), and presents detailed analysis of CR 2052 to\nidentify WSA model settings that lead to successful and erroneous SW\npredictions at Earth. For the events studied, we show that increasing the\nmodels grid resolution improves the open-close boundary identification. This\nresults in better predicting the onset and duration of high-speed streams\n(HSSs). In addition, we find an optimized source surface height (R$_{ss}$)\n(lying between 1.8-3.1 R$_{\\odot}$) further enhances HSS prediction accuracy\nfor the studied events. A detailed analysis shows that changes in R$_{ss}$, (a)\nchanges the Great Circle Angular Distance (GCAD) maps (at the solar surface) of\nthe associated coronal holes and (b) changes the foot-point locations of the\nmagnetic connectivities to the sub-Earth locations. These factors change the\nnear-Sun SW speed, that eventually leads to uncertainties in speeds near Earth.\nWe also investigate the usefulness of coronal hole observations in constraining\nR$_{ss}$ and SW solutions at Earth, and highlight their underutilized value in\nguiding the selection of magnetic maps for improved ambient solar wind modeling\nat L1.",

Currently, the investigation on\nspontaneous valley polarization mainly focuses on two major types of systems.\nOne type magnetic systems by breaking the time-reversal symmetry, the other is\nferroelectric materials through breaking the inversion symmetry. Might there be\nadditional scenarios? Here, we propose to realize spontaneous valley\npolarization by breaking the mirror symmetry in the altermagnets, named type\nIII valley polarization. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles\ncalculations, we confirm that this mechanism is feasible in Non-Janus\nFe2WS2Se2. Monolayer Non-Janus and Janus Fe2WS2Se2 are stable Neel-type\nantiferromagnetic state with the direct band gap semiconductor. More\ninterestingly, their magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits the rare biaxial\nanisotropy and a four-leaf clover shape in the xy plane, while the xz and yz\nplanes show the common uniaxial anisotropy. This originated from the\nfourth-order single ion interactions. More importantly, the valley splitting is\nspontaneously generated in the Non-Janus Fe2WS2Se2 due to the Mxy symmetry\nbreaking, without requiring the SOC effect. Both the Non-Janus and Janus\nFe2WS2Se2 exhibit diverse valley polarization and anomalous valley Hall effect\nproperties. In addition, the magnitude and direction of valley polarization can\nbe effectively tuned by the biaxial strain and magnetic field.

Moreover, as\nmodels grow in scale, the increasing reliance on real-world data poses a\nbottleneck for training and requires leveraging data more effectively.\nAddressing the first challenge often involves manual model selection and\nhyperparameter tuning. At the same time, as models grow larger and more and\nmore of the available human-generated data is being used for training, data\naugmentation and synthetic data become critical elements. Automated machine\nlearning offers a path to address these challenges but is traditionally\ndesigned for tabular data and classical ML methods.

We find that for a regular diamond network, $G$\nis independent of the initial monomer concentration, while for disordered\nnetworks (monodisperse or polydisperse) the modulus increases with $\\rho_0$, at\nodds with the classical predictions for rubber elasticity. Analysis of the\nnetwork structure reveals that, for the disordered networks, defects contribute\nonly weakly to the observed increase, and that instead the $\\rho_0$-dependence\nof $G$ can be rationalized by the presence of a pre-strain in the sample. This\npre-strain can be quantified by the topological factor introduced in the affine\nnetwork theory (ANT). Comparison of the disordered networks with their phantom\ncounterparts reveals that weakly crosslinked systems show a stronger\n$\\rho_0$-dependence of $G$ due to an increase in entanglements at higher\n$\\rho_0$, and that the polydisperse networks contain more entanglements than\nthe monodisperse ones with the same average strand length.

In 1978 Thomassen constructed a (non-cubic and\nnon-planar) family of counterexamples, showing that there exist\nhamiltonian-connected $n$-vertex graphs containing two vertices with no path of\nlength $n-2$ between them. We complement this result by describing cubic planar\ncounterexamples on $6p+16$ vertices, each containing vertices between which\nthere is no path of any odd length greater than $1$ and at most $4p+9$.\nMotivated by a remark of Thomassen about a gap in the cycle spectrum of\nhamiltonian-connected graphs, we also describe an infinite family of\nhamiltonian-connected graphs with many gaps in the first half of their cycle\nspectra.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops statistical methods for determining the number of\ncomponents in panel data finite mixture regression models with regression\nerrors independently distributed as normal or more flexible normal mixtures. We\nanalyze the asymptotic properties of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) and\ninformation criteria (AIC and BIC) for model selection in both conditionally\nindependent and dynamic panel settings. Unlike cross-sectional normal mixture\nmodels, we show that panel data structures eliminate higher-order degeneracy\nproblems while retaining issues of unbounded likelihood and infinite Fisher\ninformation. Addressing these challenges, we derive the asymptotic null\ndistribution of the LRT statistic as the maximum of random variables and\ndevelop a sequential testing procedure for consistent selection of the number\nof components. Our theoretical analysis also establishes the consistency of BIC\nand the inconsistency of AIC. Empirical application to Chilean manufacturing\ndata reveals significant heterogeneity in production technology, with\nsubstantial variation in output elasticities of material inputs and\nfactor-augmented technological processes within narrowly defined industries,\nindicating plant-specific variation in production functions beyond\nHicks-neutral technological differences. These findings contrast sharply with\nthe standard practice of assuming a homogeneous production function and\nhighlight the necessity of accounting for unobserved plant heterogeneity in\nempirical production analysis.",

    "abstract": "Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large\nLanguage Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods\nfor increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing\nthe same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on\nreasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To\naddress this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the\nsampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent,\ne.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning\non both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us\nto use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual\ndiversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the\noutputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting\nthe model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought\nbefore generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate\nour method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method\nimproves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths\nand code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference\nOptimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward.\nFinally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of\ngenerations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader\ncomments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we\npresent a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while\nmaintaining performance.

While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation,\nthere is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering\nmechanism's significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at\nlow temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in\nstandard single-mode telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin\ntemperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne\ndetection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK\nto 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid\nhelium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin\ntemperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interaction with\nmicroscopic defects of the amorphous material - two-level-systems (TLS) - which\nhas not been previously observed in optical fiber. The measured behaviour of\nthe linewidth with temperature is in agreement with well-established models of\nultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic\nscattering, thermally-activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS\ninteraction. This work provides a foundation for a wide range of applications\nand further research including sensing applications, new approaches to\ninvestigate TLS physics, and Brillouin-scattering-based quantum science and\ntechnology.",

Inspired by these findings and fascinating phenomena\nemerging in the over-parameterized regime, we examine a parallel direction: do\nsimilar scaling laws govern predictive uncertainties in deep learning? In\nidentifiable parametric models, such scaling laws can be derived in a\nstraightforward manner by treating model parameters in a Bayesian way. In this\ncase, for example, we obtain $O(1/N)$ contraction rates for epistemic\nuncertainty with respect to the number of data $N$. However, in\nover-parameterized models, these guarantees do not hold, leading to largely\nunexplored behaviors. In this work, we empirically show the existence of\nscaling laws associated with various measures of predictive uncertainty with\nrespect to dataset and model sizes. Through experiments on vision and language\ntasks, we observe such scaling laws for in- and out-of-distribution predictive\nuncertainty estimated through popular approximate Bayesian inference and\nensemble methods. Besides the elegance of scaling laws and the practical\nutility of extrapolating uncertainties to larger data or models, this work\nprovides strong evidence to dispel recurring skepticism against Bayesian\napproaches: \"In many applications of deep learning we have so much data\navailable: what do we need Bayes for?\".

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\ncross-modal understanding and generation by integrating visual and textual\ninformation. While instruction tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning\nmethods have substantially improved the generalization of VLMs, most existing\napproaches rely on centralized training, posing challenges for deployment in\ndomains with strict privacy requirements like healthcare. Recent efforts have\nintroduced Federated Learning (FL) into VLM fine-tuning to address these\nprivacy concerns, yet comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating federated\nfine-tuning strategies, model architectures, and task generalization remain\nlacking. In this work, we present \\textbf{FedVLMBench}, the first systematic\nbenchmark for federated fine-tuning of VLMs. FedVLMBench integrates two\nmainstream VLM architectures (encoder-based and encoder-free), four fine-tuning\nstrategies, five FL algorithms, six multimodal datasets spanning four\ncross-domain single-task scenarios and two cross-domain multitask settings,\ncovering four distinct downstream task categories. Through extensive\nexperiments, we uncover key insights into the interplay between VLM\narchitectures, fine-tuning strategies, data heterogeneity, and multi-task\nfederated optimization. Notably, we find that a 2-layer multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) connector with concurrent connector and LLM tuning emerges as the optimal\nconfiguration for encoder-based VLMs in FL. Furthermore, current FL methods\nexhibit significantly higher sensitivity to data heterogeneity in\nvision-centric tasks than text-centric ones, across both encoder-free and\nencoder-based VLM architectures. Our benchmark provides essential tools,\ndatasets, and empirical guidance for the research community, offering a\nstandardized platform to advance privacy-preserving, federated training of\nmultimodal foundation models.",

While\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in\nvisual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical\nimages, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D\nanatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of\nsubtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we\npresent Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits\nenriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection\nfor accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet\nemploys dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and\nfine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment\nwith diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient\nmultimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a\ncompact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By\nassigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly\nperceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space,\nfacilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D\nlanguage-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report\ngeneration (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering\n(73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/YanzhaoShi/HSENet.",

Biased LLMs' decisions and\nmisinformation undermine democratic processes, and existing trust models fail\nto address the intricacies of trust in LLMs. Currently, oversimplified,\none-directional approaches have largely overlooked the many relationships\nbetween trustor (user) contextual factors (e.g. ideology, perceptions) and\ntrustee (LLMs) systemic elements (e.g. scientists, tool's features). In this\nwork, we introduce a bowtie model for holistically conceptualizing and\nformulating trust in LLMs, with a core component comprehensively exploring\ntrust by tying its two sides, namely the trustor and the trustee, as well as\ntheir intricate relationships. We uncover these relationships within the\nproposed bowtie model and beyond to its sociotechnical ecosystem, through a\nmixed-methods explanatory study, that exploits a political discourse analysis\ntool (integrating ChatGPT), by exploring and responding to the next critical\nquestions: 1) How do trustor's contextual factors influence trust-related\nactions? 2) How do these factors influence and interact with trustee systemic\nelements? 3) How does trust itself vary across trustee systemic elements? Our\nbowtie-based explanatory analysis reveals that past experiences and familiarity\nsignificantly shape trustor's trust-related actions; not all trustor contextual\nfactors equally influence trustee systemic elements; and trustee's\nhuman-in-the-loop features enhance trust, while lack of transparency decreases\nit.

To mitigate this bias, researchers\nhave developed debiasing methods such as Design-based Supervised Learning (DSL)\nand Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI), which promise valid estimation by\ncombining LLM annotations with a limited number of expensive expert\nannotations. Although these methods produce consistent estimates under\ntheoretical assumptions, it is unknown how they compare in finite samples of\nsizes encountered in applied research. We make two contributions: First, we\nstudy how each method's performance scales with the number of expert\nannotations, highlighting regimes where LLM bias or limited expert labels\nsignificantly affect results. Second, we compare DSL and PPI across a range of\ntasks, finding that although both achieve low bias with large datasets, DSL\noften outperforms PPI on bias reduction and empirical efficiency, but its\nperformance is less consistent across datasets.

    "abstract": "Planning and extension of water distribution systems (WDSs) plays a key role\nin the development of smart cities, driven by challenges such as urbanization\nand climate change. In this context, the correct estimation of physically\ncorrect hydraulic states, i.e., pressure heads, water demands and water flows,\nis of high interest. Hydraulic emulators such as EPANET or more recently,\nphysic-informed surrogate models are used to solve this task. They require a\nsubset of observed states, such as heads at reservoirs and water demands, as\ninputs to estimate the whole hydraulic state. In order to obtain reliable\nresults of such emulators, but also to be able to give theoretical guarantees\nof their estimations, an important question is whether theoretically, the\nsubset of observed states that the emulator requires as an input suffices to\nderive the whole state, purely based on the physical properties, also called\nhydraulic principles, it obeys. This questions translates to solving linear and\nnon-linear systems of equations. Previous articles investigate on the existence\nquestion under the term observability analysis, however, they rely on the\napproximation of the non-linear principles using Taylor approximation and on\nnetwork-dependent numerical or algebraic algorithms. In this work, we provide\npurely theoretical guarantees on the existence and uniqueness of solutions to\nthe non-linear hydraulic principles, and by this, the existence and uniqueness\nof physically correct states, given common subsets of them -- a result that\nseems to be common-sense in the water community but has never been rigorously\nproven. We show that previous existence results are special cases of our more\ngeneral findings, and therefore lay the foundation for further analysis and\ntheoretical guarantees of the before-mentioned hydraulic emulators.",

    "abstract": "Embodied foundation models are crucial for Artificial Intelligence (AI)\ninteracting with the physical world by integrating multi-modal inputs, such as\nproprioception, vision and language, to understand human intentions and\ngenerate actions to control robots. While these models demonstrate strong\ngeneralization and few-shot learning capabilities, they face significant\nchallenges in continually acquiring new skills without forgetting previously\nlearned skills, a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. To address this\nissue, we propose the Analytic Task Scheduler (ATS), a novel framework for\ncontinual learning in embodied foundation models. ATS consists of a\ntask-specific model library, where each model is fine-tuned independently on a\nsingle task, and an analytic scheduler trained using recursive least squares\n(RLS) to learn the mapping between language instructions and task-specific\nmodels. This architecture enables accurate task recognition and dynamic model\nselection while fundamentally avoiding parameter interference across tasks. The\nscheduler updates its parameters incrementally using only statistics\n(autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrices), enabling forgetting-resistant\nlearning without the need to revisit historical data. We validate ATS on a\nreal-world robot platform (RM65B), demonstrating superior resistance to\nforgetting and strong adaptability to task variations.

Previously, in the eighth paper\nof this series, we established the best achievable limits of the aperture\nphotometry method for star cluster studies in the local universe. The aim of\nthis study is to determine how the sky background affects the limits and\napplicability of the aperture photometry method in star cluster analysis. We\nused a large sample of star cluster models spanning the parameter space of M 31\nclusters. To determine how the background affects star cluster photometry, we\nplaced images of simulated clusters into five background fields of different\nstellar density from the Panchromatic $Hubble$ Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey\nand measured them using aperture photometry. We determined age and mass limits\nfor the M 31 disc star clusters at which photometric uncertainties are low\nenough to enable the determination of cluster parameters using the aperture\nphotometry method. We demonstrated that for typical-size clusters, optimal\naperture diameters are of ~3 half-light radii. We assessed cluster detection\ncompleteness in relation to varying sky background densities, based on the M 31\nPHAT survey data. Our results suggest that a significant selection bias towards\nmore compact clusters may exist in the PHAT survey. We derived low-mass limits\nof the cluster mass function (CMF) in the PHAT survey, reaching down to masses\nof ~500 $M_\\odot$ in outer disc areas, ~1500 $M_\\odot$ in middle disc or\nstar-forming regions, and ~3000 $M_\\odot$ in inner disc regions.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing\nhigh-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle\nwith maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental\nrequirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this\nby either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which\nis resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share\ninformation across generations, which still yield limited success. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag\nSampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject\nconsistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling\nmechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject\ncharacteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across\ngenerated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based\non both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and\nconsistent visual stories.

    "abstract": "Ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) methods have become\nkey numerical tools for studying quantum phases and phase transitions in\ninteracting many-fermion systems. Despite the broad applicability, the\nefficiency of these algorithms is often limited by the bottleneck associated\nwith the {\\it local update} of the field configuration. In this work, we\npropose two novel update schemes, the {\\it delayed update} and {\\it block\nforce-bias update}, both of which can generally and efficiently accelerate\nground-state AFQMC simulations. The {\\it delayed update}, with a predetermined\ndelay rank, is an elegantly improved version of the {\\it local update},\naccelerating the process by replacing multiple vector-vector outer products in\nthe latter with a single matrix-matrix multiplication. The {\\it block\nforce-bias update} is a block variant of the conventional force-bias update,\nwhich is a highly efficient scheme for dilute systems but suffers from the low\nacceptance ratio in lattice models. Our modified scheme maintains the high\nefficiency while offering flexible tuning of the acceptance ratio, controlled\nby the block size, for any desired fermion filling. We apply these two update\nschemes to both the standard and spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodels, demonstrating their speedup over the {\\it local update} with respect to\nthe delay rank and block size. We also explore their efficiencies across\nvarying system sizes and model parameters. Our results identify a speedup of\n$\\sim$$8$ for systems with $\\sim$$1600$ lattice sites.

Recent X-ray timing studies have proposed that J1231's\nquasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) observed at the peak of its X-ray lightcurve\nis a variant of the quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) observed in other sources.\nHere, we fit X-ray spectra from XMM-Newton, Swift, and Chandra using a slim\ndisc model for the black hole's accretion disc, obtaining a best-fit black hole\nmass of ($6\\pm3)\\times10^{4}$ $M_\\odot$ and spin of $>0.6$ at 2$\\sigma$\nconfidence. This mass is consistent with past estimates, supporting the IMBH\ninterpretation, and the spin measurement is new. Yet the nature of J1231\nremains uncertain: its long-term variability (decade-long continuum evolution)\ncould signal a tidal disruption event or active galactic nuclear variability.\nWe find that the spectral evolution within the first three years after the\nsource's detection can be well explained by either a varying disc accretion\nrate $\\dot m$ or a varying disc inclination $\\theta$. Meanwhile, we find that\nduring the short-term variability (the QPO with a ~3.8hr period), each\noscillation does not show the \"hard-rise-soft-decay\" typical of QPEs. We fit\nthe average spectrum at the QPO lightcurve maxima and the average spectrum at\nits minima, finding that the spectral difference is well explained by $\\dot m$\ndecreasing from peaks to valleys if $\\theta<30^{\\circ}$ and constant between\nall data epochs.

The detection of dual QPOs is\nrare among blazars and suggests complex variability mechanisms. Although a\nbinary supermassive black hole (SMBH) scenario could be considered given the\nsources high redshift (z = 1.837), the short periodicities are difficult to\nreconcile with orbital motion unless invoking extreme parameters. Double-sine\nmodel fitting reveals that the oscillatory components have comparable\namplitudes but are out of phase, suggesting a potential beating phenomenon due\nto interference.

Since SATD hinders maintenance, identifying its\ncategories is key to uncovering quality issues. Traditionally, constructing\nsuch taxonomies requires manually inspecting SATD comments and surrounding\ncode, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often inconsistent due to\nannotator subjectivity. This study presents ASTAGEN, an initial step toward\nautomating SATD taxonomy generation using large language models (LLMs). Given a\ncomment and its surrounding code, ASTAGEN first generates a concise explanation\nfor each SATD comment, then incrementally generates and updates categories to\nconstruct a taxonomy. We evaluate ASTAGEN on SATD datasets from three domains:\nquantum software, smart contracts, and machine learning. It successfully\nrecovers domain-specific categories reported in prior work, such as Layer\nConfiguration in machine learning. Compared to a naive use of an LLM, ASTAGEN\nproduces more consistent category assignments due to its explanation-driven,\niterative design. It also completes taxonomy generation in under two hours and\nfor less than one USD, even on the largest dataset. These results suggest that\nwhile full automation remains challenging, ASTAGEN is able to support\nsemi-automated taxonomy construction.

The performance of very large-scale integration (VLSI)\ndevices is influenced by arithmetic operations, where multiplication is a\ncrucial operation. Therefore, a high-speed multiplier is essential for\ndeveloping any signal-processing module. Numerous multipliers have been\nreviewed in existing literature, and their speed is largely determined by how\npartial products (PPs) are accumulated. To enhance the speed of multiplication\nbeyond current methods, an approximate adder-based multiplier is introduced.\nThis approach allows for the simultaneous addition of PPs from two consecutive\nbits using a novel approximate adder. The proposed multiplier is utilized in a\nmean filter structure and implemented in ISE Design Suite 14.7 using VHDL and\nsynthesized on the Xilinx Spartan3-XC3S400 FPGA board. Compared to the\nliterature, the proposed multiplier achieves power and power-delay product\n(PDP) improvements of 56.09% and 73.02%, respectively. The validity of the\nexpressed multiplier is demonstrated through the mean filter system. Results\nshow that it achieves power savings of 33.33%. Additionally, the proposed\nmultiplier provides more accurate results than other approximate multipliers by\nexpressing higher values of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), (30.58%), and\nstructural similarity index metric (SSIM), (22.22%), while power consumption is\nin a low range.",

While traditional\nmodel-based controllers excel at planning on complex terrains, they struggle\nwith real-world uncertainties. Learning-based controllers offer robustness to\nsuch uncertainties but often lack precision on terrains with sparse steppable\nareas. Hybrid methods achieve enhanced robustness on sparse terrains by\ncombining both methods but are computationally demanding and constrained by the\ninherent limitations of model-based planners. To achieve generalized legged\nlocomotion on diverse terrains while preserving the robustness of\nlearning-based controllers, this paper proposes to learn an attention-based map\nencoding conditioned on robot proprioception, which is trained as part of the\nend-to-end controller using reinforcement learning. We show that the network\nlearns to focus on steppable areas for future footholds when the robot\ndynamically navigates diverse and challenging terrains.

Our technique allows for the estimation of these relaxation\ntimes in a few milliseconds, more than two orders of magnitude faster than\nprevious nonadaptive methods, and allows us to observe fluctuations up to 5\ntimes the qubit's average relaxation rates on significantly shorter timescales\nthan previously reported. Our statistical analysis reveals that these\nfluctuations occur on much faster timescales than previously understood, with\ntwo-level-system switching rates reaching up to 10 Hz.

Leveraging a two-stage\ndistillation framework, SemanticSplat reconstructs a holistic multi-modal\nsemantic feature field from sparse-view images.

Recent research demonstrates that attackers can\nefficiently exploit system vulnerabilities during the training phase to execute\nbackdoor attacks, producing malicious actions when specific trigger patterns\nare present in the state observations. However, most existing backdoor attacks\nrely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking\nthe potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we\nintroduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor\nAttacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor\ntriggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude.\nSpecifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing\nmechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a\ncooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most\ninfluential state variable for the injection dimension. Furthermore, we propose\na gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude\nunder environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms\nand nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack\nsuccess rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance.\nThese results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of\nprincipled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks.

The key\nchallenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric\ncues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images\nand 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D\ngeometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on\npredicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to\nlearn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly\nthrough the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D\nawareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation,\nthe truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision\nfrom 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D\ngeometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end\ntraining. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art\nimage-based methods on both single- and multi-view benchmark datasets across\ndiverse environments, achieving a 9.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the SUN RGB-D\ndataset, a 3.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the ScanNetV2 dataset, and a 0.19\nAP3D@0.7 improvement on the KITTI dataset.

Bridging these ideas, this study\nintroduces a innovative Highly Quantized Fuzzy Neural Network (HQFNN) that\nrealises the entire fuzzy pipeline inside a shallow quantum circuit and couples\nthe resulting quantum signal to a lightweight CNN feature extractor. Each image\nfeature is first mapped to a single qubit membership state through repeated\nangle reuploading.

Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in\nVisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score,\nshowcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the\nreasoning step.

As a critical link, it connects scholarly\npublications with the datasets that drive scientific progress. This study\ninvestigates whether repository visibility influences data citation rates. We\nhypothesize that repositories with higher visibility, as measured by search\nengine metrics, are associated with increased dataset citations. Using OpenAlex\ndata and repository impact indicators (including the visibility index from\nSistrix, the h-index of repositories, and citation metrics such as mean and\nmedian citations), we analyze datasets in Social Sciences and Economics to\nexplore their relationship. Our findings suggest that datasets hosted on more\nvisible web domains tend to receive more citations, with a positive correlation\nobserved between web domain visibility and dataset citation counts,\nparticularly for datasets with at least one citation. However, when analyzing\ndomain-level citation metrics, such as the h-index, mean, and median citations,\nthe correlations are inconsistent and weaker. While higher visibility domains\ntend to host datasets with greater citation impact, the distribution of\ncitations across datasets varies significantly. These results suggest that\nwhile visibility plays a role in increasing citation counts, it is not the sole\nfactor influencing dataset citation impact.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the concept and the computation of approximately vanishing\nideals of a finite set of data points. By data points, we mean that the points\ncontain some uncertainty, which is a key motivation for the approximate\ntreatment. A careful review of the existing border basis concept for an exact\ntreatment motivates a new adaptation of the border basis concept for an\napproximate treatment. In the study of approximately vanishing polynomials, the\nnormalization of polynomials plays a vital role. So far, the most common\nnormalization in computational commutative algebra uses the coefficient norm of\na polynomial. Inspired by recent developments in machine learning, the present\npaper proposes and studies the use of gradient-weighted normalization. The\ngradient-weighted semi-norm evaluates the gradient of a polynomial at the data\npoints. This data-driven nature of gradient-weighted normalization produces, on\nthe one hand, better stability against perturbation and, on the other hand,\nvery significantly, invariance of border bases with respect to scaling the data\npoints. Neither property is achieved with coefficient normalization. In\nparticular, we present an example of the lack of scaling invariance with\nrespect to coefficient normalization, which can cause an approximate border\nbasis computation to fail. This is extremely relevant because scaling of the\npoint set is often recommended for preprocessing the data. Further, we use an\nexisting algorithm with coefficient normalization to show that it is easily\nadapted to gradient-weighted normalization. The analysis of the adapted\nalgorithm only requires tiny changes, and the time complexity remains the same.\nFinally, we present numerical experiments on three affine varieties to\ndemonstrate the superior stability of our data-driven normalization over\ncoefficient normalization. We obtain robustness to perturbations and invariance\nto scaling.",

To this end, we theoretically analyze the user\nembedding skew issue and propose Personalized Federated recommendation with\nCalibration via Low-Rank decomposition (PFedCLR).

While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves real-time\nrendering in static settings, extending it to dynamic scenes is challenging due\nto the difficulty of learning structured and temporally consistent motion\nrepresentations. This challenge often manifests as three limitations in\nexisting methods: redundant Gaussian updates, insufficient motion supervision,\nand weak modeling of complex non-rigid deformations. These issues collectively\nhinder coherent and efficient dynamic reconstruction. To address these\nlimitations, we propose HAIF-GS, a unified framework that enables structured\nand consistent dynamic modeling through sparse anchor-driven deformation. It\nfirst identifies motion-relevant regions via an Anchor Filter to suppresses\nredundant updates in static areas. A self-supervised Induced Flow-Guided\nDeformation module induces anchor motion using multi-frame feature aggregation,\neliminating the need for explicit flow labels. To further handle fine-grained\ndeformations, a Hierarchical Anchor Propagation mechanism increases anchor\nresolution based on motion complexity and propagates multi-level\ntransformations.

    "abstract": "Forecasting the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an important yet challenging\ntask in economics, where most existing approaches rely on low-frequency,\nsurvey-based data. With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs),\nthere is growing potential to leverage high-frequency online text data for\nimproved CPI prediction, an area still largely unexplored. This paper proposes\nLLM-CPI, an LLM-based approach for CPI prediction inference incorporating\nonline text time series. We collect a large set of high-frequency online texts\nfrom a popularly used Chinese social network site and employ LLMs such as\nChatGPT and the trained BERT models to construct continuous inflation labels\nfor posts that are related to inflation. Online text embeddings are extracted\nvia LDA and BERT. We develop a joint time series framework that combines\nmonthly CPI data with LLM-generated daily CPI surrogates. The monthly model\nemploys an ARX structure combining observed CPI data with text embeddings and\nmacroeconomic variables, while the daily model uses a VARX structure built on\nLLM-generated CPI surrogates and text embeddings. We establish the asymptotic\nproperties of the method and provide two forms of constructed prediction\nintervals. The finite-sample performance and practical advantages of LLM-CPI\nare demonstrated through both simulation and real data examples.",

    "abstract": "Currently planned and constructed terrestrial detectors for gravitational\nwaves and dark matter based on differential light-pulse atom interferometry are\ndesigned around three primary strategies to enhance their sensitivity: (i)\nResonant-mode enhancement using multiple diamonds, (ii) large-momentum-transfer\ntechniques to increase arm separation within the interferometer, and (iii)\nvery-long baseline schemes that increase the distance between the two\ninterferometers. Both resonant-mode enhancement and large-momentum-transfer\ntechniques result in a greater number of light pulses, making high pulse\nfidelity during atom-light interactions imperative. At the same time,\nincreasing the number of diamonds in vertical configurations leads to taller\natomic fountains, which consequently reduces the available distance between\ninterferometers. As a result, the number of diamonds, large-momentum-transfer\npulses, and the fountain height are interdependent parameters that must be\ncarefully balanced. In this work, we present optimal configurations for\nmulti-diamond geometries, explicitly accounting for the spatial extent of a\nsingle interferometer, considering constraints imposed by the baseline\ndimensions and atomic losses due to imperfect pulses. We provide practical\nanalytical relations to estimate the optimal number of pulses that should be\napplied. Many proposals beyond demonstrator experiments require pulse numbers\nthat demand efficiencies not yet demonstrated with state-of-the-art momentum\ntransfer techniques. As a result, the observed sensitivity falls short of\nexpectations - an effect caused by both arm separation and atom loss per pulse\n- highlighting the urgent need for research aimed at improving pulse\nfidelities.",

    "abstract": "To more effectively control and allocate network resources, MAC CE has been\nintroduced into the network protocol, which is a type of control signaling\nlocated in the MAC layer. Since MAC CE lacks encryption and integrity\nprotection mechanisms provided by PDCP, the control signaling carried by MAC CE\nis vulnerable to interception or tampering by attackers during resource\nscheduling and allocation. Currently, the 3GPP has analyzed the security risks\nof Layer 1/Layer 2 Triggered Mobility (LTM), where handover signaling sent to\nthe UE via MAC CE by the network can lead to privacy leaks and network attacks.\nHowever, in addition to LTM, there may be other potential security\nvulnerabilities in other protocol procedures. Therefore, this paper explores\nthe security threats to MAC CE and the corresponding protection mechanisms. The\nresearch is expected to support the 3GPP's study of MAC CE and be integrated\nwith the security research of lower-layer protocols, thereby enhancing the\nsecurity and reliability of the entire communication system.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are now integral across various domains and have\ndemonstrated impressive performance. Progress, however, rests on the premise\nthat benchmark scores are both accurate and reproducible. We demonstrate that\nthe reproducibility of LLM performance is fragile: changing system\nconfiguration such as evaluation batch size, GPU count, and GPU version can\nintroduce significant difference in the generated responses. This issue is\nespecially pronounced in reasoning models, where minor rounding differences in\nearly tokens can cascade into divergent chains of thought, ultimately affecting\naccuracy. For instance, under bfloat16 precision with greedy decoding, a\nreasoning model like DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B can exhibit up to 9% variation\nin accuracy and 9,000 tokens difference in response length due to differences\nin GPU count, type, and evaluation batch size. We trace the root cause of this\nvariability to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic under\nlimited numerical precision. This work presents the first systematic\ninvestigation into how numerical precision affects reproducibility in LLM\ninference. Through carefully controlled experiments across various hardware,\nsoftware, and precision settings, we quantify when and how model outputs\ndiverge. Our analysis reveals that floating-point precision -- while critical\nfor reproducibility -- is often neglected in evaluation practices. Inspired by\nthis, we develop a lightweight inference pipeline, dubbed LayerCast, that\nstores weights in 16-bit precision but performs all computations in FP32,\nbalancing memory efficiency with numerical stability.

STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable\ninitiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options\nFramework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using\nChapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple\npolicies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and\ncomputed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs\nrecord the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and\nconstraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a\nhigh-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we\ncan decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are\naggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at\nthe level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem.

The recently\nproposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by\ncombining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis\nshows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential\nnature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we\npropose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of\nMCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD\nintegrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via\ndelayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which\nreduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that\nFast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or\nimproving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in\ninference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and\nyielding weaker solutions.

We propose EnerBridge-DPO, a novel inverse folding framework focused\non generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation\nlies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge\nmodel. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior\nsequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence\ncandidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which\nenhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the\nmodel to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior\nknowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing\nquantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that\nEnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while\nmaintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and\naccurately predicts $\\Delta \\Delta G$ values between various sequences.",

We applied complementary approaches:\ncomputational bottom-up, hybrid, and expert-driven top-down, on a novel\nlongitudinal dataset of 181 YouTube channels from individuals with\nlife-threatening attempts, alongside 134 control channels. In the bottom-up\napproach, we applied LLM-based topic modeling to identify behavioral\nindicators.

In the hybrid approach,\na clinical expert reviewed LLM-derived topics and flagged 19 as\nsuicide-related. However, none showed significant attempt-related temporal\neffects beyond those identified bottom-up.

For heavy scalars, following\nATLAS and CMS, we describe how the top loop contribution to the gluon-gluon\nfusion mechanisms could produce a dip rather than a bump in the mass\ndistribution, which prevents genuine searches for heavy resonances. It seems\nthat A470 and H650 resonances, indicated by other channels, as described in our\nprevious work, start to be visible in the tt channel in RUN2 analyses presented\nby ATLAS and CMS. An NMSSM interpretation does not seem excluded, although the\nmass difference between these two resonances comes as a surprise. The KK\ngraviton scenario is updated from our previous work, offering promising\ndiscoveries of charged and neutral resonances at RUN3.

    "abstract": "We present new exact charged black hole solutions in (2+1) dimensions within\nthe framework of $f({Q})$ gravity, where ${Q}$ denotes the non-metricity\nscalar. By considering a cubic $f({Q})$ form we derive classes of charged and\nuncharged spherically symmetric solutions, and we identify conditions under\nwhich these reduce to the well-known Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black\nhole. Notably, our analysis reveals a novel charged solution that is\nasymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) but cannot be continuously deformed into a\nGR counterpart, and thus arising purely from the\n  higher-order nature of the non-metricity corrections. Furthermore, we explore\nthe geometrical properties of the solutions, demonstrating the existence of\nmultiple horizons and a softer central singularity compared to GR.\nAdditionally, we calculate various thermodynamic quantities, such as Hawking\ntemperature, entropy, and heat capacity, with results confirming thermal\nstability. Finally, a detailed study of the geodesic motion and the effective\npotentials unveils stable photon orbits, as well as the effect of cubic\nnon-metricity corrections on orbital dynamics.",

The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional\nmotion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions,\nwhich takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input,\nand reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the\ninitial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first\nconducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions.\nDifferent from previous work, we do not need any collision data for\npretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision\ninteractions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated\ncollision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce\nepisode collision rates by 20\\% compared to previous work.",

In this joint modeling\nframework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic\nfeatures and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image\nsamples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms\nother image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion\nmodels. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of\n1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster\ninference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer\nand x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore,\nbuilding on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm\ncalled Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive\ngeneration by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference\nmultiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more\ndiverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in\nsubsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is\nimproved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open\nup a new frontier in the field of image generation.",

Under this assumption, the corrected sample cannot\nperfectly recover the true correlation function. We name this effect sub-sample\nsystematics. For a galaxy sample, even if its overall sample statistics\n(redshift distribution n(z), galaxy bias b(z)), are accurately measured, n(z),\nb(z) can still vary across the observed footprint. It makes the correlation\nfunction amplitude of galaxy clustering higher, while correlation functions for\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear do not have noticeable change. Such a\ncombination could potentially degenerate with physical signals on small angular\nscales, such as the amplitude of galaxy clustering, the impact of neutrino mass\non the matter power spectrum, etc. Sub-sample systematics, cannot be corrected\nusing imaging systematics mitigation approaches that rely on the\ncross-correlation signal between imaging systematics maps and the observed\ngalaxy density field. In this paper, we derive formulated expressions of\nsub-sample systematics, demonstrating its fundamental difference with other\nimaging systematics.

    "abstract": "The recent development of feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents a\nnew paradigm to reconstruct 3D scenes. Using neural networks trained on\nlarge-scale multi-view datasets, it can directly infer 3DGS representations\nfrom sparse input views. Although the feedforward approach achieves high\nreconstruction speed, it still suffers from the substantial storage cost of 3D\nGaussians. Existing 3DGS compression methods relying on scene-wise optimization\nare not applicable due to architectural incompatibilities. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose TinySplat, a complete feedforward approach for\ngenerating compact 3D scene representations. Built upon standard feedforward\n3DGS methods, TinySplat integrates a training-free compression framework that\nsystematically eliminates key sources of redundancy. Specifically, we introduce\nView-Projection Transformation (VPT) to reduce geometric redundancy by\nprojecting geometric parameters into a more compact space. We further present\nVisibility-Aware Basis Reduction (VABR), which mitigates perceptual redundancy\nby aligning feature energy along dominant viewing directions via basis\ntransformation. Lastly, spatial redundancy is addressed through an\noff-the-shelf video codec. Comprehensive experimental results on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that TinySplat achieves over 100x compression\nfor 3D Gaussian data generated by feedforward methods. Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art compression approach, we achieve comparable quality with only\n6% of the storage size. Meanwhile, our compression framework requires only 25%\nof the encoding time and 1% of the decoding time.",

Nonetheless, although\nthis was not what the Russians wished to present to the world, the\ninterplanetary campaign, centred around missions to the planet Venus (the\nVenera program) was also beset with difficulties. Many of the early Venera\nprobes failed, despite making it to a heliocentric orbit, but naturally the\nsuccess rate improved with time. The result is that there are now many Venera\nprobes in heliocentric orbits, either completely intact, or the main bus after\na successful deployment of the lander; together with the associated Blok-L\nupper stages. This paper is a response to some previous quite contentious\nresearch proposing that a certain member of a new class of objects, designated\n$2005\\ VL_1$ may in fact be the Venera-2 probe. In this paper we look into the\ninvariance of the Earth Tisserand parameter in an attempt to establish if there\nare indeed any members of this class which could be Venera probes. It is found,\nwith extremely small probability, that compared to a sample of randomly chosen\nNEOs, members of the class of Dark Comet have an Earth Tisserand unusually\nclose to 3, a property shared by the Venera missions. Furthermore there are\nparticular associations of 3 Dark Comets with 3 of these probes, the most\nsignificant being $2010\\ VL_{65}$ with the Venera-12 mission",

This paper investigates ICL on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)\nand explores the policies of multi-modal demonstration selection. Existing\nresearch efforts in ICL face significant challenges: First, they rely on\npre-defined demonstrations or heuristic selecting strategies based on human\nintuition, which are usually inadequate for covering diverse task requirements,\nleading to sub-optimal solutions; Second, individually selecting each\ndemonstration fails in modeling the interactions between them, resulting in\ninformation redundancy. Unlike these prevailing efforts, we propose a new\nexploration-exploitation reinforcement learning framework, which explores\npolicies to fuse multi-modal information and adaptively select adequate\ndemonstrations as an integrated whole. The framework allows LVLMs to optimize\nthemselves by continually refining their demonstrations through\nself-exploration, enabling the ability to autonomously identify and generate\nthe most effective selection policies for in-context learning. Experimental\nresults verify the superior performance of our approach on four Visual\nQuestion-Answering (VQA) datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing\nthe generalization capability of few-shot LVLMs.",

Intermediate- and\nextreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \\gtrsim 10^2$, are\npromising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space\nAntenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is\nchallenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to\nmillions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses\nthis need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly\ncompute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes.\nIn this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black\nholes with spin magnitudes $|a| \\leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities\n$e < 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p < 200$, enabling the generation of\nlong-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\\sim 100$ ms with\nhardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our\nmodel attains mismatches of $\\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect\nto error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that\nkludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as\n$^{+60\\%}_{-40\\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\\sim 1\\sigma$ in\nparameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies\nsignificantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs)\nwith only minor $(\\sim10\\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20.

These limitations\nreduce their extensibility and applicability to a broad range of multimodal\ntasks, particularly as the field shifts toward richer modalities such as video\nand audio in recent MLLMs. Therefore, we propose the Visual-Audio-Text\nKnowledge Graph (VAT-KG), the first concept-centric and knowledge-intensive\nmultimodal knowledge graph that covers visual, audio, and text information,\nwhere each triplet is linked to multimodal data and enriched with detailed\ndescriptions of concepts. Specifically, our construction pipeline ensures\ncross-modal knowledge alignment between multimodal data and fine-grained\nsemantics through a series of stringent filtering and alignment steps, enabling\nthe automatic generation of MMKGs from any multimodal dataset.

However, traditional deep learning approaches for\nECG analysis rely heavily on large-scale manual annotations, which are both\ntime-consuming and resource-intensive to obtain. To overcome this limitation,\nself-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising alternative, enabling\nthe extraction of robust ECG representations that can be efficiently\ntransferred to various downstream tasks. While previous studies have explored\nSSL for ECG pretraining and multi-modal ECG-language alignment, they often fail\nto capture the multi-scale nature of ECG signals.

MELP first pretrains a\ncardiology-specific language model to enhance its understanding of clinical\ntext.

Particularly during peak hours, the massive ride-hailing vehicles\nwaiting to drop off obstruct curb spaces and even disrupt the flow of mainline\ntraffic. However, there is a lack of an analytical model that formulates and\nmitigates the congestion effects of ride-hailing drop-offs in curb spaces. To\naddress this issue, this paper proposes a novel bi-modal two-tandem bottleneck\nmodel to depict the commuting behaviors of private vehicles (PVs) and\nride-hailing vehicles (RVs) during the morning peak in a linear city. In the\nmodel, the upstream bottleneck models the congestion on highways, and the\ndownstream curbside bottlenecks depict the congestion caused by RV drop-offs in\ncurb spaces, PV queue on main roads, and the spillover effects between them in\nthe urban area. The proposed model can be solved in a closed form under eight\ndifferent scenarios. A time-varying optimal congestion pricing scheme, combined\ncurbside pricing and parking pricing, is proposed to achieve the social\noptimum. It is found that potential waste of road capacity could occur when\nthere is a mismatch between the highway and curbside bottlenecks, and hence the\noptimal pricing should be determined in a coordinated manner. A real-world case\nfrom Hong Kong shows that the limited curb space and main road in the urban\narea could be the major congestion bottleneck. Expanding the capacity of the\ncurb space or the main road in the urban area, rather than the highway\nbottleneck, can effectively reduce social costs. This paper highlights the\ncritical role of curbside management and provides policy implications for the\ncoordinated management of highways and curb spaces.",

This\nlimitation is particularly challenging in SLSQP, where intermediate results of\nQR factorization are crucial for back-substitution logic at each iteration. Our\nwork introduces novel scheduling techniques using a two-queue approach to\nexecute the QR factorization kernel effectively. This approach, implemented in\nhigh-level C++ programming language, facilitates compiler optimizations and\nallows storing intermediate results required by back-substitution logic.\nEmpirical evaluations demonstrate substantial performance gains, including a\n10x improvement over the sequential QR version of the SLSQP algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Open-set domain generalization(OSDG) for hyperspectral image classification\npresents significant challenges due to the presence of unknown classes in\ntarget domains and the need for models to generalize across multiple unseen\ndomains without target-specific adaptation. Existing domain adaptation methods\nassume access to target domain data during training and fail to address the\nfundamental issue of domain shift when unknown classes are present, leading to\nnegative transfer and reduced classification performance. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel open-set domain generalization framework that\ncombines four key components: Spectrum-Invariant Frequency Disentanglement\n(SIFD) for domain-agnostic feature extraction, Dual-Channel Residual Network\n(DCRN) for robust spectral-spatial feature learning, Evidential Deep Learning\n(EDL) for uncertainty quantification, and Spectral-Spatial Uncertainty\nDisentanglement (SSUD) for reliable open-set classification. The SIFD module\nextracts domain-invariant spectral features in the frequency domain through\nattention-weighted frequency analysis and domain-agnostic regularization, while\nDCRN captures complementary spectral and spatial information via parallel\npathways with adaptive fusion. EDL provides principled uncertainty estimation\nusing Dirichlet distributions, enabling the SSUD module to make reliable\nopen-set decisions through uncertainty-aware pathway weighting and adaptive\nrejection thresholding. Experimental results on three cross-scene hyperspectral\nclassification tasks show that our approach achieves performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art domain adaptation methods while requiring no access to the\ntarget domain during training.

However, DAAs\nsuffer from a fundamental limitation we identify as the \"reward-generation gap\"\n-- a misalignment between optimization objectives during training and actual\ngeneration performance during inference. In this paper, we find a contributor\nto the reward-generation gap is the mismatch between the inherent importance of\nprefix tokens during the LLM generation process and how this importance is\nreflected in the implicit reward functions of DAAs. To bridge the gap, we adopt\na token-level MDP perspective of DAAs to analyze its limitations and introduce\na simple yet effective approach called Prefix-Oriented Equal-length Training\n(POET), which truncates both preferred and dispreferred responses to match the\nshorter one's length. Training with \\mname, where both responses in each sample\nare truncated to equal length, resulting in diverse truncated lengths across\nsamples, the optimization of DAAs objective is implicitly constrained to\nconverge across all timesteps of token-level MDP, thus paying more attention to\nprefix tokens than the standard DAAs.

The weakly coupled IR theory of photons exhibits confinement through a\ndensity of magnetically charged instanton configurations. As the\ncompactification scale 1/L approaches the strong coupling scale, the IR theory\nbecomes strongly coupled. In this regime we propose a holographic description\nof the IR degrees of freedom. The instanton condensation scale can be\nassociated with a scale at which the Brietenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound is\nviolated in the model and the glueball spectrum computed.

Very naively extending the\nperturbative results to the non-perturbative regime suggests that chiral\nsymmetry breaking might occur ahead of confinement, but equally they may be\njoined phenomena. If the two phenomena are separate, then it would be useful to\nbe able to enlarge the gap in scales.

    "abstract": "Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes, including\nrelevant legal charge, terms, and fines, which is a crucial process in Large\nLanguage Model(LLM). However, LJP faces two key challenges: (1)Long Tail\nDistribution: Current datasets, derived from authentic cases, suffer from high\nhuman annotation costs and imbalanced distributions, leading to model\nperformance degradation. (2)Lawyer's Improvement: Existing systems focus on\nenhancing judges' decision-making but neglect the critical role of lawyers in\nrefining arguments, which limits overall judicial accuracy. To address these\nissues, we propose an Adversarial Self-Play Lawyer Augmented Legal Judgment\nFramework, called ASP2LJ, which integrates a case generation module to tackle\nlong-tailed data distributions and an adversarial self-play mechanism to\nenhance lawyers' argumentation skills. Our framework enables a judge to\nreference evolved lawyers' arguments, improving the objectivity, fairness, and\nrationality of judicial decisions. Besides, We also introduce RareCases, a\ndataset for rare legal cases in China, which contains 120 tail-end cases. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimuCourt dataset and our\nRareCases dataset. Experimental results show our framework brings improvements,\nindicating its utilization. Our contributions include an integrated framework,\na rare-case dataset, and publicly releasing datasets and code to support\nfurther research in automated judicial systems.",

Existing methods typically train a single\nmodel across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information.\nHowever, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1)\nsample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among\nsources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and\ntrade-offs during multi-source training.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for statistical modelling of a\ncontinuous random variable $X$ on $[0, 1)$, based on its digit representation\n$X=.X_1X_2\\ldots$. In general, $X$ can be coupled with a random variable $N$ so\nthat if a prior of $N$ is imposed, $(X_1,\\ldots,X_N)$ becomes a sufficient\nstatistics and $.X_{N+1}X_{N+2}\\ldots$ is uniformly distributed. In line with\nthis fact, and focusing on binary digits for simplicity, we propose a family of\ngeneralized finite P{\\'o}lya trees that induces a random density for a sample,\nwhich becomes a flexible tool for density estimation. Here, the digit system\nmay be random and learned from the data. We provide a detailed Bayesian\nanalysis, including closed form expression for the posterior distribution which\nsidesteps the need of MCMC methods for posterior inference. We analyse the\nfrequentist properties as the sample size increases, and provide sufficient\nconditions for consistency of the posterior distributions of the random density\nand $N$. We consider an extension to data spanning multiple orders of\nmagnitude, and propose a prior distribution that encodes the so-called extended\nNewcomb-Benford law. Such a model shows promising results for density\nestimation of human-activity data. Our methodology is illustrated on several\nsynthetic and real datasets.",

Focusing\non multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question\nfrom the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited\nfor heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial\nsetting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation\noperators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on\nindividual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$\ntask scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these\noperators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for\nbroad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask\nwhat incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents\nmust learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such\nsettings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational\nparadigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a\ngradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified\nMARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous.\nExperiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show\nthat, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes\npredicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both\nvalidating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in\nMARL.

The gauge/gravity duality\nmaps this to the computation of spectral curve of a massive scalar operator\n$\\mathcal{O}_{\\phi}$ for a large-$N$ conformal field theory with irrelevant\ntype non-conformal deformation. In this context, non-conformality has been\nholographically introduced by using the Einstein-dilaton theory with Liouville\ntype dilaton potential as the bulk theory. It has been observed that the\nobtained quasinormal modes are characterized by specific gapped dispersion\nrelations. The pole-skipping points have also been computed and classified\nbased upon different dispersion relations satisfied by them. The effect of\nnon-conformality is evident from these results. Analytic form of the mentioned\ngapped dispersion relation have been obtained in the long wavelength limit by\nsetting the mass of the scalar field to zero. The coefficients appearing in the\nmomenta of the dispersion relation also captures the signature of non-conformal\ndeformation. The radius of convergence of the derivative expansion in the\nmomentum space is then computed from the critical points of the spectral curve.\nIt has been observed that presence of non-conformality increases the domain of\napplicability for the derivative expansion in momentum space, as it increases\nthe radius of convergence for a given conformal dimension.

    "abstract": "In many complex scenarios, robotic manipulation relies on generative models\nto estimate the distribution of multiple successful actions. As the diffusion\nmodel has better training robustness than other generative models, it performs\nwell in imitation learning through successful robot demonstrations. However,\nthe diffusion-based policy methods typically require significant time to\niteratively denoise robot actions, which hinders real-time responses in robotic\nmanipulation. Moreover, existing diffusion policies model a time-varying action\ndenoising process, whose temporal complexity increases the difficulty of model\ntraining and leads to suboptimal action accuracy. To generate robot actions\nefficiently and accurately, we present the Time-Unified Diffusion Policy\n(TUDP), which utilizes action recognition capabilities to build a time-unified\ndenoising process. On the one hand, we build a time-unified velocity field in\naction space with additional action discrimination information. By unifying all\ntimesteps of action denoising, our velocity field reduces the difficulty of\npolicy learning and speeds up action generation. On the other hand, we propose\nan action-wise training method, which introduces an action discrimination\nbranch to supply additional action discrimination information. Through\naction-wise training, the TUDP implicitly learns the ability to discern\nsuccessful actions to better denoising accuracy. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on RLBench with the highest success rate of 82.6%\non a multi-view setup and 83.8% on a single-view setup. In particular, when\nusing fewer denoising iterations, TUDP achieves a more significant improvement\nin success rate. Additionally, TUDP can produce accurate actions for a wide\nrange of real-world tasks.",

More\nrecently, the notion of local state marking has been introduced with the focus\nshifted to correctly identifying permutation of a subset of states random\nchosen from a given set of multipartite states under LOCC.

Traditional data augmentation approaches are focus mainly on\nsingle-hop questions and prone to semantic distortion, while LLM-based methods\nprimarily address semantic distortion but usually neglect multi-hop reasoning,\nthus limiting data diversity.

    "abstract": "Jeff Hawkins and his colleagues in Numenta have proposed the thousand-brains\nsystem. This is a model of the structure and operation of the neocortex and is\nunder investigation as a new form of artificial intelligence. In their study,\nlearning and inference algorithms running on the system are proposed, where the\nprediction is an important function. The author believes that one of the most\nimportant capabilities of the neocortex in addition to prediction is the\nability to make association, that is, to find the relationships between\nobjects. Similarity is an important example of such relationships. In our\nstudy, algorithms that run on the thousand-brains system to find similarities\nare proposed. Although the setting for these algorithms is restricted, the\nauthor believes that the case it covers is fundamental. Karl Friston and his\ncolleagues have studied the free-energy principle that explains how the brain\nactively infers the cause of a Shannon surprise. In our study, an algorithm is\nproposed for the thousand-brains system to make this inference. The problem of\ninferring what is being observed from the sensory data is a type of inverse\nproblem, and the inference algorithms of the thousand-brains system and\nfree-energy principle solve this problem in a Bayesian manner. Our inference\nalgorithms can also be interpreted as Bayesian or non-Bayesian updating\nprocesses.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely heavily on complete and\nhigh-quality spatiotemporal traffic data to achieve optimal performance.\nNevertheless, in real-word traffic data collection processes, issues such as\ncommunication failures and sensor malfunctions often lead to incomplete or\ncorrupted datasets, thereby posing significant challenges to the advancement of\nITS. Among various methods for imputing missing spatiotemporal traffic data,\nthe latent factorization of tensors (LFT) model has emerged as a widely adopted\nand effective solution. However, conventional LFT models typically employ the\nstandard L2-norm in their learning objective, which makes them vulnerable to\nthe influence of outliers. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a\nthreshold distance weighted (TDW) loss-incorporated Latent Factorization of\nTensors (TDWLFT) model. The proposed loss function effectively reduces the\nmodel's sensitivity to outliers by assigning differentiated weights to\nindividual samples. Extensive experiments conducted on two traffic speed\ndatasets sourced from diverse urban environments confirm that the proposed\nTDWLFT model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of\nboth in both prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.",

However, expressive and\nrealistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between\nmotion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose\n\\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a\npost-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly\noptimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of\nthe denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily\ncontrol motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be\neffectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.\nBuilding on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference\noptimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment\nmodules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep\ninterval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and\nactivated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion\nnaturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman\nimproves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a\n3.3$\\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on\ngeneration quality.

Recent advances in\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) have enabled the learning heuristics directly\nfrom data. However, DRL methods often suffer from limited exploration and\nsusceptibility to local optima. On the other hand, evolutionary algorithms such\nas Genetic Algorithms (GAs) exhibit strong global exploration capabilities but\nare typically sample inefficient and computationally intensive. In this work,\nwe propose the Evolutionary Augmentation Mechanism (EAM), a general and\nplug-and-play framework that synergizes the learning efficiency of DRL with the\nglobal search power of GAs. EAM operates by generating solutions from a learned\npolicy and refining them through domain-specific genetic operations such as\ncrossover and mutation. These evolved solutions are then selectively reinjected\ninto the policy training loop, thereby enhancing exploration and accelerating\nconvergence. We further provide a theoretical analysis that establishes an\nupper bound on the KL divergence between the evolved solution distribution and\nthe policy distribution, ensuring stable and effective policy updates. EAM is\nmodel-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with state-of-the-art DRL\nsolvers such as the Attention Model, POMO, and SymNCO.

    "abstract": "Millisecond magnetars, one of the potential candidates for the central engine\nof Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), can experience significant magnetic field\nenhancement shortly after their formation. In some cases, this evolution is\nfurther influenced by the accretion of stellar debris, which modifies the\ndipole magnetic field strength. During a hypercritical accretion phase that\nlasts seconds or longer after the progenitor explosion, a thin crust may form,\nsubmerging the magnetic field (the so-called magnetic burial scenario). Once\nhypercritical accretion ceases, the buried field can diffuse back through the\ncrust, delaying the external dipole's reactivation. On the other hand,\nobservations have shown that relativistic outflows ejected by these objects and\ndecelerated by the circumburst environment cause a late and temporary emission\nknown as afterglow. This work investigates how the submergence and subsequent\nreemergence of the magnetar magnetic field, on a few years timescales, affect\nthe GRB afterglow dynamics. Specifically, we apply this phenomenological\nscenario to the late-time X-ray excess observed approximately three years\npost-burst in GW170817/GRB 170817A, exploring how the evolving magnetic field\nstrength may contribute to this emission. Our modelling of GRB 170817A\nindicates that $\\gtrsim90$ percent of the external dipole flux was initially\nburied, re-emerging on a timescale $\\tau_{B}=3-40$ yr and restoring a surface\nfield $B\\simeq(2-5)\\times10^{15}\\,$G; the late-time X-ray brightening is far\nbetter reproduced by this scenario than by models without burial.",

This is achieved by introducing a set of new efficient and powerful\nSO(2)-equivariant operations and performing all off-diagonal feature updates\nand message passing within SO(2) local frames, thereby eliminating the need of\nSO(3) tensor products. Moreover, a continuous SO(2) tensor product is performed\nwithin the SO(2) local frame at each node to fuse node features, mimicking the\nsymmetric contraction operation. Extensive experiments on the large QH9 and\nMD17 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance across a\nwide range of molecular structures and trajectories, highlighting its strong\ngeneralization capability. The proposed SO(2) operations on SO(2) local frames\noffer a promising direction for scalable and symmetry-aware learning of\nelectronic structures.

To further increase the efficiency of\nverification, the edge server batch the diverse verification requests from\ndevices. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side\nmemory footprint by sharing the same upstream target model across multiple\ndevices.

XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter has enabled, for the first time, a\ndetailed characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active\ngalactic nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent\nvelocities, along with their ionization parameter ($\\xi$) and column density\n($N_{\\rm H}$). The high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series\nof Fe absorption lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe\nXXVI. At lower energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also\ndetected. Our spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged\nResolve spectrum uncovers six outflow components, five of which exhibit\nrelatively narrow absorption lines with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to\n1170 km/s. In addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is\nconsistent with Fe XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). The kinetic\nluminosity of this component is 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our\nanalysis of the Resolve spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption\nlines are intrinsically broader than those of lower-ionization species,\nindicating that the turbulent velocity of the six outflow components (ranging\nfrom 0 to 3500 km/s) increases with $\\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the\n$N_{\\rm H}$ of the outflows generally declines with $\\xi$ up to $\\log \\xi =\n3.2$ but rises beyond this point, suggesting a complex ionization structure.\nThe absorption profile of the Fe XXV resonance line is intriguingly similar to\nUV absorption lines (Ly$\\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we\ninfer that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support\na \"hybrid wind\" scenario in which the observed outflows have multiple origins\nand driving mechanisms.

As a\nlinear solver, RCD is particularly effective when the matrix is\nwell-conditioned; however, its convergence rate deteriorates rapidly in the\npresence of large spectral outliers. In this paper, we introduce the\nsubspace-constrained randomized coordinate descent (SC-RCD) method, in which\nthe dynamics of RCD are restricted to an affine subspace corresponding to a\ncolumn Nystr\\\"{o}m approximation, efficiently computed using the recently\nanalyzed RPCholesky algorithm. We prove that SC-RCD converges at a rate that is\nunaffected by large spectral outliers, making it an effective and\nmemory-efficient solver for large-scale, dense linear systems with rapidly\ndecaying spectra, such as those encountered in kernel ridge regression.\nExperimental validation and comparisons with related solvers based on\ncoordinate descent and the conjugate gradient method demonstrate the efficiency\nof SC-RCD. Our theoretical results are derived by developing a more general\nsubspace-constrained framework for the sketch-and-project method.

Therefore, we investigate a new challenging problem called\nOmni Multi-modal Person Re-identification (OM-ReID), which aims to achieve\neffective retrieval with varying multi-modal queries.

This dataset also has significant\nsuperiority in terms of diversity, such as the painting perspectives and\ntextual information.

Combining 3D scenes with semantic fields\nfacilitates the perception and understanding of the surrounding environment.\nHowever, key challenges include embedding semantics into 3D representations,\nachieving generalizable real-time reconstruction, and ensuring practical\napplicability by using only images as input without camera parameters or ground\ntruth depth. To this end, we propose UniForward, a feed-forward model to\npredict 3D Gaussians with anisotropic semantic features from only uncalibrated\nand unposed sparse-view images. To enable the unified representation of the 3D\nscene and semantic field, we embed semantic features into 3D Gaussians and\npredict them through a dual-branch decoupled decoder. During training, we\npropose a loss-guided view sampler to sample views from easy to hard,\neliminating the need for ground truth depth or masks required by previous\nmethods and stabilizing the training process. The whole model can be trained\nend-to-end using a photometric loss and a distillation loss that leverages\nsemantic features from a pre-trained 2D semantic model. At the inference stage,\nour UniForward can reconstruct 3D scenes and the corresponding semantic fields\nin real time from only sparse-view images. The reconstructed 3D scenes achieve\nhigh-quality rendering, and the reconstructed 3D semantic field enables the\nrendering of view-consistent semantic features from arbitrary views, which can\nbe further decoded into dense segmentation masks in an open-vocabulary manner.\nExperiments on novel view synthesis and novel view segmentation demonstrate\nthat our method achieves state-of-the-art performances for unifying 3D scene\nand semantic field reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR ATR) has seen\nsignificant performance improvements with deep learning. However, the black-box\nnature of deep SAR ATR introduces low confidence and high risks in\ndecision-critical SAR applications, hindering practical deployment. To address\nthis issue, deep SAR ATR should provide an interpretable reasoning basis $r_b$\nand logic $\\lambda_w$, forming the reasoning logic $\\sum_{i} {{r_b^i} \\times\n{\\lambda_w^i}} =pred$ behind the decisions. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nphysics-based two-stage feature decomposition method for interpretable deep SAR\nATR, which transforms uninterpretable deep features into attribute scattering\ncenter components (ASCC) with clear physical meanings. First, ASCCs are\nobtained through a clustering algorithm. To extract independent physical\ncomponents from deep features, we propose a two-stage decomposition method. In\nthe first stage, a feature decoupling and discrimination module separates deep\nfeatures into approximate ASCCs with global discriminability. In the second\nstage, a multilayer orthogonal non-negative matrix tri-factorization (MLO-NMTF)\nfurther decomposes the ASCCs into independent components with distinct physical\nmeanings. The MLO-NMTF elegantly aligns with the clustering algorithms to\nobtain ASCCs. Finally, this method ensures both an interpretable reasoning\nprocess and accurate recognition results. Extensive experiments on four\nbenchmark datasets confirm its effectiveness, showcasing the method's\ninterpretability, robust recognition performance, and strong generalization\ncapability.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Diffusion distillation is a widely used technique to reduce the sampling cost\nof diffusion models, yet it often requires extensive training, and the student\nperformance tends to be degraded. Recent studies show that incorporating a GAN\nobjective may alleviate these issues, yet the underlying mechanism remains\nunclear. In this work, we first identify a key limitation of distillation:\nmismatched step sizes and parameter numbers between the teacher and the student\nmodel lead them to converge to different local minima, rendering direct\nimitation suboptimal. We further demonstrate that a standalone GAN objective,\nwithout relying a distillation loss, overcomes this limitation and is\nsufficient to convert diffusion models into efficient one-step generators.\nBased on this finding, we propose that diffusion training may be viewed as a\nform of generative pre-training, equipping models with capabilities that can be\nunlocked through lightweight GAN fine-tuning. Supporting this view, we create a\none-step generation model by fine-tuning a pre-trained model with 85% of\nparameters frozen, achieving strong performance with only 0.2M images and\nnear-SOTA results with 5M images. We further present a frequency-domain\nanalysis that may explain the one-step generative capability gained in\ndiffusion training.

These models primarily extract embeddings for speaker\nidentification but fail to capture demographic attributes such as dialect,\ngender, and age in a structured manner.

This allows for the creation of\ndetailed captions based on speaker embeddings. CoLMbo utilizes user-defined\nprompts to adapt dynamically to new speaker characteristics and provides\ncustomized descriptions, including regional dialect variations and age-related\ntraits.

For instance, fluorescence\nmeasurements -- commonly used to assess gene activation -- may reflect not only\nnewly produced proteins but also those inherited through successive cell\ndivisions. In such cases, observed protein levels in any given cell are shaped\nby its division history. As a case study, we examine activation of the glc3\ngene in yeast involved in glycogen synthesis and expressed under\nnutrient-limiting conditions. We monitor this activity using snapshot\nfluorescence measurements via flow cytometry, where GFP expression reflects\nglc3 promoter activity. A na\\\"ive analysis of flow cytometry data ignoring cell\ndivision suggests many cells are active with low expression. Explicitly\naccounting for the (non-Markovian) effects of cell division and protein\ninheritance makes it impossible to write down a tractable likelihood -- a key\ningredient in physics-inspired inference, defining the probability of observing\ndata given a model. The dependence on a cell's division history breaks the\nassumptions of standard (Markovian) master equations, rendering traditional\nlikelihood-based approaches inapplicable. Instead, we adapt conditional\nnormalizing flows (a class of neural network models designed to learn\nprobability distributions) to approximate otherwise intractable likelihoods\nfrom simulated data. In doing so, we find that glc3 is mostly inactive under\nstress, showing that while cells occasionally activate the gene, expression is\nbrief and transient.",

In this survey, we comprehensively review\nanomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a\ntutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical\nimplementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and\nmultimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly\ndetection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent\nsynergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where\ngeneration techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly\ndata scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve\ngeneration fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their\nindividual potential.

    "abstract": "The Cahn-Hilliard equation with Flory-Huggins potential serves as a\nfundamental phase field model for describing phase separation phenomena. Due to\nthe presence of logarithmic singularities at $u=\\pm 1$, the solution $u$ is\nconstrained within the interval $(-1,1)$. While convex splitting schemes are\ncommonly employed to preserve this bound and guarantee unconditional unique\nsolvability, their practical implementation requires solving nonlinear systems\ncontaining singular logarithmic terms at each time step. This introduces\nsignificant challenges in both ensuring convergence of iterative solvers and\nmaintaining the solution bounds throughout the iterations. Existing solvers\noften rely on restrictive conditions -- such as the strict separation property\nor small time step sizes -- to ensure convergence, which can limit their\napplicability. In this work, we introduce a novel iterative solver that is\nspecifically designed for singular nonlinear systems, with the use of a variant\nof the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). By developing a\ntailored variable splitting strategy within the ADMM framework, our method\nefficiently decouples the challenging logarithmic nonlinearity, enabling\neffective handling of singularities. Crucially, we rigorously prove the\nunconditional convergence of our ADMM-based solver, which removes the need for\ntime step constraints or strict separation conditions. This allows us to fully\nleverage the unconditional solvability offered by convex splitting schemes.\nComprehensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior efficiency and\nrobustness of our ADMM variant, strongly validating both our algorithmic design\nand theoretical results.",

Our method models segmentation as the\ndeformation of a template curve via a diffeomorphic transformation of the image\ndomain, using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM)\nframework. The curve evolution is guided by a loss function that compares the\ndeformed curve to the image gradient field, formulated through the varifold\nrepresentation of geometric shapes.

Short-channel effects\n(SCEs) dominate cryogenic benefits at Lg = 25 nm for T < 25 K, as evidenced by\na modest improvement in the minimum subthreshold swing and threshold voltage\nroll-off with temperature in this range. Additionally, localized defects\nexacerbate SCEs, increasing the OFF current and subthreshold swing, while\nbroader trap distributions yield higher carrier mobility. Higher trap densities\namplify SCEs, degrade surface mobility, and worsen threshold voltage roll-off.\nThis study also addresses the impact of technology scaling parameters, such as\noxide thickness and gate length, on SCEs at cryogenic temperatures. The\ncalibrated TCAD deck aligns closely with experimental data for low and high\ndrain biases at T = 4.2 K, 77 K, and 300 K, providing robust methodologies for\nsimulating and predicting the characteristics of short-channel cryogenic FETs.\nThe detailed TCAD Sentaurus deck implementation methodology is explained, which\ncan be further used to design low-temperature technologies.

    "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent\ncatastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new\ntasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only\nneeds to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This\narises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the\nmodel to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks.\nFrom feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases\nsimultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address\nthis, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous\nmemories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old\ntasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error\nErasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in\nthe feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of\npotentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is\nerased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples.\nAdditionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed\nto reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream\ntasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly\nmitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and\nlower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods.

However, due to the\nscarcity of tri-modal data, research on tri-modal action recognition tasks\nfaces many challenges. To this end, we have proposed a comprehensive multimodal\naction recognition solution that effectively utilizes multimodal information.\nFirst, the existing data are transformed and expanded by optimizing data\nenhancement techniques to enlarge the training scale. At the same time, more\nRGB datasets are used to pre-train the backbone network, which is better\nadapted to the new task by means of transfer learning. Secondly, multimodal\nspatial features are extracted with the help of 2D CNNs and combined with the\nTemporal Shift Module (TSM) to achieve multimodal spatial-temporal feature\nextraction comparable to 3D CNNs and improve the computational efficiency. In\naddition, common prediction enhancement methods, such as Stochastic Weight\nAveraging (SWA), Ensemble and Test-Time augmentation (TTA), are used to\nintegrate the knowledge of models from different training periods of the same\narchitecture and different architectures, so as to predict the actions from\ndifferent perspectives and fully exploit the target information.

    "abstract": "Can AI protein models follow human language instructions and design proteins\nwith desired functions (e.g. binding to a ligand)? Designing proteins that bind\nto a given ligand is crucial in a wide range of applications in biology and\nchemistry. Most prior AI models are trained on protein-ligand complex data,\nwhich is scarce due to the high cost and time requirements of laboratory\nexperiments. In contrast, there is a substantial body of human-curated text\ndescriptions about protein-ligand interactions and ligand formula. In this\npaper, we propose InstructPro, a family of protein generative models that\nfollow natural language instructions to design ligand-binding proteins. Given a\ntextual description of the desired function and a ligand formula in SMILES,\nInstructPro generates protein sequences that are functionally consistent with\nthe specified instructions. We develop the model architecture, training\nstrategy, and a large-scale dataset, InstructProBench, to support both training\nand evaluation. InstructProBench consists of 9,592,829 triples of (function\ndescription, ligand formula, protein sequence). We train two model variants:\nInstructPro-1B (with 1 billion parameters) and InstructPro-3B~(with 3 billion\nparameters). Both variants consistently outperform strong baselines, including\nProGen2, ESM3, and Pinal. Notably, InstructPro-1B achieves the highest docking\nsuccess rate (81.52% at moderate confidence) and the lowest average root mean\nsquare deviation (RMSD) compared to ground truth structures (4.026{\\AA}).\nInstructPro-3B further descreases the average RMSD to 2.527{\\AA}, demonstrating\nInstructPro's ability to generate ligand-binding proteins that align with the\nfunctional specifications.",

This thesis advances LLM alignment by introducing\nnovel methodologies in data collection, training, and evaluation. We first\naddress alignment data collection. Existing approaches rely heavily on manually\ncurated datasets or proprietary models. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose Lion, an adversarial distillation framework that iteratively refines\ntraining data by identifying and generating challenging instructions, enabling\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot reasoning. Additionally, we introduce Web\nReconstruction (WebR), a fully automated framework that synthesizes\ninstruction-tuning data directly from raw web documents, significantly\nimproving data diversity and scalability over existing synthetic data methods.\nNext, we enhance alignment training through novel optimization techniques. We\ndevelop Learning to Edit (LTE), a framework that enables LLMs to efficiently\nintegrate new knowledge while preserving existing information. LTE leverages\nmeta-learning to improve both real-time and batch knowledge updates.\nFurthermore, we introduce Bridging and Modeling Correlations (BMC), a\nrefinement of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) that explicitly captures\ntoken-level correlations in preference data, leading to superior alignment\nacross QA and mathematical reasoning tasks. Finally, we tackle the challenge of\nevaluating alignment. Existing benchmarks emphasize response quality but\noverlook adherence to specific constraints.

This paper presents QARMA, a novel\nQubit mapping using Attention-based deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) for\nModular quantum Architectures, along with its extension QARMA-R that\nincorporates dynamic qubit reuse capabilities. Our approach combines an\nattention-based mechanism with Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn optimal\nqubit allocation, routing, and reuse strategies that minimize inter-core\ncommunications. We introduce two key innovations: (1) a transformer-based\nencoder that captures both the global circuit structure and local qubit\ninteractions and (2) a dynamic qubit reuse compilation mechanism that leverages\nmid-circuit measurement and reset operations to reduce inter-operation and\nqubit requirements. Our experimental results show significant improvements over\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

Although quantum adiabatic evolution is\ninherently robust against control errors, it typically demands long evolution\ntimes. In this work, we propose to achieve rapid adiabatic evolution, in which\nnonadiabatic transitions induced by fast changes in the system Hamiltonian are\nmitigated by flipping the nonadiabatic transition matrix using $\\pi$ pulses.\nThis enables a faster realization of adiabatic evolution while preserving its\nrobustness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in both two-level\nand three-level systems.

    "abstract": "First-order phase transitions in the early universe can generate stochastic\ngravitational waves (GWs), offering a unique probe of high-scale particle\nphysics. The Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), which restores parity symmetry\nat high energies and naturally incorporates the seesaw mechanism, allows for\nsuch transitions -- particularly during the spontaneous breaking of $SU(2)_R\n\\times SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_{B-L} \\to SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$. This initial step,\nthough less studied, is both theoretically motivated and potentially observable\nvia GWs. In this work, we investigate the GW signatures associated with this\nfirst-step phase transition in the minimal LRSM. Due to the complexity and\ndimensionality of its parameter space, traditional scanning approaches are\ncomputationally intensive and inefficient. To overcome this challenge, we\nemploy a Machine Learning Scan (MLS) strategy, integrated with the\nhigh-precision three-dimensional effective field theory framework -- using\nPhaseTracer as an interface to DRalgo -- to efficiently identify\nphenomenologically viable regions of the parameter space. Through successive\nMLS iterations, we identify a parameter region that yields GW signals\ndetectable at forthcoming gravitational wave observatories, such as BBO and\nDECIGO. Additionally, we analyse the evolution of the MLS-recommended parameter\nspace across iterations and perform a sensitivity analysis to identify the most\ninfluential parameters in the model. Our findings underscore both the\nobservational prospects of gravitational waves from LRSM phase transitions and\nthe efficacy of machine learning techniques in probing complex beyond the\nStandard-Model landscapes.",

Here, we employ\nfirst-principles calculations to systematically investigate the sliding\nferroelectricity-mediated topological transitions in bilayer MBi2Te4 (M = Ge,\nSn, Pb). By strategically engineering interlayer sliding configurations with\noppositely polarized states, we demonstrate reversible band inversion\naccompanied by topological phase transitions. The calculated spin-orbit-coupled\nbandgaps reach 31 meV (GeBi2Te4), 36 meV (SnBi2Te4), and 35 meV (PbBi2Te4),\nthereby enabling room-temperature observation of the quantum spin Hall effect.\nCrucially, these systems exhibit substantial out-of-plane ferroelectric\npolarization magnitudes of 0.571-0.623 pC/m, with PbBi2Te4 showing the maximum\npolarization (0.623 pC/m). The topological nontriviality is unambiguously\nconfirmed by two independent signatures: (i) the computed z2 topological\ninvariant, and (ii) the emergence of gapless helical edge states spanning the\nbulk insulating gap. This synergy arises from the unique sliding-induced charge\nredistribution mechanism, which simultaneously modulates Berry curvature and\nbreaks in-plane inversion symmetry without disrupting out-of-plane polarization\nstability. The co-engineering of non-volatile ferroelectric switching and\ntopologically protected conduction channels in MBi2Te4 bilayers establishes a\nmaterial paradigm for designing reconfigurable quantum devices, where\nelectronic topology can be electrically controlled via polarization reversal.\nOur results provide critical insights into manipulating correlated quantum\nstates in van der Waals ferroelectrics for multifunctional nanoelectronics.",

To further balance efficiency and accuracy\nunder dynamic workload conditions, we introduce DSLA-Serve, an online adaptive\ndistillation framework that progressively replaces Transformer layers with DSLA\nlayers at inference time, guided by a sensitivity-based layer ordering.\nDSLA-Serve uses a chained fine-tuning strategy to ensure that each newly\nconverted DSLA layer remains consistent with previously replaced layers,\npreserving the overall quality. Extensive evaluations on commonsense reasoning,\nlong-context QA, and text summarization demonstrate that DSLA-Serve yields 2.3x\nfaster inference than Llama2-7B and 3.0x faster than the hybrid Zamba-7B, while\nretaining comparable performance across downstream tasks.

A surrogate model trained to determine\nwhether surface recombination dominates the plasma-surface interactions in a\nPEALD process achieves 99% accuracy.

Differential Privacy (DP) offers formal\nprotection, but achieving a favourable utility-privacy trade-off remains\nchallenging. Recent works explore deep learning-based generative models to\nproduce synthetic trajectories. However, current models lack formal privacy\nguarantees and rely on conditional information derived from real data during\ngeneration. This work investigates the utility cost of enforcing DP in such\nmodels, addressing three research questions across two datasets and eleven\nutility metrics. (1) We evaluate how DP-SGD, the standard DP training method\nfor deep learning, affects the utility of state-of-the-art generative models.\n(2) Since DP-SGD is limited to unconditional models, we propose a novel DP\nmechanism for conditional generation that provides formal guarantees and assess\nits impact on utility. (3) We analyse how model types - Diffusion, VAE, and GAN\n- affect the utility-privacy trade-off. Our results show that DP-SGD\nsignificantly impacts performance, although some utility remains if the\ndatasets is sufficiently large. The proposed DP mechanism improves training\nstability, particularly when combined with DP-SGD, for unstable models such as\nGANs and on smaller datasets. Diffusion models yield the best utility without\nguarantees, but with DP-SGD, GANs perform best, indicating that the best\nnon-private model is not necessarily optimal when targeting formal guarantees.\nIn conclusion, DP trajectory generation remains a challenging task, and formal\nguarantees are currently only feasible with large datasets and in constrained\nuse cases.",

    "abstract": "We present a first principles calculation within quantum chromodynamics (QCD)\nof the radiative decays of the $J/\\psi$ into the light pseudoscalar mesons\n$\\eta$ and $\\eta'$. Within a lattice computation we obtain the transition\nform-factors as a function of photon virtuality from the timelike region,\naccessible experimentally via the 'Dalitz' decay $J/\\psi \\to e^+ e^-\\,\n\\eta^{(\\prime)} $, through to the real photon point corresponding to $J/\\psi\n\\to \\gamma\\, \\eta^{(\\prime)} $. This is the first calculation in lattice QCD\nwith two (heavier than physical) degenerate flavors of light quark and a\nheavier strange quark, in which the $\\eta'$ appears as the first-excited state\nwith pseudoscalar isoscalar quantum numbers. We access it reliably by using\nvariationally optimized operators, use of which also improves the purity of the\n$J/\\psi$ and $\\eta$ signals, reducing systematic uncertainties. High quality\nresults at a large number of kinematic points are obtained in a typically noisy\ndisconnected process by using a novel correlator averaging procedure. Our\nresults show the expected enhanced production of the $\\eta'$ over the $\\eta$ in\nthis process, and suggest that the demonstrated lattice technology is suitable\nfor future calculations considering processes in which light meson resonances\nare produced.",

    "abstract": "We report on the computation of amplitudes describing the radiative decay\nprocesses $J/\\psi \\to \\gamma \\, \\eta$ and $J/\\psi \\to \\gamma \\, \\eta'$ from\nfirst principles via lattice QCD. Using lattices with two degenerate flavors of\nlight quark and a heavier strange quark where $m_\\pi \\sim 391$ MeV, we compute\nthree-point correlation functions using optimized meson operators with a range\nof momenta. The use of optimized operators allows access to the $\\eta'$, even\nthough it appears as an excited state, lying above the ground-state $\\eta$ in\nthe isoscalar pseudoscalar channel. Statistically precise signals are obtained\nin this disconnected process by averaging over large numbers of kinematically\nequivalent correlators. We determine transition form-factors as a function of\nphoton virtuality across the timelike region, which describe also the 'Dalitz'\nprocesses $J/\\psi \\to e^+ e^- \\, \\eta^{(\\prime)}$. Significantly lower\nmagnitudes of transition form-factor for both the $\\eta$ and $\\eta'$ are found\nthan those extracted from experimental data, and possible explanations for this\nobservation are presented.",

    "abstract": "We make use of the perturbation theory for modified gravity models that we\ndeveloped in previous works and apply it to construct the fullshape galaxy\npower spectrum for the Symmetron modified gravity model. First, we study the\ngrowth rate, that is a scale dependent quantity, and compare our results with\nthose of the $n=1 $ Hu-Sawcki (HS) model, finding that the Symmetron has a\ngrowth quite similar to the HS F6 in the wavenumber interval $0.01 \\leq k \\leq\n0.1 $ and for redshifts where Symmetron model is viable. We also propose a\ngrowth parametrization that turns to be a good approximation for the HS and\nSymmetron models, with a deviation less than $0.6 \\%$. To compute the RSD\nmultipoles we employ an expansion of the velocity moments generating function\nthat is suitable for general modified gravity models. Later, we apply the\nfk-Perturbation Theory (fkPT) approximation to reduce the computation time of\nnonlinear kernels, to find the fullshape galaxy power spectrum for the\nSymmetron, and study the differences with HS model. The RSD multipoles of the\nSymmetron result similar to those of the HS F6 model. Next, we integrate this\ntheory to an MCMC sampler and validate our results by fitting our parameters to\nEZMocks to recover the parameters that bring the model to GR. We found a\nsimilar agreement in the model validation between Symmetron and F6 model,\nrecovering the simulation cosmological parameters, and concluding that our\npipeline is ready to make cosmological parameters' inference with real data.",

    "abstract": "We study the charged black hole solutions of a 2+1 nonlinear electrodynamical\ntheory with cosmological constant. Considered as a one-parameter group of\ntheories (the exponent of the squared Maxwell tensor) the causal structure of\nall possible black holes is scrutinized. We analyze the singularity character\nthat each theory delivers together with their horizons and the plausible\nlimitations in the black hole charges. The investigation demonstrates a rich\nstructure of three different groups of theories, according to the qualitative\nbehavior of the singularity, horizons and limitations in the geometric charges.\nFor such groups we study the effect of a scalar field propagating in the fixed\nblack holes spacetime. All geometries analyzed were stable to such linear\nperturbations, these evolving as usual quasinormal spectra of the black holes\nthat we calculate in different cases.",
