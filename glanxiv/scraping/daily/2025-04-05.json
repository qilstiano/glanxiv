    "abstract": "In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have become a powerful tool\nfor improving the accuracy of predictions and decision-making. Machine learning\ntechnologies have begun to penetrate all areas, including the real estate\nsector. Correct forecasting of real estate value plays an important role in the\nbuyer-seller chain, because it ensures reasonableness of price expectations\nbased on the offers available in the market and helps to avoid financial risks\nfor both parties of the transaction. Accurate forecasting is also important for\nreal estate investors to make an informed decision on a specific property. This\nstudy helps to gain a deeper understanding of how effective and accurate\nensemble machine learning methods are in predicting real estate values. The\nresults obtained in the work are quite accurate, as can be seen from the\ncoefficient of determination (R^2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean\nabsolute error (MAE) calculated for each model. The Gradient Boosting Regressor\nmodel provides the highest accuracy, the Extra Trees Regressor, Hist Gradient\nBoosting Regressor and Random Forest Regressor models give good results. In\ngeneral, ensemble machine learning techniques can be effectively used to solve\nreal estate valuation. This work forms ideas for future research, which consist\nin the preliminary processing of the data set by searching and extracting\nanomalous values, as well as the practical implementation of the obtained\nresults.",

Half of the questions involve query types, which return information\nin its original format, while the remaining 50% are statistical analysis\nquestions, which perform statistical operations on the data. The Python code\nlabels in our dataset cover 4 types of query types and 40 types of statistical\nanalysis patterns. We evaluated the SIGMA dataset using three different\nbaseline models: LGESQL, SmBoP, and SLSQL. The experimental results show that\nthe LGESQL model with ELECTRA outperforms all other models, achieving 83.37%\nstructure accuracy.

    "abstract": "While Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have gained significant traction across\nvarious fields, path planning in 3D environments remains a critical challenge,\nparticularly under size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints. Traditional\nmodular planning systems often introduce latency and suboptimal performance due\nto limited information sharing and local minima issues. End-to-end learning\napproaches streamline the pipeline by mapping sensory observations directly to\nactions but require large-scale datasets, face significant sim-to-real gaps, or\nlack dynamical feasibility. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised UAV\ntrajectory planning pipeline that integrates a learning-based depth perception\nwith differentiable trajectory optimization. A 3D cost map guides UAV behavior\nwithout expert demonstrations or human labels. Additionally, we incorporate a\nneural network-based time allocation strategy to improve the efficiency and\noptimality. The system thus combines robust learning-based perception with\nreliable physics-based optimization for improved generalizability and\ninterpretability. Both simulation and real-world experiments validate our\napproach across various environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and\nrobustness. Our method achieves a 31.33% improvement in position tracking error\nand 49.37% reduction in control effort compared to the state-of-the-art.",

    "abstract": "Uncertainties in renewable energy resources (RES) and load variations can\nlead to elevated system operational costs. Moreover, the emergence of\nlarge-scale distributed threats, such as load-altering attacks (LAAs), can\ninduce substantial load variations, further exacerbating these costs. Although\ntraditional defense measures can reduce the likelihood of such attacks,\nconsiderable residual risks remain. Thus, this paper proposes a cyber insurance\nframework designed to hedge against additional operational costs resulting from\nLAAs and substantial load variations in renewable-rich grids. The insurance\nframework determines both the insurance coverage and premium based on the Value\nat Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR). These risk metrics are calculated\nusing the system failure probability and the probability density function (PDF)\nof the system operation cost. The system failure probability is assessed\nthrough a semi-Markov process (SMP), while the cost distribution is estimated\nthrough a cost minimization model of a distribution grid combined with a\nMonte-Carlo simulation to capture load variability. Furthermore, we employ a\nbi-level optimization scheme that identifies the specific load distribution\nleading to the maximum system cost, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the\noperation cost PDF estimation. The effectiveness and scalability of the\nproposed cyber insurance policy are evaluated considering a modified IEEE-118\ntest bus system and the IEEE European low-voltage (LV) test feeders model. The\ncase study shows that with a relatively low premium, the network operator can\nhedge against additional operational costs caused by malicious load\nmanipulations.",

    "abstract": "Cloud-based quantum service providers allow multiple users to run programs on\nshared hardware concurrently to maximize resource utilization and minimize\noperational costs. This multi-tenant computing (MTC) model relies on the error\nparameters of the hardware for fair qubit allocation and scheduling, as\nerror-prone qubits can degrade computational accuracy asymmetrically for users\nsharing the hardware. To maintain low error rates, quantum providers perform\nperiodic hardware calibration, often relying on third-party calibration\nservices. If an adversary within this calibration service misreports error\nrates, the allocator can be misled into making suboptimal decisions even when\nthe physical hardware remains unchanged. We demonstrate such an attack model in\nwhich an adversary strategically misreports qubit error rates to reduce\nhardware throughput, and probability of successful trial (PST) for two\npreviously proposed allocation frameworks, i.e. Greedy and Community-Based\nDynamic Allocation Partitioning (COMDAP). Experimental results show that\nadversarial misreporting increases execution latency by 24% and reduces PST by\n7.8%.

However, for MTS data, correlations\nbetween variables often vary across domains, whereas most existing UDA works\nfor MTS classification have overlooked this essential characteristic.

A correlation alignment loss is further proposed to mitigate\ncorrelation shift, bypassing the alignment challenge from the non-i.i.d. nature\nof MTS data. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that\n(1) compared with vanilla Transformer-based models, CATS increases over $10\\%$\naverage accuracy while only adding around $1\\%$ parameters, and (2) all\nTransformer variants equipped with CATS either reach or surpass\nstate-of-the-art baselines.",

Given text and\nimages from home-service project descriptions provided by Thumbtack customers,\nwe build embeddings-based softmax models that predict the professional category\n(e.g., handyman, bathroom remodeling) associated with each problem description.\nWe then compare against prompts that ask state-of-the-art LLM models to solve\nthe same problem. We find that the embeddings approach outperforms the best LLM\nprompts in terms of accuracy, calibration, latency, and financial cost. In\nparticular, the embeddings approach has 49.5% higher accuracy than the\nprompting approach, and its superiority is consistent across text-only,\nimage-only, and text-image problem descriptions. Furthermore, it yields\nwell-calibrated probabilities, which we later use as confidence signals to\nprovide contextualized user experience during deployment. On the contrary,\nprompting scores are overly uninformative. Finally, the embeddings approach is\n14 and 81 times faster than prompting in processing images and text\nrespectively, while under realistic deployment assumptions, it can be up to 10\ntimes cheaper. Based on these results, we deployed a variation of the\nembeddings approach, and through A/B testing we observed performance consistent\nwith our offline analysis.

    "abstract": "This paper compares model-agnostic and model-specific approaches to\nexplainable AI (XAI) in deep learning image classification. I examine how LIME\nand SHAP (model-agnostic methods) differ from Grad-CAM and Guided\nBackpropagation (model-specific methods) when interpreting ResNet50 predictions\nacross diverse image categories. Through extensive testing with various species\nfrom dogs and birds to insects I found that each method reveals different\naspects of the models decision-making process. Model-agnostic techniques\nprovide broader feature attribution that works across different architectures,\nwhile model-specific approaches excel at highlighting precise activation\nregions with greater computational efficiency. My analysis shows there is no\n\"one-size-fits-all\" solution for model interpretability. Instead, combining\nmultiple XAI methods offers the most comprehensive understanding of complex\nmodels particularly valuable in high-stakes domains like healthcare, autonomous\nvehicles, and financial services where transparency is crucial. This\ncomparative framework provides practical guidance for selecting appropriate\ninterpretability techniques based on specific application needs and\ncomputational constraints.",

    "abstract": "Negation is a universal feature of natural languages. In Brazilian\nPortuguese, the most commonly used negation particle is n\\~ao, which can scope\nover nouns or verbs. When it scopes over a verb, n\\~ao can occur in three\npositions: pre-verbal (NEG1), double negation (NEG2), or post-verbal (NEG3),\ne.g., n\\~ao gosto, n\\~ao gosto n\\~ao, gosto n\\~ao (\"I do not like it\"). From a\nvariationist perspective, these structures are different forms of expressing\nnegation. Pragmatically, they serve distinct communicative functions, such as\npoliteness and modal evaluation. Despite their grammatical acceptability, these\nforms differ in frequency. NEG1 dominates across Brazilian regions, while NEG2\nand NEG3 appear more rarely, suggesting its use is contextually restricted.\nThis low-frequency challenges research, often resulting in subjective,\nnon-generalizable interpretations of verbal negation with n\\~ao. To address\nthis, we developed negativas, a tool for automatically identifying NEG1, NEG2,\nand NEG3 in transcribed data. The tool's development involved four stages: i)\nanalyzing a dataset of 22 interviews from the Falares Sergipanos database,\nannotated by three linguists, ii) creating a code using natural language\nprocessing (NLP) techniques, iii) running the tool, iv) evaluating accuracy.\nInter-annotator consistency, measured using Fleiss' Kappa, was moderate (0.57).\nThe tool identified 3,338 instances of n\\~ao, classifying 2,085 as NEG1, NEG2,\nor NEG3, achieving a 93% success rate. However, negativas has limitations. NEG1\naccounted for 91.5% of identified structures, while NEG2 and NEG3 represented\n7.2% and 1.2%, respectively. The tool struggled with NEG2, sometimes\nmisclassifying instances as overlapping structures (NEG1/NEG2/NEG3).",

We justify why momentum is needed to obtain the\nimproved performance using the theory of backward analysis for splitting\nintegrators and provide a detailed analytic computation of the stochastic\ngradient bias on a simple example.\n  Further, we provide improved convergence guarantees for this new minibatching\nstrategy using Lyapunov techniques that show reduced stochastic gradient bias\nfor a fixed stepsize (or learning rate) over the class of strongly-convex and\nsmooth objective functions. Via the same techniques we also improve the known\nresults for the Random Reshuffling strategy for stochastic gradient descent\nmethods with momentum. We argue that this also leads to a faster convergence\nrate when considering a decreasing stepsize schedule. Both the reduced bias and\nefficacy of decreasing stepsizes are demonstrated numerically on several\nmotivating examples.",

This study\npresents ECG-DiaNet, a multimodal deep learning model that integrates\nelectrocardiogram (ECG) features with clinical risk factors (CRFs) to enhance\nT2DM onset prediction. Using data from Qatar Biobank (QBB), we trained and\nvalidated models on a development cohort (n=2043) and evaluated performance on\na longitudinal test set (n=395) with five-year follow-up. ECG-DiaNet\noutperformed unimodal ECG-only and CRF-only models, achieving a higher AUROC\n(0.845 vs 0.8217) than the CRF-only model, with statistical significance\n(DeLong p<0.001). Reclassification metrics further confirmed improvements: Net\nReclassification Improvement (NRI=0.0153) and Integrated Discrimination\nImprovement (IDI=0.0482). Risk stratification into low-, medium-, and high-risk\ngroups showed ECG-DiaNet achieved superior positive predictive value (PPV) in\nhigh-risk individuals. The model's reliance on non-invasive and widely\navailable ECG signals supports its feasibility in clinical and community health\nsettings.

    "abstract": "Information on standing dead trees is important for understanding forest\necosystem functioning and resilience but has been lacking over large geographic\nregions. Climate change has caused large-scale tree mortality events that can\nremain undetected due to limited data. In this study, we propose a novel method\nfor segmenting standing dead trees using aerial multispectral orthoimages.\nBecause access to annotated datasets has been a significant problem in forest\nremote sensing due to the need for forest expertise, we introduce a method for\ndomain transfer by leveraging domain adaptation to learn a transformation from\na source domain X to target domain Y. In this Image-to-Image translation task,\nwe aim to utilize available annotations in the target domain by pre-training a\nsegmentation network. When images from a new study site without annotations are\nintroduced (source domain X), these images are transformed into the target\ndomain. Then, transfer learning is applied by inferring the pre-trained network\non domain-adapted images. In addition to investigating the feasibility of\ncurrent domain adaptation approaches for this objective, we propose a novel\napproach called the Attention-guided Domain Adaptation Network (ADA-Net) with\nenhanced contrastive learning. Accordingly, the ADA-Net approach provides new\nstate-of-the-art domain adaptation performance levels outperforming existing\napproaches. We have evaluated the proposed approach using two datasets from\nFinland and the US.

    "abstract": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major global health issue which is\naffecting million people around the world and with increasing rate of\nmortality. Mitigation of progression of CKD and better patient outcomes\nrequires early detection. Nevertheless, limitations lie in traditional\ndiagnostic methods, especially in resource constrained settings. This study\nproposes an advanced machine learning approach to enhance CKD detection by\nevaluating four models: Random Forest (RF), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),\nLogistic Regression (LR), and a fine-tuned CatBoost algorithm. Specifically,\namong these, the fine-tuned CatBoost model demonstrated the best overall\nperformance having an accuracy of 98.75%, an AUC of 0.9993 and a Kappa score of\n97.35% of the studies. The proposed CatBoost model has used a nature inspired\nalgorithm such as Simulated Annealing to select the most important features,\nCuckoo Search to adjust outliers and grid search to fine tune its settings in\nsuch a way to achieve improved prediction accuracy. Features significance is\nexplained by SHAP-a well-known XAI technique-for gaining transparency in the\ndecision-making process of proposed model and bring up trust in diagnostic\nsystems. Using SHAP, the significant clinical features were identified as\nspecific gravity, serum creatinine, albumin, hemoglobin, and diabetes mellitus.\nThe potential of advanced machine learning techniques in CKD detection is shown\nin this research, particularly for low income and middle-income healthcare\nsettings where prompt and correct diagnoses are vital. This study seeks to\nprovide a highly accurate, interpretable, and efficient diagnostic tool to add\nto efforts for early intervention and improved healthcare outcomes for all CKD\npatients.",

This relationship suggests these scenarios can be tested\nby predicting biosignature distributions and comparing them with empirical\ndata. Here, we demonstrate this approach by focusing on the cyanosulfidic\norigins-of-life scenario and investigating the hypothesis that a minimum\nnear-ultraviolet (NUV) flux is necessary for abiogenesis. Using Bayesian\nmodeling and the \\bioverse\\ survey simulator, we constrain the probability of\nobtaining strong evidence for or against this ``UV Threshold Hypothesis'' with\nfuture biosignature surveys.\n  Our results indicate that a correlation between past NUV flux and current\nbiosignature occurrence is testable for sample sizes of $\\gtrsim$50 planets.\nThe diagnostic power of such tests is critically sensitive to the intrinsic\nabiogenesis rate and host star properties, particularly maximum past NUV\nfluxes. Surveys targeting a wide range of fluxes, and planets orbiting M dwarfs\nenhance the chances of conclusive results, with sample sizes $\\gtrsim$100\nproviding $\\gtrsim$80\\% likelihood of strong evidence if abiogenesis rates are\nhigh and the required NUV fluxes are moderate. For required fluxes exceeding a\nfew hundred erg/s/cm$^2$, both the fraction of inhabited planets and the\ndiagnostic power sharply decrease.\n  Our findings demonstrate the potential of exoplanet surveys to test\norigins-of-life hypotheses.

For instance, fully turbulent flow simulations of\nNavier-Stokes equations at Reynolds numbers 3500 and above can generate\nhigh-frequency signals due to swirling fluid motions caused by eddies and\nvortices. Faithfully modeling such signals using neural networks depends on\naccurately reconstructing moderate to high frequencies. However, it has been\nwell known that deep neural nets exhibit the so-called spectral bias toward\nlearning low-frequency components. Meanwhile, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)\nhave emerged as a popular class of data-driven models in recent years for\nsolving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and for surrogate modeling in\ngeneral. Although impressive results have been achieved on several PDE\nbenchmark problems, FNOs often perform poorly in learning non-dominant\nfrequencies characterized by local features. This limitation stems from the\nspectral bias inherent in neural networks and the explicit exclusion of\nhigh-frequency modes in FNOs and their variants. Therefore, to mitigate these\nissues and improve FNO's spectral learning capabilities to represent a broad\nrange of frequency components, we propose two key architectural enhancements:\n(i) a parallel branch performing local spectral convolutions (ii) a\nhigh-frequency propagation module. Moreover, we propose a novel\nfrequency-sensitive loss term based on radially binned spectral errors. This\nintroduction of a parallel branch for local convolutions reduces number of\ntrainable parameters by up to 50% while achieving the accuracy of baseline FNO\nthat relies solely on global convolutions. Experiments on three challenging PDE\nproblems in fluid mechanics and biological pattern formation, and the\nqualitative and spectral analysis of predictions show the effectiveness of our\nmethod over the state-of-the-art neural operator baselines.",

The automation, which includes a\npre-trained classifier, observes data for a batch of independent tasks,\nanalyzes them, and may refer a subset of tasks to a human operator for fresh\nand final analysis. Our key modeling assumption is that human performance\ndegrades with task load. We model the problem of choosing which tasks to refer\nas a stochastic optimization problem and show that, for a given task load, it\nis optimal to myopically refer tasks that yield the largest reduction in\nexpected cost, conditional on the observed data. This provides a ranking scheme\nand a policy to determine the optimal set of tasks for referral. We evaluate\nthis policy against a baseline through an experimental study with human\nparticipants. Using a radar screen simulator, participants made binary target\nclassification decisions under time constraint. They were guided by a decision\nrule provided to them, but were still prone to errors under time pressure. An\ninitial experiment estimated human performance model parameters, while a second\nexperiment compared two referral policies. Results show statistically\nsignificant gains for the proposed optimal referral policy over a blind policy\nthat determines referrals using the automation and human-performance models but\nnot based on the observed data.",

Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing have promised transformative\nadvances in this area through real-time data integration and automated\nproduction planning and control. However, the reliance on automation alone has\noften fallen short, lacking the flexibility needed for complex processes. To\nfully unlock the potential of smart manufacturing, we must evolve from\nautomation to autonomous systems that go beyond rigid programming and can\ndynamically optimize the search for solutions. Current discovery approaches are\noften slow, requiring numerous trials to find optimal combinations, and costly,\nparticularly when optimizing multiple properties simultaneously. This paper\nproposes a Bayesian multi-objective sequential decision-making (BMSDM)\nframework that can intelligently select experiments as manufacturing\nprogresses, guiding us toward the discovery of optimal design faster and more\nefficiently. The framework leverages sequential learning through Bayesian\nOptimization, which iteratively refines a statistical model representing the\nunderlying manufacturing process. This statistical model acts as a surrogate,\nallowing for efficient exploration and optimization without requiring numerous\nreal-world experiments. This approach can significantly reduce the time and\ncost of data collection required by traditional experimental designs. The\nproposed framework is compared with traditional DoE methods and two other\nmulti-objective optimization methods. Using a manufacturing dataset, we\nevaluate and compare the performance of these approaches across five evaluation\nmetrics.

Our results demonstrate model performance exhibiting\nhigher accuracy in ad-hoc benchmarks, lowering approximately 88% convergence\nrate for extra stochasticity time-series data within 100-steps, and showcasing\na more unbaised eigenvalue spectrum of the fisher information matrix on CPU/GPU\nand IonQ QPU simulators.",

A velocity maximum naturally divides the current\ninto inner and outer shear layers, which are weakly coupled by exchange of\nmomentum and buoyancy on timescales that are much longer than the typical\ntimescale characterizing either layer. The outer layer evolves to a\nself-similar regime with flow parameters taking constant characteristic values.\nThe flow behaviour in the outer layer is consistent with that found in a\ncurrent on a free-slip slope by van Reeuwijk et al. ($\\textit{J. Fluid Mech.}$,\nvol. 873, 2019, pp. 786-815), and the integral buoyancy forcing in the layer is\nbalanced solely by entrainment drag. The inner layer evolves to a quasi-steady\nstate, in which the buoyancy forcing is approximately balanced by wall drag.\nThe inner layer can be further decomposed into viscous and turbulent wall\nregions that have much in common with fully developed open channel flow. Using\nscaling laws within each layer and a matching condition at the velocity\nmaximum, we solve the entire flow system as a function of slope angle $\\alpha$,\nin good agreement with the simulation data.

    "abstract": "Modern AI models excel in controlled settings but often fail in real-world\nscenarios where data distributions shift unpredictably - a challenge known as\ndomain generalisation (DG). This paper tackles this limitation by rigorously\nevaluating vision tramsformers, specifically the BEIT architecture which is a\nmodel pre-trained with masked image modelling (MIM), against synthetic\nout-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks designed to mimic real-world noise and\nocclusions. We introduce a novel framework to generate OOD test cases by\nstrategically masking object regions in images using grid patterns (25\\%, 50\\%,\n75\\% occlusion) and leveraging cutting-edge zero-shot segmentation via Segment\nAnything and Grounding DINO to ensure precise object localisation.

Analysis of self-attention distances\nreveals that the BEIT dependence on global features correlates with its\nresilience. Furthermore, our synthetic benchmarks expose critical failure\nmodes: performance degrades sharply when occlusions disrupt object shapes e.g.\n68\\% drop for external grid masking vs. 22\\% for internal masking. This work\nprovides two key advances (1) a scalable method to generate OOD benchmarks\nusing controllable noise, and (2) empirical evidence that MIM and\nself-attention mechanism in vision transformers enhance DG by learning\ninvariant features.

    "abstract": "Recently, researchers have proposed many multi-agent frameworks for\nfunction-level code generation, which aim to improve software development\nproductivity by automatically generating function-level source code based on\ntask descriptions. A typical multi-agent framework consists of Large Language\nModel (LLM)-based agents that are responsible for task planning, code\ngeneration, testing, debugging, etc. Studies have shown that existing\nmulti-agent code generation frameworks perform well on ChatGPT. However, their\ngeneralizability across other foundation LLMs remains unexplored\nsystematically. In this paper, we report an empirical study on the\ngeneralizability of four state-of-the-art multi-agent code generation\nframeworks across six open-source LLMs with varying parameter sizes,\narchitectures, and performance levels. Our study reveals the unstable\ngeneralizability of existing frameworks on diverse foundation LLMs. Based on\nthe findings obtained from the empirical study, we propose AdaCoder, a novel\nadaptive planning, multi-agent framework for function-level code generation.\nAdaCoder has two phases. Phase-1 is an initial code generation step without\nplanning, which uses an LLM-based coding agent and a script-based testing agent\nto unleash LLM's native power, identify cases beyond LLM's power, and determine\nthe errors hindering execution. Phase-2 adds a rule-based debugging agent and\nan LLM-based planning agent for iterative code generation with planning. Our\nevaluation shows that AdaCoder achieves higher generalizability on diverse\nLLMs. Compared to the best baseline MapCoder, AdaCoder is on average 27.69%\nhigher in Pass@1, 16 times faster in inference, and 12 times lower in token\nconsumption.",

Each image was multilabel-annotated for the presence of\nnine dermoscopic patterns and categorized into one of four BCC subtypes:\nsuperficial, nodular, infiltrative, or micronodular. Statistical and\ninformation-theoretic methods were applied, including co-occurrence matrices,\nBayesian conditional probabilities, and entropy-based metrics. Mutual\ninformation quantified the predictive value of individual and paired patterns,\nand decision trees were built based on diagnostic informativeness.\n  Results: Nodular BCC was highly associated with most dermoscopic patterns,\nparticularly arborizing telangiectasia and blue-gray ovoid nests. Superficial\nBCC showed stronger associations with maple leaf-like structures and shiny\nwhite-red areas. Some patterns, like spoke-wheel areas and white streaks,\nshowed low discriminative power. Mutual information and conditional\nprobabilities identified meaningful pattern-pair dependencies for each subtype.\nDecision trees revealed that subsets of patterns could enhance subtype\nclassification by accumulating diagnostic information.\n  Conclusions: Information Theory enables a quantitative understanding of\ndermoscopic patterns and their relationship with BCC subtypes.

In this study, we address these challenges by precisely\nmatching the refractive indices of the continuous and dispersed phases,\nenabling us to measure local velocity information at high volume fractions. The\nemulsion is generated in a turbulent Taylor-Couette flow, with velocity\nmeasured at two radial locations: near the inner cylinder (boundary layer) and\nin the middle gap (bulk region). Near the inner cylinder, the presence of\ndroplets suppresses the emission of angular velocity plumes, which reduces the\nmean azimuthal velocity and its root mean squared fluctuation. The former\neffect leads to a higher angular velocity gradient in the boundary layer,\nresulting in greater global drag on the system. In the bulk region, although\ndroplets suppress turbulence fluctuations, they enhance the cross-correlation\nbetween azimuthal and radial velocities, leaving the angular velocity flux\ncontributed by the turbulent flow nearly unchanged. In both locations, droplets\nsuppress turbulence at scales larger than the average droplet diameter and\nincrease the intermittency of velocity increments. However, the effects of the\ndroplets are more pronounced near the inner cylinder than in the bulk, likely\nbecause droplets fragment in the boundary layer but are less prone to breakup\nin the bulk.

    "abstract": "Eliciting information to reduce uncertainty about a latent entity is a\ncritical task in many application domains, e.g., assessing individual student\nlearning outcomes, diagnosing underlying diseases, or learning user\npreferences. Though natural language is a powerful medium for this purpose,\nlarge language models (LLMs) and existing fine-tuning algorithms lack\nmechanisms for strategically gathering information to refine their own\nunderstanding of the latent entity. To harness the generalization power and\nworld knowledge of LLMs in developing effective information-gathering\nstrategies, we propose an adaptive elicitation framework that actively reduces\nuncertainty on the latent entity. Since probabilistic modeling of an abstract\nlatent entity is difficult, our framework adopts a predictive view of\nuncertainty, using a meta-learned language model to simulate future\nobservations and enable scalable uncertainty quantification over complex\nnatural language. Through autoregressive forward simulation, our model\nquantifies how new questions reduce epistemic uncertainty, enabling the\ndevelopment of sophisticated information-gathering strategies to choose the\nmost informative next queries. In experiments on the 20 questions game, dynamic\nopinion polling, and adaptive student assessment, our method consistently\noutperforms baselines in identifying critical unknowns and improving downstream\npredictions, illustrating the promise of strategic information gathering in\nnatural language settings.",

Despite the growing interest in\nLLM-based recommendations, unique challenges are brought to the trustworthiness\nof LLM-based recommender systems (LLM-RS). Compared to unique user/item\nrepresentations in conventional recommender systems, users and items share the\ntextual representation (e.g., word embeddings) in LLM-based recommendations.\nRecent studies have revealed that LLMs are likely to inherit stereotypes that\nare embedded ubiquitously in word embeddings, due to their training on\nlarge-scale uncurated datasets. This leads to LLM-RS exhibiting stereotypical\nlinguistic associations between users and items, causing a form of two-sided\n(i.e., user-to-item) recommendation fairness. However, there remains a lack of\nstudies investigating the unfairness of LLM-RS due to intrinsic stereotypes,\nwhich can simultaneously involve user and item groups. To bridge this gap, this\nstudy reveals a new variant of fairness between stereotype groups containing\nboth users and items, to quantify discrimination against stereotypes in LLM-RS.\nMoreover, in this paper, to mitigate stereotype-aware unfairness in textual\nuser and item representations, we propose a novel framework named\nMixture-of-Stereotypes (MoS). In particular, an insightful stereotype-wise\nrouting strategy over multiple stereotype-relevant experts is designed, aiming\nto learn unbiased representations against different stereotypes in LLM-RS.\nExtensive experiments are conducted to analyze the influence of\nstereotype-aware fairness in LLM-RS and the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethods, which consistently outperform competitive benchmarks under various\nfairness settings.",

Then we show that, for a class of pseudodifferential operators\nincluding the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the scattering manifolds, such\nestimates imply the global-in-time Strichartz estimates for the kinetic\ntransport equations in the semiclassical limit. As a byproduct we prove that\nthe existence of a periodic stable geodesic breaks the orthonormal Strichartz\nestimates. In the proof we do not need any quasimode. As an application we show\nthe small data scattering for the cutoff Boltzmann equation on nontrapping\nscattering manifolds.",

    "abstract": "Learning open-vocabulary physical skills for simulated agents presents a\nsignificant challenge in artificial intelligence. Current reinforcement\nlearning approaches face critical limitations: manually designed rewards lack\nscalability across diverse tasks, while demonstration-based methods struggle to\ngeneralize beyond their training distribution. We introduce GROVE, a\ngeneralized reward framework that enables open-vocabulary physical skill\nlearning without manual engineering or task-specific demonstrations. Our key\ninsight is that Large Language Models(LLMs) and Vision Language Models(VLMs)\nprovide complementary guidance -- LLMs generate precise physical constraints\ncapturing task requirements, while VLMs evaluate motion semantics and\nnaturalness. Through an iterative design process, VLM-based feedback\ncontinuously refines LLM-generated constraints, creating a self-improving\nreward system. To bridge the domain gap between simulation and natural images,\nwe develop Pose2CLIP, a lightweight mapper that efficiently projects agent\nposes directly into semantic feature space without computationally expensive\nrendering. Extensive experiments across diverse embodiments and learning\nparadigms demonstrate GROVE's effectiveness, achieving 22.2% higher motion\nnaturalness and 25.7% better task completion scores while training 8.4x faster\nthan previous methods. These results establish a new foundation for scalable\nphysical skill acquisition in simulated environments.",

Given the fundamental gap between the mechanism of LLMs and the\nrequirement of RS, researchers have focused on fine-tuning LLMs with\nrecommendation-specific data to enhance their performance. Language Modeling\nLoss (LML), originally designed for language generation tasks, is commonly\nadopted. However, we identify two critical limitations of LML: 1) it exhibits\nsignificant divergence from the recommendation objective; 2) it erroneously\ntreats all fictitious item descriptions as negative samples, introducing\nmisleading training signals.\n  To address these limitations, we propose a novel Masked Softmax Loss (MSL)\ntailored for fine-tuning LLMs on recommendation. MSL improves LML by\nidentifying and masking invalid tokens that could lead to fictitious item\ndescriptions during loss computation. This strategy can effectively avoid the\ninterference from erroneous negative signals and ensure well alignment with the\nrecommendation objective supported by theoretical guarantees. During\nimplementation, we identify a potential challenge related to gradient vanishing\nof MSL. To overcome this, we further introduce the temperature coefficient and\npropose an Adaptive Temperature Strategy (ATS) that adaptively adjusts the\ntemperature without requiring extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Following Voyager\nmeasurements of their ambient plasmas, laboratory data indicated that the\nobserved ions were supplied by and would in turn impact and sputtering their\nsurfaces, decomposing the ice and producing thin O2 atmospheres. More than a\ndecade later, Europa's ambient O2 was inferred from observations of the O\naurora and condensed O2 bands at 5773 and 6275 angstroms were observed in\nGanymede's icy surface. More than another decade later, the O2 atmosphere was\nshown to have a dusk/dawn enhancement, confirmed by Juno data. Although the\nincident plasma produces these observables, processes within the surface are\nstill not well understood. Here we note that incident plasma produces a\nnon-equilibrium defect density in the surface grains. Subsequent diffusion\nleads to the formation of voids and molecular products, some of which are\nvolatile. Although some volatiles are released into their atmospheres, others\nare trapped at defects or in voids forming gas bubbles, which might be\ndelivered to their subsurface oceans. Here we discuss how trapping competes\nwith annealing of the radiation damage. We describe differences observed at\nEuropa and Ganymede and roughly determine the trend with latitude of O2 bands\non Ganymede's trailing hemisphere. This understanding is used to discuss the\nimportance of condensed and adsorbed O2 as atmospheric sources, accounting for\ndusk/dawn enhancements and temporal variability reported in condensed O2 band\ndepths. Since plasma and thermal annealing timescales affect the observed O2\nvariability on all of the icy moons, understanding the critical physical\nprocesses of O2 can help determine the evolution of other detected oxidants\noften suggested to be related to geological activity and venting.",

In this study, we analyze the prevalence and\nimpact of vulnerabilities within the Maven Central ecosystem, using Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data from OSV.dev and a subsample enriched\nwith aggregated CVE data (CVE_AGGREGATED), which captures both direct and\ntransitive vulnerabilities. In our subsample of around 4 million releases, we\nfound that while only about 1% of releases have direct vulnerabilities,\napproximately 46.8% are affected by transitive vulnerabilities. This highlights\nhow a small number of vulnerable yet influential artifacts can impact a vast\nportion of the ecosystem. Moreover, our analysis shows that vulnerabilities\npropagate rapidly through dependency networks and that more central artifacts\n(those with a high number of dependents) are not necessarily less vulnerable.\nWe also observed that the time taken to patch vulnerabilities, including those\nof high or critical severity, often spans several years. Additionally, we found\nthat dependents of artifacts tend to prefer presumably non-vulnerable versions;\nhowever, some continue to use vulnerable versions, indicating challenges in\nadopting patched releases.

Rather than assuming the continuum as a completed\nuncountable totality, we view it as the cumulative result of a vast space of\nstratified formal systems, each defining a countable layer of real numbers via\nconstructive means. The union of all such definable layers across all\nadmissible chains yields a set of continuum cardinality, yet no single system\nor definability path suffices to capture it in full.\n  This leads to the Fractal Origin Hypothesis: the apparent uncountability of\nthe real line arises not from actual infinity, but from the meta-theoretical\ncontinuity of definability itself. Our framework models the continuum as a\nprocess-relative totality, grounded in syntax and layered formal growth. We\ndevelop this idea through a formal analysis of definability hierarchies and\nshow that the resulting universe of constructible reals is\ncountable-by-construction (that is, each element is definable within some\nfinite syntactic system, but no single procedure enumerates all of them\nuniformly) yet inaccessible to any uniform enumeration.

Our results show that as we densify the\nsample in microgravity, glassy dynamics appear at a volume fraction 1.6\\% lower\nthan on ground. We also show how the influence of gravity can affect how dense\na granular system one can prepare by comparing the final jamming point of our\nsample on the ISS compared to our ground setup. We show that jamming occurs at\na volume fraction 0.5\\% lower in space compared to on ground.

This paper proposes a general short-term\nvehicle acceleration prediction framework that jointly models environmental\ninfluence and individual driving behavior. The framework adopts a dual input\ndesign by incorporating environmental sequences, constructed from historical\ntraffic variables such as percentile-based speed and acceleration statistics of\nmultiple vehicles at specific spatial locations, capture group-level driving\nbehavior influenced by the traffic environment. In parallel, individual driving\nbehavior sequences represent motion characteristics of the target vehicle prior\nto the prediction point, reflecting personalized driving styles.

To demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method, an empirical study was conducted\nusing high resolution radar video fused trajectory data collected from the exit\nsection of the Guangzhou Baishi Tunnel. Drivers were clustered into three\ncategories conservative, moderate, and aggressive based on key behavioral\nindicators, and a dedicated prediction model was trained for each group to\naccount for driver heterogeneity.Experimental results show that the proposed\nmethod consistently outperforms four baseline models, yielding a 10.9%\nimprovement in accuracy with the inclusion of historical traffic variables and\na 33% improvement with driver classification.

The\nmain challenge to analyse the cascade stability lies in the difficulty of\nestablishing an accurate mathematical model to describe the process of load\nbalancing due to its nonlinearity and high-dimensionality. In our previous\ntheoretical work, a simplified general dynamic function was used to analyze the\nstability.

The\npolicy learning experiment demonstrates the policy's generalization ability\nwith nearly 100\\% success insertion across over eight thousand unique hole\nposes in parallel environments, and sim-to-real validation on a UR10e robot\nconfirms the policy's performance through direct trajectory execution without\ntask-specific tuning.",

    "abstract": "The jet quenching parameter and energy loss of light and heavy quarks have\nbeen investigated in the framework of holographic QCD models with a critical\nend point (CEP) at finite baryon chemical potential in $N_f=2,2+1,2+1+1$\nsystems. The properties of the jet quenching parameter and energy loss around\nCEP have been carefully studied, and some evident signatures for CEP are\nsubtracted. It is found that the dimensionless jet quenching parameter and the\nenergy loss of light and heavy quarks exhibit evident features around CEP.\nSpecifically, all these quantities increase rapidly near the CEP phase\ntransition temperature $T_{CEP}$ with fixed $\\mu_{CEP}$. Moreover, the velocity\ndependent behavior of heavy quark energy loss at CEP differs significantly from\ncharged particle energy loss in QED matter. For electromagnetic interaction,\nthe energy loss of charged particle can be described by the Bethe-Bloch formula\nand the Lindhand-Scharff-Schiott theory at low and high velocities,\nrespectively. However, the heavy quark energy loss at CEP is approximately\nproportional to velocity at low velocities and aligns with Bjorken's results at\nhigh velocities, which indicates that the heavy quark energy loss is\npredominantly collisional at low velocities and gluon radiation dominant at\nhigh velocities. For light quark energy loss, the behavior of the energy loss\nper unit length and the total energy loss differs significantly. However, the\ntotal energy loss and stopping distance exhibit similar behavior. This implies\nthat the stopping distance predominantly determines the total energy loss.\nThus, even with increased energy loss per unit length at higher temperatures or\nchemical potentials, the total energy loss decreases due to the reduced\nstopping distance.",

In contrast to\nprevious models of narrow capture, we assume that when a searcher finds a\ntarget by attaching to the partially adsorbing surface $\\partial \\calU_k$ it\ndoes not have immediate access to the resources within the target interior.\nInstead, the searcher remains attached to the surface for a random waiting time\n$\\tau$, after which it either gains access to the resources within ({\\em\nsurface absorption}) or detaches and continues its search process ({\\em surface\ndesorption)}. We also consider two distinct desorption scenarios -- either the\nparticle continues its search from the point of desorption or rapidly returns\nto its initial search position. We formulate the narrow capture problem in\nterms of a set of renewal equations that relate the probability density and\ntarget flux densities for absorption to the corresponding quantities for\nirreversible adsorption. The renewal equations, which effectively sew together\nsuccessive rounds of adsorption and desorption prior to the final absorption\nevent, provide a general probabilistic framework for incorporating\nnon-Markovian models of desorption/absorption and different search scenarios\nfollowing desorption. We solve the general renewal equations in two stages.\nFirst, we calculate the Laplace transformed target fluxes for irreversible\nadsorption by solving a Robbin boundary value problem (BVP) in the small-target\nlimit using matched asymptotic analysis. We then use the inner solution of the\nBVP to solve the corresponding Laplace transformed renewal equations for\nnon-Markovian desorption/absorption, which leads to explicit Neumann series\nexpansions of the corresponding target fluxes.",

While life expectancy has improved\ndramatically over the past century, a fundamental question remains: is the rate\nat which mortality accelerates biologically fixed, or has it shifted across\ngenerations? Vaupel's hypothesis suggests that the pace of aging is stable -\nthat humans are not aging more slowly, but simply starting later. To test this,\nwe analyze cohort mortality data from France, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden. We\nuse a two-step framework to first isolate senescent mortality, then decompose\nthe Gompertz slope into three parts: a biological constant, a potential trend,\nand a cumulative period effect. The results show that most variation in the\nrate of aging is not biological in origin. Once non-senescent deaths and\nhistorical shocks are accounted for, the Gompertz slope is remarkably stable.\nThe fluctuations we see are not signs of changing senescence, but echoes of\nshared history. Aging itself, it seems, has stayed the same. These findings\nsuggest that while longevity has shifted, the fundamental rhythm of human aging\nmay be biologically fixed - shaped not by evolution, but by history.",

While prompt engineering strategies\nhave enhanced the capabilities of LLMs in decision-making, cognitive biases\ninherent to LLMs present significant challenges. Cognitive biases are\nsystematic patterns of deviation from norms or rationality in decision-making\nthat can lead to the production of inaccurate outputs. Existing cognitive bias\nmitigation strategies assume that input prompts only contain one type of\ncognitive bias, limiting their effectiveness in more challenging scenarios\ninvolving multiple cognitive biases. To fill this gap, we propose a cognitive\ndebiasing approach, self-adaptive cognitive debiasing (SACD), that enhances the\nreliability of LLMs by iteratively refining prompts. Our method follows three\nsequential steps -- bias determination, bias analysis, and cognitive debiasing\n-- to iteratively mitigate potential cognitive biases in prompts. Experimental\nresults on finance, healthcare, and legal decision-making tasks, using both\nclosed-source and open-source LLMs, demonstrate that the proposed SACD method\noutperforms both advanced prompt engineering methods and existing cognitive\ndebiasing techniques in average accuracy under single-bias and multi-bias\nsettings.",

Conventional techniques, such as optical photometry,\nface challenges in providing precise attitude information.

We introduce a\ngeneralisation of ranking supermartingales, which serves as witnesses to the\nuniqueness of fixed points. Our method can be applied to a wide range of\nquantitative properties, including the weakest preexpectation, expected\nruntime, and higher moments of runtime. We provide a template-based algorithm\nfor the automated verification of lower bounds. Our implementation demonstrates\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method via an experiment.",

    "abstract": "We present NUPunkt and CharBoundary, two sentence boundary detection\nlibraries optimized for high-precision, high-throughput processing of legal\ntext in large-scale applications such as due diligence, e-discovery, and legal\nresearch. These libraries address the critical challenges posed by legal\ndocuments containing specialized citations, abbreviations, and complex sentence\nstructures that confound general-purpose sentence boundary detectors.\n  Our experimental evaluation on five diverse legal datasets comprising over\n25,000 documents and 197,000 annotated sentence boundaries demonstrates that\nNUPunkt achieves 91.1% precision while processing 10 million characters per\nsecond with modest memory requirements (432 MB). CharBoundary models offer\nbalanced and adjustable precision-recall tradeoffs, with the large model\nachieving the highest F1 score (0.782) among all tested methods.\n  Notably, NUPunkt provides a 29-32% precision improvement over general-purpose\ntools while maintaining exceptional throughput, processing multi-million\ndocument collections in minutes rather than hours. Both libraries run\nefficiently on standard CPU hardware without requiring specialized\naccelerators. NUPunkt is implemented in pure Python with zero external\ndependencies, while CharBoundary relies only on scikit-learn and optional ONNX\nruntime integration for optimized performance. Both libraries are available\nunder the MIT license, can be installed via PyPI, and can be interactively\ntested at https://sentences.aleainstitute.ai/.\n  These libraries address critical precision issues in retrieval-augmented\ngeneration systems by preserving coherent legal concepts across sentences,\nwhere each percentage improvement in precision yields exponentially greater\nreductions in context fragmentation, creating cascading benefits throughout\nretrieval pipelines and significantly enhancing downstream reasoning quality.",

In\nthe distorted diamond model, flat bands in the magnon spectra indicate the\nlocalized states confined to small regions (`trapping cells') of the lattice.\nRemarkably, these trapping cells can host up to five and seven localized states\nfor square and cubic lattices, respectively, leading to the macroscopic ground\nstate degeneracy and high value of residual entropy. The problem of calculating\nground state degeneracy reduces to that of non-interacting spins, whose spin\nvalue equal to half the number of localized magnons in the trapping cell. In\ncontrast, ideal diamond models feature ground states composed of randomly\ndistributed isolated diamond diagonal singlets immersed in a ferromagnetic\nbackground. Counting the ground state degeneracies here maps onto the\npercolation problem in 2D and 3D lattices.

Recent approaches in event-based object detection try to\nbridge this gap by employing computationally expensive transformer-based\nsolutions. However, due to their resource-intensive components, these solutions\nfail to exploit the sparsity and higher temporal resolution of event cameras\nefficiently. Moreover, these solutions are adopted from the vision domain,\nlacking specificity to the event cameras.

Current research\non KT modeling focuses on predicting future student performance based on\nexisting, unupdated records of student learning interactions. However, these\nmethods ignore distractions in the response process (such as slipping and\nguessing) and ignore that static cognitive representations are temporary and\nlimited. Most of them assume that there are no distractions during the\nanswering process, and that the recorded representation fully represents the\nstudent's understanding and proficiency in knowledge. This can lead to many\ndissonant and uncoordinated issues in the original record. Therefore, we\npropose a knowledge-tracking cognitive representation optimization (CRO-KT)\nmodel that uses dynamic programming algorithms to optimize the structure of\ncognitive representation.

In addition, we use a\nsynergistic optimization algorithm to optimize the cognitive representation of\nsub-target exercises based on the overall picture of exercise responses by\nconsidering all exercises with synergistic relationships as one goal. At the\nsame time, the CRO-KT model integrates the relationship embedding learned in\nthe dichotomous graph with the optimized record representation in a weighted\nmanner, which enhances students' cognitive expression ability.

We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's\napproach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will\nalso study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months\nlater. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are\ncommon explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an\nimage is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the\ndynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of\nindistinguishability in quantum mechanics.",

    "abstract": "The surge of deep learning has catalyzed considerable progress in\nself-supervised Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection (HAD). The core premise for\nself-supervised HAD is that anomalous pixels are inherently more challenging to\nreconstruct, resulting in larger errors compared to the background. However,\nowing to the powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities of neural networks,\nself-supervised models often suffer from the Identity Mapping Problem (IMP).\nThe IMP manifests as a tendency for the model to overfit to the entire image,\nparticularly with increasing network complexity or prolonged training\niterations. Consequently, the whole image can be precisely reconstructed, and\neven the anomalous pixels exhibit imperceptible errors, making them difficult\nto detect. Despite the proposal of several models aimed at addressing the\nIMP-related issues, a unified descriptive framework and validation of solutions\nfor IMP remain lacking. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth exploration to\nIMP, and summarize a unified framework that describes IMP from the perspective\nof network optimization, which encompasses three aspects: perturbation,\nreconstruction, and regularization. Correspondingly, we introduce three\nsolutions: superpixel pooling and uppooling for perturbation, error-adaptive\nconvolution for reconstruction, and online background pixel mining for\nregularization. With extensive experiments being conducted to validate the\neffectiveness, it is hoped that our work will provide valuable insights and\ninspire further research for self-supervised HAD.

Using micropillar\ncompression tests, we find the samples exhibit a transition from brittle\nfracture (if no dislocation is present in the pillars) to plastic yield (with\npre-engineered dislocations in the pillars). While within the regime of plastic\ndeformation, the yield strength and plastic flow behavior exhibit a strong\ndependence on the dislocation density. The yield strength first decreases and\nthen increases with the increase of dislocation densities. Detailed examination\nvia post-mortem transmission electron microscopy reveals a complex evolution of\ndislocation structure, highlighting the critical role played by dislocations in\nregulating the brittle/ductile behavior in SrTiO3 at room temperature.

Large Language Models (LLMs), by virtue of their extensive\npre-training on large textual corpora, exhibit strong capabilities in material\ninference. However, their reasoning often lacks formal rigour and\nverifiability. At the same time, LLMs' linguistic competence positions them as\na promising bridge between natural and formal languages, opening up new\nopportunities for combining these two modes of reasoning. In this paper, we\nintroduce PEIRCE, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to unify material and\nformal inference through an iterative conjecture-criticism process. Within this\nframework, LLMs play the central role of generating candidate solutions in\nnatural and formal languages, which are then evaluated and refined via\ninteraction with external critique models. These critiques include symbolic\nprovers, which assess formal validity, as well as soft evaluators that measure\nthe quality of the generated arguments along linguistic and epistemic\ndimensions such as plausibility, coherence, and parsimony.

By\nmaximizing the hardware utilization, SpecPipe decodes one token per pipeline\nstep ideally. Specifically, SpecPipe comprises a dynamic speculative token tree\nand a pipelined inference framework.

In this\nwork, we propose a classification algorithm based on the quantum Neyman-Pearson\ntest, which is theoretically optimal for distinguishing between two quantum\nstates. While directly constructing the quantum Neyman-Pearson test for\nmany-body systems via full state tomography is intractable due to the\nexponential growth of the Hilbert space, we introduce a partitioning strategy\nthat applies hypothesis tests to subsystems rather than the entire state,\neffectively reducing the required number of quantum state copies while\nmaintaining classification accuracy.

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce Mozualization, a music generation and editing tool\nthat creates multi-style embedded music by integrating diverse inputs, such as\nkeywords, images, and sound clips (e.g., segments from various pieces of music\nor even a playful cat's meow). Our work is inspired by the ways people express\ntheir emotions -- writing mood-descriptive poems or articles, creating drawings\nwith warm or cool tones, or listening to sad or uplifting music. Building on\nthis concept, we developed a tool that transforms these emotional expressions\ninto a cohesive and expressive song, allowing users to seamlessly incorporate\ntheir unique preferences and inspirations. To evaluate the tool and, more\nimportantly, gather insights for its improvement, we conducted a user study\ninvolving nine music enthusiasts. The study assessed user experience,\nengagement, and the impact of interacting with and listening to the generated\nmusic.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models have demonstrated remarkable performance across\nvarious tasks; however, the challenge of hallucinations constrains their\npractical applications. The hallucination problem arises from multiple factors,\nincluding the inherent hallucinations in language models, the limitations of\nvisual encoders in perception, and biases introduced by multimodal data.\nExtensive research has explored ways to mitigate hallucinations. For instance,\nOPERA prevents the model from overly focusing on \"anchor tokens\", thereby\nreducing hallucinations, whereas VCD mitigates hallucinations by employing a\ncontrastive decoding approach. In this paper, we investigate the correlation\nbetween the decay of attention to image tokens and the occurrence of\nhallucinations. Based on this finding, we propose Temporal Attention Real-time\nAccumulative Connection (TARAC), a novel training-free method that dynamically\naccumulates and updates LVLMs' attention on image tokens during generation. By\nenhancing the model's attention to image tokens, TARAC mitigates hallucinations\ncaused by the decay of attention on image tokens. We validate the effectiveness\nof TARAC across multiple models and datasets, demonstrating that our approach\nsubstantially mitigates hallucinations. In particular, TARAC reduces $C_S$ by\n25.2 and $C_I$ by 8.7 compared to VCD on the CHAIR benchmark.",

    "abstract": "In addition to enhancing wireless communication coverage quality,\nreconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technique can also assist in\npositioning. In this work, we consider RIS-assisted superimposed pilot and data\ntransmission without the assumption availability of prior channel state\ninformation and position information of mobile user equipments (UEs). To tackle\nthis challenge, we design a frame structure of transmission protocol composed\nof several location coherence intervals, each with pure-pilot and data-pilot\ntransmission durations. The former is used to estimate UE locations, while the\nlatter is time-slotted, duration of which does not exceed the channel coherence\ntime, where the data and pilot signals are transmitted simultaneously. We\nconduct the Fisher Information matrix (FIM) analysis and derive \\text\n{Cram\\'er-Rao bound} (CRB) for the position estimation error. The inverse fast\nFourier transform (IFFT) is adopted to obtain the estimation results of UE\npositions, which are then exploited for channel estimation. Furthermore, we\nderive the closed-form lower bound of the ergodic achievable rate of\nsuperimposed pilot (SP) transmission, which is used to optimize the phase\nprofile of the RIS to maximize the achievable sum rate using the genetic\nalgorithm. Finally, numerical results validate the accuracy of the UE position\nestimation using the IFFT algorithm and the superiority of the proposed SP\nscheme by comparison with the regular pilot scheme.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety for autonomous robots operating in dynamic environments can\nbe challenging due to factors such as unmodeled dynamics, noisy sensor\nmeasurements, and partial observability. To account for these limitations, it\nis common to maintain a belief distribution over the true state. This belief\ncould be a non-parametric, sample-based representation to capture uncertainty\nmore flexibly. In this paper, we propose a novel form of Belief Control Barrier\nFunctions (BCBFs) specifically designed to ensure safety in dynamic\nenvironments under stochastic dynamics and a sample-based belief about the\nenvironment state. Our approach incorporates provable concentration bounds on\ntail risk measures into BCBFs, effectively addressing possible multimodal and\nskewed belief distributions represented by samples. Moreover, the proposed\nmethod demonstrates robustness against distributional shifts up to a predefined\nbound. We validate the effectiveness and real-time performance (approximately\n1kHz) of the proposed method through two simulated underwater robotic\napplications: object tracking and dynamic collision avoidance.",

    "abstract": "Under specific conditions, a rotating saddle potential can confine the motion\nof a particle on its surface. This time-varying hyperbolic potential shares key\ncharacteristics with the RF electric quadrupole ion trap (RF Paul trap), making\nit a valuable mechanical analog. Previous work has primarily focused on\nsymmetric saddles, characterized by equal curvatures along the trapping and\nanti-trapping directions. However, most applications of RF Paul traps-such as\natomic clocks, quantum computing, and quantum simulations-require asymmetry in\nthe quadrupole potential to break the degeneracy of motional modes, which is\nessential for processes like laser cooling and other quantum manipulations. In\nthis paper, we investigate the motion of trapped particles in asymmetric\nrotating saddles. We demonstrate that even minor asymmetries, including those\narising from manufacturing imperfections, can significantly affect particle\ntrajectories and stability. Our analysis includes both theoretical modeling and\nexperimental measurements. We derive the equations of motion for asymmetric\nsaddles and solve them to explore stability and precession effects.\nAdditionally, we present lifetime measurements of particles in saddles with\nvarying degrees of asymmetry to map key features of the a-q stability diagram,\nincluding counterintuitive demonstrations of stability for saddles with\nnegative asymmetry. This study underscores the importance of incorporating\nasymmetry into mechanical models of ion traps to better reflect real-world\nimplementations. Although motivated primarily by RF Paul traps, these\nasymmetry-related results are also relevant to emerging gravitational analogs,\nsuch as rotating saddle potentials in certain binary black hole systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a formal theory of Krivine's classical realisability\ninterpretation for first-order Peano arithmetic ($\\mathsf{PA}$). To formulate\nthe theory as an extension of $\\mathsf{PA}$, we first modify Krivine's original\ndefinition to the form of number realisability, similar to Kleene's\nintuitionistic realisability for Heyting arithmetic. By axiomatising our\nrealisability with additional predicate symbols, we obtain a first-order theory\n$\\mathsf{CR}$ which can formally realise every theorem of $\\mathsf{PA}$.\nAlthough $\\mathsf{CR}$ itself is conservative over $\\mathsf{PA}$, adding a type\nof reflection principle that roughly states that ``realisability implies\ntruth'' results in $\\mathsf{CR}$ being essentially equivalent to the Tarskian\ntheory $\\mathsf{CT}$ of typed compositional truth, which is known to be\nproof-theoretically stronger than $\\mathsf{PA}$. Thus, $\\mathsf{CT}$ can be\nconsidered a formal theory of classical realisability. We also prove that a\nweaker reflection principle which preserves the distinction between\nrealisability and truth is sufficient for $\\mathsf{CR}$ to achieve the same\nstrength as $\\mathsf{CT}$. Furthermore, we formulate transfinite iterations of\n$\\mathsf{CR}$ and its variants, and then we determine their proof-theoretic\nstrength.",

In this paper, we aim to explore how to\nefficiently estimate a model's real performance on a given benchmark based on\nits evaluation results on a small number of instances sampled from the\nbenchmark. Inspired by Collaborative Filtering (CF) in Recommendation Systems\n(RS), we treat LLMs as users and test instances as items and propose a\ntwo-stage method. In the first stage, we treat instance selection as\nrecommending products to users to choose instances that can easily distinguish\nmodel performance. In the second stage, we see performance prediction as rating\nprediction problem in RS to predict the target LLM's behavior on unselected\ninstances. Experiments on multiple LLMs and datasets imply that our method can\naccurately estimate the target model's performance while largely reducing its\ninference overhead.",

    "abstract": "Let $(M,g)$ be a $3$--dimensional, complete, one--ended Riemannian manifold,\nwith a minimal, compact and connected boundary. We assume that $M$ has a simple\ntopology and that the scalar curvature of $(M,g)$ is non--negative. Moreover,\nwe suppose that $(M,g)$ admits a $2$--capacitary potential $v$ with $v,\\,\\vert\n\\nabla v\\vert\\to 0$ at infinity. In this note, we provide a gradient integral\nestimate for the level sets of the function $u=1-v$. This estimate leads to a\nsharp volume comparison for the sub--level sets of $u$, and a sharp area\ncomparison of the level sets of $u$. From this last comparison it follows a\nsharp area--capacity inequality, originally derived by Bray and Miao, thereby\nextending its cases of validity. This work is based on a recent paper by\nColding and Minicozzi. Finally, for completeness, we also show the same type of\narea and volume comparison, in the case where $(M,g)$ has no boundary,\nreplacing the function $u$ with one related to the minimal positive Green's\nfunction. This volume comparison leads to a more geometric proof of the\npositive mass inequality than the one given in \\cite{Ago_Maz_Oro}.",

Generative large\nlanguage models trained to align with human goals have achieved high zero-shot\nperformance across a wide variety of tasks. As of yet, it is unclear how well\nthese models perform on biomedical relation extraction (RE). To address this\nknowledge gap, we explore patterns in the performance of OpenAI LLMs across a\ndiverse sampling of RE tasks.\n  Methods: We use OpenAI GPT-4-turbo and their reasoning model o1 to conduct\nend-to-end RE experiments on seven datasets. We use the JSON generation\ncapabilities of GPT models to generate structured output in two ways: (1) by\ndefining an explicit schema describing the structure of relations, and (2)\nusing a setting that infers the structure from the prompt language.\n  Results: Our work is the first to study and compare the performance of the\nGPT-4 and o1 for the end-to-end zero-shot biomedical RE task across a broad\narray of datasets. We found the zero-shot performances to be proximal to that\nof fine-tuned methods. The limitations of this approach are that it performs\npoorly on instances containing many relations and errs on the boundaries of\ntextual mentions.\n  Conclusion: Recent large language models exhibit promising zero-shot\ncapabilities in complex biomedical RE tasks, offering competitive performance\nwith reduced dataset curation and NLP modeling needs at the cost of increased\ncomputing, potentially increasing medical community accessibility.

    "abstract": "As an emerging paradigm of federated learning, asynchronous federated\nlearning offers significant speed advantages over traditional synchronous\nfederated learning. Unlike synchronous federated learning, which requires\nwaiting for all clients to complete updates before aggregation, asynchronous\nfederated learning aggregates the models that have arrived in realtime, greatly\nimproving training speed. However, this mechanism also introduces the issue of\nclient model version inconsistency. When the differences between models of\ndifferent versions during aggregation become too large, it may lead to\nconflicts, thereby reducing the models accuracy. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes an asynchronous federated learning version correction algorithm\nbased on knowledge distillation, named FedADT. FedADT applies knowledge\ndistillation before aggregating gradients, using the latest global model to\ncorrect outdated information, thus effectively reducing the negative impact of\noutdated gradients on the training process. Additionally, FedADT introduces an\nadaptive weighting function that adjusts the knowledge distillation weight\naccording to different stages of training, helps mitigate the misleading\neffects caused by the poorer performance of the global model in the early\nstages of training. This method significantly improves the overall performance\nof asynchronous federated learning without adding excessive computational\noverhead. We conducted experimental comparisons with several classical\nalgorithms, and the results demonstrate that FedADT achieves significant\nimprovements over other asynchronous methods and outperforms all methods in\nterms of convergence speed.",

    "abstract": "Co-clustering exploits the duality of instances and features to\nsimultaneously uncover meaningful groups in both dimensions, often\noutperforming traditional clustering in high-dimensional or sparse data\nsettings. Although recent deep learning approaches successfully integrate\nfeature learning and cluster assignment, they remain susceptible to noise and\ncan suffer from posterior collapse within standard autoencoders. In this paper,\nwe present the first fully variational Co-clustering framework that directly\nlearns row and column clusters in the latent space, leveraging a doubly\nreparameterized ELBO to improve gradient signal-to-noise separation. Our\nunsupervised model integrates a Variational Deep Embedding with a Gaussian\nMixture Model (GMM) prior for both instances and features, providing a built-in\nclustering mechanism that naturally aligns latent modes with row and column\nclusters. Furthermore, our regularized end-to-end noise learning Compositional\nELBO architecture jointly reconstructs the data while regularizing against\nnoise through the KL divergence, thus gracefully handling corrupted or missing\ninputs in a single training pipeline. To counteract posterior collapse, we\nintroduce a scale modification that increases the encoder's latent means only\nin the reconstruction pathway, preserving richer latent representations without\ninflating the KL term. Finally, a mutual information-based cross-loss ensures\ncoherent co-clustering of rows and columns. Empirical results on diverse\nreal-world datasets from multiple modalities, numerical, textual, and\nimage-based, demonstrate that our method not only preserves the advantages of\nprior Co-clustering approaches but also exceeds them in accuracy and\nrobustness, particularly in high-dimensional or noisy settings.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal research and applications are becoming more commonplace as Virtual\nReality (VR) technology integrates different sensory feedback, enabling the\nrecreation of real spaces in an audio-visual context. Within VR experiences,\nnumerous applications rely on the user's voice as a key element of interaction,\nincluding music performances and public speaking applications. Self-perception\nof our voice plays a crucial role in vocal production. When singing or\nspeaking, our voice interacts with the acoustic properties of the environment,\nshaping the adjustment of vocal parameters in response to the perceived\ncharacteristics of the space. This technical report presents a real-time\nauralization pipeline that leverages three-dimensional Spatial Impulse\nResponses (SIRs) for multimodal research applications in VR requiring\nfirst-person vocal interaction. It describes the impulse response creation and\nrendering workflow, the audio-visual integration, and addresses latency and\ncomputational considerations. The system enables users to explore acoustic\nspaces from various positions and orientations within a predefined area,\nsupporting three and five Degrees of Freedom (3Dof and 5DoF) in audio-visual\nmultimodal perception for both research and creative applications in VR.",

    "abstract": "Prior studies on deception in language-based AI agents typically assess\nwhether the agent produces a false statement about a topic, or makes a binary\nchoice prompted by a goal, rather than allowing open-ended deceptive behavior\nto emerge in pursuit of a longer-term goal. To fix this, we introduce\n$\\textit{Among Us}$, a sandbox social deception game where LLM-agents exhibit\nlong-term, open-ended deception as a consequence of the game objectives. While\nmost benchmarks saturate quickly, $\\textit{Among Us}$ can be expected to last\nmuch longer, because it is a multi-player game far from equilibrium. Using the\nsandbox, we evaluate $18$ proprietary and open-weight LLMs and uncover a\ngeneral trend: models trained with RL are comparatively much better at\nproducing deception than detecting it. We evaluate the effectiveness of methods\nto detect lying and deception: logistic regression on the activations and\nsparse autoencoders (SAEs). We find that probes trained on a dataset of\n``pretend you're a dishonest model: $\\dots$'' generalize extremely well\nout-of-distribution, consistently obtaining AUROCs over 95% even when evaluated\njust on the deceptive statement, without the chain of thought. We also find two\nSAE features that work well at deception detection but are unable to steer the\nmodel to lie less.

Another distinct feature of the distribution is its spatial\ninhomogeneity. In the weak monitoring limit, the distribution is close to\nGaussian with a broad support for boundary point separating the two subsystems\ndefining the EE while for the rest of sites has asymmetric exponential tails\nand a much narrower support.

These singular values are the critical (stationary) values of\nthe non-convex optimization problem of minimizing $\\langle u,Av\\rangle$ such\nthat $u$ and $v$ are unit vectors in $P$ and $Q$, respectively. When $A$ is the\nidentity matrix, the singular values coincide with the cosine of the critical\nangles between $P$ and $Q$. When $P$ and $Q$ are positive orthants, the\nsingular values are called Pareto singular values of $A$ and have applications,\nfor instance, in spectral graph theory. This paper deals with the numerical\ncomputation of these cone-constrained singular values. We prove the NP-hardness\nof all the above problems, while identifying cases when such problems can be\nsolved in polynomial time. We then propose four algorithms. Two are exact\nalgorithms, meaning that they are guaranteed to compute a globally optimal\nsolution; one uses an exact non-convex quadratic programming solver, and the\nother a brute-force active-set method. The other two are heuristics, meaning\nthat they rapidly compute locally optimal solutions; one uses an alternating\nprojection algorithm with extrapolation, and the other a sequential partial\nlinearization approach based on fractional programming.

Next, we\nprove a new exponential concentration result for smooth unipartite classical\nquantum soft covering when the samples are taken via a random walk on an\nexpander graph. The resulting expander matrix Chernoff bound complements the\nresults of Garg, Lee, Song and Srivastava in important ways. We prove our new\nexpander matrix Chernoff bound by generalising McDiarmid's method of bounded\ndifferences for functions of independent random variables to a new method of\nbounded excision for functions of expander walks. This new technical tool\nshould be of independent interest.\n  A notable feature of our new concentration bounds is that they have no\nexplicit Hilbert space dimension factor. This is because our bounds are stated\nin terms of the trace distance of the sample averaged quantum state to the\n`ideal' quantum state. Our bounds are sensitive to certain smooth Renyi max\ndivergences, giving a clear handle on the number of samples required to achieve\na target trace distance. Using these novel features, we prove new one shot\ninner bounds for sending private classical information over different kinds of\nquantum wiretap channels with many non-interacting eavesdroppers that are\nindependent of the Hilbert space dimensions of the eavesdroppers.

However, in real-world interactions between users and LLMs, query\nentry errors such as keyboard proximity errors, visual similarity errors, and\nspelling errors are frequent. The impact of these errors on current RAG methods\nagainst such errors remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose\nQE-RAG, the first robust RAG benchmark designed specifically to evaluate\nperformance against query entry errors. We augment six widely used datasets by\ninjecting three common types of query entry errors into randomly selected user\nqueries at rates of 20\\% and 40\\%, simulating typical user behavior in\nreal-world scenarios.

    "abstract": "Speech large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent research\nfocus in speech processing. We introduce VocalNet-1B and VocalNet-8B, a series\nof high-performance, low-latency speech LLMs enabled by a scalable and\nmodel-agnostic training framework designed for real-time voice interaction.\nCentral to our contribution is the first application of multi-token prediction\n(MTP) to speech LLMs. This approach represents a paradigm shift from standard\nnext-token prediction (NTP), offering simultaneous improvements in generation\nspeed and quality. Informed by analysis of MTP's effect on speech generation\nand experimental comparisons, we designed a straightforward and highly\neffective MTP implementation. Experiments demonstrate that VocalNet performs on\npar with mainstream Omni LLMs even with limited training data, and\nsignificantly surpasses existing open-source speech LLMs. To foster\nreproducibility and community advancement, all model weights, inference code,\ntraining data, and framework implementations have been made publicly available\nat https://github.com/SJTU-OmniAgent/VocalNet",

    "abstract": "Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, exemplified by OpenAI's\nDeepResearch, autonomously pursue goals, adapting strategies through implicit\nlearning. Unlike traditional generative AI, which is reactive to user prompts,\nagentic AI proactively orchestrates complex workflows. It exhibits stochastic,\ndynamic, and fluid autonomy: its steps and outputs vary probabilistically\n(stochastic), it evolves based on prior interactions (dynamic), and it operates\nwith significant independence within human-defined parameters, adapting to\ncontext (fluid). While this fosters complex, co-evolutionary human-machine\ninteractions capable of generating uniquely synthesized creative outputs, it\nalso irrevocably blurs boundaries--human and machine contributions become\nirreducibly entangled in intertwined creative processes. Consequently, agentic\nAI poses significant challenges to legal frameworks reliant on clear\nattribution: authorship doctrines struggle to disentangle ownership,\nintellectual property regimes strain to accommodate recursively blended\nnovelty, and liability models falter as accountability diffuses across shifting\nloci of control. The central issue is not the legal treatment of human versus\nmachine contributions, but the fundamental unmappability--the practical\nimpossibility in many cases--of accurately attributing specific creative\nelements to either source. When retroactively parsing contributions becomes\ninfeasible, applying distinct standards based on origin becomes impracticable.\nTherefore, we argue, legal and policy frameworks may need to treat human and\nmachine contributions as functionally equivalent--not for moral or economic\nreasons, but as a pragmatic necessity.",

Trained on a data set of 25,689 numerically generated\nsolutions, SageNet allows accurate reconstructions of $\\Omega_\\mathrm{GW}(f)$\nand generalizes well to a wide range of cosmological parameters; 89.3% of the\ntest emulations with randomly distributed parameters exhibit errors of under\n4%. In addition, SageNet demonstrates its ability to learn and reproduce the\nartificial, adaptive sampling patterns in numerical calculations, which\nimplement denser sampling of frequencies around changes of spectral indices in\n$\\Omega_\\mathrm{GW}(f)$. The dual capability of learning both physical and\nartificial features of the numerical GW spectra establishes SageNet as a robust\nalternative to exact numerical methods. Finally, our benchmark tests show that\nSageNet reduces the computation time from tens of seconds to milliseconds,\nachieving a speed-up of ~$10^4$ times over standard CPU-based numerical solvers\nwith the potential for further acceleration on GPU hardware.

This makes them\nessential candidates for spintronics applications. These magnetic orders are\noften related to the electronic structure parameters, such as spin-orbit\ncoupling (SOC), Hund's coupling ($J_H$), $p-d$ covalency, and inter-orbital\nCoulomb interactions. Accurately determining such parameters is paramount for\nunderstanding Cr$X_3$ physics. We have used ultra high-resolution resonant\ninelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to study Cr$X_3$ across phase\ntransition temperatures. Ligand field multiplet calculations were used to\ndetermine the electronic structure parameters by incorporating the crystal\nfield interactions in a distorted octahedral with $C_3$ symmetry. These methods\nprovide the most detailed description of Cr$X_3$ magneto-optical and electronic\nenergetic (terms) to date. For the first time, the crystal field distortion\nparameters $D\\sigma$ and $D\\tau$ were calculated, and the energies of $d$\norbitals have been reported. Our RIXS spectroscopic measurements reveal a clear\nenergy separation between spin-allowed quartet states and spin-forbidden\ndoublet states in Cr$X_3$. The role of SOC in Cr $2p$ orbitals for the\nspin-flip excitations has been demonstrated. The determined 10$Dq$ values are\nin good agreement with the spectrochemical series, and Racah B follows the\nNephelauxetic effect.

    "abstract": "Computational pathology, which involves analyzing whole slide images for\nautomated cancer diagnosis, relies on multiple instance learning, where\nperformance depends heavily on the feature extractor and aggregator. Recent\nPathology Foundation Models (PFMs), pretrained on large-scale histopathology\ndata, have significantly enhanced both the extractor and aggregator, but they\nlack a systematic analysis framework. In this survey, we present a hierarchical\ntaxonomy organizing PFMs through a top-down philosophy applicable to foundation\nmodel analysis in any domain: model scope, model pretraining, and model design.\nAdditionally, we systematically categorize PFM evaluation tasks into\nslide-level, patch-level, multimodal, and biological tasks, providing\ncomprehensive benchmarking criteria. Our analysis identifies critical\nchallenges in both PFM development (pathology-specific methodology, end-to-end\npretraining, data-model scalability) and utilization (effective adaptation,\nmodel maintenance), paving the way for future directions in this promising\nfield.

    "abstract": "Syllogistic reasoning is crucial for sound legal decision-making, allowing\nlegal professionals to draw logical conclusions by applying general principles\nto specific case facts. While large language models (LLMs) can answer legal\nquestions, they often struggle with explicit syllogistic reasoning. Their\noutputs tend to be implicit, unstructured, and consequently, less explainable\nand trustworthy. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyLeR, a novel\nframework designed to enable LLMs to perform explicit syllogistic legal\nreasoning. SyLeR employs a tree-structured hierarchical retrieval mechanism to\nsynthesize relevant legal statutes and precedents, thereby constructing\ncomprehensive major premises. This is followed by a two-stage fine-tuning\nprocess: an initial supervised fine-tuning warm-up establishes a foundational\nunderstanding of syllogistic reasoning, while reinforcement learning, guided by\na structure-aware reward mechanism, refines the model's capacity to generate\ndiverse, logically sound, and well-structured reasoning paths. We conducted\nextensive experiments to evaluate SyLeR's performance. Our evaluations spanned\ndiverse dimensions, including both in-domain and cross-domain user groups\n(legal laypersons and practitioners), multiple languages (Chinese and French),\nand various LLM backbones (legal-specific and open-domain LLMs). The results\nconsistently demonstrate that SyLeR significantly enhances response accuracy\nand reliably produces explicit, explainable, and trustworthy legal reasoning.",

However, any fixed Boolean function can\nbe implemented by an infinite number of circuits, all of which vary in their\nresource costs. This has given rise to the field of circuit complexity theory,\nwhich studies the minimal resource cost to implement a given Boolean function\nwith any circuit. Traditionally, circuit complexity theory has focused on the\nresource costs of a circuit's size (its number of gates) and depth (the longest\npath length from the circuit's input to its output). In this paper, we extend\ncircuit complexity theory by investigating the minimal thermodynamic cost of a\ncircuit's operation. We do this by using the mismatch cost (MMC) of a given\ncircuit that is run multiple times in a row to calculate a lower bound on the\nentropy production (EP) incurred in each such run. Specifically, we discuss\nconditions under which MMC of a circuit is proportional to the size of a\ncircuit, and conditions for them to diverge. We also use our results to compare\nthe thermodynamic costs of different circuit families implementing the same\nfamily of Boolean functions. In addition we analyze how heterogeneity in the\nunderlying physical processes implementing the gates in a circuit influences\nthe minimal thermodynamic cost of the overall circuit.

Experiments on synthetic time-series tasks demonstrate\nthat QASA achieves faster convergence and superior generalization compared to\nboth standard Transformers and reduced classical variants.

Existing denoising methods for event cameras are often designed\nin isolation and thus consider other tasks, such as motion estimation,\nseparately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an\nintrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without\nmotion. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that\nsimultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical\nflow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the one-step\nmotion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any\nother motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that\nthe proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising\nbenchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while demonstrating\neffectiveness across motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks.

Quite recently,\nthe elastic breakup cross section data were reanalyzed with the\ncontinuum-discretized coupled channels method (CDCC) assuming a $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}$\ntwo-body model for $^9$C and the $S_{18}$ was modified. It was not well\njustified, however, to treat $^8$B as an inert nucleus given its proton\nseparation energy is only 137~keV. We reexamine the elastic breakup of $^9$C by\nthe four-body CDCC with a $p+p+{\\rm ^{7}Be}$ three-body model for $^9$C and\nevaluate $S_{18}$. To achieve this, we propose a method to disentangle the\n$p+{\\rm ^{8}B}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ three-body channel in the four-body CDCC\ncalculation, for the first time. We calculate the elastic breakup cross section\nof $^9$C off a $^{208}$Pb target at 65~MeV/nucleon. The obtained breakup cross\nsections are decomposed into the contributions of the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}+{\\rm\n^{208}Pb}$ and $p+p+{\\rm ^{7}Be}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ channels by using the solution\nof the complex-scaled Lippmann--Schwinger equation. The breakup cross section\nto the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}+{\\rm ^{208}Pb}$ channel reproduces well the shape of the\nexperimental data in the low breakup energy region, which is important for\ndetermining $S_{18}$. By fitting the theoretical result to the experimental\ndata, the asymptotic normalization coefficient of $^9$C for the $p+{\\rm ^{8}B}$\nconfiguration is determined and we obtain $S_{18}=38.4\\pm1.1$ eVb. This result\nis smaller than the previous value obtained with the three-body CDCC by about\n45\\%.

This paper presents challenges and\nopportunities of few-shot approaches that vary across major domains, i.e.,\naudio, image, text, and their combinations, with their strengths and\nweaknesses. This detailed understanding can help to adopt appropriate\napproaches applicable to different domains and applications.",

Existing methods typically treat infrared\nnonuniformity correction (NUC) as a preprocessing step for detection, which\nleads to suboptimal performance. Balancing the two tasks while enhancing\ndetection beneficial information remains challenging. In this paper, we present\na detection-friendly union framework, termed UniCD, that simultaneously\naddresses both infrared NUC and UAV target detection tasks in an end-to-end\nmanner. We first model NUC as a small number of parameter estimation problem\njointly driven by priors and data to generate detection-conducive images. Then,\nwe incorporate a new auxiliary loss with target mask supervision into the\nbackbone of the infrared UAV target detection network to strengthen target\nfeatures while suppressing the background. To better balance correction and\ndetection, we introduce a detection-guided self-supervised loss to reduce\nfeature discrepancies between the two tasks, thereby enhancing detection\nrobustness to varying nonuniformity levels. Additionally, we construct a new\nbenchmark composed of 50,000 infrared images in various nonuniformity types,\nmulti-scale UAV targets and rich backgrounds with target annotations, called\nIRBFD.

Existing methods often rely on\nlow-dimensional motion codes for facial behavior generation followed by\nphotorealistic rendering, limiting both visual fidelity and expressive\nrichness. To address these challenges, we introduce DiTaiListener, powered by a\nvideo diffusion model with multimodal conditions. Our approach first generates\nshort segments of listener responses conditioned on the speaker's speech and\nfacial motions with DiTaiListener-Gen. It then refines the transitional frames\nvia DiTaiListener-Edit for a seamless transition. Specifically,\nDiTaiListener-Gen adapts a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for the task of listener\nhead portrait generation by introducing a Causal Temporal Multimodal Adapter\n(CTM-Adapter) to process speakers' auditory and visual cues. CTM-Adapter\nintegrates speakers' input in a causal manner into the video generation process\nto ensure temporally coherent listener responses. For long-form video\ngeneration, we introduce DiTaiListener-Edit, a transition refinement\nvideo-to-video diffusion model. The model fuses video segments into smooth and\ncontinuous videos, ensuring temporal consistency in facial expressions and\nimage quality when merging short video segments produced by DiTaiListener-Gen.\nQuantitatively, DiTaiListener achieves the state-of-the-art performance on\nbenchmark datasets in both photorealism (+73.8% in FID on RealTalk) and motion\nrepresentation (+6.1% in FD metric on VICO) spaces.

    "abstract": "Weak magnetic fields and isotopes have been shown to influence biological\nprocesses; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood,\nparticularly because the corresponding interaction energies are far below\nthermal energies, making classical explanations challenging or impossible.\nMicrotubules, dynamic cytoskeletal fibers, offer an ideal system to test weak\nmagnetic field effects due to their self-assembling capabilities, sensitivity\nto magnetic fields, and their central role in cellular processes. In this\nstudy, we use a combination of experiments and simulations to explore how\nnuclear spin dynamics affect microtubule polymerization by examining\ninteractions between magnesium isotope substitution and weak magnetic fields.\nOur experiments reveal an isotope-dependent effect, which can be explained via\na radical pair mechanism, explicitly arising from nuclear spin properties\nrather than isotopic mass differences. This nuclear spin-driven isotope effect\nis notably enhanced under an applied weak magnetic field of approximately 3 mT.\nOur theoretical model based on radical pairs achieves quantitative agreement\nwith our experimental observations. These results establish a direct connection\nbetween quantum spin dynamics and microtubule assembly, providing new insights\ninto how weak magnetic fields influence cellular and biomolecular functions.",

    "abstract": "Pursuing efficient text shape representations helps scene text detection\nmodels focus on compact foreground regions and optimize the contour\nreconstruction steps to simplify the whole detection pipeline. Current\napproaches either represent irregular shapes via box-to-polygon strategy or\ndecomposing a contour into pieces for fitting gradually, the deficiency of\ncoarse contours or complex pipelines always exists in these models. Considering\nthe above issues, we introduce EdgeText to fit text contours compactly while\nalleviating excessive contour rebuilding processes. Concretely, it is observed\nthat the two long edges of texts can be regarded as smooth curves. It allows us\nto build contours via continuous and smooth edges that cover text regions\ntightly instead of fitting piecewise, which helps avoid the two limitations in\ncurrent models. Inspired by this observation, EdgeText formulates the text\nrepresentation as the edge approximation problem via parameterized curve\nfitting functions. In the inference stage, our model starts with locating text\ncenters, and then creating curve functions for approximating text edges relying\non the points. Meanwhile, truncation points are determined based on the\nlocation features. In the end, extracting curve segments from curve functions\nby using the pixel coordinate information brought by truncation points to\nreconstruct text contours. Furthermore, considering the deep dependency of\nEdgeText on text edges, a bilateral enhanced perception (BEP) module is\ndesigned. It encourages our model to pay attention to the recognition of edge\nfeatures. Additionally, to accelerate the learning of the curve function\nparameters, we introduce a proportional integral loss (PI-loss) to force the\nproposed model to focus on the curve distribution and avoid being disturbed by\ntext scales.",

Existing\nmethods to recover B-Reps from measured data require complete, noise-free 3D\ndata, which are laborious to obtain. We alleviate this difficulty by enabling\nthe precise reconstruction of CAD shapes from a single RGB-D image. We propose\na method that addresses the challenge of reconstructing only the observed\ngeometry from a single view. To allow for these partial observations, and to\navoid hallucinating incorrect geometry, we introduce a novel view-centric B-rep\n(VB-Rep) representation, which incorporates structures to handle visibility\nlimits and encode geometric uncertainty.

Experimentally,\nextracting maximal information about the SHG susceptibility tensor requires\nmeasurements of S and P polarized input and output combinations, which\nnaturally involves the rotation of the polarizers during data collection. For\nmulti-axis experiments, this has proved challenging since polarization rotation\nis typically done manually. Automating this process eliminates labor\nconstraints, reduces uncertainty due to low-frequency noise, and expands the\ntype of multi-axis datasets that can be collected; however, it is difficult due\nto geometrical constraints within the setup. In this work, we design and\nimplement low-cost, high-fidelity automated polarization rotators for use in\nmulti-axis RA-SHG. These polarization rotators utilize an electrical slip ring\nto transfer power to the rotating RA-SHG optical setup as well as a miniature\nstepper motor to perform the polarization rotation. We demonstrate this\nautomated system in time-resolved RA-SHG measurements in the\nnon-centrosymmetric semiconductor GaAs. For the multi-axis measurements\ndescribed above, this automated system permits data averaging over longer\nperiods, vastly expedites data collection, and expands the setup measurement\ncapability.

Existing MBSS algorithms, such as independent\nlow-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) and multichannel nonnegative matrix\nfactorization (MNMF), utilize the low-rank structure of source models but\nassume that frequency bins are independent. In contrast, independent vector\nanalysis (IVA) does not rely on a low-rank source model but rather captures\nfrequency dependencies based on a uniform correlation assumption. In this work,\nwe demonstrate that dependencies between adjacent frequency bins are\nsignificantly stronger than those between bins that are farther apart in\ntypical speech signals. To address this, we introduce a weighted Sinkhorn\ndivergence-based ILRMA (wsILRMA) that simultaneously captures these\ninter-frequency dependencies and models joint probability distributions.
