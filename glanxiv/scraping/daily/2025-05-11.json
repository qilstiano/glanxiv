    "abstract": "Suicide prevention remains a critical public health challenge. While online\nplatforms such as Reddit's r/SuicideWatch have historically provided spaces for\nindividuals to express suicidal thoughts and seek community support, the advent\nof large language models (LLMs) introduces a new paradigm-where individuals may\nbegin disclosing ideation to AI systems instead of humans. This study evaluates\nthe capability of LLMs to perform automated suicide risk assessment using the\nColumbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). We assess the zero-shot\nperformance of six models-including Claude, GPT, Mistral, and LLaMA-in\nclassifying posts across a 7-point severity scale (Levels 0-6). Results\nindicate that Claude and GPT closely align with human annotations, while\nMistral achieves the lowest ordinal prediction error. Most models exhibit\nordinal sensitivity, with misclassifications typically occurring between\nadjacent severity levels. We further analyze confusion patterns,\nmisclassification sources, and ethical considerations, underscoring the\nimportance of human oversight, transparency, and cautious deployment.

Transfer learning\nhelps address small sample sizes by borrowing information from larger datasets,\nalthough differences in covariates and outcome-generating mechanisms between\nthe target and external cohorts can complicate the process. We propose a novel\nweighting method, TRANSfer LeArning wiTh wEights (TRANSLATE), to integrate data\nfrom various sources by incorporating domain-specific characteristics through\nlearned weights that align external data with the target cohort. These weights\nadjust for cohort differences, are proportional to each cohort's effective\nsample size, and downweight dissimilar cohorts.

One of the\nmost prominent threats is the membership inference attack (MIA), where the\nadversary aims to determine whether a particular data record was part of the\ntraining set.\n  This paper addresses this problem through a two-stage defense called\nAugMixCloak. The core idea is to apply data augmentation and principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA)-based information fusion to query images, which are\ndetected by perceptual hashing (pHash) as either identical to or highly similar\nto images in the training set. Experimental results show that AugMixCloak\nsuccessfully defends against both binary classifier-based MIA and metric-based\nMIA across five datasets and various decentralized FL (DFL) topologies.\nCompared with regularization-based defenses, AugMixCloak demonstrates stronger\nprotection.

In this paper, we give,\nfor the first time, a proof of the known phenomenon for the parameters $c=-3/4$\nand $c=-5/4$, which is also conceptual, and we provide a generalization of the\nphenomenon and the proof for all bifurcation points of the Mandelbrot set.",

To address the limitations of linear parametric dependence in the\nKBF model, we introduce the Extended KBF (EKBF) model, which enables a global\nlinear representation of aeroelastic dynamics while capturing stronger\nnonlinear dependence on, e.g., the flutter parameter. The effectiveness of the\nproposed methodology is demonstrated through two case studies: a 2D academic\nexample and a panel flutter problem. Results show that EKBF effectively\ninterpolates and extrapolates principal eigenvalues, capturing flutter\nmechanisms, and accurately predicting the flutter boundary even when the data\nis corrupted by noise. Furthermore, parameterized isostable and isochron\nidentified by EKBF provides valuable insights into the nonlinear flutter\nsystem.",

This study\ndevelops an integrated reactive transport model coupling geochemical surface\ncomplexation modeling (SCM) with multiphase compositional dynamics to quantify\nwettability alteration during LSWF. The framework combines PHREEQC-based\nequilibrium calculations of the Total Bond Product (TBP), a wettability\nindicator derived from oil-calcite ionic bridging, with Corey-type relative\npermeability interpolation, resolved via COMSOL Multiphysics. Core flooding\nsimulations, compared with experimental data from calcite systems at 100\ndegrees Celsius and 220 bar, reveal that magnesium and sulfate concentrations\nmodulate TBP, reducing oil-rock adhesion under controlled low-salinity\nconditions. Parametric analysis demonstrates that acidic crude oils (TAN higher\nthan 1 mg KOH per gram) exhibit TBP values approximately 2.5 times higher than\nsweet crudes, due to carboxylate-calcite bridging, while pH elevation (above\n7.5) amplifies wettability shifts by promoting deprotonated carboxyl\ninteractions. The model further identifies synergistic effects between\nmagnesium (50 to 200 millimoles per kilogram of water) and sulfate (above 500\nmillimoles per kilogram of water), which reduce calcium-mediated oil adhesion\nthrough competitive mineral surface binding. By correlating TBP with fractional\nflow dynamics, this framework could support the optimization of injection\nstrategies in carbonate reservoirs, suggesting that ion-specific adjustments\nare more effective than bulk salinity reduction.",

We analyze in detail both the\njunction conditions at the surface as well as the boundary conditions at the\ncenter which are required in order to have a smooth structure throughout the\nobject and into the exterior vacuum region. These junction conditions, although\ninvolved, turn out to be relatively easy to satisfy. Analysis reveals that\nthese compact objects have a richer structure than the canonical boson stars\nand some of these properties turn out to be physically peculiar: There are\nseveral branches of solutions depending on how the junction conditions are\nrealized. Further analysis illustrates that in practice the junction conditions\ntend to require interior geometries reminiscent of ``bag of gold'' spacetimes,\nand also hide the star behind an event horizon in its exterior. The surface\ncompactness of such objects, defined here as the ratio $2M/r$, can be made\narbitrarily close to unity indicating the absence of a Buchdahl bound. Some\ncomments on the stability of these objects is provided to find possible stable\nand unstable regimes.

Biasing standing waves (BSWs) are excited by a\ntime-periodic signal and sampled at each RIS element to create a desired\nbiasing voltage and control the reflection coefficients of the elements. A\nsimple rectifier can be used to sample the voltages and capture the peaks of\nthe BSWs over time. Like other types of RIS, attempting to model and accurately\nconfigure a wave-controlled RIS is extremely challenging due to factors such as\ndevice non-linearities, frequency dependence, element coupling, etc., and thus\nsignificant differences will arise between the actual and assumed performance.\nAn alternative approach to solving this problem is data-driven: Using training\ndata obtained by sampling the reflected radiation pattern of the RIS for a set\nof BSWs, a neural network (NN) is designed to create an input-output map\nbetween the BSW amplitudes and the resulting sampled radiation pattern. This is\nthe approach discussed in this paper. In the proposed approach, the NN is\noptimized using a genetic algorithm (GA) to minimize the error between the\npredicted and measured radiation patterns. The BSW amplitudes are then designed\nvia Simulated Annealing (SA) to optimize a signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio\nmeasure by iteratively forward-propagating the BSW amplitudes through the NN\nand using its output as feedback to determine convergence. The resulting\noptimal solutions are stored in a lookup table to be used both as settings to\ninstantly configure the RIS and as a basis for determining more complex\nradiation patterns.",

On one hand, formal statutes (\"law on the books\") set the\nscope of what can be patented and outline procedural safeguards. On the other\nhand, actual enforcement (\"law in practice\") determines whether those rights\nhold up in practice. To capture these dimensions, researchers have developed\nsimple indices of legal provisions and more nuanced proxies for enforcement\neffectiveness, along with metrics of how applicant-friendly each office's\nprocedures are. Comparative studies of \"twin patents\" -- identical inventions\nfiled in multiple jurisdictions -- reveal systematic differences in grant rates\nand bar heights across major offices. By combining these approaches, we gain a\nmultifaceted view of patent-system strength that balances statutory design,\nadministrative practice, and actual enforcement.

The framework incorporates three\nmajor innovations: (1) de-noising parliamentary speeches via summarization to\nproduce cleaner, more consistent opinion embeddings; (2) automatic extraction\nof axes of political controversy from legislators' speech summaries; and (3) a\ndiachronic analysis that tracks the evolution of party positions over time.\n  We conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations to verify our\nmethodology. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate high correlation with expert\npredictions across various political topics, while qualitative analyses reveal\nmeaningful associations between language patterns and political ideologies.\nThis research aims to have an impact beyond the field of academia by making the\nresults accessible by the public on teh web application: kokkaidoc.com.

The probability of such lensing\nevents has been approximately estimated by using the Einstein criterion in\nprevious work. However, a more reasonable approach to calculating the lensing\nprobability should be based on whether the detector can distinguish the lensed\nGW waveform from the unlensed one. In this work, we calculate the lensing\nprobability of LIGO sources embedded in AGN disk by relating threshold mismatch\nto the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed events. For the sensitivity of\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 observation runs, our results indicate that the lensing\nprobability is several times higher than previous estimates. If AGNs are indeed\nthe primary formation channel for BBHs, we could quantify the probability of\ndetecting the lensed GW events in such a scenario.

With their advanced\nsemantic understanding, deep learning models have been widely used for\nrelevance matching in search tasks. While large language models (LLMs) offer\nsuperior ranking capabilities, it is challenging to deploy LLMs in real-time\nsystems due to the high-latency requirements. To leverage the ranking power of\nLLMs while meeting the low-latency demands of production systems, we propose a\nnovel framework that distills a high performing LLM into a more efficient,\nlow-latency student model. To help the student model learn more effectively\nfrom the teacher model, we first train the teacher LLM as a classification\nmodel with soft targets. Then, we train the student model to capture the\nrelevance margin between pairs of products for a given query using mean squared\nerror loss. Instead of using the same training data as the teacher model, we\nsignificantly expand the student model dataset by generating unlabeled data and\nlabeling it with the teacher model predictions. Experimental results show that\nthe student model performance continues to improve as the size of the augmented\ntraining data increases. In fact, with enough augmented data, the student model\ncan outperform the teacher model. The student model has been successfully\ndeployed in production at Walmart.com with significantly positive metrics.",

This result\nis not covered by \\cite{G} as the required large magnitude of the Jacobi\nconstant is uniform across the mass ratios.\n  Our approach consists of three main ingredients. First, by introducing new\ncoordinate transformations, we reformulate the restricted three-body problem as\na perturbed Duffing equation. Second, we adopt the method recently introduced\nin \\cite{CW} to derive integral equations for the primary stable and unstable\nsolutions. This enables us to effectively capture the order of the\nsingularities involved and to further establish the existence and analytic\ndependence of the invariant manifolds on the mass ratio of the primaries and\nthe Jacobi constant. Third, in evaluating the Poincar\\'e-Melnikov integral, we\ntake advantage of the explicit homoclinic solution of the unperturbed Duffing\nequation.\n  Compared to existing works, our proof is significantly simpler and more\ndirect.

In this paper, we investigate a\ngeneral formulation of sequential decision-making with stage-wise feasibility\nconstraints, where at each round, the learner must select an action based on\nobserved context while ensuring that a problem-specific feasibility criterion\nis satisfied. We propose a unified algorithmic framework that captures many\nexisting constrained learning problems, including constrained bandits, active\nlearning with label budgets, online hypothesis testing with Type I error\ncontrol, and model calibration. Central to our approach is the concept of upper\ncounterfactual confidence bounds, which enables the design of practically\nefficient online algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees using any\noffline conditional density estimation oracle. To handle feasibility\nconstraints in complex environments, we introduce a generalized notion of the\neluder dimension, extending it from the classical setting based on square loss\nto a broader class of metric-like probability divergences. This allows us to\ncapture the complexity of various density function classes and characterize the\nutility regret incurred due to feasibility constraint uncertainty.

    "abstract": "Gas hydrates are considered fundamental building blocks of giant icy planets\nlike Neptune and similar exoplanets. The existence of these materials in the\ninteriors of giant icy planets, which are subject to high pressures and\ntemperatures, depends on their stability relative to their constituent\ncomponents. In this study, we reexamine the structural stability and hydrogen\ncontent of hydrogen hydrates, (H2O)(H2)n, up to 104 GPa, focusing on\nhydrogen-rich materials. Using synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction,\nRaman spectroscopy, and first-principles theoretical calculations, we find that\nthe C2-filled ice phase undergoes a transformation to C3-filled ice phase over\na broad pressure range of 47 - 104 GPa at room temperature. The C3 phase\ncontains twice as much molecular H2 as the C2 phase. Heating the C2-filled ice\nabove approximately 1500 K induces the transition to the C3 phase at pressures\nas low as 47 GPa. Upon decompression, this phase remains metastable down to 40\nGPa. These findings establish new stability limits for hydrates, with\nimplications for hydrogen storage and the interiors of planetary bodies.",

    "abstract": "Finite element (FE) modeling is essential for structural analysis but remains\ncomputationally intensive, especially under dynamic loading. While operator\nlearning models have shown promise in replicating static structural responses\nat FEM level accuracy, modeling dynamic behavior remains more challenging. This\nwork presents a Multiple Input Operator Network (MIONet) that incorporates a\nsecond trunk network to explicitly encode temporal dynamics, enabling accurate\nprediction of structural responses under moving loads. Traditional DeepONet\narchitectures using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are limited by fixed time\ndiscretization and struggle to capture continuous dynamics. In contrast, MIONet\npredicts responses continuously over both space and time, removing the need for\nstep wise modeling. It maps scalar inputs including load type, velocity,\nspatial mesh, and time steps to full field structural responses. To improve\nefficiency and enforce physical consistency, we introduce a physics informed\nloss based on dynamic equilibrium using precomputed mass, damping, and\nstiffness matrices, without solving the governing PDEs directly. Further, a\nSchur complement formulation reduces the training domain, significantly cutting\ncomputational costs while preserving global accuracy. The model is validated on\nboth a simple beam and the KW-51 bridge, achieving FEM level accuracy within\nseconds. Compared to GRU based DeepONet, our model offers comparable accuracy\nwith improved temporal continuity and over 100 times faster inference, making\nit well suited for real-time structural monitoring and digital twin\napplications.",

To analyze the lattice QCD data we develop a field-theory\ninspired model of quark-antiquark-pion matter with vector-isovector repulsion\namong pions and (anti)quarks. The quark substructure of pions, which is one of\nthe key elements of the model, is accounted for within the one-loop no-sea\napproximation and leads to an effective medium dependence of the pion mass. The\nlatter is shown to be crucial for providing asymptotic vanishing of the pion\ndensity and pion condensate, which reflects pion dissociation due to asymptotic\nfreedom of QCD. The proposed quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD agrees with the\nresults of perturbative calculations on reaching the conformal limit of QCD and\nwith the data of lattice simulations, which supports its viability and physical\nrelevance.",

Recently, the Concept Discovery\nthrough Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT) framework,\nintroduced by Varshney et al. (2025), attempts to identify concepts via\ndimension-wise traversal of the latent space of a Variational Autoencoder\ntrained on counterfactual trajectories. Extending the CDCT framework, this work\nintroduces Concept Directions via Latent Clustering (CDLC), which extracts\nglobal, class-specific concept directions by clustering latent difference\nvectors derived from factual and diffusion-generated counterfactual image\npairs. CDLC substantially reduces computational complexity by eliminating the\nexhaustive latent dimension traversal required in CDCT and enables the\nextraction of multidimensional semantic concepts encoded across the latent\ndimensions. This approach is validated on a real-world skin lesion dataset,\ndemonstrating that the extracted concept directions align with clinically\nrecognized dermoscopic features and, in some cases, reveal dataset-specific\nbiases or unknown biomarkers. These results highlight that CDLC is\ninterpretable, scalable, and applicable across high-stakes domains and diverse\ndata modalities.",

To address this limitation,\nwe propose SAMSR, a semantic-guided diffusion framework that incorporates\nsemantic segmentation masks into the sampling process. Specifically, we\nintroduce the SAM-Noise Module, which refines Gaussian noise using segmentation\nmasks to preserve spatial and semantic features. Furthermore, we develop a\npixel-wise sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the residual transfer\nrate and noise strength based on pixel-level semantic weights, prioritizing\nsemantically rich regions during the diffusion process. To enhance model\ntraining, we also propose a semantic consistency loss, which aligns pixel-wise\nsemantic weights between predictions and ground truth.

The results\nindicate that as spin parameter increases, the circular orbits are shifted\nrightwards, while the larger values of critical density and the scale radius\nare the cause to enhance the radius of circular orbits of the BH shadow. In the\ncase of the celestial light source, the impact of critical density on shadow\ndistortion is negligible, but this influence is relatively smaller and becomes\nappreciable when the scale radius has larger values. Next, we discuss the\nintensity and the size of the inner shadow, which are gradually increasing with\nthe increase of both parameters.

Building on this\nframework, we explore the evolution of social value systems and the operational\nrole that social status plays in hierarchically organised societies. Within the\nasymmetric Ultimatum Game paradigm, where \"proposers\" suggest terms for\nresource distribution, and \"responders\" accept or reject these terms, we\nexamine the assignment of roles between players under a subjective social\norder. This order is grounded in an emergent status hierarchy based on\nobservable player attributes (such as age and wealth). The underlying rules for\nconstructing such a hierarchy stabilise over time by inheritance and family\nties. Despite their subjective nature these (often sub-conscious) value systems\nhave operative meaning in controlling access of individuals to resources and\ndecision making. We demonstrate these effects using a simple but sufficiently\ncomplex model with dynamical population size and network structure, where\ndivision of resources (prey) is carried out according to the principles of the\nUltimatum Game. We focus on the emerging proposer and responder thresholds\nunder distinct social hierarchies and interaction networks and discuss them in\nrelation to the extensive body of Ultimatum Game experiments conducted across a\nwide range of cultural contexts.

      "Mizuki Nishiwaki"
    ],
    "abstract": "Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture\nof volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical\nmodels and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation\ntheory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the\nparameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct estimation of\nsurface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble\nnumber density (BND) from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical\nnucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts\nfor the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the\nspinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown,\nnecessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal\npressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the\nnonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a\ntwo-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This\napproach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using\ndata from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface\ntension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical\nformula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma\nvesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require\nan integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both\nsupersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more\naccurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the\ndiscrepancy between theoretical and experimental BND values.",

    "abstract": "This work formally introduces Y-wise Affine Neural Networks (YANNs), a\nfully-explainable network architecture that continuously and efficiently\nrepresent piecewise affine functions with polytopic subdomains. Following from\nthe proofs, it is shown that the development of YANNs requires no training to\nachieve the functionally equivalent representation. YANNs thus maintain all\nmathematical properties of the original formulations. Multi-parametric model\npredictive control is utilized as an application showcase of YANNs, which\ntheoretically computes optimal control laws as a piecewise affine function of\nstates, outputs, setpoints, and disturbances. With the exact representation of\nmulti-parametric control laws, YANNs retain essential control-theoretic\nguarantees such as recursive feasibility and stability. This sets YANNs apart\nfrom the existing works which apply neural networks for approximating optimal\ncontrol laws instead of exactly representing them. By optimizing the inference\nspeed of the networks, YANNs can evaluate substantially faster in real-time\ncompared to traditional piecewise affine function calculations. Numerical case\nstudies are presented to demonstrate the algorithmic scalability with respect\nto the input/output dimensions and the number of subdomains. YANNs represent a\nsignificant advancement in control as the first neural network-based controller\nthat inherently ensures both feasibility and stability.

Many of these networks are based on a few fundamental motifs leading\nto switches and oscillators of various kinds. And yet, there is more to the\nstory than which transcription factors control these various circuits. These\ntranscription factors are often themselves under the control of effector\nmolecules that bind them and alter their level of activity. Traditionally, much\nbeautiful work has shown how to think about the stability of the different\nstates achieved by these fundamental regulatory architectures by examining how\nparameters such as transcription rates, degradation rates and dissociation\nconstants tune the circuit, giving rise to behavior such as bistability.\nHowever, such studies explore dynamics without asking how these quantities are\naltered in real time in living cells as opposed to at the fingertips of the\nsynthetic biologist's pipette or on the computational biologist's computer\nscreen. In this paper, we make a departure from the conventional dynamical\nsystems view of these regulatory motifs by using statistical mechanical models\nto focus on endogenous signaling knobs such as effector concentrations rather\nthan on the convenient but more experimentally remote knobs such as\ndissociation constants, transcription rates and degradation rates that are\noften considered. We also contrast the traditional use of Hill functions to\ndescribe transcription factor binding with more detailed thermodynamic models.\nThis approach provides insights into how biological parameters are tuned to\ncontrol the stability of regulatory motifs in living cells, sometimes revealing\nquite a different picture than is found by using Hill functions and tuning\ncircuit parameters by hand.",

Fortunately, Domain Generalization (DG) excels without the need\nfor any target data. Recent works expose that depth maps contribute to improved\ngeneralized performance in the UDA tasks, but they ignore the noise and holes\nin depth maps due to device and environmental factors, failing to sufficiently\nand effectively learn domain-invariant representation. Although\nhigh-sensitivity region suppression has shown promising results in learning\ndomain-invariant features, existing methods cannot be directly applicable to\ndepth maps due to their unique characteristics. Hence, we propose a novel\nframework, namely Depth-Sensitive Soft Suppression with RGB-D inter-modal\nstylization flow (DSSS), focusing on learning domain-invariant features from\ndepth maps for the DG semantic segmentation. Specifically, we propose the RGB-D\ninter-modal stylization flow to generate stylized depth maps for sensitivity\ndetection, cleverly utilizing RGB information as the stylization source. Then,\na class-wise soft spatial sensitivity suppression is designed to identify and\nemphasize non-sensitive depth features that contain more domain-invariant\ninformation. Furthermore, an RGB-D soft alignment loss is proposed to ensure\nthat the stylized depth maps only align part of the RGB features while still\nretaining the unique depth information. To our best knowledge, our DSSS\nframework is the first work to integrate RGB and Depth information in the\nmulti-class DG semantic segmentation task.

Recent advances in RL-based large reasoning models have\nled to impressive long CoT capabilities and high performance on math and\nscience benchmarks. However, these reasoning models rely mainly on\nmonologue-style reasoning, which often limits reasoning diversity and\ncoherency, frequently recycling fixed strategies or exhibiting unnecessary\nshifts in attention. Our work consists of an analysis of monologue reasoning\npatterns and the development of a dialogue-based reasoning approach. We first\nintroduce the Compound-QA task, which concatenates multiple problems into a\nsingle prompt to assess both diversity and coherency of reasoning. Our analysis\nshows that Compound-QA exposes weaknesses in monologue reasoning, evidenced by\nboth quantitative metrics and qualitative reasoning traces. Building on the\nanalysis, we propose a dialogue-based reasoning, named DialogueReason,\nstructured around agents, environment, and interactions. Using PPO with\nrule-based rewards, we train open-source LLMs (Qwen-QWQ and Qwen-Base) to adopt\ndialogue reasoning. We evaluate trained models on MATH, AIME, and GPQA\ndatasets, showing that the dialogue reasoning model outperforms monologue\nmodels under more complex compound questions.

Battery swapping, a technique in\nwhich fully or partially depleted batteries are exchanged and then transported\nto a central facility for charging, introduces a unique scheduling problem. For\nscenarios involving a large number of batteries, commercial solvers and\nexisting methods do not yield optimal or near-optimal solutions in a reasonable\ntime due to high computational complexity. Our study presents a novel approach\nthat combines variable layering with Lagrangian decomposition. We develop a\nnew, tighter time-block reformulation for one of the Lagrangian sub-problems,\nenhancing convergence rates when used with our partial-variable fixing\nLagrangian heuristic. We also propose an ergodic-iterate-based local search\nmethod to further improve the solution quality.

Experimental results on a\n2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle system, equipped with explicit system\nmodels, demonstrate the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of\nDAOF-v1 compared to existing nonlinear filters.

    "abstract": "We present a large-scale simulation of the three-dimensional and mean-field\nspin glasses down to a very low but finite temperature. We extrapolate\npertinent observables, e.g., the disorder-averaged central weight to zero\ntemperature, finding that many thermodynamic states at a finite temperature and\ntwo ground states at zero temperature are fully compatible. While the\ndisorder-averaged central weight monotonically decreases with decreasing\ntemperature, this is far from true for individual samples. This motivates us to\nlink this behaviour with the well-known temperature chaos. At an observing\ntemperature, a sample may or may not have pure state coexistence depending on\nwhether it is undergoing temperature chaos, which is a random process.\nTherefore, temperature chaos is likely responsible for the emergence of many\npure states, providing a natural and intuitive explanation for the coexistence\nof expensive domain-wall excitations and many pure states at the\ndisorder-averaged level.",

Central to our\napproach is the development of a novel model, DNet, a hybrid architecture\ncombining Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nlayers for effective feature extraction and sequential learning. The DNet model\ncomprises an initial convolutional block for capturing essential features,\nfollowed by a residual block with skip connections to facilitate efficient\ninformation flow. Batch Normalization and Dropout are employed for robust\nregularization, and an LSTM layer captures temporal dependencies within the\ndata. Using a Kaggle-sourced real-world diabetes dataset, our model evaluation\nspans cross-validation accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.\nAmong the models, DNet demonstrates the highest efficacy with an accuracy of\n99.79% and an AUC-ROC of 99.98%, establishing its potential for superior\ndiabetes prediction.

For norm-bounded CSI\nerrors, we derive the worst-case received signal power in closed-form. For\nrandomly distributed CSI errors, due to the intractability of the probabilistic\nconstraints, we apply the Bernstein-type inequality to obtain a closed-form\nlower bound for the non-outage received signal power.

Traditional statistical prediction methods are becoming\nobsolete due to their inability to address the non-linear and dynamic\nspatio-temporal dependencies present in today's network traffic. The most\npromising direction of research today is graph neural networks (GNNs) based\nprediction approaches that are naturally suited to handle graph-structured\ndata. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art GNN approaches separate the modeling\nof spatial and temporal information, resulting in the loss of important\ninformation about joint dependencies. These GNN based approaches further do not\nmodel information at both local and global scales simultaneously, leaving\nsignificant room for improvement. To address these challenges, we propose\nNetSight. NetSight learns joint spatio-temporal dependencies simultaneously at\nboth global and local scales from the time-series of measurements of any given\nnetwork metric collected at various nodes in a network. Using the learned\ninformation, NetSight can then accurately predict the future values of the\ngiven network metric at those nodes in the network. We propose several new\nconcepts and techniques in the design of NetSight, such as spatio-temporal\nadjacency matrix and node normalization. Through extensive evaluations and\ncomparison with prior approaches using data from two large real-world networks,\nwe show that NetSight significantly outperforms all prior state-of-the-art\napproaches.

    "abstract": "Fault detection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is crucial for reliable\ndata transmission and network longevity. Traditional fault detection methods\noften struggle with optimizing deep neural networks (DNNs) for efficient\nperformance, especially in handling high-dimensional data and capturing\nnonlinear relationships. Additionally, these methods typically suffer from slow\nconvergence and difficulty in finding optimal network architectures using\ngradient-based optimization. This study proposes a novel hybrid method\ncombining Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with a DNN optimized by the\nGrasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) to address these limitations. Our\napproach begins by computing eigenvalues from the original 12-dimensional\ndataset and sorting them in descending order. The cumulative sum of these\nvalues is calculated, retaining principal components until 99.5% variance is\nachieved, effectively reducing dimensionality to 4 features while preserving\ncritical information. This compressed representation trains a six-layer DNN\nwhere GOA optimizes the network architecture, overcoming backpropagation's\nlimitations in discovering nonlinear relationships. This hybrid PCA-GOA-DNN\nframework compresses the data and trains a six-layer DNN that is optimized by\nGOA, enhancing both training efficiency and fault detection accuracy. The\ndataset used in this study is a real-world WSNs dataset developed by the\nUniversity of North Carolina, which was used to evaluate the proposed method's\nperformance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves a\nremarkable 99.72% classification accuracy, with exceptional precision and\nrecall, outperforming conventional methods. The method is computationally\nefficient, making it suitable for large-scale WSN deployments, and represents a\nsignificant advancement in fault detection for resource-constrained WSNs.",

We examine whether the standard\ntradition was followed regarding the orientation of the apses of historic\nchurches eastwards. While most of the religious constructions in the sample\nhave their main axes oriented within the solar range, the statistical analysis\nalso reveals the presence of two different groups of churches with different\npossible interpretations. For the first group, mainly composed of churches\nlocated in the central part of the island, an anomalous tendency to orientate\nthem towards a declination of c. -14 degrees is detected. We provide some\npossible explanations for this, which include the date of a traditional\nCanarian celebration, an eventual imprint of topography, and the possibility of\nsunset orientations. Also, this particular value of declination is close to\n-16.3 degrees, the declination of Sirius during the 17th century. Therefore, we\nprovide ethnographic data that might support an eventually controversial\n'bright star' orientation. For the second group, meanwhile, we find a pattern\nof orientation where the apse of the churches points slightly to the north of\ndue east.

The minimum\nnumber of colors required for this coloring is denoted as the local rainbow\ncoloring number $C_r(n, H)$.\n  We first establish an upper bound of the local rainbow coloring number for\n$r$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ consisting of $h$ vertices, that is, $C_r(n, H)=\nO\\left( n^{\\frac{h-r}{h}} \\cdot h^{2r + \\frac{r}{h}} \\right)$. Furthermore, we\nidentify a set of $r$-uniform hypergraphs whose local rainbow coloring numbers\nare bounded by a constant.

Although network structure has been found to significantly\ninfluence cooperation, human experiments have observed different cooperation\nphenomena under similar conditions.

Here, we seek to formalize\nhuman exploration as an individual learning process involving trial and\nreflection, and integrate social learning to examine how their interdependence\nshapes cooperation. We find that individual learning can alter neighbor\nimitation tendencies, and the resulting shifts in the local cooperative\nenvironment feed back into the experiential cognition that guides individual\nlearning. This coupled dynamic makes the ability of social networks to promote\ncooperation largely dependent on whether individuals focus on long-term\npayoffs, and exhibits a series of characteristics that can explain previously\nunexplained and seemingly contradictory cooperation phenomena. Surprisingly,\nindividual learning can promote cooperation more than social learning when its\nprobability is negatively correlated with payoffs, a mechanism rooted in the\npsychological tendency to avoid trial-and-error when individuals are satisfied\nwith their current payoffs. These results explain the contradictory cooperation\nphenomenon by accounting for decision preferences and cognitive processes\nunderlying exploration, bridging the gap between theoretical research and\nreality.",

While prior affective computing approaches emphasized\nexpressiveness, immersion, and responsiveness, they often neglected the\ncognitive and structural consequences of repeated emotional engagement. R-CAGE\ninstead conceptualizes emotional output not as reactive expression but as\nethical design structure requiring architectural intervention. The model is\ngrounded in experiential observations of subtle affective symptoms such as\nlocalized head tension, interpretive fixation, and emotional lag arising from\nprolonged interaction with affective AI systems. These indicate a mismatch\nbetween system-driven emotion and user interpretation that cannot be fully\nexplained by biometric data or observable behavior. R-CAGE adopts a\nuser-centered stance prioritizing psychological recovery, interpretive\nautonomy, and identity continuity. The framework consists of four control\nblocks: (1) Control of Rhythmic Expression regulates output pacing to reduce\nfatigue; (2) Architecture of Sensory Structuring adjusts intensity and timing\nof affective stimuli; (3) Guarding of Cognitive Framing reduces semantic\npressure to allow flexible interpretation; (4) Ego-Aligned Response Design\nsupports self-reference recovery during interpretive lag.

Furthermore, many of\nthese approaches rely on pretraining with constrained datasets such as\nImageNet, which lack domain-specific information. We propose SCOLD (Soft-target\nCOntrastive learning for Leaf Disease identification), a context-aware\nvision-language foundation model tailored to address these challenges for\nagricultural tasks. SCOLD is developed using a diverse corpus of plant leaf\nimages and corresponding symptom descriptions, comprising over 186,000\nimage-caption pairs aligned with 97 unique concepts. Through task-agnostic\npretraining, SCOLD leverages contextual soft targets to mitigate overconfidence\nin contrastive learning by smoothing labels, thereby improving model\ngeneralization and robustness on fine-grained classification tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that SCOLD outperforms existing\nvision-language models such as OpenAI-CLIP-L, BioCLIP, and SigLIP2 across\nseveral benchmarks, including zero-shot and few-shot classification, image-text\nretrieval, and image classification, while maintaining a competitive parameter\nfootprint.

We confirm the FMR and\nequivalent relations for stellar metallicity (FMR*) and gaseous N/O\n(fundamental nitrogen relation, FNR). We find that all relations persist when\nconsidering gravitational potential in place of stellar mass and/or considering\nstellar ages in place of SFR, with the gaseous relations strengthened\nsignificantly by considering potential. The gaseous FMR disappears at high\nmasses/potentials, while the FNR persists and the FMR* strengthens. Our results\nsuggest a unified interpretation of galaxies' gaseous and stellar metallicities\nand their N/O abundances in terms of their formation histories. Deeper\ngravitational potentials correspond to earlier star-formation histories (SFHs)\nand faster gas consumption, producing tight potential-abundance relations for\nstars and gas. In weak potentials, galaxy SFR variations primarily result from\nrecent gas inflows, mostly affecting gas abundances. In deeper potentials, SFR\nvariations instead correspond to broad differences in SFH shapes resulting from\ndifferences in long-term gas consumption histories, which is most visible in\nstellar abundances.

    "abstract": "We propose and analyze two agent-based models to investigate the dynamics of\npapal conclaves, focusing on how social influence, strategic voting, and\nideological alignment affect the time required to elect a pope. In the first\nmodel, cardinals interact through two mechanisms: with probability $p$, they\nimitate the choice of a randomly selected peer, and with probability $q$, they\nshift support to the most voted candidate from the previous round.\nAdditionally, strategic behavior is introduced via ``useful voting'', where\nagents abandon their preferred candidate if he receives less than a threshold\nfraction of the votes, switching instead to the most viable alternative. A\ncandidate must secure a qualified majority of two-thirds to be elected. We then\nextend the framework by incorporating ideological blocs, assigning each\ncardinal and candidate to one of two groups (e.g., progressives and\nconservatives). Cardinals initially vote for candidates from their own group\nbut may cross ideological lines for strategic reasons. We initialize the\nelectorate with $20\\%$ conservative cardinals, reflecting the current\ncomposition shaped by papal appointments. Numerical simulations show that\nideological polarization tends to delay the election by increasing the number\nof voting rounds required. However, higher values of strategic responsiveness\n$q$ can restore efficiency even under polarization. We further validate the\nmodel by calibrating parameters to historical data from conclaves held between\n1939 and 2025. The model reproduces observed convergence times with good\nagreement, supporting its explanatory power across institutional contexts. The\nrapid outcome of the 2025 conclave, despite ideological divisions, suggests the\nimportance of informal consensus-building, possibly prior to voting, as a key\nmechanism for accelerating convergence.",

The challenge is\nto design a network-dependent probability distribution (at the source) over the\npotential destinations such that, from the receiver's perspective, all users\nhave a similar likelihood of being the source.

However, metal contamination of the\nbonding surfaces during fabrication compromised these results, making them\nunrepresentative of an ideal bonding interface. In this paper we present the\nresults from a subsequent fabrication run, which does not exhibit this sort of\nmetal contamination. These results confirm that the bonding interface behaves\nas a heavily doped N++ layer, even without contamination.

Our main objective is to establish the\nsharp $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators $W_\\pm(H; (-\\Delta)^m)$ in the\npresence of all types of zero-resonance singularities, for all odd dimensions\n$1 \\le n \\le 4m - 1$.\n  Specifically, for odd $n$ with $1 \\le n \\le 4m - 1$, there exist $m_n$ types\nof zero resonances for $H$, along with a critical type $k_c$ (both depending on\n$n$ and $m$). If zero is a regular point of $H$ or a $\\mathbf{k}$-th kind\nresonance with $1 \\le \\mathbf{k} \\le k_c$, the wave operators $W_\\pm(H;\n(-\\Delta)^m)$ are bounded on $L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $1 < p < \\infty$.

However, current automatic micro-expression\nrecognition (MER) research primarily focuses on discrete emotion\nclassification, neglecting a convincing analysis of the subtle dynamic\nmovements and inherent emotional cues. The rapid progress in multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs), known for their strong multimodal comprehension and\nlanguage generation abilities, offers new possibilities. MLLMs have shown\nsuccess in various vision-language tasks, indicating their potential to\nunderstand MEs comprehensively, including both fine-grained motion patterns and\nunderlying emotional semantics. Nevertheless, challenges remain due to the\nsubtle intensity and short duration of MEs, as existing MLLMs are not designed\nto capture such delicate frame-level facial dynamics. In this paper, we propose\na novel Micro-Expression Large Language Model (MELLM), which incorporates a\nsubtle facial motion perception strategy with the strong inference capabilities\nof MLLMs, representing the first exploration of MLLMs in the domain of ME\nanalysis. Specifically, to explicitly guide the MLLM toward motion-sensitive\nregions, we construct an interpretable motion-enhanced color map by fusing\nonset-apex optical flow dynamics with the corresponding grayscale onset frame\nas the model input. Additionally, specialized fine-tuning strategies are\nincorporated to further enhance the model's visual perception of MEs.\nFurthermore, we construct an instruction-description dataset based on Facial\nAction Coding System (FACS) annotations and emotion labels to train our MELLM.\nComprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nour model exhibits superior robustness and generalization capabilities in ME\nunderstanding (MEU).

Any modifications of the input image lead\nto an entire regeneration of the 3D models. In this paper, we introduce a new\nmethod called CMD that generates a 3D model from an input image while enabling\nflexible local editing of each component of the 3D model. In CMD, we formulate\nthe 3D generation as a conditional multiview diffusion model, which takes the\nexisting or known parts as conditions and generates the edited or added\ncomponents. This conditional multiview diffusion model not only allows the\ngeneration of 3D models part by part but also enables local editing of 3D\nmodels according to the local revision of the input image without changing\nother 3D parts. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that CMD\ndecomposes a complex 3D generation task into multiple components, improving the\ngeneration quality.

This means every (non-trivial) toroidal snark can be\nobtained from several copies of the Petersen graph using the dot product\noperation. The first two snarks in this family are the Petersen graph and one\nof Blanu\\v{s}a snarks; the rest are exposed by Vodopivec in 2008. This proves a\nstrengthening of the well-known, long-standing conjecture of Gr\\\"unbaum from\n1968.\n  This implies that a 2-connected cubic (multi)graph that can be embedded in\nthe torus is not 3-edge-colorable if and only if it can be obtained from a dot\nproduct of copies of the Petersen graph by replacing its vertices with\n2-edge-connected planar cubic (multi)graphs. Here, replacing a vertex $v$ in a\ncubic graph $G$ is the operation that takes a 2-connected planar cubic\nmultigraph $H$ and one of its vertices $u$ of degree 3, unifying $G-v$ and\n$H-u$ and connecting the neighbors of $v$ in $G-v$ with the neighbors of $u$ in\n$H-u$ with a matching.\n  This result is a highly nontrivial generalization of the Four Color Theorem,\nand its proof requires a combination of extensive computer verification and\ncomputer-free extension of existing proofs on colorability.\n  An important consequence of this result is a very strong version of the Tutte\n4-Flow Conjecture for toroidal graphs. We show that a 2-edge connected graph\nembedded in the torus admits a nowhere-zero 4-flow unless it is Petersen-like\n(in which case it does not admit nowhere-zero 4-flows). Observe that this is a\nvast strengthening over the Tutte 4-Flow Conjecture on the torus, which assumes\nthat the graph does not contain the Petersen graph as a minor because almost\nall toroidal graphs contain the Petersen graph minor, but almost none are\nPetersen-like.",

To facilitate VLM\nresearch on gastrointestinal (GI) image analysis and study hallucination, we\ncurate a multimodal image-text GI dataset: Gut-VLM. This dataset is created\nusing a two-stage pipeline: first, descriptive medical reports of Kvasir-v2\nimages are generated using ChatGPT, which introduces some hallucinated or\nincorrect texts. In the second stage, medical experts systematically review\nthese reports, and identify and correct potential inaccuracies to ensure\nhigh-quality, clinically reliable annotations. Unlike traditional datasets that\ncontain only descriptive texts, our dataset also features tags identifying\nhallucinated sentences and their corresponding corrections. A common approach\nto reducing hallucination in VLM is to finetune the model on a small-scale,\nproblem-specific dataset. However, we take a different strategy using our\ndataset. Instead of finetuning the VLM solely for generating textual reports,\nwe finetune it to detect and correct hallucinations, an approach we call\nhallucination-aware finetuning.

(ii) Positions of the\nsource and observer -- the finite distances of the source and observer from the\nlens are explicitly considered, avoiding approximations.

    "abstract": "Mobile crowdsensing is evolving beyond traditional human-centric models by\nintegrating heterogeneous entities like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and\nunmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). Optimizing task allocation among these diverse\nagents is critical, particularly in challenging emergency rescue scenarios\ncharacterized by complex environments, limited communication, and partial\nobservability. This paper tackles the Heterogeneous-Entity\nCollaborative-Sensing Task Allocation (HECTA) problem specifically for\nemergency rescue, considering humans, UAVs, and UGVs. We introduce a novel\n``Hard-Cooperative'' policy where UGVs prioritize recharging low-battery UAVs,\nalongside performing their sensing tasks. The primary objective is maximizing\nthe task completion rate (TCR) under strict time constraints. We rigorously\nformulate this NP-hard problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov\ndecision process (Dec-POMDP) to effectively handle sequential decision-making\nunder uncertainty. To solve this, we propose HECTA4ER, a novel multi-agent\nreinforcement learning algorithm built upon a Centralized Training with\nDecentralized Execution architecture. HECTA4ER incorporates tailored designs,\nincluding specialized modules for complex feature extraction, utilization of\naction-observation history via hidden states, and a mixing network integrating\nglobal and local information, specifically addressing the challenges of partial\nobservability. Furthermore, theoretical analysis confirms the algorithm's\nconvergence properties. Extensive simulations demonstrate that HECTA4ER\nsignificantly outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average 18.42%\nincrease in TCR. Crucially, a real-world case study validates the algorithm's\neffectiveness and robustness in dynamic sensing scenarios, highlighting its\nstrong potential for practical application in emergency response.",

The claims these services make may\nbe very appealing to privacy-conscious Web users, but how effective these\nservices actually are at improving privacy has not been investigated. This work\naims to improve our understanding of commercial PII removal services in\nmultiple ways. First, we conduct a user study where participants purchase\nsubscriptions from four popular PII removal services, and report (i) what PII\nthe service find, (ii) from which data brokers, (iii) whether the service is\nable to have the information removed, and (iv) whether the identified\ninformation actually is PII describing the participant. And second, by\ncomparing the claims and promises the services makes (e.g. which and how many\ndata brokers each service claims to cover). We find that these services have\nsignificant accuracy and coverage issues that limit the usefulness of these\nservices as a privacy-enhancing technology. For example, we find that the\nmeasured services are unable to remove the majority of the identified PII\nrecords from data broker's (48.2% of the successfully removed found records)\nand that most records identified by these services are not PII about the user\n(study participants found that only 41.1% of records identified by these\nservices were PII about themselves).",

Such expansions therefore provide ensembles of\nmicrostates that can be used to define probabilities in the manner of\nfrequentism, in von Mises sense (where the probability of P is the frequency of\noccurrence of P in a suitable ensemble). The result is the Born rule. Since\nsatisfying our postulates, and in particular the locality condition (meaning no\naction-at-a-distance), these probabilities for no-collapse quantum mechanics\nare perfectly local, even though they violate Bell inequalities. The latter can\nbe traced to a violation of outcome independence, used to derive the\ninequalities. But in no-collapse theory that is not a locality condition; it is\na criterion for entanglement, not locality.",

This paper\nproposes a novel Data efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) based framework that\nintegrates context aware multiscale patch embedding, Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA), knowledge distillation, and federated learning to address these\nchallenges in a unified manner. The proposed model effectively captures both\nlocal and global retinal features by leveraging multi scale patch\nrepresentations with local and global attention mechanisms. LoRA integration\nenhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of trainable\nparameters, while federated learning ensures secure, decentralized training\nwithout compromising data privacy. A knowledge distillation strategy further\nimproves generalization in data scarce settings. Comprehensive evaluations on\ntwo benchmark datasets OCTDL and the Eye Disease Image Dataset demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework consistently outperforms both traditional CNNs and state\nof the art transformer architectures across key metrics including AUC, F1\nscore, and precision.

Preparing magic states within\nemerging quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes poses additional\nchallenges, due to the complex encoding structures. Here, we introduce a\ngeneric and scalable method for magic state injection into arbitrarily selected\nlogical qubits encoded using qLDPC codes. Our approach, based on parallelized\ncode surgery, supports the injection from either physical qubits or\nlow-distance logical qubits. For qLDPC code families with asymptotically\nconstant encoding rates, the method achieves injection into $\\Theta(k)$ logical\nqubits -- where $k$ denotes the logical qubit number of the code -- with only\nconstant qubit overhead and a time complexity of $\\tilde{O}(d^2)$, where $d$ is\nthe code distance. A central contribution of this work is a rigorous proof that\nerrors affecting the injected magic states remain independent throughout the\nprocedure. This independence ensures the resilience of logical qubits against\ninteractions with noisy ancillae and preserves the presumption of subsequent\nmagic state distillation protocols. We further support our theoretical results\nwith numerical validation through circuit-level simulations. These findings\nadvance the feasibility of scalable, fault-tolerant universal quantum computing\nusing qLDPC codes, offering a pathway to significantly reduced qubit resource\nrequirements in magic state injection.",

Leveraging data-driven Machine Learning\n(ML), especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), is expected to\nsignificantly enhance CAV decision-making in both vehicle control and V2X\ncommunication under uncertainty. These two decision-making processes are\nclosely intertwined, with the value of information (VoI) acting as a crucial\nbridge between them. In this paper, we introduce Sequential Stochastic Decision\nProcess (SSDP) models to define and assess VoI, demonstrating their application\nin optimizing communication systems for CAVs. Specifically, we formally define\nthe SSDP model and demonstrate that the MDP model is a special case of it. The\nSSDP model offers a key advantage by explicitly representing the set of\ninformation that can enhance decision-making when available. Furthermore, as\ncurrent research on VoI remains fragmented, we propose a systematic VoI\nmodeling framework grounded in the MDP, Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Optimal\nControl theories. We define different categories of VoI and discuss their\ncorresponding estimation methods. Finally, we present a structured approach to\nleverage the various VoI metrics for optimizing the ``When\", ``What\", and\n``How\" to communicate problems. For this purpose, SSDP models are formulated\nwith VoI-associated reward functions derived from VoI-based optimization\nobjectives.

Motivated by the\nobservation that high-frequency regions (e.g., edges and textures) are most\ncritical for reconstruction, we propose a training-free adaptive masking module\nfor acceleration that dynamically focuses computation on these challenging\nareas. Specifically, our method first extracts high-frequency components via\nGaussian blur subtraction and adaptively generates binary masks using K-means\nclustering to identify regions requiring intensive processing. Our method can\nbe easily integrated with both CNNs and Transformers. For CNN-based\narchitectures, we replace standard $3 \\times 3$ convolutions with an unfold\noperation followed by $1 \\times 1$ convolutions, enabling pixel-wise sparse\ncomputation guided by the mask. For Transformer-based models, we partition the\nmask into non-overlapping windows and selectively process tokens based on their\naverage values. During inference, unnecessary pixels or windows are pruned,\nsignificantly reducing computation. Moreover, our method supports\ndilation-based mask adjustment to control the processing scope without\nretraining, and is robust to unseen degradations (e.g., noise, compression).\nExtensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method reduces FLOPs\nby 24--43% for state-of-the-art models (e.g., CARN, SwinIR) while achieving\ncomparable or better quantitative metrics.

    "abstract": "Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a\npopulation of compact, red object ($z\\sim 4\\text{--}7$) known as little red\ndots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active\ngalactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit\nunusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting\nsuper-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that\nsuch an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would\ndisrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing\na general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose\nthat the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that\ngravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This\nenvelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington\nlimit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on\nthe order of $\\sim 1 M_{\\odot}~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either\nwithin the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic\ntemperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting\nblackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct\nV-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale\nat the photosphere, $\\sim 0.01~{\\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed\nyear-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs\nare shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as\na gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.",

Building on these results, we discuss strategies to enhance the\nutility of LLMs for carbon capture research, particularly using ILs.

Previous numerical studies show, that persuadable agents in\nallies-only networks are disrupted from asymptotically learning the intrinsic\nbias of a media organization, when the network is populated by one or more\nobdurate agents (partisans), who are not persuadable themselves but exert peer\npressure on other agents. Some persuadable agents asymptotically learn a false\nbias, while others vacillate indefinitely between a false bias and the true\nbias, a phenomenon called turbulent nonconvergence which also emerges in\nopponents-only and mixed networks without partisans. Here we derive an analytic\ninstability condition, which demarcates turbulent nonconvergence from\nasymptotic learning as a function of key network properties, for an idealized\nmodel of media bias featuring a biased coin. The condition is verified with\nMonte Carlo simulations as a function of network size, sparsity, and partisan\nfraction. It is derived in a probabilistic framework, where an agent's opinion\nis uncertain and is described by a probability density function, which is\nmultimodal in general, generalizing previous studies which assume that an\nagent's opinion is certain (i.e. described by one number).

However, previous\nschemes were unable to simultaneously handle the volatility problem of servers\ndynamically and eliminate the error caused by homomorphic evaluation of T-gate\nnon-interactively. Therefore, a novel multi-party dynamic quantum homomorphic\nencryption scheme based on rotation operators is proposed in this paper.\nFirstly, the proposed scheme uses the rotation operators to solve the phase\ngate error that occurs during the homomorphic evaluation of T-gate\nnon-interactively. Secondly, the scheme can dynamically deal with instability\nof servers, such as adding a server or removing a server. Then, the trusted key\ncenter is introduced, which is responsible for key updating and circuit\nreplacement, which lowers the requirements for quantum capabilities on the\nclient. Finally, this scheme extends the single-client multi-server model to\nthe multi-client multi-server model, making it more suitable for quantum\ndistributed networks and enhancing its practicality. In addition, we\ntheoretically prove the correctness and fully homomorphic property of the\nproposed scheme, and verify it through the simulation conducted on the IBM\nQuantum Experience.

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving, thermal image semantic segmentation has emerged as a\ncritical research area, owing to its ability to provide robust scene\nunderstanding under adverse visual conditions. In particular, unsupervised\ndomain adaptation (UDA) for thermal image segmentation can be an efficient\nsolution to address the lack of labeled thermal datasets. Nevertheless, since\nthese methods do not effectively utilize the complementary information between\nRGB and thermal images, they significantly decrease performance during domain\nadaptation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on cross-spectral\nUDA for thermal image semantic segmentation. We first propose a novel masked\nmutual learning strategy that promotes complementary information exchange by\nselectively transferring results between each spectral model while masking out\nuncertain regions. Additionally, we introduce a novel prototypical\nself-supervised loss designed to enhance the performance of the thermal\nsegmentation model in nighttime scenarios. This approach addresses the\nlimitations of RGB pre-trained networks, which cannot effectively transfer\nknowledge under low illumination due to the inherent constraints of RGB\nsensors. In experiments, our method achieves higher performance over previous\nUDA methods and comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs and structural causal models have each proven valuable for\norganizing biomedical knowledge and estimating causal effects, but remain\nlargely disconnected: knowledge graphs encode qualitative relationships\nfocusing on facts and deductive reasoning without formal probabilistic\nsemantics, while causal models lack integration with background knowledge in\nknowledge graphs and have no access to the deductive reasoning capabilities\nthat knowledge graphs provide. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel\nformulation of Causal Knowledge Graphs (CKGs) which extend knowledge graphs\nwith formal causal semantics, preserving their deductive capabilities while\nenabling principled causal inference. CKGs support deconfounding via explicitly\nmarked causal edges and facilitate hypothesis formulation aligned with both\nencoded and entailed background knowledge. We constructed a Drug-Disease CKG\n(DD-CKG) integrating disease progression pathways, drug indications,\nside-effects, and hierarchical disease classification to enable automated\nlarge-scale mediation analysis. Applied to UK Biobank and MIMIC-IV cohorts, we\ntested whether drugs mediate effects between indications and downstream disease\nprogression, adjusting for confounders inferred from the DD-CKG. Our approach\nsuccessfully reproduced known adverse drug reactions with high precision while\nidentifying previously undocumented significant candidate adverse effects.\nFurther validation through side effect similarity analysis demonstrated that\ncombining our predicted drug effects with established databases significantly\nimproves the prediction of shared drug indications, supporting the clinical\nrelevance of our novel findings.

To address this, we propose Unsupervised\nLearning for Class Distribution Mismatch (UCDM), which constructs\npositive-negative pairs from unlabeled data for classifier training.

Additionally, we\nintroduce a confidence-based labeling mechanism that iteratively assigns\npseudo-labels to valuable real-world data and incorporates them into the\ntraining process. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate UCDM's\nsuperiority over previous semi-supervised methods. Specifically, with a 60%\nmismatch proportion on Tiny-ImageNet dataset, our approach, without relying on\nlabeled data, surpasses OpenMatch (with 40 labels per class) by 35.1%, 63.7%,\nand 72.5% in classifying known, unknown, and new classes.",

In\nthis study, we propose an Iterative Residual Correction Network (IRC-Net) for\nthe inverse design of Ku-band Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW) components\nbased on multimode resonators. We use a multimode resonance structure to\ndemonstrate that it is possible to control the resonances of the structure.\nTherefore, these structures can be used for resonant components and smart\nfilter design. The proposed deep learning architecture leverages residual\nneural networks to overcome the limitations of traditional inverse design\ntechniques, such as the Feedforward Inverse Model (FIM), offering improved\ngeneralization and prediction accuracy. The approach begins with a FIM to\ngenerate initial design estimates, followed by an iterative correction strategy\ninspired by the Hybrid Inverse-Forward Residual Refinement Network\n(HiFR\\textsuperscript{2}-Net), which we call IRC-Net. Experiments demonstrate\nthat the IRC-Net achieves substantial improvements in prediction accuracy\ncompared to traditional single-stage networks, validated through statistical\nmetrics, full-wave electromagnetic simulations, and measurements.

    "abstract": "An assumed density approximate likelihood is derived for a class of partially\nobserved stochastic compartmental models which permit observational\nover-dispersion.

We derive an asymptotically exact filtering result in the large\npopulation regime, demonstrating the approximation's ability to recover latent\ndisease states and reporting probabilities. Through simulations we: 1)\ndemonstrate favorable behavior of the maximum approximate likelihood estimator\nin the large population and time horizon regime in terms of ground truth\nrecovery; 2) demonstrate order of magnitude computational speed gains over a\nsequential Monte Carlo likelihood based approach, and explore the statistical\ncompromises our approximation implicitly makes.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel sharp front-tracking method designed to address\nlimitations in classical front-tracking approaches, specifically their reliance\non smooth interpolation kernels and extended stencils for coupling the front\nand fluid mesh. In contrast, the proposed method employs exclusively sharp,\nlocalized interpolation and spreading kernels, restricting the coupling to the\ninterfacial fluid cells. This localized coupling is achieved by integrating a\ndivergence-preserving velocity interpolation method with a piecewise parabolic\ninterface calculation (PPIC) and a polyhedron intersection algorithm to compute\nthe indicator function and local interface curvature. Surface tension is\ncomputed using the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) method, maintaining\nconsistency with the sharp representation. Additionally, we propose an\nefficient local roughness smoothing implementation to account for surface mesh\nundulations, which is easily applicable to any triangulated surface mesh.\nBuilding on our previous work, the primary innovation of this study lies in the\nlocalization of the coupling for both the indicator function and surface\ntension calculations. By reducing the interface thickness on the fluid mesh to\na single cell, as opposed to the 4-5 cell spans typical in classical methods,\nthe proposed sharp front-tracking method achieves a highly localized and\naccurate representation of the interface. This sharper representation mitigates\nparasitic currents and improves force balancing, making it particularly\nsuitable for scenarios where the interface plays a critical role, such as\nmicrofluidics, fluid-fluid interactions, and fluid-structure interactions. The\npresented results demonstrate that the sharp front-tracking method\nsignificantly outperforms the classical approach in terms of accuracy,\nstability, and computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Power electronics converters are key enablers in the global energy transition\nfor power generation, industrial and mobility applications; they convert\nelectrical power in a controlled, reliable and efficient manner. The\nsemiconductor switching devices, at the core of power converters, are the most\nlikely component to fail due to the damage caused by the current-induced\ntemperature cycling. Damage models of semiconductors have been developed and\nemployed to study their reliability, improve their design and to estimate the\nlifetime of the converter in various power applications. However, those models\ncan offer more if employed in the design of strategies to actively operate the\nconverter. Specifically, properly controlling the current, and hence the\ntemperature cycling, can effectively contribute to reducing the accumulated\ndamage in the semiconductor and increase its reliability and lifetime. In this\npaper we propose a novel current control approach that integrates reliability\nrequirements into the design framework, based on a frequency-domain model of\nthe semiconductor damage.",

    "abstract": "Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote\nsensing imagery via deep learning is notoriously challenging due to the lack of\nsufficient structural information. Conventional digital elevation models\n(DEMs), typically derived from airborne LiDAR or multi-view stereo, remain\ncostly and geographically limited. Recently, models trained on synthetic data\nand refined through domain adaptation have shown remarkable performance in MHE,\nyet it remains unclear how these models make predictions or how reliable they\ntruly are. In this paper, we investigate a state-of-the-art MHE model trained\npurely on synthetic data to explore where the model looks when making height\npredictions. Through systematic analyses, we find that the model relies heavily\non shadow cues, a factor that can lead to overestimation or underestimation of\nheights when shadows deviate from expected norms. Furthermore, the inherent\ndifficulty of evaluating regression tasks with the human eye underscores\nadditional limitations of purely synthetic training. To address these issues,\nwe propose a novel correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global\nLiDAR measurements (ICESat-2) with deep-learning outputs to improve local\naccuracy and achieve spatially consistent corrections. Our method comprises two\nstages: pre-processing raw ICESat-2 data, followed by a random forest-based\napproach to densely refine height estimates. Experiments in three\nrepresentative urban regions -- Saint-Omer, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo -- reveal\nsubstantial error reductions, with mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by\n22.8\\%, 6.9\\%, and 4.9\\%, respectively. These findings highlight the critical\nrole of shadow awareness in synthetic data-driven models and demonstrate how\nfusing imperfect real-world LiDAR data can bolster the robustness of MHE,\npaving the way for more reliable and scalable 3D mapping solutions.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the leaderless formation flying problem with collision\navoidance for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which requires the\nUAVs to navigate through cluttered environments without colliding while\nmaintaining the formation. The communication network among the UAVs is\nstructured as a directed graph that includes a directed spanning tree. A novel\ndistributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) method based on the model\nreference adaptive consensus (MRACon) framework is proposed. Within this\nframework, each UAV tracks an assigned reference output generated by a linear\nreference model that utilizes relative measurements as input. Subsequently, the\nNMPC method penalizes the tracking error between the output of the reference\nmodel and that of the actual model while also establishing constraint sets for\ncollision avoidance and physical limitations to achieve distributed and safe\nformation control. Finally, simulations and hardware experiments are conducted\nto verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

However, this approach may exclude beneficial\nshapes and overlook the varying contributions of shapelets to classification\nperformance.

The former transforms shapes\ninto soft representations based on classification contribution scores, merging\nlower-scored ones into a single shape to retain and differentiate all\nsubsequence information. The latter facilitates intra- and inter-shape temporal\npattern learning, improving model efficiency by using sparsified soft shapes as\ninputs. Specifically, we employ a learnable router to activate a subset of\nclass-specific expert networks for intra-shape pattern learning.

Water-side turbulent velocity fields and Eulerian-mean flows\nwere measured with particle image velocimetry before vs after the passage of a\nwave group, and with vs without the presence of regular waves. We compare\ndifferent wavelengths, steepnesses and turbulent intensities. In all cases, a\nsignificant change in the Eulerian-mean current is observed, strongly focused\nnear the surface, where it opposes the Stokes drift. The observations support\nthe picture that when waves encounter ambient sub-surface turbulence, the flow\nundergoes a transition during which Eulerian-mean momentum is redistributed\nvertically (without changing the depth-integrated mass transport) until a new\nequilibrium state is reached, wherein the near-surface ratio between\n$\\mathrm{d}\\overline{u}/\\mathrm{d}z$ and $|\\mathrm{d}u_s/\\mathrm{d} z|$\napproximately equals the ratio between the streamwise and vertical Reynolds\nnormal stresses. This accords with a simple statistical theory derived here and\nholds regardless of the absolute turbulence level, whereas stronger turbulence\nmeans faster growth of the Eulerian-mean current. We present a model based on\nRapid Distortion Theory which describes the generation of the Eulerian-mean\nflow as a consequence of the action of the Stokes drift on the background\nturbulence. Predictions are in qualitative, and reasonable quantitative,\nagreement with experiments on wave groups, where equilibrium has not yet been\nreached.

Understanding the generalized patterns and decoding the neural\nrepresentations that are evoked by the diverse range of natural scene stimuli\nin the mouse visual cortex is one of the key quests in computational vision. In\nrecent years, significant parallels have been drawn between the primate visual\ncortex and hierarchical deep neural networks. However, their generalized\nefficacy in understanding mouse vision has been limited. In this study, we\ninvestigate the functional alignment between the mouse visual cortex and deep\nlearning models for object classification tasks. We first introduce a\ngeneralized representational learning strategy that uncovers a striking\nresemblance between the functional mapping of the mouse visual cortex and\nhigh-performing deep learning models on both top-down (population-level) and\nbottom-up (single cell-level) scenarios. Next, this representational similarity\nacross the two systems is further enhanced by the addition of Neural Response\nNormalization (NeuRN) layer, inspired by the activation profile of excitatory\nand inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex. To test the performance effect of\nNeuRN on real-world tasks, we integrate it into deep learning models and\nobserve significant improvements in their robustness against data shifts in\ndomain generalization tasks.

However, in practice, a problem can be described in various ways,\nincluding with typos, where developers may struggle to understand certain\ndescriptions and seek clarification to find more suitable wording. Such various\ndescriptions may lead to variations in the performance of CLLMs on the same\nquestion, resulting in a biased evaluation when using existing benchmarks. In\nthis paper, we aim to explore these pitfalls with the goal of revisiting and\nenhancing future benchmark designs. To simulate real-world variations in\nproblem descriptions, we propose 10 mutation strategies and introduce three new\nmetrics to evaluate their impact on code generation. We then assess five\npopular CLLMs using 12,834 generated prompt variants, and found a significant\nperformance discrepancy between the results from existing benchmarks and those\nfrom mutated benchmarks containing perturbations and variations. This finding\nunderscores the need for more robust evaluation methods and benchmarks.",

The main presumption is taking the\ndiamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the molar magnetic susceptibility\nof the two parent MOFs to be additive. To verify this, four examples are\nprovided with commonly used MOFs to represent the cases when both parent MOFs\nare either paramagnetic or diamagnetic but with different linkers with the\nfollowing systems:\n[MIL-101(Cr)-SO$_3$H]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[MIL-101(Cr)-NO$_2$]$_{\\delta}$,\n[EuMOF]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[EuPDCA]$_{\\delta}$,\n[UiO-66-COOH]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[UiO-66]$_{\\delta}$ and [MIL-101(Cr) F\nFree]$_{(1-\\delta)}$[MIL-53(Al)]$_{\\delta}$, where 1-$\\delta$ : $\\delta$ are\nthe ratios to be determined.

This periodic shaking connects the\nfree-scattering states to shallow molecular states. At specific frequencies, we\nobserve significant atom loss, which corresponds to the resonant coupling\nbetween these two types of states. This precisely corresponds to a form of\nFeshbach resonance, yet in the frequency domain rather than the magnetic-field\ndomain. Using this method, we can directly scan the energy spectrum of\nmolecular bound states without synthesizing any molecules. In addition to these\nbound states, we can also probe the molecular states embedded in the continuum,\nwhich are typically very difficult to detect by the conventional methods based\non molecular synthesis. Moreover, by using a far-detuned laser instead of a\nmagnetic field coil, it enables spatially dependent control over atomic\ninteractions, coupling multiple levels simultaneously, and inducing new\nFeshbach resonances for those atoms that do not have conventional magnetic\nresonances. Therefore, we believe that this new resonant mechanism offers new\nopportunities for controlling atomic and molecular interactions in quantum\nsimulations.",

Yet,\nfor a magnetized plasma, there are two different polarization paradoxes that\nare finally resolved in this work. The \"diamagnetic polarization paradox''\nrefers to the fact that there is a paradoxical factor of 1/2 difference between\nthe pressure-driven \"diamagnetic polarization'' density calculated using the\nreal space drift theory versus the action-angle space guiding center and\ngyrokinetic theory that has not been explained before. In this work, it is\nshown that the results of both approaches can be made consistent with one\nanother. Half of the diamagnetic polarization is due to the transformation from\nthe guiding center density to the real space density. The other half is due to\nthe fact that, within the drift kinetic ordering assumptions, the guiding\ncenter density should be expressed as the gyroaverage of the density in the\nlimit of vanishing Larmor radius. Expressions for the diamagnetic polarization\ndensity are given that are accurate to first order in amplitude and all orders\nin gyroradius within gyrokinetic theory for a constant magnetic field.\nApplications to anisotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann particle distribution functions\nare presented. Because the total energy and toroidal momentum are local\ninvariants, they do not generate net polarization effects: the electric and\nthermodynamic polarizations must precisely cancel.

    "abstract": "Current robotic planning methods often rely on predicting multi-frame images\nwith full pixel details. While this fine-grained approach can serve as a\ngeneric world model, it introduces two significant challenges for downstream\npolicy learning: substantial computational costs that hinder real-time\ndeployment, and accumulated inaccuracies that can mislead action extraction.\nPlanning with coarse-grained subgoals partially alleviates efficiency issues.\nHowever, their forward planning schemes can still result in off-task\npredictions due to accumulation errors, leading to misalignment with long-term\ngoals. This raises a critical question: Can robotic planning be both efficient\nand accurate enough for real-time control in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks?\nTo address this, we propose a Latent Space Backward Planning scheme (LBP),\nwhich begins by grounding the task into final latent goals, followed by\nrecursively predicting intermediate subgoals closer to the current state. The\ngrounded final goal enables backward subgoal planning to always remain aware of\ntask completion, facilitating on-task prediction along the entire planning\nhorizon. The subgoal-conditioned policy incorporates a learnable token to\nsummarize the subgoal sequences and determines how each subgoal guides action\nextraction. Through extensive simulation and real-robot long-horizon\nexperiments, we show that LBP outperforms existing fine-grained and forward\nplanning methods, achieving SOTA performance.

However, Gaussian processes perform sub-optimally when the degree of\nsmoothness is non-homogeneous across the input domain. Random forest regression\npartially addresses this issue by providing local basis functions of variable\nsupport set sizes that are chosen in a data-driven way. However, they do so at\nthe expense of forgoing any degree of smoothness, which often results in poor\nperformance in the small data regime. Here, we aim to combine the advantages of\nboth models by applying a kernel-based smoothing mechanism to a learned random\nforest or any other piecewise constant prediction function. As we demonstrate\nempirically, the resulting model consistently improves the predictive\nperformance of the underlying random forests and, in almost all test cases,\nalso improves the log loss of the usual uncertainty quantification based on\ninter-tree variance. The latter advantage can be attributed to the ability of\nthe smoothing model to take into account the uncertainty over the exact\ntree-splitting locations.",

To address these\nlimitations, we present PhishXplain (PXP), a real-time explainable phishing\nwarning system designed to augment existing detection mechanisms. PXP empowers\nusers by clearly articulating why a site is flagged as malicious, highlighting\nsuspicious elements using a memory-efficient implementation of LLaMA 3.2. It\nutilizes a structured two-step prompt architecture to identify phishing\nfeatures, generate contextual explanations, and render annotated screenshots\nthat visually reinforce the warning. Longitudinally implementing PhishXplain\nover a month on 7,091 live phishing websites, we found that it can generate\nwarnings for 94% of the sites, with a correctness of 96%. We also evaluated\nPhishXplain through a user study with 150 participants split into two groups:\none received conventional, generic warnings, while the other interacted with\nPXP's explainable alerts. Participants who received the explainable warnings\nnot only demonstrated a significantly better understanding of phishing\nindicators but also achieved higher accuracy in identifying phishing threats,\neven without any warning. Moreover, they reported greater satisfaction and\ntrust in the warnings themselves. These improvements were especially pronounced\namong users with lower initial levels of cybersecurity proficiency and\nawareness. To encourage the adoption of this framework, we release PhishXplain\nas a browser extension.",

    "abstract": "Sliced optimal transport (SOT) or sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance is widely\nrecognized for its statistical and computational scalability. In this work, we\nfurther enhance the computational scalability by proposing the first method for\ncomputing SW from sample streams, called \\emph{streaming sliced Wasserstein}\n(Stream-SW). To define Stream-SW, we first introduce the streaming computation\nof the one-dimensional Wasserstein distance. Since the one-dimensional\nWasserstein (1DW) distance has a closed-form expression, given by the absolute\ndifference between the quantile functions of the compared distributions, we\nleverage quantile approximation techniques for sample streams to define the\nstreaming 1DW distance. By applying streaming 1DW to all projections, we obtain\nStream-SW. The key advantage of Stream-SW is its low memory complexity while\nproviding theoretical guarantees on the approximation error. We demonstrate\nthat Stream-SW achieves a more accurate approximation of SW than random\nsubsampling, with lower memory consumption, in comparing Gaussian distributions\nand mixtures of Gaussians from streaming samples. Additionally, we conduct\nexperiments on point cloud classification, point cloud gradient flows, and\nstreaming change point detection to further highlight the favorable performance\nof Stream-SW.",

    "abstract": "Achieving group-robust generalization in the presence of spurious\ncorrelations remains a significant challenge, particularly when bias\nannotations are unavailable. Recent studies on Class-Conditional Distribution\nBalancing (CCDB) reveal that spurious correlations often stem from mismatches\nbetween the class-conditional and marginal distributions of bias attributes.\nThey achieve promising results by addressing this issue through simple\ndistribution matching in a bias-agnostic manner. However, CCDB approximates\neach distribution using a single Gaussian, which is overly simplistic and\nrarely holds in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we propose\na novel method called Bias Exploration via Overfitting (BEO), which captures\neach distribution in greater detail by modeling it as a mixture of latent\ngroups. Building on these group-level descriptions, we introduce a fine-grained\nvariant of CCDB, termed FG-CCDB, which performs more precise distribution\nmatching and balancing within each group. Through group-level reweighting,\nFG-CCDB learns sample weights from a global perspective, achieving stronger\nmitigation of spurious correlations without incurring substantial storage or\ncomputational costs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BEO serves as a\nstrong proxy for ground-truth bias annotations and can be seamlessly integrated\nwith bias-supervised methods.

Here, we report experimental realization of an unconventional form\nof AHE in a low-dimensional heterostructure, wherein the Hall response is not\nonly proportional to the out-of-plane magnetization component but also to the\nin-plane magnetization component. By interfacing a low-symmetry topological\nsemimetal (TaIrTe4) with the ferromagnetic insulator (Cr2Ge2Te6), we create a\nlow-dimensional magnetic system, where only one mirror symmetry is preserved.\nWe show that as long as the magnetization has a finite component in the mirror\nplane, this last mirror symmetry is broken, allowing the emergence of an AHE\nsignal proportional to in-plane magnetization. Our experiments, conducted on\nmultiple devices, reveal a gate-voltage-dependent AHE response, suggesting that\nthe underlying mechanisms responsible for the Hall effect in our system can be\ntuned via electrostatic gating. A minimal microscopic model constrained by the\nsymmetry of the heterostructure shows that both interfacial spin-orbit coupling\nand time-reversal symmetry breaking via the exchange interaction from\nmagnetization are responsible for the emergence of the in-plane AHE.

However, existing wide LRCs\nstruggle to balance optimal fault tolerance and high availability during\nfrequent system events. By analyzing the existing LRCs, we reveal three\nlimitations in the LRC construction which lay behind the non-optimal overall\nperformance from multiple perspectives, including non-minimum local recovery\ncost, non cluster-topology-aware data distribution, and non XOR-based local\ncoding. Thanks to the flexible design space offered by the locality property of\nwide LRCs, we present UniLRC, which unifies locality considerations in code\nconstruction. UniLRC achieves the optimal fault tolerance while overcoming the\nrevealed limitations.

    "abstract": "Illegal parking along with the lack of available parking spaces are among the\nbiggest issues faced in many large cities. These issues can have a significant\nimpact on the quality of life of citizens. On-street parking systems have been\ndesigned to this end aiming at ensuring that parking spaces will be available\nfor the local population, while also providing easy access to parking for\npeople visiting the city center. However, these systems are often affected by\nillegal parking, providing incorrect information regarding the availability of\nparking spaces. Even though this can be mitigated using sensors for detecting\nthe presence of cars in various parking sectors, the cost of these\nimplementations is usually prohibiting large. In this paper, we investigate an\nindirect way of predicting parking violations at a fine-grained level,\nequipping such parking systems with a valuable tool for providing more accurate\ninformation to citizens. To this end, we employed a Deep Learning (DL)-based\nmodel to predict fine-grained parking violation rates for on-street parking\nsystems. Moreover, we developed a data augmentation and smoothing technique for\nfurther improving the accuracy of DL models under the presence of missing and\nnoisy data. We demonstrate, using experiments on real data collected in\nThessaloniki, Greece, that the developed system can indeed provide accurate\nparking violation predictions.",

We\nconstruct an interpretable neural network framework to characterize the\nsurrounding environment of galaxies and investigate the extent to which their\nproperties are affected by neighboring galaxies in IllustrisTNG300 data\n($z=0$). Our models predict galaxy properties (stellar mass and star formation\nrate) given dark matter subhalo properties of both host subhalo and of\nsurrounding galaxies, which serve as an explainable, flexible galaxy-halo\nconnection model. We find that prediction accuracy peaks when incorporating\nonly the nearest neighboring galaxy for stellar mass prediction, while star\nformation rate prediction benefits from information from up to the\nthird-nearest neighbor. We determine that environmental influence follows a\nclear hierarchical pattern, with the nearest neighbor providing the dominant\ncontribution that diminishes rapidly with additional neighbors. We confirm that\ncentral and satellite galaxies, as well as different galaxy categories based on\nmass and star-forming activity, exhibit distinct environmental dependencies.\nEnvironmental dependence for low-mass galaxies ($\\log(M_*/M_\\odot) < 10$) shows\n35-50% environmental contribution compared to just 8-30% for massive centrals,\nwhile satellite galaxies experience consistently stronger environmental effects\nthan centrals across all populations.

This design effectively balances the reception quality and the\ninference latency by prioritizing the critical semantic information.

These reconstructions are based on the\nharmonious relationship between the Koopman operators and the choice of\ndictionary, determined implicitly by a kernel function. This leads to the\napproximation of the Koopman operators in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS) associated with that kernel function. Data-driven analysis of Koopman\noperators demands that Koopman operators be closable over the underlying RKHS,\nwhich still remains an unsettled, unexplored, and critical operator-theoretic\nchallenge. We aim to address this challenge by investigating the embedding of\nthe Laplacian kernel in the measure-theoretic sense, giving rise to a rich\nenough RKHS to settle the closability of the Koopman operators. We leverage\nKernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with the Laplacian kernel to\nreconstruct the dominant spatial temporal modes of various diverse dynamical\nsystems. After empirical demonstration, we concrete such results by providing\nthe theoretical justification leveraging the closability of the Koopman\noperators on the RKHS generated by the Laplacian kernel on the avenues of\nKoopman mode decomposition and the Koopman spectral measure.

    "abstract": "For domains that involve numerical simulation, it can be computationally\nexpensive to run an ensemble of simulations spanning a parameter space of\ninterest to a user. To this end, an attractive surrogate for simulation is the\ngenerative modeling of fields produced by an ensemble, allowing one to\nsynthesize fields in a computationally cheap, yet accurate, manner. However,\nfor the purposes of visual analysis, a limitation of generative models is their\nlack of control, as it is unclear what one should expect when sampling a field\nfrom a model. In this paper we study how to make generative models of fields\nmore controllable, so that users can specify features of interest, in\nparticular topological features, that they wish to see in the output. We\npropose topology guidance, a method for guiding the sampling process of a\ngenerative model, specifically a diffusion model, such that a topological\ndescription specified as input is satisfied in the generated output. Central to\nour method, we couple a coordinate-based neural network used to represent\nfields, with a diffusion model used for generation. We show how to use\ntopologically-relevant signals provided by the coordinate-based network to help\nguide the denoising process of a diffusion model. This enables us to faithfully\nrepresent a user's specified topology, while ensuring that the output field\nremains within the generative data distribution. Specifically, we study 2D\nvector field topology, evaluating our method over an ensemble of fluid flows,\nwhere we show that generated vector fields faithfully adhere to the location,\nand type, of critical points over the spatial domain. We further show the\nbenefits of our method in aiding the comparison of ensembles, allowing one to\nexplore commonalities and differences in distributions along prescribed\ntopological features.",

This phase\nis characterized by a decrease in the equatorial magnetic field Bz and the\nstretching of magnetic field lines. Observing these large-scale magnetic field\nreconfigurations is challenging with single-point satellite measurements, which\nprovides only spatially-localized snapshots of system dynamics. Conversely,\nlow-altitude spacecraft measurements of energetic electron fluxes, such as\nthose from ELFIN, offer a unique opportunity to remotely sense the equatorial\nmagnetic field in the magnetotail during substorms by measuring the latitudinal\nvariations of energetic electron isotropic fluxes. Because of strong scattering\ncaused by the curvature of magnetic field lines, energetic electrons in the\nmagnetotail are mostly isotropic. Consequently, variations in their fluxes at\nlow altitudes are expected to reflect the reconfiguration of the magnetotail\nmagnetic field. To better understand the connection of electron flux variation\nat low altitudes and magnetic field reconfiguration during substorms, we\ncompared low-altitude ELFIN observations with simulations from the Rice\nConvection Model (RCM). The RCM, which assumes fully isotropic electron\ndistributions, provides a robust framework for describing energetic electron\ndynamics in the plasma sheet and determining the self-consistent magnetic field\nconfiguration during substorms.

    "abstract": "Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining is the cornerstone of histopathology but\nlacks molecular specificity. While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides\nmolecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&E-to-IHC translation\nas a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly\nGAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural\nfidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose\nHistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity\nH&E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy,\nutilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&E\nrepresentations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural\nconsistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise\nschedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition\nat the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the\nmorphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces\ncontrolled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular\nfidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel\npathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular\nrelevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that\nHistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28%\nimprovement in MRA on the H&E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its\neffectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.",

    "abstract": "On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon\ninterconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the\nrequirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network.\nThe mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to\nmeet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE)\napproach underpinning the realization of these unique quantum emitters allows\ncontrol on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these\nepitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the\nMTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon\nsuperradiance, a characteristic of the SESRE-enabled delicate balance between\nthe confinement pontential volume, depth, the resulting exciton binding energy,\nand the degree of confinement of the center of mass (CM) motion of the exciton.\nScanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) studies reveal the structural\n(atomic scale) and chemical (nm scale) nature of the material region defining\nthe notion of the shape and volume (here large) of the electron confinement\nregion (i.e. the QD). In the exciton's weake CM confinement regime, owing to\nits coherent sampling of the large volume, enhancement of the MTSQD oscillator\nstrength to ~30 is demonstrated. Theoretical modelling with input from the STEM\nfinding provide corroboration for single photon superradiance causing\nenhancement of the oscillator strength by ~2.5 to 3. Our findings allow\nfabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by the unique matter\nqubit-light qubit interconversion units that can be realized for lattice\nmatched and mismatched material combinations covering UV to midinfrared\nwavelength range.",

    "abstract": "As hardware design complexity escalates, there is an urgent need for advanced\nautomation in electronic design automation (EDA). Traditional register transfer\nlevel (RTL) design methods are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors.\nWhile commercial (instruction-tuned) large language models (LLMs) shows\npromising performance for automation, they pose security and privacy concerns.\nOpen-source models offer alternatives; however, they frequently fall short in\nquality/correctness, largely due to limited, high-quality RTL code data\nessential for effective training and generalization. This paper proposes RTL++,\na first-of-its-kind LLM-assisted method for RTL code generation that utilizes\ngraph representations of code structures to enhance the quality of generated\ncode. By encoding RTL code into a textualized control flowgraphs (CFG) and data\nflow graphs (DFG), RTL++ captures the inherent hierarchy, dependencies, and\nrelationships within the code. This structured graph-based approach enhances\nthe context available to LLMs, enabling them to better understand and generate\ninstructions. By focusing on data generation through graph representations,\nRTL++ addresses the limitations of previous approaches that rely solely on code\nand suffer from lack of diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that RTL++\noutperforms state-of-the-art models fine-tuned for RTL generation, as evaluated\nusing the VerilogEval benchmark's Pass@1/5/10 metric, as well as the RTLLM1.1\nmodel, which highlight the effectiveness of graph-enhanced context in advancing\nthe capabilities of LLM-assisted RTL code generation.",

In response, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\nintroduced the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) to streamline network\nmonitoring by collecting, analyzing, and providing insights from network data.\nWhile prior research has focused mainly on isolated applications of machine\nlearning within NWDAF, critical aspects such as standardized data collection,\nanalytics integration in closed-loop automation, and end-to-end system\nevaluation have received limited attention. This work addresses existing gaps\nby presenting a practical implementation of NWDAF and its integration with\nleading open-source 5G core network solutions.
