    "abstract": "Quantum image processing (QIMP) has recently emerged as a promising field for\nmodern image processing applications. In QIMP algorithms, encoding classical\nimage informaiton into quantum circuit is important as the first step. However,\nmost of existing encoding methods use gates almost twice the number of pixels\nin an image, and simulating even a modest sized image is computationally\ndemanding. In this work, we propose a quantum image encoding method that\neffectively reduces gates than the number of pixels by a factor at least 4. We\ndemonstrate our method for various 1024 by 1024 high-quality medical images\ncaptured during the Bilateral Axillo-Breast Approach (BABA) robotic\nthyroidectomy surgery. Additionally, two compression techniques are proposed to\nfurther reduce the number of gates as well as pre-processing time with\nnegligible loss of image quality. We suggest our image encoding strategy as a\nvaluable option for large scale medical imaging.",

    "abstract": "AR Scorpii, the so called white dwarf pulsar, contains a rapidly rotating\nmagnetic white dwarf (WD; Pspin = 117.0564 s) interacting with a cool, red\ndwarf (RD) companion in a 3.56 hour orbit. It is a strong radio source with an\ninverted spectral index between 1-200 GHz that is indicative of synchrotron\nemission. This paper presents the first submillimeter observations of AR\nScorpii using the Submillimeter Array, helping to fill a critical gap in the\nspectral energy distribution between 10-600 GHz. The average flux densities at\n220 and 345 GHz are 124 and 86 mJy, respectively. The lower than expected flux\ndensity at 345 GHz suggests a break in the synchrotron emission at about 200\nGHz. A periodogram analysis of the 220 GHz observations shows a modulation with\nan amplitude of ~6% at a period of 58.26 s or at twice the spin frequency of\nthe white dwarf. This modulation is the first direct detection of the WD spin\nperiod at radio frequencies and implies that the synchrotron emission arises\nnear the WD and and not from an interaction with the photosphere of the RD. A\nfit to the spectral energy distribution shows that the synchrotron emission\narises from a small, low density region with a magnetic field of 43 MG at a\ndistance of 0.6 orbital radii from the WD. This result implies that AR Scorpii\ncontains a weakly magnetic WD (~15 MG) and not a strongly magnetic WD (~500 MG)\nas previously asserted.",

The success of recent research\nin person PRe-ID is largely due to effective feature extraction and\nrepresentation, as well as the powerful learning of these features to reliably\ndiscriminate between pedestrian images. To this end, two powerful features,\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Local Maximal Occurrence (LOMO), are\nmodeled on multidimensional data using the proposed method, High-Dimensional\nFeature Fusion (HDFF).

    "abstract": "This is an obituary of Rod Burstall, written in his honour. Rod was a\nprominent computer scientist whose contributions span over forty years. Most of\nhis career was spent at Edinburgh University. He lead the team programming\nFreddy, the first hand-eye assembly robot, with much of his effort being\ndevoted to the development of the POP-2 programming language. He became\ninterested in a mathematical approach to software development: he recognised\nthe central role of structural induction; his work on reasoning about mutable\ndata structures was an influential precursor of separation logic; he was the\nfirst to point out the connection between program proof and modal logic; and he\nwas responsible for the idea that stores are mappings from locations to their\ncontents.\n  As part of his quest for correctness of programs, Rod, with John Darlington,\nundertook the first major work on program transformation. His interest in novel\nprogramming languages continued with the experimental language HOPE, developed\nwith Don Sannella and David MacQueen. Robin Milner's Standard ML and its\nrelatives integrated ideas from Hope, and Rod was an active member of the\nStandard ML design team. Rod pioneered the use of algebraic and categorical\ntechniques in programming. He and Joseph Goguen proposed the first algebraic\nspecification language. Rod was an early user of categorical ideas, in\nparticular developing computational category theory with David Rydeheard.\n  The interplay between programming and correctness proofs is again evident in\nRod's contributions to automated proof support systems. For example, he led\nRandy Pollack, Zhaohui Luo, and others in the Lego proof assistant, which\nimplemented type systems supporting interactive proof development. Finally,\nRod, with James McKinna, investigated notions of programs packaged with proofs\nof their correctness, anticipating the topic of proof-carrying code.",

These attacks pose serious threats of\nenergy depletion and latency degradation in systems where limited battery\ncapacity and real-time responsiveness are critical for reliable operation. This\npaper makes two key contributions. First, we present the first systematic\nexploration of energy-latency sponge attacks targeting sensing-based AI models.\nUsing wearable sensing-based AI as a case study, we demonstrate that sponge\nattacks can substantially degrade performance by increasing energy consumption,\nleading to faster battery drain, and by prolonging inference latency. Second,\nto mitigate such attacks, we investigate model pruning, a widely adopted\ncompression technique for resource-constrained AI, as a potential defense. Our\nexperiments show that pruning-induced sparsity significantly improves model\nresilience against sponge poisoning.

    "abstract": "Elastic waves that propagate in polycrystalline materials attenuate due to\nscattering of energy out of the primary propagation direction in addition to\nbecoming dispersive in their group and phase velocities. Attenuation and\ndispersion are modeled through multiple scattering theory to describe the mean\ndisplacement field or the mean elastodynamic Green's function. The Green's\nfunction is governed by the Dyson equation and was solved previously (Weaver,\n1990) by truncating the multiple scattering series at first-order, which is\nknown as the first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA). FOSA allows for\nmultiple scattering but places a restriction on the scattering events such that\na scatterer can only be visited once during a particular multiple scattering\nprocess. In other words, recurrent scattering between two scatterers is not\npermitted. In this article, the Dyson equation is solved using the second-order\nsmoothing approximation (SOSA). The SOSA permits scatterers to be visited twice\nduring the multiple scattering process and, thus, provides a more complete\npicture of the multiple scattering effects on elastic waves. The derivation is\nvalid at all frequencies spanning the Rayleigh, stochastic, and geometric\nscattering regimes without additional approximations that limit applicability\nin strongly scattering cases (like the Born approximation). The importance of\nSOSA is exemplified through analyzing specific weak and strongly scattering\npolycrystals. Multiple scattering effects contained in SOSA are shown to be\nimportant at the beginning of the stochastic scattering regime and are\nparticularly important for transverse (shear) waves. This step forward opens\nthe door for a deeper fundamental understanding of multiple scattering\nphenomena in polycrystalline materials.",

This asymmetry has spurred interest in semi-supervised\n(SS) learning, but most existing approaches rely on strong assumptions -- such\nas missing completely at random (MCAR) labeling or strict positivity -- that\nput substantial limitations on their practical usefulness. In this work, we\nintroduce a general semiparametric framework for estimation and inference in SS\nsettings where labels are missing at random (MAR) and the overlap may vanish as\nsample size increases. Our framework accommodates a wide range of smooth\nstatistical targets -- including means, linear coefficients, quantiles, and\ncausal effects -- and remains valid under high-dimensional nuisance estimation\nand distributional shift between labeled and unlabeled samples. We construct\nestimators that are doubly robust and asymptotically normal by deriving\ninfluence functions under this decaying MAR-SS regime. A key insight is that\nclassical root-$n$ convergence fails under vanishing overlap; we instead\nprovide corrected asymptotic rates that capture the impact of the decay in\noverlap. We validate our theory through simulations and demonstrate practical\nutility in real-world applications on the internet of things and breast cancer\nwhere labeled data are scarce.",

    "abstract": "Modern recommendation systems aim to increase click-through rates (CTR) for\nbetter user experience, through commonly treating ranking as a classification\ntask focused on predicting CTR. However, there is a gap between this method and\nthe actual objectives of businesses across different sectors. In video\nrecommendation services, the objective of video on demand (VOD) extends beyond\nmerely encouraging clicks, but also guiding users to discover their true\ninterests, leading to increased watch time. And longer users watch time will\nleads to more revenue through increased chances of presenting online display\nadvertisements. This research addresses the issue by redefining the problem\nfrom classification to regression, with a focus on maximizing revenue through\nuser viewing time. Due to the lack of positive labels on recommendation, the\nstudy introduces Tweedie Loss Function, which is better suited in this scenario\nthan the traditional mean square error loss. The paper also provides insights\non how Tweedie process capture users diverse interests. Our offline simulation\nand online A/B test revealed that we can substantially enhance our core\nbusiness objectives: user engagement in terms of viewing time and,\nconsequently, revenue. Additionally, we provide a theoretical comparison\nbetween the Tweedie Loss and the commonly employed viewing time weighted\nLogloss, highlighting why Tweedie Regression stands out as an efficient\nsolution. We further outline a framework for designing a loss function that\nfocuses on a singular objective.",

Although this transition is completely forbidden by\nselection rules, state mixing from the hyperfine interaction in 87Sr provides a\nweakly allowed transition that can be coherently driven with practical clock\nlaser intensities. While the coherent interrogation times of optical clocks are\ntypically set by the linewidth of the probe laser, this limitation can be\novercome in synchronous differential comparisons between ensembles. In such\nmeasurements the natural lifetime of the 1S0-3P0 clock transition becomes the\nfundamental limiting factor to the duration of a single run of the experiment.\nHowever, a direct measurement of the decay rate of the clock excited state is\nquite challenging due to the competing effects of other loss channels such as\nRaman scattering, inelastic collisions and atom-loss due to background gas. In\nthis work, we monitor the decay of Sr atoms trapped in an optical lattice and\ninitialized in the 3P0 state. By making measurements of high and low density\nensembles of both 87Sr and 88Sr across varying lattice trap depths, we isolate\nradiative decay, which accounts for a significant fraction of the observed\ndecays at low depths. We obtain a natural radiative decay lifetime of\n167(+79/-40) s for the 3P0 clock state in 87Sr, a value that is consistent with\npreviously reported measurements and theoretical predictions.

Synchronous differential clock comparisons have\nnow demonstrated atomic coherence times on optical transitions that far exceed\nthe coherence time of the clock laser. In optical lattice and tweezer clocks\nthe atom coherence times are then primarily limited by errors induced by Raman\nscattering from the trapping light, as well as radiative decay due to the\nfinite lifetime of the excited clock state, broadening and loss from two-body\ncollisions, and loss due to heating.

    "abstract": "It is known that ion-irradiation can lead surfaces to spontaneously develop\npatterns with characteristic length scales on the order of only a few\nnanometers. Pattern formation typically occurs only for irradiation angles\nbeyond a critical angle, which varies with projectile, target, and irradiation\nenergy. To date, there is no completely unifying physical theory. However,\nsince predictions of the critical angle can be extracted from linear stability\nanalysis of a given model, the ability to explain critical angle selection is a\nsimple but important test of model validity. In this paper, we survey all\nexisting critical angle, wavelength, and in-plane stress data for noble gas\nbroad beam ion-irradiation of silicon and germanium by argon, krypton and xenon\nat energies from 250eV to 2keV. While neglecting the effects of erosion and\nredistribution, which are widely regarded as key contributors to ion-induced\npattern formation, we find that a viscous flow model is capable of explaining\nthese three types of experimental data simultaneously using only parameters\nwithin a physically-reasonable range, and in a manner consistent with the\ndefect kinetics of the amorphous layer. This bolsters the case for viscous flow\nand stress-driven instabilities as important components of an eventual,\nunifying model of nanoscale pattern formation under ion bombardment.",

    "abstract": "This theoretical and numerical study investigates the impact of electrostatic\nstresses on the shape of charged water structures (grains) in weakly ionized\nplasmas. We developed an analytic model to predict the conditions under which a\ngrain in a plasma is deformed. We find that electrostatic stresses can overcome\nthe opposing surface tension stresses on nanometer-scale grains, causing\ninitially spherical clusters to elongate and become ellipsoidal. The exact size\nlimit of the grain for which electrostatic stress will dominate depends on the\nfloating potential, surface tension, and local radius of curvature. Clusters\nlarger than this limit are not affected by electrostatic stresses due to an\ninsufficient number of electrons on the surface. The model is compared to\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) simulations performed with a calculated solvated\nelectron potential on initially spherical grains of 2.5 nm radius charged with\n0.5 to 1% electrons. We find excellent agreement between MD simulations and the\nanalytic theory. We also carried out Quantum Mechanics (QM) computations\nshowing that the surface tension increases with decreasing size of the water\nmolecule cluster and increases even more with the addition of solvated\nelectrons. This increase in surface tension can hinder the elongation of the\ngrains. Our QM computations also show that on the nanosecond time scale, the\nbinding force of electrons to water molecule clusters is stronger than the\nelectrostatic repulsion between adjacent electrons, and thus the cluster\nbehaves as an insulator. However, consideration of the very small conductivity\nof ice shows that on time scales of a fraction of a second, ice clusters behave\nas conductors, so their surface may be considered to be at an equipotential.",

During SDC, the number of spiral waves fluctuates and\neventually drops to zero, marking the termination of activity. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that varying a single parameter allows the system to transition\nfrom SDC to a single spiral wave, passing through an intermediate regime of\nintermittency. In this intermittent dynamics, intervals of SDC are sandwiched\nbetween non-SDC intervals during which the number of spiral waves remains small\nand constant. We quantify this intermittency and show that the mean termination\ntime increases significantly as the control parameter approaches values for\nwhich a single spiral wave is stable. In addition, we find that it is also\npossible to have intermittently present quasi-stable spiral waves in part of\nthe computational domain while the remainder of the domain exhibits SDC.

Energy and\nmomentum transport from large-scale fields and flows to small scale motions of\nplasma particles is ubiquitous in these systems, but a full picture of the\nunderlying physical mechanisms remains elusive. The transfer is often mediated\nby a turbulent cascade of Alfv{\\'e}nic fluctuations as well as a variety of\nkinetic instabilities; these processes tend to be multi-scale and/or\nmulti-dimensional, which makes them difficult to study using spacecraft\nmissions and numerical simulations alone (Dorfman et al. 2023; Lichko et al.\n2020, 2023). Meanwhile, existing laboratory devices struggle to produce the\ncollisionless, high ion beta ($\\beta_i \\gtrsim 1$), magnetized plasmas across\nthe range of scales necessary to address these problems. As envisioned in\nrecent community planning documents (Carter et al. 2020; Milchberg and Scime\n2020; Baalrud et al. 2020; Dorfman et al. 2023; National Academies of Sciences,\nEngineering, and Medicine 2024, it is therefore important to build a next\ngeneration laboratory facility to create a $\\beta_i \\gtrsim 1$, collisionless,\nmagnetized plasma in the laboratory for the first time. A Working Group has\nbeen formed and is actively defining the necessary technical requirements to\nmove the facility towards a construction-ready state. Recent progress includes\nthe development of target parameters and diagnostic requirements as well as the\nidentification of a need for source-target device geometry. As the working\ngroup is already leading to new synergies across the community, we anticipate a\nbroad community of users funded by a variety of federal agencies (including\nNASA, DOE, and NSF) to make copious use of the future facility.",

Using the training\nsection of the ScienceQA dataset, we then construct a data set of pairwise\ncomparisons between the outputs of strong and weak tutors. This enables us to\napply multiple preference optimization methods to fine-tune an underperforming\ntutor model (Qwen2-VL-2B) into more effective ones. Our results also show that\nstrong problem-solving skills do not guarantee high-quality tutoring and that\nperformance optimization-guided refinements can yield more educationally\naligned tutor models. This approach opens avenues for building MLLMs that serve\nnot only as problem solvers, but as genuinely helpful educational assistants.",

We aimed to\ntest an unstructured speech sample for the feasibility of yielding a machine\nlearning (ML) model to predict PND. We surveyed 446 women nationwide at 22\nweeks of gestation.

A standardized cleaning pipeline was applied to the audio files,\nincluding a uniform format conversion, segment filtering for background noise,\nextraneous acoustic events, and file size. This resulted in 112 high-quality\nvoice recordings, i.e., a rate of 25%. The ML modeling strategy utilized the\nAllie ML framework on 80% of the data for training on the binary classification\ntask (depressed or not).

In\ntypical applications, the battery resistance is obtained through an approximate\nmethod computed as the ratio of the voltage difference to the applied current\nexcitation pulse or vice versa for admittance. When estimating the battery\nresistance, this approach ignores the change in the open circuit voltage (OCV)\nas a result of the excitation signal. In this paper, we formally demonstrate\nand quantify the effect of the OCV drop on the errors in internal resistance\nestimation. Then, we propose a novel method to accurately estimate the internal\nresistance by accounting for the change in OCV caused by the applied current\nexcitation signal. The proposed approach is based on a novel observation model\nthat allows one to estimate the effect of OCV without requiring any additional\ninformation, such as the state of charge (SOC), parameters of the OCV-SOC\ncurve, and the battery capacity. As such, the proposed approach is independent\nof the battery chemistry, size, age, and the ambient temperature. A performance\nanalysis of the proposed approach using the battery simulator shows significant\nperformance gain in the range of 30% to more than 250% in percentage estimation\nerror.

It is based on a variational quantum circuit\nthat can be interpreted as a discretization of the annealing process that\nquantum annealers follow to find a minimum energy state of a given Hamiltonian.\nThis ensures that QAOA must find an optimal solution for any given optimization\nproblem when the number of layers, $p$, used in the variational quantum circuit\ntends to infinity. In practice, the number of layers is usually bounded by a\nsmall number. This is a must in current quantum computers of the NISQ era, due\nto the depth limit of the circuits they can run to avoid problems with\ndecoherence and noise. In this paper, we show mathematical evidence that QAOA\nrequires exponential time to solve linear functions when the number of layers\nis less than the number of different coefficients of the linear function $n$.\nWe conjecture that QAOA needs exponential time to find the global optimum of\nlinear functions for any constant value of $p$, and that the runtime is linear\nonly if $p \\geq n$. We conclude that we need new quantum algorithms to reach\nquantum supremacy in quantum optimization.",

    "abstract": "We present the public release of EXP, a basis function expansion C++ library\nand Python package for running N-body galactic simulations and dynamical\ndiscovery. EXP grew out of the need for methodology that seamlessly connects\ntheoretical descriptions of dynamics, N-body simulations, and compact\ndescriptions of observed data. EXP decomposes a galaxy into multiple bases for\na variety of scales and geometries and is thus able to represent arbitrarily\ncomplex simulations with many components (e.g., disk, bulge, dark matter halo,\nsatellites). pyEXP provides a full Python interface to the EXP C++ libraries.\nExample workflows based on previously published work are available and\ndistributed as accompanying examples and tutorials. The examples and tutorials\nflatten the learning curve for adopting basis function expansion tools to\ngenerate and analyze the significance of coefficients and discover dynamical\nrelationships using time series analysis. The current release uses a powerful,\nnon-parametric technique for time series analysis that decomposes basis\nfunction expansion coefficients into interpretable components without assuming\na specific model structure. This enables the automated discovery of dynamical\nsignals from simulations. We provide a full online manual hosted by Read the\nDocs.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous landing is essential for drones deployed in emergency deliveries,\npost-disaster response, and other large-scale missions. By enabling\nself-docking on charging platforms, it facilitates continuous operation and\nsignificantly extends mission endurance. However, traditional approaches often\nfall short in dynamic, unstructured environments due to limited semantic\nawareness and reliance on fixed, context-insensitive safety margins. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates large language\nmodel (LLMs) with model predictive control (MPC). Our approach begins with a\nvision-language encoder (VLE) (e.g., BLIP), which transforms real-time images\ninto concise textual scene descriptions. These descriptions are processed by a\nlightweight LLM (e.g., Qwen 2.5 1.5B or LLaMA 3.2 1B) equipped with\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to classify scene elements and infer\ncontext-aware safety buffers, such as 3 meters for pedestrians and 5 meters for\nvehicles. The resulting semantic flags and unsafe regions are then fed into an\nMPC module, enabling real-time trajectory replanning that avoids collisions\nwhile maintaining high landing precision. We validate our framework in the\nROS-Gazebo simulator, where it consistently outperforms conventional\nvision-based MPC baselines. Our results show a significant reduction in\nnear-miss incidents with dynamic obstacles, while preserving accurate landings\nin cluttered environments.",

In the high-field polarized phase above a critical field\n$B_{C}$ we observe sharp magnons, as expected in the case of no exchange\ndisorder. Through simultaneous fits to the dispersions including data in\npolarizing field along the Ising axis, we obtain an excellent match to an\nIsing-like XXZ Hamiltonian and rule out previously proposed Kitaev exchanges.\nIn the intermediate-field phase below $B_{C}$, we observe three dispersive\nmodes, out of which only the lowest energy one is sharp and the others are\nbroad and overlap with continuum scattering. We propose that the broadening\neffects are due to magnon decays into two-magnon excitations and confirm that\nsuch processes are kinematically allowed. The continuum scattering becomes\nprogressively stronger upon lowering field and, at 0.25 T and zero field, it\ndominates the complete spectrum with no clear evidence for even broadened\nmagnon modes. We discuss the relevance of the continuous manifold of mean-field\ndegenerate ground states of the refined Hamiltonian for capturing the observed\nspectrum in zero field, and compare the data with the one- and two-magnon\nspectrum averaged over this manifold. We also propose a model of the interlayer\ncouplings to explain the observed finite interlayer magnetic propagation vector\nof the zero-field magnetic order; this requires the breaking of the mirror\nsymmetry in the nominal P-3m1 space group and through refinement of x-ray\ndiffraction data on an untwinned single crystal, we indeed confirm a rotation\nof the CoO6 octahedra around the c-axis, which lowers the symmetry to P-3.",

    "abstract": "Sweeping jets are increasingly employed in thermal management and flow\ncontrol applications due to their inherent unsteadiness and ability to cover\nwide surface areas. This study investigates the unsteady heat transfer and flow\nstructures of an impinging sweeping jet, with particular emphasis on the\ninfluence of Reynolds number (Re) and nozzle-to-plate spacing (L/D). A combined\ndiagnostic approach, utilising non-synchronous high-speed infrared thermography\nand planar particle image velocimetry, independently measures wall heat flux\ndistributions and flow field dynamics. Time-averaged Nusselt number maps reveal\na progressive widening of the thermal footprint as the nozzle-to-plate distance\nincreases, accompanied by a reduction in peak heat transfer intensity. In\ncontrast, the fluctuating component exhibits a double-lobe structure that\nbecomes more pronounced at higher Re. Velocity measurements confirm the\npresence of a bifurcated jet core and shear-driven unsteadiness, with\nfluctuating velocity components and Reynolds shear stress spatially correlated\nwith zones of enhanced heat transfer fluctuations. A direct spatial comparison\nbetween velocity and heat transfer fluctuations demonstrates that wall-normal\nvelocity unsteadiness dominates the thermal response at low nozzle-to-plate\ndistances, while streamwise fluctuations become increasingly significant at\nlarger spacings. Finally, the full-field heat transfer data are embedded into a\nreduced-order parametric space, where the complex system behaviour is\neffectively represented by a low-dimensional manifold governed by Re and L/D.\nThis manifold is used to perform an efficient surrogate model capable of\npredicting both mean and fluctuating Nusselt number maps for untested\ncombinations of Re and L/D within the parametric space, serving as a tool for\nthe preliminary sizing and design of heat transfer enhancement devices.",

    "abstract": "Financial sentiment analysis (FSA) presents unique challenges to LLMs that\nsurpass those in typical sentiment analysis due to the nuanced language used in\nfinancial contexts. The prowess of these models is often undermined by the\ninherent subjectivity of sentiment classifications in existing benchmark\ndatasets like Financial Phrasebank. These datasets typically feature undefined\nsentiment classes that reflect the highly individualized perspectives of\nannotators, leading to significant variability in annotations. This variability\nresults in an unfair expectation for LLMs during benchmarking, where they are\ntasked to conjecture the subjective viewpoints of human annotators without\nsufficient context. In this paper, we introduce the Annotators' Instruction\nAssisted Prompt, a novel evaluation prompt designed to redefine the task\ndefinition of FSA for LLMs. By integrating detailed task instructions\noriginally intended for human annotators into the LLMs' prompt framework, AIAP\naims to standardize the understanding of sentiment across both human and\nmachine interpretations, providing a fair and context-rich foundation for\nsentiment analysis. We utilize a new dataset, WSBS, derived from the\nWallStreetBets subreddit to demonstrate how AIAP significantly enhances LLM\nperformance by aligning machine operations with the refined task definitions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that AIAP enhances LLM performance\nsignificantly, with improvements up to 9.08. This context-aware approach not\nonly yields incremental gains in performance but also introduces an innovative\nsentiment-indexing method utilizing model confidence scores. This method\nenhances stock price prediction models and extracts more value from the\nfinancial sentiment analysis, underscoring the significance of WSB as a\ncritical source of financial text.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in super-resolution for License Plate Recognition (LPR)\nhave sought to address challenges posed by low-resolution (LR) and degraded\nimages in surveillance, traffic monitoring, and forensic applications. However,\nexisting studies have relied on private datasets and simplistic degradation\nmodels. To address this gap, we introduce UFPR-SR-Plates, a novel dataset\ncontaining 10,000 tracks with 100,000 paired low and high-resolution license\nplate images captured under real-world conditions. We establish a benchmark\nusing multiple sequential LR and high-resolution (HR) images per vehicle --\nfive of each -- and two state-of-the-art models for super-resolution of license\nplates. We also investigate three fusion strategies to evaluate how combining\npredictions from a leading Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model for\nmultiple super-resolved license plates enhances overall performance. Our\nfindings demonstrate that super-resolution significantly boosts LPR\nperformance, with further improvements observed when applying majority\nvote-based fusion techniques. Specifically, the Layout-Aware and\nCharacter-Driven Network (LCDNet) model combined with the Majority Vote by\nCharacter Position (MVCP) strategy led to the highest recognition rates,\nincreasing from 1.7% with low-resolution images to 31.1% with super-resolution,\nand up to 44.7% when combining OCR outputs from five super-resolved images.\nThese findings underscore the critical role of super-resolution and temporal\ninformation in enhancing LPR accuracy under real-world, adverse conditions.

In this paper, we present a novel\nmethod that leverages causal dynamics to achieve effective fMRI-based subject\nand task fingerprinting. Methods: By applying an implicit-explicit\ndiscretization scheme, we develop a two-timescale linear state-space model.\nThrough data-driven identification of its parameters, the model captures causal\nsignatures, including directed interactions among brain regions from a spatial\nperspective, and disentangled fast and slow dynamic modes of brain activity\nfrom a temporal perspective. These causal signatures are then integrated with:\n(i) a modal decomposition and projection method for model-based subject\nidentification, and (ii) a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for\nlearning-based task classification. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of\nthe brain reachability landscape as a novel visualization tool, which\nquantitatively characterizes the maximum possible activation levels of brain\nregions under various fMRI tasks. Results: We evaluate the proposed approach\nusing the Human Connectome Project dataset and demonstrate its advantage over\nnon-causality-based methods. The obtained causal signatures are visualized and\ndemonstrate clear biological relevance with established understandings of brain\nfunction. Conclusion: We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of\nutilizing brain causal signatures for subject and task fingerprinting.\nAdditionally, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints\nwith potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative\ndiseases.",

    "abstract": "The strategic selection of resources by selfish agents has long been a key\narea of research, with Resource Selection Games and Congestion Games serving as\nprominent examples. In these traditional frameworks, agents choose from a set\nof resources, and their utility depends solely on the number of other agents\nutilizing the same respective resource, treating all agents as\nindistinguishable or anonymous. Only recently, the study of the Resource\nSelection Game with heterogeneous agents has begun, meaning agents have a type\nand the fraction of agents of their type at their resource is the basis of\ntheir decision-making. In this work, we initiate the study of the Resource\nSelection Game with heterogeneous agents in combination with single-peaked\nutility functions, as some research suggests that this may represent human\ndecision-making in certain cases. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the\ngame's stability within this framework. We provide tight bounds that specify\nfor which peak values equilibria exist across different dynamics on cycles and\nbinary trees. On arbitrary graphs, in a setting where agents lack information\nabout the selection of other agents, we provide tight bounds for the existence\nof equilibria, given that the utility function is linear on both sides of the\npeak. Agents possessing this information on arbitrary graphs creates the sole\ncase where our bounds are not tight, instead, we narrow down the cases in which\nthe game may admit equilibria and present how several conventional approaches\nfall short in proving stability.",

This dataset included structured interviews in which adolescents\ndiscussed a common emotion-inducing topic. To model conceptual associations\nwithin these interviews, we applied textual forma mentis networks (TFMNs)-a\ncognitive/AI approach integrating syntactic, semantic, and emotional word-word\nassociations in language. From TFMNs, we extracted network features\n(semantic/syntactic structure) and emotional profiles to serve as predictors of\nlatent psychopathology factor scores. Using Random Forest and XGBoost\nregression models, we found significant associations between language-derived\nfeatures and clinical scores: social maladjustment (r = 0.37, p < .01),\nspecific internalizing behaviors (r = 0.33, p < .05), and neurodevelopmental\nrisk (r = 0.34, p < .05). Explainable AI analysis using SHAP values revealed\nthat higher modularity and a pronounced core-periphery network\nstructure-reflecting clustered conceptual organization in language-predicted\nincreased social maladjustment. Internalizing scores were positively associated\nwith higher betweenness centrality and stronger expressions of disgust,\nsuggesting a linguistic signature of rumination.

In such systems, analog information obtained from\nthe syndrome measurements of an inner bosonic code is used to inform decoding\nfor an outer code layer consisting of a discrete-variable stabilizer code such\nas a surface code. The use of Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) codes as\nan outer code is of particular interest due to the significantly higher\nencoding rates offered by these code families, leading to a further reduction\nin overhead for large-scale quantum computing. Recent works have investigated\nthe performance of QLDPC-GKP codes in detail, and the use of analog information\nfrom the inner code significantly boosts decoder performance. However, the\nnoise models assumed in these works are typically limited to depolarizing or\nphenomenological noise. In this paper, we investigate the performance of\nQLDPC-GKP concatenated codes under circuit-level noise, based on a model\nintroduced by Noh et al. in the context of the surface-GKP code. To demonstrate\nthe performance boost from analog information, we investigate three scenarios:\n(a) decoding without soft information, (b) decoding with precomputed error\nprobabilities but without real-time soft information, and (c) decoding with\nreal-time soft information obtained from round-to-round decoding of the inner\nGKP code. Results show minimal improvement between (a) and (b), but a\nsignificant boost in (c), indicating that real-time soft information is\ncritical for concatenated decoding under circuit-level noise.

We focus on the canonical rolling-window mean-variance\nportfolio rule. Our contributions are identifying the bias mechanism, and\nproviding a practical heuristic for gauging bias severity.

Using simulations to\nconfirm these findings, it is revealed that the resulting Sharpe Ratio bias is\noften a fraction of a typical backtest's estimation noise, benefiting from\npartial offsetting of component biases. Empirical analysis further illustrates\nthat differences between IID-resampled and standard backtests align\nqualitatively with these drivers.

    "abstract": "Ensuring data ownership and traceability of unauthorised redistribution are\ncentral to safeguarding intellectual property in shared data environments. Data\nfingerprinting addresses these challenges by embedding recipient-specific marks\ninto the data, typically via content modifications. We propose NCorr-FP, a\nNeighbourhood-based Correlation-preserving Fingerprinting system for structured\ntabular data with the main goal of preserving statistical fidelity. The method\nuses local record similarity and density estimation to guide the insertion of\nfingerprint bits. The embedding logic is then reversed to extract the\nfingerprint from a potentially modified dataset. Extensive experiments confirm\nits effectiveness, fidelity, utility and robustness. Results show that\nfingerprints are virtually imperceptible, with minute Hellinger distances and\nKL divergences, even at high embedding ratios. The system also maintains high\ndata utility for downstream predictive tasks. The method achieves 100\\%\ndetection confidence under substantial data deletions and remains robust\nagainst adaptive and collusion attacks. Satisfying all these requirements\nconcurrently on mixed-type datasets highlights the strong applicability of\nNCorr-FP to real-world data settings.",

We analyze the distribution of topological\ncharges of these defects and their evolution as a function of the container\ngeometry. In particular, we find that in the circular cavity, both the number\nand charge of defects remain constant in the steady-state regime, with only\ndefects of charge $+1$ being excited. In contrast, within the square cavity,\nwith the same topology as the circular cavity, some defects become pinned to\nthe corners of the cavity, developing charges of $+1$ or $+2$. Additionally,\nfree defects with charges of $\\pm 1$ can be excited. Notably, dynamic events\noccur, such as the fusion of two defects or the creation of two defects from a\nsingle one. These events are governed by the conservation of total charge\nwithin the cavity and give rise to various system configurations, with rapid\ntransitions between them.

Utilizing a network\nof six strategically placed LoRaWAN end devices (EDs) and a single indoor\ngateway (GW) at the University of Siegen, City of Siegen, Germany, we\nsystematically measured signal strength indicators such as the Received Signal\nStrength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) under various\nenvironmental conditions, including temperature, relative humidity, carbon\ndioxide (CO$_2$) concentration, barometric pressure, and particulate matter\nlevels (PM$_{2.5}$). Our empirical analysis confirms that transient phenomena\nsuch as reflections, scattering, interference, occupancy patterns (induced by\nenvironmental parameter variations), and furniture rearrangements can alter\nsignal attenuation by as much as 10.58 dB, highlighting the dynamic nature of\nindoor propagation. As an example of how this dataset can be utilized, we\ntested and evaluated a refined Log-Distance Path Loss and Shadowing Model that\nintegrates both structural obstructions (Multiple Walls) and Environmental\nParameters (LDPLSM-MW-EP). Compared to a baseline model that considers only\nMultiple Walls (LDPLSM-MW), the enhanced approach reduced the root mean square\nerror (RMSE) from 10.58 dB to 8.04 dB and increased the coefficient of\ndetermination (R$^2$) from 0.6917 to 0.8222. By capturing the extra effects of\nenvironmental conditions and occupancy dynamics, this improved model provides\nvaluable insights for optimizing power usage and prolonging device battery\nlife, enhancing network reliability in indoor Internet of Things (IoT)\ndeployments, among other applications.

    "abstract": "Ultrastrong light-matter coupling has traditionally been studied in optical\ncavities, where it occurs when the light-matter coupling strength reaches a\nsignificant fraction of the transition frequency. This regime fundamentally\nalters the ground and excited states of the particle-cavity system, unlocking\nnew ways to control its physics and chemistry. However, achieving ultrastrong\ncoupling in engineered cavities remains a major challenge. Here, we show that\nultra- and deep-strong coupling naturally occur in bulk materials without the\nneed for external cavities. By analyzing experimental data from over 70\nmaterials, we demonstrate that phonon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaritons in\nmany solids exhibit ultrastrong coupling, systematically surpassing the\ncoupling strengths achieved in cavity-based systems. To explain this\nphenomenon, we introduce a dipole lattice model based on a generalized Hopfield\nHamiltonian, which unifies photon-matter, matter-matter, and photon-photon\ninteractions. The complete overlap between the photonic and collective dipole\nmodes in the lattice enables ultrastrong coupling, leading to excited-state\nmixing, radiative decay suppression, and potential phase transitions into\ncollective ground states. Applying our model to real materials, we show that it\nreproduces light-matter coupling across broad material classes and may underlie\nstructural phase transitions that give rise to emergent phenomena such as\nferroelectricity, insulator-to-metal transitions, and exciton condensation.\nRecognizing ultrastrong coupling as an intrinsic property of solids reshapes\nour understanding of light-matter interactions and opens new avenues for\nexploring quantum materials and exotic phases of matter.",

    "abstract": "Causal machine learning (CML) enables individualized estimation of treatment\neffects, offering critical advantages over traditional correlation-based\nmethods. However, existing approaches for medical survival data with censoring\nsuch as causal survival forests estimate effects at fixed time points, limiting\ntheir ability to capture dynamic changes over time. We introduce Causal\nAnalysis for Survival Trajectories (CAST), a novel framework that models\ntreatment effects as continuous functions of time following treatment. By\ncombining parametric and non-parametric methods, CAST overcomes the limitations\nof discrete time-point analysis to estimate continuous effect trajectories.\nUsing the RADCURE dataset [1] of 2,651 patients with head and neck squamous\ncell carcinoma (HNSCC) as a clinically relevant example, CAST models how\nchemotherapy and radiotherapy effects evolve over time at the population and\nindividual levels. By capturing the temporal dynamics of treatment response,\nCAST reveals how treatment effects rise, peak, and decline over the follow-up\nperiod, helping clinicians determine when and for whom treatment benefits are\nmaximized. This framework advances the application of CML to personalized care\nin HNSCC and other life-threatening medical conditions. Source code/data\navailable at: https://github.com/CAST-FW/HNSCC",

We put this result into a much wider context of graded\nstructures on supermanifolds and describe explicitly several canonical\nequivalences of the corresponding categories in a purely geometrical and\nconstructive way; the desuperization equivalence functor is a composition of\nsome of them. Our constructions are completely canonical, we use such tools of\nsupergeometry as the iterated tangent functor, the parity reversion in vector\nsuperbundles, and the modern view of $n$-tuple vector bundles as a sequence of\ncommuting Euler vector fields of the vector bundle structures in question.

There has been only limited\nresearch on their diversity and stealth in analog designs, where a Trojan is\nactivated only during a narrow input voltage range. Effective defense\ntechniques require a clear understanding of the attack vectors; however, the\nlack of diverse analog Trojan instances limits robust advances in detection\nstrategies. To address this gap, we present LATENT, the first large language\nmodel (LLM)-driven framework for crafting stealthy, circuit-specific analog\nTrojans. LATENT incorporates LLM as an autonomous agent to intelligently insert\nand refine Trojan components within analog designs based on iterative feedback\nfrom a detection model. This feedback loop ensures that the inserted Trojans\nremain stealthy while successfully evading detection. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our generated Trojan designs exhibit an average\nTrojan-activation range of 15.74%, ensuring they remain inactive under most\noperating voltages, while causing a significant performance degradation of\n11.3% upon activation.",

This paper identifies preference\ndiscriminability, which quantifies how easily a human can judge which\ntrajectory is closer to their ideal behavior, as a key metric for improving\nquery efficiency. To address this, we move beyond comparisons within a single\npolicy and instead generate queries by comparing trajectories from multiple\npolicies, as training them from scratch promotes diversity without policy bias.\nWe propose Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Efficient\nReinforcement Learning (DAPPER), which integrates preference discriminability\nwith trajectory diversification achieved by multiple policies. DAPPER trains\nnew policies from scratch after each reward update and employs a discriminator\nthat learns to estimate preference discriminability, enabling the prioritized\nsampling of more discriminable queries. During training, it jointly maximizes\nthe preference reward and preference discriminability score, encouraging the\ndiscovery of highly rewarding and easily distinguishable policies.

There are two complementary views of how the\ncharacteristic size of an operator, also known as the butterfly light cone,\ngrows under chaotic quantum time evolution: A discrete stochastic population\ndynamics or a stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in the continuum. When the\ninteraction decays as a power function of distance, the discrete population\ndynamics model features superlinear butterfly light cones with stretched\nexponential or power-law scaling. Its continuum counterpart, a noisy long-range\nFisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscunov (FKPP) equation, remains less understood.\nWe use a mathematical duality to demonstrate their equivalence through an\nintermediate model, which replaces the hard local population limit by an\nequilibrium population.

Explaining the\nnumber density of such objects requires extremely high conversion efficiency of\nbaryons into stars in early dark matter halos. Using stellar kinematics, we can\ninvestigate the processes shaping the mass assembly histories of MQGs. We\npresent high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of GS-9209, a\nmassive, compact quiescent galaxy at z=4.66 ($\\log \\left (M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}\n\\right) = 10.52 \\pm 0.06 $, $R_{eff} = 220 \\pm 20$ pc). Full spectral fitting\nof the spatially resolved stellar continuum reveals a clear rotational pattern,\nyielding a spin parameter of $\\lambda_{R_{eff}} = 0.65 \\pm 0.12$. With its high\ndegree of rotational support, this galaxy challenges the scenario of MQGs\ngrowing mainly by dry major mergers. This study suggests that at least a\nfraction of the earliest quiescent galaxies were fast rotators and that\nquenching was dynamically gentle process, preserving the stellar disc even in\nhighly compact objects. Using Jeans anisotropic modelling (JAM) and a NFW\nprofile, we measure a dark matter fraction of $f_{\\rm DM} \\left (< R_{eff}\n\\right ) = 6.3^{+2.8}_{-1.7}%$, which is plausible given that this galaxy is\nextremely compact. Our findings use kinematics to independently confirm the\nmassive nature of early quiescent galaxies, previously inferred from stellar\npopulation modelling. We suggest that GS-9209 has a similar structure to\nlow-redshift 'relic' galaxies. However, unlike relic galaxies which have\nbottom-heavy initial mass functions (IMF), the dynamically inferred stellar\nmass-to-light ratio of GS-9209 is consistent with a Milky-Way like IMF. The\nkinematical properties of GS-9209 are different from those of z<1 early-type\ngalaxies and more similar to those of recently quenched post-starburst galaxies\nat z>2.",

The growth of ionized bubbles and\nthe persistence of neutral islands within the IGM hold vital clues to\nunderstanding the morphology and timeline of cosmic reionization. We explore\nthe potential of photometric IGM tomography using deep narrow-band (NB) imaging\nto observe the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest transmission in background galaxies with\nthe Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC).

Our findings indicate that\nover $\\sim$500 background galaxies are needed to accurately reconstruct the IGM\nat scales greater than 200 Mpc, achieving more than 40 per cent correlation\nwith the true distribution. This technique can help detect final remaining\nneutral islands that span more than 20 Mpc lengths. Using the superpixel method\nbuilt to identify physical patterns in noisy image data, we find that the\nneutral island size distribution can be recovered with an accuracy of $\\sim$0.3\ndex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these reconstructed maps are correlated\nwith the galaxy distribution and anti-correlated with the cosmological 21-cm\nsignal from neutral hydrogen in the IGM. Lastly, we find that these\nreconstructed maps are anti-correlated with the patchy optical depth to the\ncosmic microwave background. As such, multiple measurements can be employed for\nconfirmed detection of neutral islands during the end stages.",

The simulation object of this study focuses on a\ndwarf galaxy with a virial mass of a few $10^9$ $M_\\odot$ at $z=6.14$, where\nthe spatial resolution reaches 0.3 pc $h^{-1}$. Individual stars are formed\ndirectly by sampling the initial mass function with a 100\\% star formation\nefficiency, a setup designed to explore the impact of a high star formation\nefficiency under high-redshift conditions. The simulation reveals the emergence\nof numerous stellar clumps with sizes of 1-3 pc, stellar surface densities up\nto almost $10^4$ $M_\\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, and masses predominantly spanning from\n$10^3$ $M_\\odot$ to several $10^4$ $M_\\odot$, with a few reaching $10^5$\n$M_\\odot$ and up to $10^6$ $M_\\odot$. All clumps form during intense, short\nbursts of star formation lasting less than a Myr, often with negligible dark\nmatter content (dark-to-stellar mass ratios below 1 within three times their\neffective radii). We measure a clear correlation between mass and size, and a\nclump mass function described by a power-law with a slope of -2. Star formation\nconditions in the simulation behave similarly to those of a feedback-free\nstarburst scenario, where dense clumps form due to inefficient stellar feedback\nover small timescales.

The flux of these components is\nexpected to vary with the 11-year solar cycle, being highest during solar\nminimum and lowest during solar maximum, as it varies with the cosmic-ray flux.\nNo study has yet analyzed the flux variation of each component over solar\ncycles.\n  In this work, we measure the temporal variations of the flux of each\ncomponent over 15 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations and compare\nthem with the sunspot number and Galactic cosmic-ray flux from AMS-02 near\nEarth.\n  We find that the flux variation of the disk anticorrelates with the sunspot\nnumber and correlates with cosmic-ray protons, as expected, confirming its\nemission mechanism. In contrast, the extended component exhibits a more complex\nvariation: despite an initial anticorrelation with the sunspot number, we find\nneither anticorrelation with the sunspot number nor correlation with cosmic-ray\nelectrons over the full 15-year period.

Non-unitary conformal field\ntheories-particularly the Yang-Lee CFT-pose significant challenges to\nconventional fuzzy sphere approaches. To overcome these obstacles, here we\nutilize a different method for determining critical points that requires no a\npriori knowledge of CFT scaling dimensions.

We also discuss a new finite-size scaling on the fuzzy\nsphere that allows us to extract conformal data more reliably, and compare it\nwith the conventional analysis using the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Lee problem as\nan example.

Our algorithm requires no ancillary\nqubits and can be made noise-resilient without additional error mitigation. It\nis well-suited for estimating thermal expectation values by making use of the\nnotion of a thermal pure quantum state. We demonstrate our algorithm by\nperforming numerical simulations of thermal pure quantum state preparation for\nthe 1D Heisenberg Hamiltonian on 8 qubits, and by using an IBM quantum computer\nto estimate the energy of the same Hamiltonian on 2 qubits. We observe\npromising results compared to the exact values, illustrating the potential of\nour algorithm for probing the physics of quantum many-body systems on current\nhardware.",

In particular\nchaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central\nmassive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an\nobservationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and\nshow that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute\nthe timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the\nimplied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from\n2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate\nby orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of\ndisruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs)\nand tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars\ncome from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that\nstrongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination\ninteractions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether\nejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the\ngalactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a\nnon-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.",

    "abstract": "Simulating generic quantum states and dynamics is practically intractable\nusing classical computers. However, certain special classes -- namely Clifford\nand matchgate circuits -- permit efficient computation. They provide invaluable\ntools for studying many-body physics, quantum chemistry, and quantum\ncomputation. While both play foundational roles across multiple disciplines,\nthe origins of their tractability seem disparate, and their relationship remain\nunclear. A deeper understanding of such tractable classes could expand their\nscope and enable a wide range of new applications. In this work, we make\nprogress toward the unified understanding of the Clifford and matchgate --\nthese two classes are, in fact, distinct special cases of a single underlying\nstructure. Specifically, we introduce the 2D Quon language, which combines\nMajorana worldlines with their underlying spacetime topology to\ndiagrammatically represent quantum processes and tensor networks. In full\ngenerality, the 2D Quon language is universal -- capable of representing\narbitrary quantum states, dynamics, or tensor networks -- yet they become\nespecially powerful in describing Clifford and matchgate classes. Each class\ncan be efficiently characterized in a visually recognizable manner using the\nQuon framework. This capability naturally gives rise to several families of\nefficiently computable tensor networks introduced in this work: punctured\nmatchgates, hybrid Clifford-matchgate-MPS, and ansatze generated from factories\nof tractable networks. All of these exhibit high non-Cliffordness, high\nnon-matchgateness, and large bipartite entanglement entropy. We discuss a range\nof applications of our approach, from recovering well-known results such as the\nKramers-Wannier duality and the star-triangle relation of the Ising model, to\nenabling variational optimization with novel ansatz states.",

The resulting dataset provides a detailed view of gas, dust, and\nstellar structures on kiloparsec scales at the end of the era of reionization.\nThe survey reveals diverse morphologies and kinematics, including rotating\ndisks, merging systems, [CII] emission tails from potential interactions, and\nclumpy star formation. Notably, the [CII] emission in many cases extends beyond\nthe stellar light seen in HST and JWST imaging. Scientific highlights include\nCRISTAL-10, exhibiting an extreme [CII] deficit similar to Arp 220; and\nCRISTAL-13, where feedback from young star-forming clumps likely causes an\noffset between the stellar clumps and the peaks of [CII] emission. CRISTAL\ngalaxies exhibit global [CII]/FIR ratios that decrease with increasing FIR\nluminosity, similar to trends seen in local galaxies but shifted to higher\nluminosities, likely due to their higher molecular gas content. CRISTAL\ngalaxies also span a previously unexplored range of global FIR surface\nbrightness at high-redshift, showing that high-redshift galaxies can have\nelevated [CII]/FIR ratios. These elevated ratios are likely influenced by\nfactors such as lower metallicity gas, the presence of significant extraplanar\ngas, and contributions from shock-excited gas.",

While some attempts have\nbeen made to measure these qualities in representations, no unified evaluation\nframework with modular, generalizable, and interpretable metrics exists.\n  In this paper, we argue for the importance of representation evaluation\nbeyond downstream probing.

In proton Bragg peak\nFLASH-RT, this effect is confined to high-dose regions near the target at deep\ntissue levels. In contrast, Spatially Fractionated Radiation Therapy (SFRT)\ncreates alternating high- and low-dose regions with high peak-to-valley dose\nratios (PVDR), sparing tissues at shallow-to-intermediate depths. Purpose: This\nstudy investigates a novel proton modality (SFRT-FLASH) that synergizes\nFLASH-RT and SFRT to enhance normal tissue protection across all depths.\nMethods: Two SFRT techniques are integrated with FLASH-RT: proton GRID therapy\n(pGRID) with conventional beam sizes and proton minibeam radiation therapy\n(pMBRT) with submillimeter beams. These are implemented as pGRID-FLASH\n(SB-FLASH) and minibeam-FLASH (MB-FLASH), respectively. The pGRID technique\nuses a scissor-beam (SB) method to achieve uniform target coverage. To meet\nFLASH dose (5 Gy) and dose-rate (40 Gy/s) thresholds, a single-field\nuniform-dose-per-fraction strategy is used. Dose and dose-rate constraints are\njointly optimized, including a CTV1cm structure (a 1 cm ring around the CTV)\nfor each field. Results: Across four clinical cases, MB-FLASH and SB-FLASH\nplans were benchmarked against conventional (CONV), FLASH-RT (FLASH), pMBRT\n(MB), and pGRID (SB) plans. SFRT-FLASH achieved high FLASH effect coverage\n(~60-80% in CTV1cm) while preserving PVDR (~2.5-7) at shallow-to-intermediate\ndepths. Conclusions: We present a proton treatment planning approach that\ncombines the FLASH effect at depth with high PVDR near the surface, enhancing\nnormal tissue protection and advancing proton therapy.",

Our\nkey insight is to train an acquisition policy that directly optimizes for\nreconstruction quality rather than just coverage.

We show that our RRI fitness criterion leads to a ~30% gain in\nreconstruction quality over a coverage-based criterion using the same greedy\nstrategy.

This challenge is further exacerbated by the many ways to describe them\n-- transformation of Majorana operators, action on Fock states, encoder\ncircuits, and stabilizers of local encodings -- making it challenging to know\nwhen the mappings are equivalent. In this work, we present a graphical\nframework for fermion-to-qubit mappings that streamlines and unifies various\nrepresentations through the ZX-calculus.\n  To start, we present the correspondence between linear encodings of the Fock\nbasis and phase-free ZX-diagrams.

Consequently, we\ngraphically prove that ternary tree transformations are equivalent to linear\nencodings, a recent result by Chiew et al.

This challenge\nhas led to increasing interest in tensor-based approaches, which naturally\ncapture multi-way data relationships.

Central to this being efficient\nis the ability for FL to perform sparse gradient updates and remote direct\nmemory access at the central server. Most of the research in FL security\nfocuses on protecting data privacy at the edge client or in the communication\nchannels between the client and server. Client-facing attacks on the server are\nless well investigated as the assumption is that a large collective of clients\noffer resilience.\n  Here, we show that by attacking certain clients that lead to a high frequency\nrepetitive memory update in the server, we can remote initiate a rowhammer\nattack on the server memory. For the first time, we do not need backdoor access\nto the server, and a reinforcement learning (RL) attacker can learn how to\nmaximize server repetitive memory updates by manipulating the client's sensor\nobservation. The consequence of the remote rowhammer attack is that we are able\nto achieve bit flips, which can corrupt the server memory. We demonstrate the\nfeasibility of our attack using a large-scale FL automatic speech recognition\n(ASR) systems with sparse updates, our adversarial attacking agent can achieve\naround 70\\% repeated update rate (RUR) in the targeted server model,\neffectively inducing bit flips on server DRAM.

Using orbit-based dynamical models, we\nmodel Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit\nmodel requires a black hole mass of $4 \\pm 1.5 \\times 10^5\\ M_\\odot$. The value\nof the black hole mass is the same with or without a dark halo. The\nmass-to-light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical\nmodeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars.\nDynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a\ndark halo with very small scale radii of around 100 parsecs. Additionally, the\nzero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly\nradially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that\nis close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue\nthat the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better\ndescription of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark\nhalo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a\nsignificant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we\nmeasure a rotation amplitude of $9.0 \\pm 2.4\\ \\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}}$. Segue 1 is\nlikely being tidally stripped at large radii, and we might be witnessing the\nremnant nucleus of a more massive system.

    "abstract": "The non-Abelian exchange statistics of Majorana zero modes make them\ninteresting for both technological applications and fundamental research.\nUnlike their non-Abelian counterpart, the Abelian contribution $e^{i \\theta}$,\nwhere $\\theta$ is directly related to the Majorana's topological spin, is often\nneglected. However, the Abelian exchange phase and hence the topological spin\ncan differ from system to system. For vortices in topological superconductors,\nthe Abelian exchange phase is interpreted as an Aharonov-Casher phase arising\nfrom a vortex encircling an $e/4$ charge. In this work, we show how this\nfractional charge and hence the topological spin can be manipulated,\nintroducing an additional knob for braiding operations in topological quantum\ncomputing. To probe this effect, we propose a vortex interference experiment\nthat reveals the effect of this fractional charge through measurable shifts in\nthe critical current.",

    "abstract": "Charged particle precipitation typically manifests as a gradual increase and\ndecrease of flux observed by space detectors. Cases with rapidly flux variation\nare very rare. Periodic events are even more extraordinary. These oscillating\nparticle precipitation (OPP) events are usually attributed to the bounce motion\nof electrons, which are induced by lightning. Owing to the observation\nlimitations, there has been debate regarding whether these oscillations\noriginate from temporal flux evolution or spatial structure evolution. Here we\nreport three peculiar charged particle precipitation events detected by GECAM\nduring a geomagnetic storm on March 21, 2024, with two exhibiting significant\nperiodicity. These events were observed around the same region during three\nconsecutive orbits. Through comprehensive temporal and spectral analyses, we\nrevealed that one of the OPP events exhibited a transition in spectral lag of\nmini-pulses, shifting from \"softer-earlier\" to \"softer-later\" while showing no\nsignificant time evolution in overall frequency characteristics. And there is\nno association found between these two OPP events and lightning activity.\nSeveral possible scenarios are discussed to explain these charged particles\nwith a life time of more than 3.5 hours, but the nature of these three events\nremains an enigma. We suggest that these GECAM-detected OPP events may\nrepresent a new type of particle precipitation event or a peculiar\nLightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).",

However, despite their resemblance, asymptotic theory for ACD is\nchallenging and also not complete, in particular for integrated ACD. Central\nchallenges arise from the facts that (i) integrated ACD processes imply\ndurations with infinite expectation, and (ii) even in the non-integrated case,\nconventional asymptotic approaches break down due to the randomness in the\nnumber of durations within a fixed observation period. Addressing these\nchallenges, we provide here unified asymptotic theory for the (quasi-) maximum\nlikelihood estimator for ACD models; a unified theory which includes integrated\nACD models. Based on the new results, we also provide a novel framework for\nhypothesis testing in duration models, enabling inference on a key empirical\nquestion: whether durations possess a finite or infinite expectation. We apply\nour results to high-frequency cryptocurrency ETF trading data. Motivated by\nparameter estimates near the integrated ACD boundary, we assess whether\ndurations between trades in these markets have finite expectation, an\nassumption often made implicitly in the literature on point process models. Our\nempirical findings indicate infinite-mean durations for all the five\ncryptocurrencies examined, with the integrated ACD hypothesis rejected --\nagainst alternatives with tail index less than one -- for four out of the five\ncryptocurrencies considered.",

    "abstract": "We consider an evolving random discrete tree model called Preferential\nAttachment with Vertex Death, as introduced by Deijfen. Initialised with an\nalive root labelled $1$, at each step $n\\geq1$ either a new vertex with label\n$n+1$ is introduced that attaches to an existing alive vertex selected\npreferentially according to a function $b$, or an alive vertex is selected\npreferentially according to a function $d$ and killed. In this article we\nintroduce a generalised concept of persistence for evolving random graph\nmodels. Let $O_n$ be the smallest label among all alive vertices (the oldest\nalive vertex), and let $I_n^m$ be the label of the alive vertex with the\n$m^{\\mathrm{th}}$ largest degree. We say a persistent $m$-hub exists if $I_n^m$\nconverges almost surely, we say that persistence occurs when $I_n^1/O_n$ is\ntight, and that lack of persistence occurs when $I_n^1/O_n$ tends to infinity.\nWe identify two regimes called the infinite lifetime and finite lifetime\nregimes. In the infinite lifetime regime, vertices are never killed with\npositive probability. Here, we provide conditions under which we prove the\n(non-)existence of persistent $m$-hubs for any $m\\in\\mathbb N$. This expands\nand generalises recent work of Iyer, which covers the case $d\\equiv 0$ and\n$m=1$. In the finite lifetime regime, vertices are killed after a finite number\nof steps almost surely.

    "abstract": "Phonons, the quantized vibrational modes of a crystal lattice, are ubiquitous\nquasiparticles in solid-state systems. They play a central role in a wide range\nof physical phenomena, from thermal transport, as primary carriers of heat in\ninsulators, to their involvement in symmetry-breaking orders such as charge\ndensity waves and superconductivity. Traditionally considered as spinless\nbosons, phonons have recently emerged as a fertile ground for exploring\ntopological physics, spurred by the rapid development of topological band\ntheory initially formulated for fermionic systems. It is now understood that\nthe phonon eigenstates, characterized by their eigenvalues and eigenvectors,\ncan carry nontrivial topological invariants such as Berry curvature and Chern\nnumbers, despite the absence of spin or charge. This new understanding opens up\navenues to investigate the interplay between lattice dynamics, topology, and\nchirality in bosonic systems. In this article, we provide a comprehensive\nreview of recent theoretical and experimental advances in the field of\ntopological and chiral phonons. We begin by introducing the foundational\nconcepts, including the classification of phononic band structures,\nsymmetry-protected topological phases, and the definition of topological\ninvariants in bosonic systems. Special attention is given to the concept of\nphonon angular momentum and its fundametal connection to Weyl phonons in\ninversion-symmetry-breaking systems. We then discuss key experimental\nrealizations of topological and chiral phonons across a variety of material\nplatforms. Finally, we outline outstanding challenges and promising directions\nfor future research, such as the role of topology in phonon-mediated\nquasiparticle interactions and the manipulation of phonon angular momentum in\nquantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW) is a\nclassic NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem widely applied in logistics\ndistribution and transportation management. Its complexity stems from the\nconstraints of vehicle capacity and time windows, which pose significant\nchallenges to traditional approaches. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs)\nprovide new possibilities for finding approximate solutions to CVRPTW. This\npaper proposes a novel LLM-enhanced Q-learning framework to address the CVRPTW\nwith real-time emergency constraints. Our solution introduces an adaptive\ntwo-phase training mechanism that transitions from the LLM-guided exploration\nphase to the autonomous optimization phase of Q-network. To ensure reliability,\nwe design a three-tier self-correction mechanism based on the Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) for LLMs: syntactic validation, semantic verification, and physical\nconstraint enforcement. In addition, we also prioritized replay of the\nexperience generated by LLMs to amplify the regulatory role of LLMs in the\narchitecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a\n7.3\\% average reduction in cost compared to traditional Q-learning, with fewer\ntraining steps required for convergence.",

    "abstract": "Retouching is an essential task in post-manipulation of raw photographs.\nGenerative editing, guided by text or strokes, provides a new tool accessible\nto users but can easily change the identity of the original objects in\nunacceptable and unpredictable ways. In contrast, although traditional\nprocedural edits, as commonly supported by photoediting tools (e.g., Gimp,\nLightroom), are conservative, they are still preferred by professionals.\nUnfortunately, professional quality retouching involves many individual\nprocedural editing operations that is challenging to plan for most novices. In\nthis paper, we ask if a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can be taught to\ncritique raw photographs, suggest suitable remedies, and finally realize them\nwith a given set of pre-authored procedural image operations. We demonstrate\nthat MLLMs can be first made aware of the underlying image processing\noperations, by training them to solve specially designed visual puzzles.\nSubsequently, such an operation-aware MLLM can both plan and propose edit\nsequences. To facilitate training, given a set of expert-edited photos, we\nsynthesize a reasoning dataset by procedurally manipulating the expert edits\nand then grounding a pretrained LLM on the visual adjustments, to synthesize\nreasoning for finetuning. The proposed retouching operations are, by\nconstruction, understandable by the users, preserve object details and\nresolution, and can be optionally overridden. We evaluate our setup on a\nvariety of test examples and show advantages, in terms of explainability and\nidentity preservation, over existing generative and other procedural\nalternatives.

For\ncertain applications, it is unreasonable to assume that the adversary computes\nthe added offset without any knowledge of the codeword c. Recently, Ahmadi and\nSafavi-Naini, and then Lin, Safavi-Naini, and Wang gave a construction of\nleakage-resilient AMD codes where the adversary has some partial information\nabout the codeword before choosing added offset, and the scheme is secure even\nconditioned on this partial information.

These bounds hold even if adversary\nis polynomial-time bounded, as long as we allow leakage function to be\narbitrary. We present constructions of AMD codes that (asymptotically) fulfill\nthe above bounds for almost full range of parameters r and k.

The task of discerning\nthe spoofing signals from benign ones is naturally relevant for machine\nlearning, thus recent interest in applying it for detection. While deep\nlearning-based methods are promising, they require extensive labeled datasets,\nconsume significant computational resources, and raise privacy concerns due to\nthe sensitive nature of position data. This is why this paper proposes a\nself-supervised federated learning framework for GNSS spoofing detection. It\nconsists of a cloud server and local mobile platforms. Each mobile platform\nemploys a self-supervised anomaly detector using long short-term memory (LSTM)\nnetworks. Labels for training are generated locally through a\nspoofing-deviation prediction algorithm, ensuring privacy. Local models are\ntrained independently, and only their parameters are uploaded to the cloud\nserver, which aggregates them into a global model using FedAvg. The updated\nglobal model is then distributed back to the mobile platforms and trained\niteratively. The evaluation shows that our self-supervised federated learning\nframework outperforms position-based and deep learning-based methods in\ndetecting spoofing attacks while preserving data privacy.",

Previous methods are primarily trained on synthetic data\nand cope with the limited amount of such data by using low-dimensional\nintermediate representations, such as guide strands and scalp-level embeddings,\nthat require post-processing to decode, upsample, and add realism. These\napproaches fail to reconstruct detailed hair, struggle with curly hair, or are\nlimited to handling only a few hairstyles. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose DiffLocks, a novel framework that enables detailed reconstruction of a\nwide variety of hairstyles directly from a single image. First, we address the\nlack of 3D hair data by automating the creation of the largest synthetic hair\ndataset to date, containing 40K hairstyles. Second, we leverage the synthetic\nhair dataset to learn an image-conditioned diffusion-transfomer model that\ngenerates accurate 3D strands from a single frontal image. By using a\npretrained image backbone, our method generalizes to in-the-wild images despite\nbeing trained only on synthetic data. Our diffusion model predicts a scalp\ntexture map in which any point in the map contains the latent code for an\nindividual hair strand. These codes are directly decoded to 3D strands without\npost-processing techniques. Representing individual strands, instead of guide\nstrands, enables the transformer to model the detailed spatial structure of\ncomplex hairstyles. With this, DiffLocks can recover highly curled hair, like\nafro hairstyles, from a single image for the first time. Data and code is\navailable at https://radualexandru.github.io/difflocks/",

We\ndemonstrate that fixed-distance QEC can either underperform or lead to\nexcessive overhead, depending on the selected qubit and the error rate of the\nday. We then propose a simple adaptive QEC approach that selects an appropriate\ncode distance per qubit, based on daily error rates. Using logical error rate\nmodeling, we identify qubits that cannot be used and qubits that can be\nrecovered with minimal resources. Our method avoids unnecessary resource\noverhead by excluding outlier qubits and tailoring code distances. Across 12\ncalibration days on ibm_kyiv, our adaptive strategy reduces physical qubit\noverhead by over 50% per logical qubit while maintaining access to 85-100% of\nusable qubits. To further validate the method, we repeat the experiment on two\nadditional 127-qubit devices, ibm_brisbane and ibm_sherbrooke, where the\noverhead savings reach up to 71% while still preserving over 80% qubit\nusability. This approach offers a practical and efficient path forward for\nNoisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era QEC strategies.",

However, nearby mCVs have a much\nlower 6.7 keV line equivalent width ($\\rm EW_{6.7}$) compared to the diffuse\nX-ray emission. Therefore, the primary contributors to the unresolved X-ray\nemission remain unclear. We detected a total of 859 sources in the 6.5-7 keV\nband using XMM-Newton observations of the inner Galactic disc, of which 72\nsources show significant iron line emission at 6.7 keV. The distribution of\nspectral index $\\Gamma$ for these 72 sources is bimodal, with peaks at\n$\\Gamma=0.5\\pm0.4$ and $1.8\\pm0.3$, suggesting two populations of sources. The\nsoft X-ray sources have significantly larger $\\rm EW_{6.7}$ than the hard X-ray\nsources. Furthermore, 18 of the 32 hard sources are associated with previously\nknown CVs. We identify CV candidates in our sample as those with spectral index\n$\\Gamma<1.25$. The line ratio, 2-10 keV luminosity, and previous detection of\nspin period suggest that most of these hard sources are mCVs. The distribution\nof the $\\rm EW_{6.7}$ line for the combined sample of previously identified and\ncandidate CVs has a mean value of <$\\rm EW_{6.7}$>$=415\\pm39$ eV. Furthermore,\nwe computed the stacked spectra of all sources detected in the 6.5-7 keV band\nfor different flux groups, and we find evidence in the stacked spectra of hard\nsources that the $\\rm EW_{6.7}$ increases with decreasing flux. The soft X-ray\nsources have <$\\rm EW_{6.7}$>$=1.1\\pm0.1$ keV. We identified 13 of the 30 soft\nsources associated with active stars, young stellar objects, and active\nbinaries of RS CVn type. The <$\\rm EW_{6.7}$> of our CV candidate sample is\nmore than twice as large as the typical $\\rm EW_{6.7}$ found in mCVs within 500\npc, and the <$\\rm EW_{6.7}$> of our CV candidate sample is close to the $\\rm\nEW_{6.7}$ value of Galactic diffuse X-ray emission.",

Aerocapture guidance systems must be robust to\nsignificant environmental variations and modeling uncertainty, particularly\nregarding atmospheric properties and delivery conditions. Recent work has shown\nthat enabling control over both bank angle and angle of attack, a strategy\nreferred to as augmented bank angle modulation (ABAM), can improve robustness\nto entry state and atmospheric uncertainties. In this work, we derive optimal\ncontrol solutions for an aerocapture vehicle using ABAM. We first formulate the\nproblem using a linear aerodynamic model and derive closed-form optimal control\nprofiles using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. To increase modeling fidelity,\nwe also consider a quadratic aerodynamic model and obtain the solution directly\nusing the optimality conditions. Both formulations are solved numerically using\nGauss pseudospectral methods (via GPOPS, a software tool for pseudospectral\noptimal control), to validate the analytic solutions. We then introduce a novel\naerocapture guidance algorithm, ABAMGuid+, which indirectly minimizes\npropellant usage by mimicking the structure of the optimal control solution,\nenabling efficient guidance by avoiding the complexity of solving the full\noptimal control problem online. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations of a Uranus\naerocapture mission demonstrate that ABAMGuid+ increases capture success rates\nand reduces post-capture propellant requirements relative to previous methods.",

Feature contribution revealed conversational\ndynamics and semantic similarity between clients and therapists were among the\ntop contributors, led by words uttered by the client (mean and standard\ndeviation). The framework was robust across the original and augmented datasets\nand demonstrated consistent improvements in F1 scores and recall. While\ncurrently text-based, the framework supports future multimodal extensions\n(e.g., vocal tone, facial affect) for more holistic assessments.

    "abstract": "The hadron physics community has been actively debating the interpretation of\nso-called mechanical properties of hadrons. Non-relativistic quantum-mechanical\nsystems like the hydrogen atom have been appealed to in these debates as\nanalogies. Since such appeals are likely to continue, it is important to have\nGalilei-covariant expressions for matrix elements of the energy-momentum\ntensor. In this work, I obtain Galilei-covariant breakdowns of such matrix\nelements into mechanical form factors, with a special focus on spin-half\nstates. I additionally study the spatial densities associated with these form\nfactors, using the pilot wave interpretation to guide their breakdown into\ncontributions from internal structure and from quantum-mechanical effects such\nas wave packet dispersion. For completeness, I also obtain non-relativistic\nBreit frame densities.",

However, current\napproaches tend to focus on perturbing the past positions of surrounding\nagents, which can generate unrealistic scenarios and overlook critical\nvulnerabilities. This limitation may result in overly optimistic assessments of\nmodel performance in real-world conditions.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that perturbing not just past but also future\nstates of adversarial agents can uncover previously undetected weaknesses and\nthereby provide a more rigorous evaluation of model robustness. Our novel\napproach incorporates dynamic constraints and preserves tactical behaviors,\nenabling more effective and realistic adversarial attacks. We introduce new\nperformance measures to assess the realism and impact of these adversarial\ntrajectories. Testing our method on a state-of-the-art prediction model\nrevealed significant increases in prediction errors and collision rates under\nadversarial conditions. Qualitative analysis further showed that our attacks\ncan expose critical weaknesses, such as the inability of the model to detect\npotential collisions in what appear to be safe predictions.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of parameter privacy-preserving data sharing\nin coupled systems, where a data provider shares data with a data user but\nwants to protect its sensitive parameters. The shared data affects not only the\ndata user's decision-making but also the data provider's operations through\nsystem interactions. To trade off control performance and privacy, we propose\nan interaction-aware privacy-preserving data sharing approach. Our approach\ngenerates distorted data by minimizing a combination of (i) mutual information,\nquantifying privacy leakage of sensitive parameters, and (ii) the impact of\ndistorted data on the data provider's control performance, considering the\ninteractions between stakeholders. The optimization problem is formulated into\na Bellman equation and solved by a particle filter reinforcement learning\n(RL)-based approach. Compared to existing RL-based methods, our formulation\nsignificantly reduces history dependency and efficiently handles scenarios with\ncontinuous state space. Validated in a mixed-autonomy platoon scenario, our\nmethod effectively protects sensitive driving behavior parameters of\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) against inference attacks while maintaining\nnegligible impact on fuel efficiency.",

Although analysis of LLM\nconversation logs has confirmed that underspecification occurs frequently in\nuser instructions, LLM evaluation has predominantly focused on the single-turn,\nfully-specified instruction setting. In this work, we perform large-scale\nsimulation experiments to compare LLM performance in single- and multi-turn\nsettings.

However, the\nscarcity of rich defect data poses substantial challenges for effective model\ntraining. While existing methods have explored generative models to augment\ndatasets, they often suffer from instability, limited diversity, and domain\nshifts. To address these issues, we propose PDIG, a Photovoltaic Defect Image\nGenerator based on Stable Diffusion (SD). PDIG leverages the strong priors\nlearned from large-scale datasets to enhance generation quality under limited\ndata.

At inference, we propose a Text-Image Dual-Space Constraints (TIDSC)\nmodule, enforcing the quality of generated images via positional consistency\nand spatial smoothing alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDIG\nachieves superior realism and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nSpecifically, our approach improves Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 19.16\npoints over the second-best method and significantly enhances the performance\nof downstream defect detection tasks.",

The lack of data on\nnationality can create challenges for migration research. It can lead to a\nleft-censoring issue since we are uncertain about the migrant's country of\norigin. Once we observe an emigration event, if we know the nationality, we can\ndifferentiate it from return migration. We propose methods to detect the\nnationality with the least available data, i.e., full names. We use the\ndetected nationality in comparison with the country of academic origin, which\nis a common approach in studying the migration of researchers. We gathered 2.6\nmillion unique name-nationality pairs from Wikipedia and categorized them into\nfamilies of nationalities with three granularity levels to use as our training\ndata. Using a character-based machine learning model, we achieved a weighted F1\nscore of 84% for the broadest and 67% for the most granular, country-level\ncategorization. In our empirical study, we used the trained and tested model to\nassign nationality to 8+ million scholars' full names in Scopus data. Our\nresults show that using the country of first publication as a proxy for\nnationality underestimates the size of return flows, especially for countries\nwith a more diverse academic workforce, such as the USA, Australia, and Canada.\nWe found that around 48% of emigration from the USA was return migration once\nwe used the country of name origin, in contrast to 33% based on academic\norigin. In the most recent period, 79% of scholars whose affiliation has\nconsistently changed from the USA to China, and are considered emigrants, have\nChinese names in contrast to 41% with a Chinese academic origin.

    "abstract": "We derive an implicit numerical scheme for the solution of advection equation\nwhere the roles of space and time variables are exchanged using the inverse\nLax-Wendroff procedure. The scheme contains a linear weight for which it is\nalways second order accurate in time and space, and the stencil in the implicit\npart is fully upwinded for any value of the weight, enabling a direct\ncomputation of numerical solutions by forward substitution. To fulfill the\nlocal bounds for the solution represented by the discrete minimum and maximum\nprinciple (DMP), we use a predicted value obtained with the linear weight and\ncheck a priori if the DMP is valid. If not, we can use either a nonlinear\nweight or a limiter function that depends on Courant number and apply such a\nhigh-resolution version of the scheme to obtain a corrected value. The\nadvantage of the scheme obtained with the inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure is\nthat only in the case of too small Courant numbers, the limiting is towards the\nfirst order accurate scheme, which is not a situation occurring in numerical\nsimulations with implicit schemes very often. In summary, the local bounds are\nsatisfied up to rounding errors unconditionally for any Courant numbers, and\nthe formulas for the predictor and the corrector are explicit. The\nhigh-resolution scheme can be extended straightforwardly for advection with\nnonlinear retardation coefficient with numerical solutions satisfying the DMP,\nand a scalar nonlinear algebraic equation has to be solved to obtain each\npredicted and corrected value.

However, these\ndemonstrations are not always simple movements themselves, and complex\ndemonstrations must be broken down, or segmented, into primitive movements. In\nthis work, we present a parameter-free approach to segmentation using\ntechniques inspired by autocorrelation and cross-correlation from signal\nprocessing. In cross-correlation, a representative signal is found in some\nlarger, more complex signal by correlating the representative signal with the\nlarger signal. This same idea can be applied to segmenting robot motion and\ndemonstrations, provided with a representative motion primitive. This results\nin a fast and accurate segmentation, which does not take any parameters. One of\nthe main contributions of this paper is the modification of the\ncross-correlation process by employing similarity metrics that can capture\nfeatures specific to robot movements. To validate our framework, we conduct\nseveral experiments of complex tasks both in simulation and in real-world. We\nalso evaluate the effectiveness of our segmentation framework by comparing\nvarious similarity metrics.",

In forthcoming work, we\nwill apply our results to the hypertree posets and their connections to\npost-Lie and pre-Lie algebras.",

These regions are located at large distances and only now\nwith JWST become accessible to study the inner disks surrounding young stars.\nWe present the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program, which provides the first\ndetailed characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the inner\ndisks around young intermediate-mass stars exposed to external irradiation from\nnearby massive stars. We present high signal to noise MIRI-MRS spectroscopy of\n12 disks located in three sub-clusters of the high-mass star-forming region NGC\n6357. Based on their mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we classify the\nXUE sources into Group I and II based on the Meeus scheme. We analyze their\nmolecular emission features, and compare their spectral indices and 10 $\\mu$m\nsilicate emission profiles to those of nearby Herbig and intermediate T Tauri\ndisks. Despite being more massive, the XUE stars host disks with molecular\nrichness comparable to isolated T Tauri systems. The 10 $\\mu$m silicate\nfeatures show lower F$_{11.3}$/F$_{9.8}$ ratios at a given F$_{\\mathrm{peak}}$,\nbut current uncertainties prevent conclusions about their inner disk\nproperties. Most disks display water emission from the inner disk, suggesting\nthat even in these extreme environments rocky planets can form in the presence\nof water. The absence of strong line fluxes and other irradiation signatures\nsuggests that the XUE disks have been truncated by external UV photons.\nHowever, this truncation does not appear to significantly impact the chemical\nrichness of their inner regions. These findings indicate that even in extreme\nenvironments, IMTT disks can retain the ingredients necessary for rocky planet\nformation.",

More recent studies have revealed a larger\ncontribution by the momentum asymmetry of photocarriers to this photovoltaic\nHall effect, although its physical mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In\nthis study, we describe this phenomenon as a circular photogalvanic effect\ncaused by an electric field-induced Berry curvature. The shift vector provides\nan additional contribution through the energy shift of interband transitions. A\nresonant enhancement of the transverse photocurrent occurs in GaAs owing to the\ntopological character of the valence band.

Neutron scattering\ntechnologies, which are known for their high energy and momentum resolution,\nare powerful tools for simultaneously characterizing material structure and\ncomplex lattice dynamics. In recent years, neutron scattering techniques have\nmade significant contributions to the study of energy materials, shedding light\non their physical mechanisms. This review article details several neutron\nscattering techniques commonly used in energy material research, including\nneutron diffraction, total neutron scattering, quasi-elastic and inelastic\nneutron scattering. Then, some important research progress made in the field of\nenergy materials in recent years using neutron scattering as the main\ncharacterization method is reviewed, including ultra-low lattice thermal\nconductivity in superionic thermoelectric materials, ion diffusion mechanism of\nsolid-state electrolytes, plastic-crystalline phase transition and\nconfiguration entropy changes in barocaloric materials, lattice anharmonicity\nand charge transport in photovoltaic materials, and first-order\nmagnetic-structural phase transition in magnetocaloric materials. In these\ncomplex energy conversion and storage materials, lattice dynamics do not work\nindependently, and their functioning in macroscopic physical properties is\nalways achieved through correlation or mutual coupling with other degrees of\nfreedom, such as sublattices, charge, spin, etc. Through these typical\nexamples, this review paper can provide a reference for further exploring and\nunderstanding the energy materials and lattice dynamics.",

However, PGM methods cannot be simply applied\nin settings where low-rank models are imposed locally on overlapping patches;\ntherefore, heuristic approaches have been proposed that lack convergence\nguarantees. In this work we propose to replace the nuclear norm with a smooth\napproximation in which a Huber-type function is applied to each singular value.\nBy providing a theoretical framework based on singular value function theory,\nwe show that important properties can be established for the proposed\nregularizer, such as: convexity, differentiability, and Lipschitz continuity of\nthe gradient.

In\naddition, we provide a novel step-size selection strategy based on a quadratic\nmajorizer of the line-search function that leverages the Huber characteristics\nof the proposed regularizer.

    "abstract": "Hydrodynamic dispersion determines the extent of solute mixing and apparent\ndiffusive flux in various chemical, geological, and biological systems that\npossess flow with strong velocity gradients. Though established dispersion\ntheory captures the transient interplay between diffusion, flow, and reaction\nrates, a long-time approximation is commonly adopted where the characteristic\ntime scale of flow substantially exceeds that of pore-scale diffusion. Here, we\nintroduce a frequency-based theory to model omni-temporal dispersion through\nporous media that simultaneously captures fast and slow components of\ndispersion. To create this theory, we formally volume-average the\nFourier-transformed pore-scale advection-diffusion equation for solute and\nobtain up-scaled transport coefficients for a periodic unit cell: a dispersion\ntensor, an advection suppression vector, and reaction-rate coefficients. These\ncoefficients serve dually as transfer functions that correlate certain output\nwith input quantities in the frequency domain, enabling the prediction of\nup-scaled temporal dynamics using inverse Fourier transformation. Their utility\nis demonstrated by deriving analytical expressions for the dispersion\ncoefficient for cases of Poiseuille flow between parallel plates and through\ncircular tubes. This omni-temporal theory produces breakthrough curves for a\nfast solute pulse between inactive parallel plates that agree with the solute\npropagation rates predicted by direct numerical simulation (DNS), in contrast\nwith conventional asymptotic theory that overpredicts such by orders of\nmagnitude. Deviations in solute peak magnitude from DNS are shown to arise from\nsolute back-diffusion into the inlet plane as well as entry-region effects that\nare evidenced by a non-periodic variation of the closure variable b.",

Our results show that\nfine-tuning significantly influences how models allocate attention to MWEs.\nSpecifically, models fine-tuned on semantic tasks tend to distribute attention\nto idiomatic expressions more evenly across layers.

Nevertheless, the scarcity of samples in data collection\nand the extensive effort required for manual annotation have significantly\nimpeded the availability of diverse datasets. This limitation has restricted\nthe effectiveness of deep learning-based detection methods, particularly those\nbased on large-scale vision models. To address these challenges, we have\ndeveloped an innovative data generation method capable of producing diverse\ncephalometric X-ray images along with corresponding annotations without human\nintervention. To achieve this, our approach initiates by constructing new\ncephalometric landmark annotations using anatomical priors. Then, we employ a\ndiffusion-based generator to create realistic X-ray images that correspond\nclosely with these annotations. To achieve precise control in producing samples\nwith different attributes, we introduce a novel prompt cephalometric X-ray\nimage dataset.

By leveraging these\ndetailed prompts, our method improves the generation process to control\ndifferent styles and attributes. Facilitated by the large, diverse generated\ndata, we introduce large-scale vision detection models into the cephalometric\nlandmark detection task to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat training with the generated data substantially enhances the performance.\nCompared to methods without using the generated data, our approach improves the\nSuccess Detection Rate (SDR) by 6.5%, attaining a notable 82.2%.

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely accessible, a detailed\nunderstanding of their knowledge within specific domains becomes necessary for\nsuccessful real world use. This is particularly critical in public health,\nwhere failure to retrieve relevant, accurate, and current information could\nsignificantly impact UK residents. However, currently little is known about LLM\nknowledge of UK Government public health information. To address this issue,\nthis paper introduces a new benchmark, PubHealthBench, with over 8000 questions\nfor evaluating LLMs' Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) and free form\nresponses to public health queries. To create PubHealthBench we extract free\ntext from 687 current UK government guidance documents and implement an\nautomated pipeline for generating MCQA samples. Assessing 24 LLMs on\nPubHealthBench we find the latest private LLMs (GPT-4.5, GPT-4.1 and o1) have a\nhigh degree of knowledge, achieving >90% accuracy in the MCQA setup, and\noutperform humans with cursory search engine use. However, in the free form\nsetup we see lower performance with no model scoring >75%. Importantly we find\nin both setups LLMs have higher accuracy on guidance intended for the general\npublic. Therefore, there are promising signs that state of the art (SOTA) LLMs\nare an increasingly accurate source of public health information, but\nadditional safeguards or tools may still be needed when providing free form\nresponses on public health topics.",

We have evaluated our approach with data from\nthe ShapeTalk dataset along with three distinct models. Our counterfactual\nexamples maintain the structure of the original description, are semantically\nsimilar and meaningful. They reveal weaknesses in the description, model bias\nand enhance the understanding of the models behavior. Theses insights help\npractitioners to better interact with systems as well as engineers to improve\nmodels.",

In particular, the Transverse\nField Ising Model (TFIM) and the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Ising (ANNNI)\nmodel are studied. The proposed extension of the adiabatic theorem is stated as\nfollows: Consider the overlap between the initial ground state and the\npost-quench Hamiltonian eigenstates for quenches within the same phase. This\noverlap is largest for the post-quench ground state. In the case of the TFIM,\nthis conjecture is confirmed for both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases\nnumerically and analytically. In the ANNNI model, the conjecture could be\nanalytically proven for a special case. Numerical methods were employed to\ninvestigate the conjecture's validity beyond this special case.",

A central element of our analysis is the\npropagation of regularity: while the transformation induced by a single Bellman\noperator application exhibits regularity, for which Backward Stochastic\nDifferential Equations (BSDEs) theory provides analytical tools, the uniform\nregularity of the entire sequence of value iteration iterates--specifically,\ntheir uniform Lipschitz continuity on compact domains under standard Lipschitz\nassumptions on the problem data--is derived from finite-horizon dynamic\nprogramming principles. We demonstrate that layers of a deep residual network,\nconceived as neural operators acting on function spaces, can approximate the\naction of the Bellman operator. The resulting approximation theorem is thus\nintrinsically linked to the control problem's structure, offering a proof\ntechnique wherein network depth directly corresponds to iterations of value\nfunction refinement, accompanied by controlled error propagation.

In\nthis work, we combine custom-developed high-speed particle tracking velocimetry\n(PTV) and digital image correlation (DIC) to visualize and quantify droplet\nejection during onion cutting. We show that droplet formation occurs via a\ntwo-stage process: an initial high-speed ejection driven by internal\npressurization of the onion first-layer, followed by slower ligament\nfragmentation in air. By systematically varying blade sharpness and cutting\nspeed, we find that faster or blunter blades significantly increase both the\nnumber and energy of ejected droplets. Strain mapping via DIC reveals that the\nonion's tough epidermis acts as a barrier to fracture, enabling the underlying\nmesophyll to undergo significant compression before rupture, thereby increasing\nboth the quantity and velocity of the resulting splashed droplets. Developing a\nscaling model and a simplified bi-layer model with a spring foundation, we\nexperimentally and theoretically demonstrated how sharpened blades lead to not\nonly fewer but also slower droplets. Numerical calculations accurately explain\nthe onion critical fracture force obtained from independent Instron tests.

    "abstract": "Merchant shipping is responsible for more than 90% of the global trade and\nhas a significant environmental impact, accounting for over 2% of global\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, fuel-saving measures are becoming\nincreasingly important in reducing the ecological footprint and increasing the\nfuel efficiency of maritime transport. Routing optimization systems, which\nrequire a rapid prediction of ambient-dependent fuel consumption, represent an\nessential pillar here, e.g. to reduce added resistances due to seaways and/or\nwind. The paper aims to predict the added resistance due to seaways. In\ncontrast to conventional methods the goal is achieved by surrogate modeling of\nthe entire pressure fields. To this end, an online/offline-procedure is applied\nto an exemplarily free-floating container vessel. The online approach to be\ntrained consists of two building blocks, namely a convolutional autoencoder\n(CAE)-based order reduction step and a neural network-based (NN) regression\nstep that links the reduced space of the autoencoder with three control\nparameters that describe the sea state (wave height/steepness, encounter angle\nand wave length). Training data is obtained from time-averaged values for\nsimulating instantaneous ship motion and pressure fields. During the offline\nphase, the combined CAE/NN is trained to capture the time-averaged pressure\nfields for a variety of sea-state conditions. During ship operation (online\nphase), the surrogate model predicts the three-dimensional pressure fields in\nresponse to sea state conditions, projects the pressure fields onto the ship\nhull, and integrates the corresponding resistances to guide the route. The\nevaluation of the method shows promising results for the different building\nblocks and the concept could therefore represent an attractive approach for\ncost-effective surrogate modeling of complex multiphase flow fields.",

    "abstract": "Planet formation impacts exoplanet atmospheres by accreting metals in solid\nform, leading to atmospheric C/O and S/N ratios that deviate from their host\nstars. Recent observations indicate differing metal abundances in planetary\natmospheres compared to their stellar companions (e.g., Alderson et al. 2022;\nBean et al. 2023). However, these observations are biased toward mature\nplanets, raising questions about whether these abundances result from formation\nor evolved over time. Another way to alter an atmosphere is through the qescape\nof particles due to thermal heating. This study examines how billions of years\nof particle escape affect metal abundances. Using an adjusted stellar evolution\ncode incorporating hydrodynamic escape, we model a warm ($T_{\\mathrm{eq}}\n\\approx 1000$ K) super-Neptune-type planet ($M_{\\mathrm{ini}} = 26$\n$M_{\\oplus}$) orbiting a solar-type star. Our results show increased\nmetal-to-hydrogen abundances of $\\sim$50-70x initial enrichment after 10 Gyr.\nWe also see a 0.88x decrease in C/O abundance and a 1.27x increase in S/N\nabundance, which can affect the interpretation of planet formation parameters.\nWe also simulate the evolving atmosphere using chemical kinetics and radiative\ntransfer codes, finding substantial increases in SO$_2$, CO$_2$, and H$_2$O\nabundances and a decrease in CH$_4$ abundance. These changes are easily\nobservable in the IR waveband transmission spectrum. Our findings demonstrate\nthat extreme escape of lighter particles significantly influences the evolution\nof warm Neptunes and complicates the interpretation of their observational\ndata.

First, we employ Bayesian time-resolved\nspectral analysis to compare the spectral components of the main and the second\nburst, finding that $83.3\\%$ of the main and second bursts contain a thermal\ncomponent. $67\\%$ of the GRBs, the thermal component gradually decreased from\nthe main to the second burst and the number of spectra exceeding the\n\"Synchrotron line-of-death\" is significantly higher in the main burst than in\nthe second burst. Subsequently, we ascertain that for both the main and second\nbursts, $71.4\\%$ of the low-energy spectral index $\\alpha$ and $77.8\\%$ of the\npeak energy $E_{p}$ evolve in a similar fashion. There are $50.0\\%$ and\n$72.2\\%$ of the GRBs exhibit comparable correlations for the $Flux-\\alpha$ and\n$\\alpha-E_{p}$, respectively. For $Flux-E_{p}$ both the main and second burst\nshow a positive correlation.

    "abstract": "Water inherently contains trace amounts of various salts, yet the microscopic\nprocesses by which salts influence some of its physical properties remain\nelusive. Notably, the mechanisms that reduce the dielectric constant of water\nupon salt addition are still debated. The primary absorption peak for\nelectromagnetic radiation -- commonly used in microwave heating -- shifts\ntowards higher frequencies in saline solutions, suggesting faster water\nmolecular dynamics. This observation, however, contrasts with the simultaneous\nincrease in viscosity and experimental reports that ionic solutes would slow\ndown water molecular motion. In this work, we use molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations with deep-neural-network models trained on high-quality quantum\nmechanical data to mimic interatomic forces and molecular dipoles, to compute\nthe dielectric spectra of perchlorate water saline solution, which may be\nrelevant to the recent discovery of liquid water beneath the thick ice crust at\nMars's south pole. Our results reveal that both the reduction in the dielectric\nconstant and the absorption peak shift can be attributed to ion-induced changes\nin the orientational ordering of water molecules. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat the self-part of the molecular dipole-dipole correlation function reveals\nclear signatures of the slowing dynamics within the first cationic solvation\nshell, consistent with the experimentally observed increase in viscosity.",

While BLO is intractable in\nits general form, we show that restricting the lower-level objective to the\nrecently proposed PL-circle functions (Gong et al., 2024) guarantees a\ncontinuous hyper-objective F_max. The PL-circle condition is strictly weaker\nthan the global Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition used in prior BLO work and allows\nmodeling of practical settings such as hyperparameter tuning in\nover-parameterized deep learning. However, even under this condition, F_max\nremains non-convex and non-smooth. To address this, we propose a relaxed\nsolution concept: we approximate F_max with a continuously differentiable\nfunction F_max_tilde that is pointwise epsilon_v-close to F_max and seek an\nepsilon_g-stationary point of F_max_tilde. In this framework, we reduce the\nminima-selection subproblem to a sampling task using a novel\nSuperquantile-Gibbs relaxation. By leveraging the manifold structure of the\nlower-level solution set under the PL-circle condition, our method finds a\nrelaxed solution using poly(epsilon_v^{-k} epsilon_g^{-1}) queries to a Gibbs\nsampling oracle, which is efficiently implemented using Langevin dynamics.\nHere, k is the intrinsic dimension of the manifolds defining the lower-level\nsolutions.

The method centers on multi-hop paths composed of various types of\nentities and relations. It models user preferences through three stages: path\nselection, semantic representation, and attention-based fusion. In the path\nselection stage, a path filtering mechanism is introduced to remove redundant\nand noisy information. In the representation learning stage, a sequential\nmodeling structure is used to jointly encode entities and relations, preserving\nthe semantic dependencies within paths. In the fusion stage, an attention\nmechanism assigns different weights to each path to generate a global user\ninterest representation. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets such as\nAmazon-Book show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing\nrecommendation models across multiple evaluation metrics, including HR@10,\nRecall@10, and Precision@10. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-hop\npaths in capturing high-order interaction semantics and demonstrate the\nexpressive modeling capabilities of the framework in heterogeneous\nrecommendation scenarios. This method provides both theoretical and practical\nvalue by integrating structural information modeling in heterogeneous networks\nwith recommendation algorithm design. It offers a more expressive and flexible\nparadigm for learning user preferences in complex data environments.",

    "abstract": "The free positive multiplicative Brownian motion $(h_t)_{t\\geq0}$ is the\nlarge $N$ limit in non-commutative distribution of matrix geometric Brownian\nmotion. It can be constructed by setting $h_t:=g_{t/2}g_{t/2}^*$, where\n$(g_t)_{t\\geq0}$ is a free multiplicative Brownian motion, which is the large\n$N$ limit in non-commutative distribution of the Brownian motion in\n$\\operatorname{Gl}(N,\\mathbb{C})$. One key property of $(h_t)_{t\\geq0}$ is the\nfact that the corresponding spectral distributions $(\\nu_t)_{t\\geq0}\\subset\nM^1((0,\\infty))$ form a semigroup w.r.t. free multiplicative convolution. In\nrecent work by M. Voit and the present author, it was shown that $\\nu_t$ can be\nexpressed by the image measure of a free additive convolution of the semicircle\nand the uniform distribution on an interval under the exponential map. In this\npaper, we provide a new proof of this result by calculating the moments of the\nfree additive convolution of semicircle and uniform distributions on intervals.\nAs a by-product, we also obtain new integral formulas for $\\nu_t$ which\ngeneralize the corresponding known moment formulas involving Laguerre\npolynomials.",

However, most efforts (e.g.\ncontrol of residential vehicle charging) focus on short durations -- typically\non the scale of minutes to hours. This paper investigates whether a fully\nelectrified supply chain (transport and manufacturing) could provide demand\nflexibility over longer durations, exploiting the latency that typically exists\nbetween the processing of raw material to the delivery of finished product.\nUsing a case study of the cement industry along the East Coast of the United\nStates, we demonstrate that electrified supply chains could shift\ngigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity demand for durations of more than a week,\nlargely following wind power variability. Furthermore, we show that this occurs\nusing low levels of carbon taxing (below $50/tn), at which battery storage is\nnot economically viable. A sensitivity analysis shows potential to provide\nflexibility in all considered cost scenarios, although where the flexibility\ncomes from can change (e.g. transport vs manufacturing). We show that today's\ncost of electrified heavy goods vehicles are the most significant parameter --\nwith substantially lower costs yielding a more demand-flexible supply chain.",

Within each cluster, the multivariate SAL\ndistribution is assumed for both the covariates and the responses given the\ncovariates. To mitigate the effect of possible atypical observations, a\nheavy-tailed extension, the contaminated SALCWM (cSALCWM), is also proposed. In\naddition to the SALCWM parameters, each mixture component has a parameter\ncontrolling the proportion of outliers, one controlling the proportion of\nleverage points, one specifying the degree of outlierness, and another\nspecifying the degree of leverage. The cSALCWM has the added benefit that once\nthe model parameters are estimated and the observations are assigned to\ncomponents, a more refined intra-group classification in typical points, (mild)\noutliers, good leverage, and bad leverage points can be directly obtained. An\nexpectation-conditional maximization algorithm is developed for efficient\nmaximum likelihood parameter estimation under this framework. Theoretical\nidentifiability conditions are established, and empirical results from\nsimulation studies and validation via real-world applications demonstrate that\nthe cSALCWM not only preserves the modelling strengths of the SALCWM but also\nsignificantly enhances outlier detection and overall inference reliability.

    "abstract": "Configurable systems typically consist of reusable assets that have\ndependencies between each other. To specify such dependencies, feature models\nare commonly used. As feature models in practice are often complex, automated\nreasoning is typically employed to analyze the dependencies. Here, the de facto\nstandard is translating the feature model to conjunctive normal form (CNF) to\nenable employing off-the-shelf tools, such as SAT or #SAT solvers. However,\nmodern feature-modeling dialects often contain constructs, such as cardinality\nconstraints, that are ill-suited for conversion to CNF. This mismatch between\nthe input of reasoning engines and the available feature-modeling dialects\nlimits the applicability of the more expressive constructs. In this work, we\nshorten this gap between expressive constructs and scalable automated\nreasoning. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a pseudo-Boolean\nencoding for feature models, which facilitates smaller representations of\ncommonly employed constructs compared to Boolean encoding. Second, we propose a\nnovel method to compile pseudo-Boolean formulas to Boolean d-DNNF. With the\ncompiled d-DNNFs, we can resort to a plethora of efficient analyses already\nused in feature modeling. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposal\nsubstantially outperforms the state-of-the-art based on CNF inputs for\nexpressive constructs. For every considered dataset representing different\nfeature models and feature-modeling constructs, the feature models can be\nsignificantly faster translated to pseudo-Boolean than to CNF. Overall,\nderiving d-DNNFs from a feature model with the targeted expressive constraints\ncan be substantially accelerated using our pseudo-Boolean approach.\nFurthermore, our approach is competitive on feature models with only basic\nconstructs.",

To do so, we\nconducted a t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering analysis on\n4,226 Malay prefixed words. Several clusters were observed for complex words\nvaried by their prefix class. Then, we derived five simple measures, and\ninvestigated whether they were significant predictors of lexical decision\nlatencies. Two sets of Linear Discriminant Analyses were run in which the\nprefix of a word is predicted from either word embeddings or shift vectors\n(i.e., a vector subtraction of the base word from the derived word). The\naccuracy with which the model predicts the prefix of a word indicates the\ndegree of transparency of the prefix. Three further measures were obtained by\ncomparing embeddings between each word and all other words containing the same\nprefix (i.e., centroid), between each word and the shift from their base word,\nand between each word and the predicted word of the Functional Representations\nof Affixes in Compositional Semantic Space model.

    "abstract": "Offline cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) faces unique\nchallenges due to distributional shifts, particularly stemming from the high\ndimensionality of joint action spaces and the presence of out-of-distribution\njoint action selections. In this work, we highlight that a fundamental\nchallenge in offline MARL arises from the multi-equilibrium nature of\ncooperative tasks, which induces a highly multimodal joint behavior policy\nspace coupled with heterogeneous-quality behavior data. This makes it difficult\nfor individual policy regularization to align with a consistent coordination\npattern, leading to the policy distribution shift problems. To tackle this\nchallenge, we design a sequential score function decomposition method that\ndistills per-agent regularization signals from the joint behavior policy, which\ninduces coordinated modality selection under decentralized execution\nconstraints. Then we leverage a flexible diffusion-based generative model to\nlearn these score functions from multimodal offline data, and integrate them\ninto joint-action critics to guide policy updates toward high-reward,\nin-distribution regions under a shared team reward. Our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple particle environments and\nMulti-agent MuJoCo benchmarks consistently. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first work to explicitly address the distributional gap between offline\nand online MARL, paving the way for more generalizable offline policy-based\nMARL methods.",

    "abstract": "In-X Subnetworks are envisioned to meet the stringent demands of short-range\ncommunication in diverse 6G use cases. In the context of In-Factory scenarios,\neffective power control is critical to mitigating the impact of interference\nresulting from potentially high subnetwork density. Existing approaches to\npower control in this domain have predominantly emphasized the data plane,\noften overlooking the impact of signaling overhead. Furthermore, prior work has\ntypically adopted a network-centric perspective, relying on the assumption of\ncomplete and up-to-date channel state information (CSI) being readily available\nat the central controller. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed to enable access points to\nautonomously learn both signaling and power control protocols in an In-Factory\nSubnetwork environment. By formulating the problem as a partially observable\nMarkov decision process (POMDP) and leveraging multi-agent proximal policy\noptimization (MAPPO), the proposed approach achieves significant advantages.\nThe simulation results demonstrate that the learning-based method reduces\nsignaling overhead by a factor of 8 while maintaining a buffer flush rate that\nlags the ideal \"Genie\" approach by only 5%.",

It\nensures that both positive and negative signals contribute, treating the\nactivation vector as a whole. Depending on the application, several variations\nof this technique are presented, with a resolution scale hyperparameter to\nprobe different angular scales. Using this method, multiple examples are\nprovided that demonstrate embedded representations tend to be axis-aligned with\nthe privileged basis. This is not necessarily the standard basis, and it is\nfound that activation functions directly result in privileged bases. Hence, it\nprovides a direct causal link between functional form symmetry breaking and\nrepresentational alignment, explaining why representations have a tendency to\nalign with the neuron basis. Therefore, using this method, we begin to answer\nthe fundamental question of what causes the observed tendency of\nrepresentations to align with neurons. Finally, examples of so-called\ngrandmother neurons are found in a variety of networks.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable sensitivity of the luminescent properties of Eu3+ ions to\nstructural changes in host materials has been well-explored for years. However,\nthe application of this feature of Eu3+ in materials exhibiting thermally\ninduced structural phase transitions for the development of luminescent\nthermometers has only recently been proposed. The narrow operating range of\nsuch thermometers necessitates the exploration of new host materials. In\nresponse to this demand, this study carefully analyzes the spectroscopic\nproperties of X as a function of temperature and dopant ion concentration. As\ndemonstrated, X undergoes a phase transition from a low-temperature monoclinic\nphase to a high-temperature trigonal structure, resulting in significant\nchanges in both the emission spectrum shape of Eu ions and the depopulation\nkinetics of the 5D0 level. Consequently, X can be utilized as both a\nratiometric and a lifetime-based luminescence thermometer, achieving maximal\nrelative sensitivities of 3.4 and 1.0 or the respective approaches.\nAdditionally, this work highlights how increasing the concentration of Eu3+\nions enables the tuning of the thermal operating range to achieve optimal\nthermometric performance. Moreover, an implementation of ratiometric approach\nof temperature sensing and imaging with X using digital camera without filters\nwas demonstrated. This is the first report that demonstrates thermal imaging\nusing Eu3+-solely doped phosphor. This finding underscores the potential of X\nas a versatile host material for advanced luminescent thermometry applications.",

We\ndetermine QPOs using multiple analysis methods applied to the CSS-V, ZTFg/r\nband light curves, and additionally, combined with the characteristics of broad\nemission lines and explores potential mechanisms for the QPOs, including jet\nand disk precession models. Two distinct periodicities, $1103\\pm260$days and\n$243\\pm29$days, are identified in the ZTF g/r-band light curves with confidence\nlevel exceeding $5\\sigma$, through four different techniques. Meanwhile, the\n$1103\\pm260$days periodicity is also clearly detected in the CSS V-band light\ncurve. The optical periodicities suggest a BSMBH system candidate in SDSS\nJ1004+1510, with an estimated total virial BH mass of $(1.13\\pm0.14)\\times10^8\nM_{\\odot}$ and a space separation of $0.0053\\pm0.0016$pc for the periodicity of\n$1103\\pm260$days. The second periodicity of $243\\pm29$days could be attributed\nto harmonic oscillations, considering $(1103\\pm260)/(243\\pm29)\\sim4.54\\pm0.47$\nwith large scatters. However, if the periodicity of $243\\pm29$days was from an\nindependent QPO, a triple BH system candidate on sub-pc scale could be probably\nexpected, with space separations of $0.00036\\pm0.00004$pc between a close BSMBH\nsystem and of $0.0053\\pm0.0016$pc between the BSMBH system and the third BH,\nafter considering similar BH mass of the third BH as the total mass of the\ncentral BSMBH. These findings strongly demonstrate that combined light curves\nfrom the different sky survey projects can lead to more reliable QPOs\ncandidates to be detected, and also indicate higher quality light curves could\nbe helpful to find probably potential QPOs with multiple periodicities leading\nto rare detections of candidates for sub-pc triple BH systems.",

    "abstract": "Modal methods for simulating vibrations of strings, membranes, and plates are\nwidely used in acoustics and physically informed audio synthesis. However,\ntraditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von\nK\\'arm\\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability,\nlimiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast,\ndifferentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library,\nproviding efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling.\nBenchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based\nimplementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse\nmodelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical\nparameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and\nexperimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to\ninitialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability\nand more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to\nsupport future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling\nand sound synthesis.",

Automatic ME\nrecognition (MER) holds valuable applications in fields such as criminal\ninvestigation and psychological diagnosis. The Facial Action Coding System\n(FACS) encodes expressions by identifying activations of specific facial action\nunits (AUs), serving as a key reference for ME analysis. However, current MER\nmethods typically limit AU utilization to defining regions of interest (ROIs)\nor relying on specific prior knowledge, often resulting in limited performance\nand poor generalization. To address this, we integrate the CLIP model's\npowerful cross-modal semantic alignment capability into MER and propose a novel\napproach namely MER-CLIP. Specifically, we convert AU labels into detailed\ntextual descriptions of facial muscle movements, guiding fine-grained\nspatiotemporal ME learning by aligning visual dynamics and textual AU-based\nrepresentations. Additionally, we introduce an Emotion Inference Module to\ncapture the nuanced relationships between ME patterns and emotions with\nhigher-level semantic understanding. To mitigate overfitting caused by the\nscarcity of ME data, we put forward LocalStaticFaceMix, an effective data\naugmentation strategy blending facial images to enhance facial diversity while\npreserving critical ME features. Finally, comprehensive experiments on four\nbenchmark ME datasets confirm the superiority of MER-CLIP.

While the integration of\nhierarchical lightweight networks has become a prevalent strategy for enhancing\nefficiency in UAV tracking, it often results in a significant drop in network\ncapacity, which further exacerbates challenges in UAV scenarios, such as\nfrequent occlusions and extreme changes in viewing angles. To address these\nissues, we introduce a novel family of UAV trackers, termed CGTrack, which\ncombines explicit and implicit techniques to expand network capacity within a\ncoarse-to-fine framework.

We consider codes of rate $\\epsilon$-close to\ncapacity, and aim to bound the dependence of the output list size $L$ on\n$\\epsilon$, the input list size $\\ell$, and the alphabet size $q$. Prior to our\nwork, the best upper bound was $L = q^{O(\\ell/\\epsilon)}$ (Zyablov and Pinsker,\nProb. Per. Inf. 1981).\n  Previous work has identified cases in which linear codes provably perform\nworse than non-linear codes with respect to list-recovery. While there exist\nnon-linear codes that achieve $L=O(\\ell/\\epsilon)$, we know that $L \\ge\n\\ell^{\\Omega(1/\\epsilon)}$ is necessary for list recovery from erasures over\nfields of small characteristic, and for list recovery from errors over large\nalphabets. We show that in other relevant regimes there is no significant price\nto pay for linearity, in the sense that we get the correct dependence on the\ngap-to-capacity $\\epsilon$ and go beyond the Zyablov-Pinsker bound for the\nfirst time. Specifically, when $q$ is constant and $\\epsilon$ approaches zero:\n  - For list-recovery from erasures over prime fields, we show that $L \\leq\nC_1/\\epsilon$. By prior work, such a result cannot be obtained for\nlow-characteristic fields.\n  - For list-recovery from errors over arbitrary fields, we prove that $L \\leq\nC_2/\\epsilon$.\n  Above, $C_1$ and $C_2$ depend on the decoding radius, input list size, and\nfield size. We provide concrete bounds on the constants above, and the upper\nbounds on $L$ improve upon the Zyablov-Pinsker bound whenever $q\\leq\n2^{(1/\\epsilon)^c}$ for some small universal constant $c>0$.",

Using perturbation theory and mean-field approximations, we derive\nanalytical expressions for the indirect influence in terms of structural\nproperties of random networks.

These estimates are often inaccurate, resulting\nin inefficient resource use and the loss of unsaved work if a job times out\nshortly before reaching its next checkpoint. This work proposes a novel\nfeedback-driven autonomy loop that dynamically adjusts HPC job time limits\nbased on checkpoint progress reported by applications. Our approach monitors\ncheckpoint intervals and queued jobs, enabling informed decisions to either\nearly cancel a job after its last completed checkpoint or extend the time limit\nsufficiently to accommodate the next checkpoint. The objective is to minimize\ntail waste, that is, the computation that occurs between the last checkpoint\nand the termination of a job, which is not saved and hence wasted. Through\nexperiments conducted on a subset of a production workload trace, we show a 95%\nreduction of tail waste, which equates to saving approximately 1.3% of the\ntotal CPU time that would otherwise be wasted. We propose various policies that\ncombine early cancellation and time limit extension, achieving tail waste\nreduction while improving scheduling metrics such as weighted average job wait\ntime.

The magnetic properties of\nthe Fe-As thin film have been investigated by Xray magnetic circular dichroism\n(XMCD) and magnetic circular dichroism in hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy\n(MCD-HAXPES) to elucidate the role of As ions in the IMA.

The\nestimations of the magnetic moments of Fe using the XMCD sum rules have\nrevealed that the orbital magnetic moment is isotropic and the magnetic dipole\nterm is anisotropic.

But over ocean, warming is suppressed for\nhot days, implying a narrowing of the temperature distribution. Previous\nstudies have developed theories based on convective coupling to interpret\nchanges in extreme temperatures over land. Building on that work, the\ncontrasting temperature distribution responses over land and ocean are\ninvestigated using a novel theoretical framework based on local convective\ncoupling. The theory highlights five physical mechanisms with the potential to\ndrive differential warming across temperature percentiles: free-tropospheric\ntemperature change, relative humidity change, convective available potential\nenergy (CAPE) change, the hot-get-hotter mechanism, and the drier-get-hotter\nmechanism. Hot days are relatively dry over land due to limited moisture\navailability, which drives the drier-get-hotter mechanism and amplified warming\nof the warm tail of the distribution. This mechanism is the primary factor\nexplaining the contrasting responses of hot days over land and ocean to climate\nchange. But other mechanisms also contribute to changing the temperature\ndistribution, with changes in free-tropospheric temperature and surface\nrelative humidity having large influences (which partially cancel).",

Offloading a computation to the many-core\nacceleration fabric implies synchronization and communication overheads which\ncan hamper overall performance and efficiency, particularly for small and\nfine-grained parallel tasks. In this work, we present a detailed,\ncycle-accurate quantitative analysis of the offload overheads on Occamy, an\nopen-source massively parallel RISC-V based heterogeneous MPSoC. We study how\nthe overheads scale with the number of accelerator cores. We explore an\napproach to drastically reduce these overheads by co-designing the hardware and\nthe offload routines. Notably, we demonstrate that by incorporating multicast\ncapabilities into the Network-on-Chip of a large (200+ cores) accelerator\nfabric we can improve offloaded application runtimes by as much as 2.3x,\nrestoring more than 70% of the ideally attainable speedups. Finally, we propose\na quantitative model to estimate the runtime of selected applications\naccounting for the offload overheads, with an error consistently below 15%.",

A comparison between measuring directly in front\nof the eye and measuring at the side of the head of an Alderson phantom showed\nno significant influence on the resulting $H_\\text{p}(3)$ for different\nradiation qualities and angles. In addition, to account for the absorption\neffect of radiation safety glasses, pieces of lead glass were attached to the\nfront and side of the dosemeter.

Furthermore, the results did not reproduce\nprevious findings where larger dose values were found for Dosepix behind lead\nglass pieces than for the TLDs behind radiation safety glasses.

For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of\nHamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes\nphysical properties of these states, including the variational energy,\nbipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and\ntwo-site correlation functions.

This problem is emphasized in cluttered indoor spaces where service\nrobotic platforms usually operate. Both model-based and learning-based methods\nare currently under investigation to precisely predict the UWB error patterns.\nDespite the great capability in approximating strong non-linearity,\nlearning-based methods often do not consider environmental factors and require\ndata collection and re-training for unseen data distributions, making them not\npractically feasible on a large scale.

To\naddress these anomalies, we seek out opposing forces that can help correct\nthem. Therefore, we introduce the Mechanics Complementary Model-based Framework\nfor the 3D-AD task (MC4AD), which generates internal and external corrective\nforces for each point. We first propose a Diverse Anomaly-Generation (DA-Gen)\nmodule designed to simulate various types of anomalies. Next, we present the\nCorrective Force Prediction Network (CFP-Net), which uses complementary\nrepresentations for point-level analysis to simulate the different\ncontributions from internal and external corrective forces. To ensure the\ncorrective forces are constrained effectively, we have developed a combined\nloss function that includes a new symmetric loss and an overall loss. Notably,\nwe implement a Hierarchical Quality Control (HQC) strategy based on a three-way\ndecision process and contribute a dataset titled Anomaly-IntraVariance, which\nincorporates intraclass variance to evaluate our model. As a result, the\nproposed MC4AD has been proven effective through theory and experimentation.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that our approach yields nine\nstate-of-the-art performances, achieving optimal results with minimal\nparameters and the fastest inference speed across five existing datasets, in\naddition to the proposed Anomaly-IntraVariance dataset.

Based\non 4-year LISA observation of 35 resolvable DNS systems under an optimistic\nscenario, we estimate that 6 (22) spinning NS components could be detected by\nthe next-generation ground-based GW detector, Cosmic Explorer, under\nlog-uniform (uniform) sampling of NS structural parameters. For these dual-line\nsources, the median signal-to-noise ratio achievable with Cosmic Explorer is\napproximately 20--30. Through the dual-line GW detection strategy, the relative\nmeasurement accuracy of the NS moment of inertia is estimated to be $\\sim 8\\%$.",

Many existing VLN approaches typically follow an 'observe-and-reason'\nschema, that is, agents observe the environment and decide on the next action\nto take based on the visual observations of their surroundings. They often face\nchallenges in long-horizon scenarios due to limitations in immediate\nobservation and vision-language modality gaps. To overcome this, we present\nVISTA, a novel framework that employs an 'imagine-and-align' navigation\nstrategy. Specifically, we leverage the generative prior of pre-trained\ndiffusion models for dynamic visual imagination conditioned on both local\nobservations and high-level language instructions. A Perceptual Alignment\nFilter module then grounds these goal imaginations against current\nobservations, guiding an interpretable and structured reasoning process for\naction selection. Experiments show that VISTA sets new state-of-the-art results\non Room-to-Room (R2R) and RoboTHOR benchmarks, e.g.,+3.6% increase in Success\nRate on R2R. Extensive ablation analysis underscores the value of integrating\nforward-looking imagination, perceptual alignment, and structured reasoning for\nrobust navigation in long-horizon environments.",

We find non-commercial\nincentives to fill an important gap, ensuring longevity and sustainability of\nprojects.

However, these models face significant scalability challenges,\nparticularly when processing proteins with long amino acid sequences (e.g.,\nsequence length > 1,000). The primary bottleneck that arises from the\nexponential growth in activation sizes is driven by the unique data structure\nin PPM, which introduces an additional dimension that leads to substantial\nmemory and computational demands. These limitations have hindered the effective\nscaling of PPM for real-world applications, such as analyzing large proteins or\ncomplex multimers with critical biological and pharmaceutical relevance.\n  In this paper, we present LightNobel, the first hardware-software co-designed\naccelerator developed to overcome scalability limitations on the sequence\nlength in PPM. At the software level, we propose Token-wise Adaptive Activation\nQuantization (AAQ), which leverages unique token-wise characteristics, such as\ndistogram patterns in PPM activations, to enable fine-grained quantization\ntechniques without compromising accuracy. At the hardware level, LightNobel\nintegrates the multi-precision reconfigurable matrix processing unit (RMPU) and\nversatile vector processing unit (VVPU) to enable the efficient execution of\nAAQ. Through these innovations, LightNobel achieves up to 8.44x, 8.41x speedup\nand 37.29x, 43.35x higher power efficiency over the latest NVIDIA A100 and H100\nGPUs, respectively, while maintaining negligible accuracy loss.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that the attention maps of the widely popular DINOv2\nmodel exhibit artifacts, which hurt both model interpretability and performance\non dense image tasks. These artifacts emerge due to the model repurposing patch\ntokens with redundant local information for the storage of global image\ninformation. To address this problem, additional register tokens have been\nincorporated in which the model can store such information instead. We\ncarefully examine the influence of these register tokens on the relationship\nbetween global and local image features, showing that while register tokens\nyield cleaner attention maps, these maps do not accurately reflect the\nintegration of local image information in large models. Instead, global\ninformation is dominated by information extracted from register tokens, leading\nto a disconnect between local and global features. Inspired by these findings,\nwe show that the CLS token itself, which can be interpreted as a register,\nleads to a very similar phenomenon in models without explicit register tokens.\nOur work shows that care must be taken when interpreting attention maps of\nlarge ViTs. Further, by clearly attributing the faulty behaviour to register\nand CLS tokens, we show a path towards more interpretable vision models.",

For the first time, we applied a deep learning\nmethod to the search for PRGs. We visually inspected galaxies from existing\ncatalogs of PRGs to create a training sample based on high-quality SDSS images.\nSince the resulting training sample was extremely small (87 strong and good\nPRGs), we applied augmentation, image segmentation, and ensemble learning\ntechniques. However, most effective method was transfer learning with its\nability to enlarge the training sample by synthetic images generated by GALFIT.\nTo examine deep learning approach for finding new PRGs we used the SDSS catalog\nof galaxies at z < 0.1. The method with synthetic images showed that even with\novertraining we were able to find galaxies with a ring pattern. Our deep\nlearning approach has resulted in the discovery of three PRGs (SDSS\nJ140644.42+471602.0; SDSS J133650.48+492745.3; SDSS J095717.30+364953.5).

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a methodology for shortlisting protection system\nconfigurations for large HVDC switching stations, which are expected in\nmultiterminal HVDC grids and electrical energy hubs (or energy islands). This\nnovel approach focuses on the configuration of protection equipment and the\narrangement of lines and converters in various protection zones, instead of\nexpert decisions on protection strategies based on numerous simulations. A\ngraph-based approach that allows high-level evaluation of possible DC fault\nimpacts is presented. This fault impact evaluation method can evaluate many\npossible protection configurations allowing the selection of less obvious\nchoices, as experts cannot consider all possible configurations, especially\nwhen the switching station size increases. A filtering process is applied to\nreduce the number of possible configurations based on multiple protection\nperformance metrics which are evaluated for different power flow scenarios. The\nresults for these performance metrics can be compared for configurations with\ndifferent numbers of HVDC circuit breakers to assess the benefit of increasing\nthe amount of protection equipment in different network topologies. It is also\nshown that, through continued filtering using additional performance metrics or\nfault scenarios, the number of possible breaker, cable and converter\nconfigurations can be further reduced, leading to a protection design that is\nwell suited for many operational scenarios. The results of the shortlisting\nprocess provide insights on the required number of HVDC circuit breakers to\nlimit fault impacts to a given value. Moreover, observed trends in the results\ncould, in future studies, contribute to new design principles and priorities,\nallowing system developers to more effectively design HVDC protection systems\nfor different operational scenarios and possible investment levels.",

In scenarios where there is a gap between trace\nevents and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation\nproblem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the\ncorresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that\nframes the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract\nArgumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event\ninterpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations\nfor those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where\nevent-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this\nreasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy\ncomputation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to\nsuggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way.\nHowever, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of\nmanually-annotated example traces.

However, existing these multi-modal approaches often\ndirectly fuse information from different modalities, overlooking the potential\nof intermodal interactions and failing to adequately capture the complex\nhigher-order relationships and invariant features between molecules. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a structure-awareness-based multi-modal\nself-supervised molecular representation pre-training framework (MMSA) designed\nto enhance molecular graph representations by leveraging invariant knowledge\nbetween molecules. The framework consists of two main modules: the multi-modal\nmolecular representation learning module and the structure-awareness module.\nThe multi-modal molecular representation learning module collaboratively\nprocesses information from different modalities of the same molecule to\novercome intermodal differences and generate a unified molecular embedding.\nSubsequently, the structure-awareness module enhances the molecular\nrepresentation by constructing a hypergraph structure to model higher-order\ncorrelations between molecules. This module also introduces a memory mechanism\nfor storing typical molecular representations, aligning them with memory\nanchors in the memory bank to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving\nthe model generalization ability.

    "abstract": "Split Learning (SL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed deep\nlearning, allowing resource-constrained clients to offload portions of their\nmodel computation to servers while maintaining collaborative learning. However,\nrecent research has demonstrated that SL remains vulnerable to a range of\nprivacy and security threats, including information leakage, model inversion,\nand adversarial attacks. While various defense mechanisms have been proposed, a\nsystematic understanding of the attack landscape and corresponding\ncountermeasures is still lacking. In this study, we present a comprehensive\ntaxonomy of attacks and defenses in SL, categorizing them along three key\ndimensions: employed strategies, constraints, and effectiveness.

    "abstract": "In this paper we present GeoThinneR, an R package for efficient and flexible\nspatial thinning of species occurrence data. Spatial thinning is a widely used\npreprocessing step in species distribution modeling (SDM) that can help reduce\nsampling bias, but existing R implementations rely on brute-force algorithms\nthat scale poorly with large datasets. GeoThinneR implements multiple thinning\napproaches, including ensuring a minimum distance between points, subsampling\npoints on a grid, and filtering based on decimal precision. To handle large\ndatasets, it introduces two optimized algorithms based on local kd-trees and\nadaptive neighbor estimation, which greatly reduce memory usage and execution\ntime. Additional functionalities such as group-wise thinning and point\nprioritization are included to facilitate its use in SDM workflows. We here\nprovide performance benchmarks using both simulated and real-world data to\ndemonstrate substantial performance improvements over existing tools.",

    "abstract": "This work provides the first comparison of the symmetron and dilaton fields\nin white dwarfs. We show how these screening mechanisms behave inside {such\nstars} and their impact on stellar properties. Employing a custom-developed\nshooting method, we solve the scalar-tensor equilibrium equations in the\nNewtonian approximation. We consider a Chandrasekhar equation of state and\nexamine a range of potential mass scales and coupling strengths for both\nfields. Both fields enhance the pressure drop in low-density white dwarfs,\nleading to smaller stellar masses, radii, and luminosities. Unlike chameleon\nmodels, their effects are suppressed in more massive stars, with symmetron\nfields fully decoupling and dilaton fields weakening but not vanishing.\nConsequently, no mass-radius curve for screened white dwarfs exceeds the\nNewtonian prediction in any of these three mechanisms. The mass-radius\ndeviations are generally more pronounced at lower densities, depending on model\nparameters. Due to their common runaway potential, we confirm that dilaton and\nchameleon fields display similar field and gradient profiles. In contrast, due\nto their environment-dependent coupling, the dilaton and symmetron mechanisms\nexhibit stronger density-dependent screening effects. These findings highlight\nboth phenomenological differences and theoretical similarities among these\nmechanisms, motivating asteroseismology studies to constrain the symmetron and\ndilaton parameter spaces.",

    "abstract": "With the widespread application of facial image data across various domains,\nthe efficient storage and transmission of facial images has garnered\nsignificant attention. However, the existing learned face image compression\nmethods often produce unsatisfactory reconstructed image quality at low bit\nrates. Simply adapting diffusion-based compression methods to facial\ncompression tasks results in reconstructed images that perform poorly in\ndownstream applications due to insufficient preservation of high-frequency\ninformation. To further explore the diffusion prior in facial image\ncompression, we propose Facial Image Compression with a Stable Diffusion Prior\n(FaSDiff), a method that preserves consistency through frequency enhancement.\nFaSDiff employs a high-frequency-sensitive compressor in an end-to-end\nframework to capture fine image details and produce robust visual prompts.\nAdditionally, we introduce a hybrid low-frequency enhancement module that\ndisentangles low-frequency facial semantics and stably modulates the diffusion\nprior alongside visual prompts. The proposed modules allow FaSDiff to leverage\ndiffusion priors for superior human visual perception while minimizing\nperformance loss in machine vision due to semantic inconsistency. Extensive\nexperiments show that FaSDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in balancing\nhuman visual quality and machine vision accuracy. The code will be released\nafter the paper is accepted.",

This was shown through a detailed characterisation of the Digital\nPixel Test Structure (DPTS) prototype exposed to X-rays and ionising beams, and\nthe results are presented in this article. Additionally, the sensor was further\ninvestigated through studies of the fake-hit rate, the linearity of the\nfront-end in the range 1.7-28 keV, the performance after ionising irradiation,\nand the detection efficiency of inclined tracks in the range 0-45$^\\circ$.",

The optical response of monolayers is\nentangled with the substrate on which they are grown or deposited on, often a\ntwo-dimensional material itself. Understanding how the properties of the\ntwo-dimensional monolayers can be tuned via the substrate is therefore\nessential. Here we employ angle-resolved reflectivity and photoluminescence\nspectroscopy on highly ordered molecular monolayers on hexagonal boron nitride\n(hBN) to systematically investigate the angle-dependent optical response as a\nfunction of the thickness of the hBN flake. We observe that light reflection\nand emission occur in a strongly directed fashion and that the direction of\nlight reflection and emission is dictated by the hBN flake thickness. Transfer\nmatrix simulations reproduce the experimental data and show that optical\ninterference effects in hBN are at the origin of the angle-dependent optical\nproperties. While our study focuses on molecular monolayers on hBN, our\nfindings are general and relevant for any 2D material placed on top of a\nsubstrate. Our findings demonstrate the need to carefully choose substrate\nparameters for a given experimental geometry but also highlight opportunities\nin applications such as lighting technology where the direction of light\nemission can be controlled via substrate thickness.",

Employing state-of-the-art ab initio\nmethods based on all-electron density-functional theory and the solution of the\nBethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we compute and analyze the XANES at the sodium\nand potassium K-edges, potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, and antimony K and\nL$_2$-edges. Our analysis reveals distinct spectral fingerprints for the\nexperimentally known phases, cubic Na$_2$KSb and hexagonal NaK$_2$Sb,\nparticularly at the sodium K-edge and potassium L$_{2,3}$-edge, providing\nuseful indications for their identification in complex samples. We further\ninvestigate the role of excitonic effects by comparing BSE spectra and their\ncounterparts obtained in the independent-particle approximation, highlighting\ntheir significant influence on the near-edge features, especially for shallower\ncore levels. Our findings offer a useful theoretical benchmark for the\nexperimental characterization and diagnostics of sodium-based MAA\nphotocathodes, complementing experiments on resolved phases and providing the\nspectral fingerprints of computationally predicted phases that could emerge in\npolycrystalline samples.",

    "abstract": "The inherent thermal storage capacity of buildings brings considerable\nthermal flexibility to the heating/cooling loads, which are promising demand\nresponse resources for power systems. It is widely believed that integrating\nthe thermal flexibility of buildings into the distribution system can improve\nthe operating economy and reliability of the system. However, the private\ninformation of the buildings needs to be transferred to the distribution system\noperator (DSO) to achieve a coordinated optimization, bringing serious privacy\nconcerns to users. Given this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserved\noptimal dispatch approach for the distribution system incorporating buildings.\nUsing it, the DSO can exploit the thermal flexibility of buildings without\naccessing their private information, such as model parameters and indoor\ntemperature profiles. Specifically, we first develop an optimal dispatch model\nfor the distribution system integrating buildings, which can be extended to\nother storage-like flexibility resources. Second, we reveal that the\nprivacy-preserved integration of buildings is a joint privacy preservation\nproblem for both parameters and state variables and then design a\nprivacy-preserved algorithm based on transformation-based encryption,\nconstraint relaxation, and constraint extension techniques. Besides, we\nimplement a detailed privacy analysis for the proposed method, considering both\nsemi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Case studies demonstrate\nthe accuracy, privacy-preserved performance, and computational efficiency of\nthe proposed method.",

But its deployment in increasingly\nsophisticated, critical, and sensitive areas affecting individuals, the groups\nthey belong to, and society as a whole raises critical concerns around\nfairness, transparency and robustness, among others. As the complexity and\nscale of ML systems and of the settings in which they are deployed grow, so\ndoes the need for responsible ML methods that address these challenges while\nproviding guaranteed performance in deployment.\n  Mixed-integer optimization (MIO) offers a powerful framework for embedding\nresponsible ML considerations directly into the learning process while\nmaintaining performance. For example, it enables learning of inherently\ntransparent models that can conveniently incorporate fairness or other domain\nspecific constraints. This tutorial paper provides an accessible and\ncomprehensive introduction to this topic discussing both theoretical and\npractical aspects. It outlines some of the core principles of responsible ML,\ntheir importance in applications, and the practical utility of MIO for building\nML models that align with these principles. Through examples and mathematical\nformulations, it illustrates practical strategies and available tools for\nefficiently solving MIO problems for responsible ML.

    "abstract": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is critical for clinical diagnostics but is\noften limited by long acquisition times and low signal-to-noise ratios,\nespecially in modalities like diffusion and functional MRI. The multi-contrast\nnature of MRI presents a valuable opportunity for cross-modal enhancement,\nwhere high-resolution (HR) modalities can serve as references to boost the\nquality of their low-resolution (LR) counterparts-motivating the development of\nMulti-Contrast Super-Resolution (MCSR) techniques. Prior work has shown that\nleveraging complementary contrasts can improve SR performance; however,\neffective feature extraction and fusion across modalities with varying\nresolutions remains a major challenge. Moreover, existing MCSR methods often\nassume fixed resolution settings and all require large, perfectly paired\ntraining datasets-conditions rarely met in real-world clinical environments. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel Modular Multi-Contrast\nSuper-Resolution (MCSR) framework that eliminates the need for paired training\ndata and supports arbitrary upscaling. Our method decouples the MCSR task into\ntwo stages: (1) Unpaired Cross-Modal Synthesis (U-CMS), which translates a\nhigh-resolution reference modality into a synthesized version of the target\ncontrast, and (2) Unsupervised Super-Resolution (U-SR), which reconstructs the\nfinal output using implicit neural representations (INRs) conditioned on\nspatial coordinates. This design enables scale-agnostic and anatomically\nfaithful reconstruction by bridging un-paired cross-modal synthesis with\nunsupervised resolution enhancement. Experiments show that our method achieves\nsuperior performance at 4x and 8x upscaling, with improved fidelity and\nanatomical consistency over existing baselines. Our framework demonstrates\nstrong potential for scalable, subject-specific, and data-efficient MCSR in\nreal-world clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Cuckoo filters are space-efficient approximate set membership data structures\nwith a controllable false positive rate (FPR) and zero false negatives, similar\nto Bloom filters. In contrast to Bloom filters, Cuckoo filters store multi-bit\nfingerprints of keys in a hash table using variants of Cuckoo hashing, allowing\neach fingerprint to be stored at a small number of possible locations. Existing\nCuckoo filters use fingerprints of $(k+3)$ bits per key and an additional space\noverhead factor of at least $1.05$ to achieve an FPR of $2^{-k}$. For $k=10$,\nthis amounts to $1.365\\, kn$ bits to store $n$ keys, which is better than\n$1.443\\, kn$ bits for Bloom filters. The $+3$ for the fingerprint size is\nrequired to balance out the multiplied FPR caused by looking for the\nfingerprint at several locations. In the original Cuckoo filter, the number of\nhash table buckets is restricted to a power of 2, which may lead to much larger\nspace overheads, up to $2.1\\, (1+3/k)\\, kn$ bits.\n  We present two improvements of Cuckoo filters. First, we remove the\nrestriction that the number of buckets must be a power of 2 by using a\ndifferent placement strategy. Second, we reduce the space overhead factor of\nCuckoo filters to $1.06 \\, (1+2/k)$ by using overlapping windows instead of\ndisjoint buckets to maintain the load threshold of the hash table, while\nreducing the number of alternative slots where any fingerprint may be found.\n  A detailed evaluation demonstrates that the alternative memory layout based\non overlapping windows decreases the size of Cuckoo filters not only in theory,\nbut also in practice. A comparison with other state-of-the art filter types,\nPrefix filters and Vector Quotient filters (VQFs), shows that the reduced space\noverhead makes windowed Cuckoo filters the smallest filters supporting online\ninsertions, with similarly fast queries, but longer insertion times.",

However,\ntraditional manual annotation was labor-intensive and inefficient,\nnecessitating automation. This paper proposes a lightweight and fully automated\npipeline for knot detection and pairing based on machine learning techniques.\nIn the detection stage, high-resolution surface images of wooden boards were\ncollected using industrial-grade cameras, and a large-scale dataset was\nmanually annotated and preprocessed. After the transfer learning, the YOLOv8l\nachieves an mAP@0.5 of 0.887. In the pairing stage, detected knots were\nanalyzed and paired based on multidimensional feature extraction. A triplet\nneural network was used to map the features into a latent space, enabling\nclustering algorithms to identify and pair corresponding knots. The triplet\nnetwork with learnable weights achieved a pairing accuracy of 0.85. Further\nanalysis revealed that he distances from the knot's start and end points to the\nbottom of the wooden board, and the longitudinal coordinates play crucial roles\nin achieving high pairing accuracy. Our experiments validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed solution, demonstrating the potential of AI in advancing wood\nscience and industry.",

In the Local Group (LG), satellite quenching has been shown to be\nhighly efficient, affecting nearly all satellites except the most massive ones.\nWhile recent surveys are studying Milky Way (MW) analogs to assess how\nrepresentative our LG is, the dominant physical mechanisms behind satellite\nquenching in MW-mass halos remain under debate. Aims: We analyze satellite\nquenching within the same MW-mass halo, simulated using various widely-used\nastrophysical codes, each using different hydrodynamic methods and implementing\ndifferent supernovae feedback recipes. The goal is to determine whether\nquenched fractions, quenching timescales and the dominant quenching mechanisms\nare consistent across codes or if they show sensitivity to the specific\nhydrodynamic method and supernovae (SNe) feedback physics employed. Methods: We\nuse a subset of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a MW-mass\nhalo from the multiple-code AGORA CosmoRun suite. Results: We find that the\nquenched fraction is consistent with the latest SAGA survey results within its\n1$\\sigma$ host-to-host scatter across all the models. Regarding quenching\ntimescales, all the models reproduce the trend observed in the ELVES survey, LG\nobservations, and previous simulations: the less massive the satellite, the\nshorter its quenching timescale. All our models converge on the dominant\nquenching mechanisms: strangulation halts cold gas accretion and ram pressure\nstripping is the predominant mechanism for gas removal, particularly effective\nin satellites with $M_* < 10^8\\, M_\\odot$. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the\nstripping mechanisms differs among the codes, showing a strong sensitivity to\nthe different SNe feedback implementations and/or hydrodynamic methods\nemployed.",

To motivate clients to participate in OFL, it is crucial to\noffer appropriate incentives to offset the training resource consumption.\nHowever, the design of incentive mechanisms in OFL is constrained by the\ndynamic variability of Two-sided Incomplete Information (TII) concerning\nresources, where the server is unaware of the clients' dynamically changing\ncomputational resources, while clients lack knowledge of the real-time\ncommunication resources allocated by the server. To incentivize clients to\nparticipate in training by offering dynamic rewards to each arriving client, we\ndesign a novel Dynamic Bayesian persuasion pricing for online Federated\nlearning (DaringFed) under TII. Specifically, we begin by formulating the\ninteraction between the server and clients as a dynamic signaling and pricing\nallocation problem within a Bayesian persuasion game, and then demonstrate the\nexistence of a unique Bayesian persuasion Nash equilibrium. By deriving the\noptimal design of DaringFed under one-sided incomplete information, we further\nanalyze the approximate optimal design of DaringFed with a specific bound under\nTII. Finally, extensive evaluation conducted on real datasets demonstrate that\nDaringFed optimizes accuracy and converges speed by 16.99%, while experiments\nwith synthetic datasets validate the convergence of estimate unknown values and\nthe effectiveness of DaringFed in improving the server's utility by up to\n12.6%.",

The\nboundary profiles are similar to the ones predicted with zero-temperature GHD\nin the quasi-BEC regime, with deviations due to non-zero entropy effects.

For our data, we extract the initial rapidity distribution by\nfitting the boundary profile and we use a 3-parameter ansatz that goes beyond\nthe thermal assumption.

A surprising result\nin the outcomes for all three studies was that although verbal acknowledgment\nof an error was typically beneficial (as expected based on prior work), few\nsignificant differences appeared between the non-expletive and expletive error\nacknowledgment conditions (counter to our expectations). Within the cultural\ncontext of our work, the U.S., it seems that many users would likely not mind\nif robots curse, and may even find it relatable and humorous. This work signals\na promising and mischievous design space that challenges typical robot\ncharacter design.",

    "abstract": "Aeroelastic model testing is essential for evaluating the wind resistance\nperformance of long-span suspension bridges. In these models, truss girders are\ncommonly modelled by a discrete-stiffness system incorporating U-shaped springs\nto simulate elastic stiffness properties, including vertical bending, lateral\nbending, and torsional rigidity. The design of these U-shaped springs\nsignificantly influences the accuracy of aeroelastic model tests for\ntruss-girder suspension bridges. Traditional design approaches, however, lack\nan analytical foundation, relying instead on trial-and-error searches across\nthe full parameter space, which is computationally intensive and\ntime-consuming. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel\ndesign method that establishes closed-form equations for U-shaped spring\ndesign. The method simplifies the truss girder's supporting condition to a\ncantilever configuration and determines the corresponding elastic stiffness\nusing the principle of elastic-strain energy equivalence. These closed-form\nequations transform the design process into a non-smooth optimization problem,\naccounting for precision constraints inherent in practical fabrication.\nDerivative-free optimization algorithms, including the Nelder-Mead method,\nPattern Search method, and Genetic Algorithm, are employed to identify a\nglobally optimal solution. The proposed method is validated through its\napplication to a representative suspension bridge with a truss girder, with\nnumerical and experimental results confirming its accuracy and reliability.\nThis approach enhances aeroelastic model design techniques for long-span\nbridges by providing a theoretical framework for the design of U-shaped spring,\nreducing the optimization process to several seconds.",

As the\ndominant loss function for training classification models, minimizing\ncross-entropy (CE) loss maximizes the compactness and distinctiveness, i.e.,\nreaching neural collapse (NC). The recent works show that binary CE (BCE)\nperforms also well in multi-class tasks. In this paper, we compare BCE and CE\nin deep feature learning. For the first time, we prove that BCE can also\nmaximize the intra-class compactness and inter-class distinctiveness when\nreaching its minimum, i.e., leading to NC. We point out that CE measures the\nrelative values of decision scores in the model training, implicitly enhancing\nthe feature properties by classifying samples one-by-one. In contrast, BCE\nmeasures the absolute values of decision scores and adjust the\npositive/negative decision scores across all samples to uniformly high/low\nlevels. Meanwhile, the classifier biases in BCE present a substantial\nconstraint on the decision scores to explicitly enhance the feature properties\nin the training. The experimental results are aligned with above analysis, and\nshow that BCE could improve the classification and leads to better compactness\nand distinctiveness among sample features.

    "abstract": "Photon upconversion has potential applications in light-emitting diodes,\nphotocatalysis, bio-imaging, microscopy, 3D printing, and photovoltaics. Bulk\nlead-halide perovskite films have emerged as promising sensitisers for\nsolid-state photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation due to their\nexcellent optoelectronic properties. In this system, a perovskite sensitiser\nabsorbs photons and subsequently generates triplet excitons in an adjacent\nemitter material, where triplet-triplet annihilation can occur allowing for the\nemission of higher energy photons. However, a major loss pathway in\nperovskite-sensitised upconversion is the back-transfer of singlet excitons\nfrom the emitter to the sensitiser via F\\\"orster Resonance Energy Transfer. In\nthis investigation we introduce a 2D perovskite spacer layer between the bulk\nperovskite sensitiser and a rubrene emitter to mitigate back-transfer of\nsinglet excitons from rubrene to the bulk perovskite sensitiser. This\nmodification reveals the inherent balance between efficient triplet exciton\ntransfer across the interface with a potential barrier versus the mitigation of\nnear-field back-transfer by increasing the distance between the sensitiser and\nsinglet excitons in the emitter. Notably, the introduction of this spacer layer\nenhances the relative upconversion efficiency at lower excitation power\ndensities while also sustaining performance over extended timescales. This work\nrepresents significant progress toward the practical applications of\nperovskite-sensitised photon upconversion.",

Five cases were explored, with each scenario\nsimulated 1000 times. Findings suggest that producers often sell to the market\nrather than the cooperative due to higher prices.

It was shown in earlier work that the HV methods are\nsupraconvergent, providing that the discretization uses more unknowns in the\nupwind direction than the downwind one, similar to the \"upwind condition\" of\nclassical finite-difference schemes.

In this work, we\nfirst show by numerical evidence that a similar barrier exists for HV methods\nand make a conjecture on the sharp bound on the stencil. Next, we prove the\nexistence of stability barrier by showing that the semi-discretized HV methods\nare unstable given a stencil sufficiently biased towards the upwind direction.\nTighter barriers are then proved using combinatorical tools, and finally we\nextend the analysis to studying other Hermite-type methods built on\napproximating nodal solutions and derivatives, such as those widely used in\nHermite WENO methods.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion policies have demonstrated remarkable dexterity and robustness in\nintricate, high-dimensional robot manipulation tasks, while training from a\nsmall number of demonstrations. However, the reason for this performance\nremains a mystery. In this paper, we offer a surprising hypothesis: diffusion\npolicies essentially memorize an action lookup table -- and this is beneficial.\nWe posit that, at runtime, diffusion policies find the closest training image\nto the test image in a latent space, and recall the associated training action\nsequence, offering reactivity without the need for action generalization. This\nis effective in the sparse data regime, where there is not enough data density\nfor the model to learn action generalization. We support this claim with\nsystematic empirical evidence. Even when conditioned on wildly out of\ndistribution (OOD) images of cats and dogs, the Diffusion Policy still outputs\nan action sequence from the training data. With this insight, we propose a\nsimple policy, the Action Lookup Table (ALT), as a lightweight alternative to\nthe Diffusion Policy. Our ALT policy uses a contrastive image encoder as a hash\nfunction to index the closest corresponding training action sequence,\nexplicitly performing the computation that the Diffusion Policy implicitly\nlearns. We show empirically that for relatively small datasets, ALT matches the\nperformance of a diffusion model, while requiring only 0.0034 of the inference\ntime and 0.0085 of the memory footprint, allowing for much faster closed-loop\ninference with resource constrained robots. We also train our ALT policy to\ngive an explicit OOD flag when the distance between the runtime image is too\nfar in the latent space from the training images, giving a simple but effective\nruntime monitor.

    "abstract": "Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization has gained increasing attentions for\nmachine learning on graphs, as graph neural networks (GNNs) often exhibit\nperformance degradation under distribution shifts. Existing graph OOD methods\ntend to follow the basic ideas of invariant risk minimization and structural\ncausal models, interpreting the invariant knowledge across datasets under\nvarious distribution shifts as graph topology or graph spectrum. However, these\ninterpretations may be inconsistent with real-world scenarios, as neither\ninvariant topology nor spectrum is assured. In this paper, we advocate the\nlearnable random walk (LRW) perspective as the instantiation of invariant\nknowledge, and propose LRW-OOD to realize graph OOD generalization learning.\nInstead of employing fixed probability transition matrix (i.e.,\ndegree-normalized adjacency matrix), we parameterize the transition matrix with\nan LRW-sampler and a path encoder. Furthermore, we propose the kernel density\nestimation (KDE)-based mutual information (MI) loss to generate random walk\nsequences that adhere to OOD principles.

    "abstract": "High-frequency trading (HFT) is an investing strategy that continuously\nmonitors market states and places bid and ask orders at millisecond speeds.\nTraditional HFT approaches fit models with historical data and assume that\nfuture market states follow similar patterns. This limits the effectiveness of\nany single model to the specific conditions it was trained for. Additionally,\nthese models achieve optimal solutions only under specific market conditions,\nsuch as assumptions about stock price's stochastic process, stable order flow,\nand the absence of sudden volatility. Real-world markets, however, are dynamic,\ndiverse, and frequently volatile. To address these challenges, we propose the\nFlowHFT, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching policy.\nFlowHFT simultaneously learns strategies from numerous expert models, each\nproficient in particular market scenarios. As a result, our framework can\nadaptively adjust investment decisions according to the prevailing market\nstate. Furthermore, FlowHFT incorporates a grid-search fine-tuning mechanism.\nThis allows it to refine strategies and achieve superior performance even in\ncomplex or extreme market scenarios where expert strategies may be suboptimal.\nWe test FlowHFT in multiple market environments. We first show that flow\nmatching policy is applicable in stochastic market environments, thus enabling\nFlowHFT to learn trading strategies under different market conditions.

Most existing membrane models,\nhowever, tend to adopt (quasi-)two-dimensional descriptions that neglect\nthickness-dependent phenomena relevant to internal membrane mechanics, and thus\ndo not fully account for the complex coupling of lipid membranes with their\nsurrounding fluid media. Therefore, explicitly incorporating membrane thickness\neffects in lipid membrane models will enable a more accurate description of the\ninfluence of membrane/fluid coupling on transport phenomena in the vicinity of\nthe bilayer surfaces. Here, we present a continuum model for membrane\nfluctuations that accounts for finite membrane thickness and resolves\nhydrodynamic interactions between the bilayer and its surrounding fluid. By\napplying linear response analysis, we observe that membrane thickness-mediated\neffects, such as bending-induced lipid reorientations, can generate shear flows\nclose to the membrane surface that slow down the relaxation of nanometer scale\nshape fluctuations. Additionally, we reveal the emergence of pressure inversion\nand flow reversal near the membrane interfaces, accompanied by localized\nstagnation points. Among these, extensional stagnation points give rise to a\nnovel mode of bulk dissipation, originating from bending-induced compression\nand expansion of the membrane surfaces and their coupling to shear stresses in\nthe fluid. Our findings identify membrane thickness as a key factor in\nnanoscale hydrodynamics and suggest that its effects may be detectable in\nfluctuation spectra and can be relevant to interfacial processes such as solute\npermeability and contact with solid boundaries or other membranes.",

We\nintroduce a state machine model designed to capture the security life cycle of\nnetwork functions and the transitions between different states within the life\ncycle. Such a model can be computed locally at each node, or hierarchically, by\naggregating measurements into security domains or the whole network. We\nidentify three essential security metrics -- attack surface exposure, impact of\nsystem vulnerabilities, and effectiveness of applied security controls -- that\ncollectively form the basis for calculating the overall security score. With\nthis approach, it is possible to provide a holistic understanding of the\nsecurity posture, laying the foundation for effective security management in\nthe expected dynamic threat landscape of 6G networks. Through practical\nexamples, we illustrate the real-world application of our proposed methodology,\noffering valuable insights for developing risk management and informed\ndecision-making strategies in 5G and 6G security operations and laying the\nfoundation for effective security management in the expected dynamic threat\nlandscape of 6G networks.",

    "abstract": "Recently, many humanoid robots have been increasingly deployed in various\nfacilities, including hospitals and assisted living environments, where they\nare often remotely controlled by human operators. Their kinematic redundancy\nenhances reachability and manipulability, enabling them to navigate complex,\ncluttered environments and perform a wide range of tasks. However, this\nredundancy also presents significant control challenges, particularly in\ncoordinating the movements of the robot's macro-micro structure (torso and\narms). Therefore, we propose various human-robot collaborative (HRC) methods\nfor coordinating the torso and arm of remotely controlled mobile humanoid\nrobots, aiming to balance autonomy and human input to enhance system efficiency\nand task execution. The proposed methods include human-initiated approaches,\nwhere users manually control torso movements, and robot-initiated approaches,\nwhich autonomously coordinate torso and arm based on factors such as\nreachability, task goal, or inferred human intent. We conducted a user study\nwith N=17 participants to compare the proposed approaches in terms of task\nperformance, manipulability, and energy efficiency, and analyzed which methods\nwere preferred by participants.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the coffee chain of Sultan Kudarat - the coffee capital\nof the Philippines, where most of the farmers are smallholders. Coffee farmers\nin this area allocate their harvested cherries as fresh cherries, dried\ncherries, and green coffee beans to five market outlets: Nestle Philippines,\nlocal traders, association, direct selling, and other markets not mentioned\n(e.g., coffee shops and hotels). Hence, a supply chain network design (SCND)\nmodel and simulation are developed to investigate the changes in the profits of\ncoffee farmers as they market their products, whether to be sold as fresh\ncherries, dried cherries, or processed into green coffee beans before marketing\nto the market outlets mentioned above, based on the average annual costs\naffecting the production, primary processing, and market prices of coffee\nproducts. Assuming that the annual coffee yield per tree and the average prices\nof coffee products in different markets are constant, the simulations show that\nfarmers can gain a positive annual profit if they sell all dried cherries.\nHowever, results show that if farmers decide to produce and sell all green\ncoffee beans, the farmers gain a negative profit due to the additional annual\naverage dehulling cost and the minimal difference in average selling prices\nbetween dried cherries and green coffee beans in different markets.\nFurthermore, members of the association producing dried cherries can gain by\nallocating the required 70 percent of their product to the association and 30\npercent to the other markets. In contrast, selling 30 percent of green coffee\nbeans to any market generates a negative profit. The developed model can also\nbe modified and used for regular coffee farms and other commodities.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based models are the foundation of modern machine learning, but\ntheir execution, particularly during autoregressive decoding in large language\nmodels (LLMs), places significant pressure on memory systems due to frequent\nmemory accesses and growing key-value (KV) caches. This creates a bottleneck in\nmemory bandwidth, especially as context lengths increase. Processing-in-memory\n(PIM) architectures are a promising solution, offering high internal bandwidth\nand compute parallelism near memory. However, current PIM designs are primarily\noptimized for dense attention and struggle with the dynamic, irregular access\npatterns introduced by modern KV cache sparsity techniques. Consequently, they\nsuffer from workload imbalance, reducing throughput and resource utilization.\nIn this work, we propose STARC, a novel sparsity-optimized data mapping scheme\ntailored specifically for efficient LLM decoding on PIM architectures. STARC\nclusters KV pairs by semantic similarity and maps them to contiguous memory\nregions aligned with PIM bank structures. During decoding, queries retrieve\nrelevant tokens at cluster granularity by matching against precomputed\ncentroids, enabling selective attention and parallel processing without\nfrequent reclustering or data movement overhead. Experiments on the HBM-PIM\nsystem show that, compared to common token-wise sparsity methods, STARC reduces\nattention-layer latency by 19%--31% and energy consumption by 19%--27%. Under a\nKV cache budget of 1024, it achieves up to 54%--74% latency reduction and\n45%--67% energy reduction compared to full KV cache retrieval. Meanwhile, STARC\nmaintains model accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art sparse attention\nmethods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and\nhardware-friendly long-context LLM inference on PIM architectures.",

Multi-agent simulations confirm these effects,\nshowing that noise intensity shapes both convergence rates and weak intra-layer\nclustering. Empirical validation using a representative retweet cascade\ndemonstrates that the proposed model reproduces real-world distortion patterns\nand synchronization behaviors, even without direct links.

Although recent deep architectures and large-scale datasets have\ndriven impressive closed-set performance, these models struggle to recognize or\nproperly segment objects outside their training classes. This gap has sparked\ninterest in Open-Set Semantic Segmentation (O3S), where models must both\ncorrectly label known categories and detect novel, unseen classes. In this\npaper, we propose a plug and play framework for O3S. By modeling the\nsegmentation pipeline as a conditional Markov chain, we derive a novel\nregularizer term dubbed Conditional Channel Capacity Maximization (3CM), that\nmaximizes the mutual information between features and predictions conditioned\non each class. When incorporated into standard loss functions, 3CM encourages\nthe encoder to retain richer, label-dependent features, thereby enhancing the\nnetwork's ability to distinguish and segment previously unseen categories.\nExperimental results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed method on detecting\nunseen objects.

    "abstract": "In a continental-scale fish abundance study, a major challenge in deriving an\nabsolute abundance estimate lies in the fact that regional surveys deploy\ndifferent gear types, each with its unique field of view, producing\ngear-specific relative abundance data. Thus, data from regional surveys in the\nstudy must be converted from the gear-specific relative scale to an absolute\nscale before being combined to estimate a continental scale absolute abundance.\nIn this paper, we develop a tool that takes gear-based data as input, and\nproduces as output the required conversion, with associated uncertainty.\nMethodologically, this tool is operationalized from a Bayesian hierarchical\nmodel which we develop in an inferential context that is akin to the\nchange-of-support problem often encountered in spatial studies; the actual\ncontext here is to reconcile abundance data at various gear-specific scales,\nsome being relative, and others, absolute. We consider data from a small-scale\ncalibration experiment in which 2 to 4 underwater video camera types, as well\nas an acoustic echosounder, were simultaneously deployed on each of 21 boat\ntrips. While acoustic fish signals are recorded along transects on the absolute\nscale, they are subject to confounding from acoustically similar species, thus\nrequiring an externally derived correction factor. Conversely, a camera allows\nvisual distinction between species but records data on a gear-specific relative\nscale. Our statistical modeling framework reflects the relationship among all 5\ngear types across the 21 trips, and the resulting model is used to derive\ncalibration formulae to translate relative abundance data to the corrected\nabsolute abundance scale whenever a camera is deployed alone. Cross-validation\nis conducted using mark-recapture abundance estimates. We also briefly discuss\nthe case when one camera type is deployed alongside the echosounder.",

The results reveal an important role of the\npartially flat band in determining phase-fluctuating SC as well as several key\nfeatures that are consistent with experimental observations.

Near the optimal doping, the\npartially flat band suppresses and amplifies the fluctuation-induced\ndestructing effect on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave pairing,\nrespectively, ensuring an absolutely dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC.

With the rapid advancement of deep\nlearning, its application to low-light image processing has attracted\nwidespread attention and seen significant progress in recent years. However,\nthere remains a lack of comprehensive surveys that systematically examine how\nrecent deep-learning-based low-light image enhancement methods function and\nevaluate their effectiveness in enhancing downstream vision tasks. To address\nthis gap, this review provides detailed elaboration on how various recent\napproaches (from 2020) operate and their enhancement mechanisms, supplemented\nwith clear illustrations. It also investigates the impact of different\nenhancement techniques on subsequent vision tasks, critically analyzing their\nstrengths and limitations. Our review found that image enhancement improved the\nperformance of downstream vision tasks to varying degrees. Although supervised\nmethods often produced images with high perceptual quality, they typically\nproduced modest improvements in vision tasks. In contrast, zero-shot learning,\ndespite achieving lower scores in image quality metrics, showed consistently\nboosted performance across various vision tasks. These suggest a disconnect\nbetween image quality metrics and those evaluating vision task performance.\nAdditionally, unsupervised domain adaptation techniques demonstrated\nsignificant gains in segmentation tasks, highlighting their potential in\npractical low-light scenarios where labelled data is scarce.

A formal verification\nsystem can check whether a formal proof is correct or not almost\ninstantaneously, but generating a completely correct formal proof with LLMs\nremains a formidable task. The usual approach in the literature is to prompt\nthe LLM many times (up to several thousands) until one of the generated proofs\npasses the verification system. In this work, we present APOLLO (Automated\nPrOof repair via LLM and Lean cOllaboration), a modular, modelagnostic pipeline\nthat combines the strengths of the Lean compiler with an LLM's reasoning\nabilities to achieve better proofgeneration results at a low sampling budget.\nApollo directs a fully automated process in which the LLM generates proofs for\ntheorems, a set of agents analyze the proofs, fix the syntax errors, identify\nthe mistakes in the proofs using Lean, isolate failing sublemmas, utilize\nautomated solvers, and invoke an LLM on each remaining goal with a low budget.\nThe repaired subproofs are recombined and reverified, iterating up to a\nusercontrolled maximum number of attempts. On the miniF2F benchmark, we\nestablish a new stateoftheart accuracy of 84.9% among sub 8Bparameter models\nwhile keeping the sampling budget below one hundred. Moreover, Apollo raises\nthe stateoftheart accuracy for GoedelProverSFT to 65.6% while cutting sample\ncomplexity from 25,600 to a few hundred. Generalpurpose models (o3mini, o4mini)\njump from 3-7% to over 40% accuracy.

However, they struggle to accurately represent\nsequences that require satisfying sophisticated constraints or whose sequential\ndependencies are better addressed by out-of-order generation. Masked Diffusion\nModels (MDMs) address some of these limitations, but the process of unmasking\nmultiple tokens simultaneously in MDMs can introduce incoherences, and MDMs\ncannot handle arbitrary infilling constraints when the number of tokens to be\nfilled in is not known in advance.

By inserting tokens one at a time, ILMs can represent\nstrong dependencies between tokens, and their ability to generate sequences in\narbitrary order allows them to accurately model sequences where token\ndependencies do not follow a left-to-right sequential structure. To train ILMs,\nwe propose a tailored network parameterization and use a simple denoising\nobjective.

Traditional QoS models rely on\nmanual feature engineering and yield only point estimates, offering no insight\ninto the confidence of their predictions. In this paper, we propose QoSBERT,\nthe first framework that reformulates QoS prediction as a semantic regression\ntask based on pre trained language models. Unlike previous approaches relying\non sparse numerical features, QoSBERT automatically encodes user service\nmetadata into natural language descriptions, enabling deep semantic\nunderstanding. Furthermore, we integrate a Monte Carlo Dropout based\nuncertainty estimation module, allowing for trustworthy and risk-aware service\nquality prediction, which is crucial yet underexplored in existing QoS models.\nQoSBERT applies attentive pooling over contextualized embeddings and a\nlightweight multilayer perceptron regressor, fine tuned jointly to minimize\nabsolute error. We further exploit the resulting uncertainty estimates to\nselect high quality training samples, improving robustness in low resource\nsettings. On standard QoS benchmark datasets, QoSBERT achieves an average\nreduction of 11.7% in MAE and 6.7% in RMSE for response time prediction, and\n6.9% in MAE for throughput prediction compared to the strongest baselines,\nwhile providing well calibrated confidence intervals for robust and trustworthy\nservice quality estimation.

    "abstract": "Agglomerative clustering has emerged as a vital tool in data analysis due to\nits intuitive and flexible characteristics. However, existing agglomerative\nclustering methods often involve additional parameters for sub-cluster\npartitioning and inter-cluster similarity assessment. This necessitates\ndifferent parameter settings across various datasets, which is undoubtedly\nchallenging in the absence of prior knowledge. Moreover, existing agglomerative\nclustering techniques are constrained by the calculation method of connection\ndistance, leading to unstable clustering results. To address these issues, this\npaper introduces a novel density-based agglomerative clustering method, termed\nkFuse. kFuse comprises four key components: (1) sub-cluster partitioning based\non natural neighbors; (2) determination of boundary connectivity between\nsub-clusters through the computation of adjacent samples and shortest\ndistances; (3) assessment of density similarity between sub-clusters via the\ncalculation of mean density and variance; and (4) establishment of merging\nrules between sub-clusters based on boundary connectivity and density\nsimilarity. kFuse requires the specification of the number of clusters only at\nthe final merging stage. Additionally, by comprehensively considering adjacent\nsamples, distances, and densities among different sub-clusters, kFuse\nsignificantly enhances accuracy during the merging phase, thereby greatly\nimproving its identification capability. Experimental results on both synthetic\nand real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of kFuse.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is\nessential for applications such as traffic management and weather prediction,\nwhich depend on capturing long-range temporal dependencies and interactions\nbetween entities. Existing methods, particularly those based on Transformer\narchitectures, compute pairwise dependencies across all time steps, leading to\na computational complexity that scales quadratically with the length of the\ninput. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Forecaster with Offline\nClustering Using Segments (FOCUS), a novel approach to MTS forecasting that\nsimplifies long-range dependency modeling through the use of prototypes\nextracted via offline clustering. These prototypes encapsulate high-level\nevents in the real-world system underlying the data, summarizing the key\ncharacteristics of similar time segments. In the online phase, FOCUS\ndynamically adapts these patterns to the current input and captures\ndependencies between the input segment and high-level events, enabling both\naccurate and efficient forecasting. By identifying prototypes during the\noffline clustering phase, FOCUS reduces the computational complexity of\nmodeling long-range dependencies in the online phase to linear scaling.\nExtensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs.",

To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal\nIntegrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder\nmodels with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data\nthrough preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization\ntechniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference\nOptimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the\naligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs\nwhile retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an\nupstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality\nmultimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or\nimage-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications:\n(1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal\nencoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a\npreference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite\nrelying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained\nwith SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue\ntype classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a\nvision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing\nknowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align\ndownstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly\nimproves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type\nclassification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align\nunimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference\noptimization.",

    "abstract": "Resilient computation in all-to-all-communication models has attracted\ntremendous attention over the years. Most of these works assume the classical\nfaulty model which restricts the total number of corrupted edges (or vertices)\nby some integer fault parameter $f$. A recent work by [Bodwin, Haeupler and\nParter, SODA 2024] introduced a stronger notion of fault-tolerance, in the\ncontext of graph sparsification, which restricts the degree of the failing edge\nset $F$, rather than its cardinality. For a subset of faulty edges $F$, the\nfaulty-degree $\\mathrm{deg}(F)$ is the largest number of faults in $F$ incident\nto any given node.\n  In this work, we study the communication aspects of this faulty model which\nallows us to handle almost linearly more edge faults (possibly quadratic), with\nno extra cost. Our end results are general compilers that take any Congested\nClique algorithm and simulate it, in a round by round manner, in the presence\nof a $\\alpha$-Byzantine mobile adversary that controls a $\\alpha$-fraction of\nthe edges incident to each node in the fully connected network. For every round\n$i$, the mobile adversary is allowed to select a distinct set of corrupted\nedges $F_i$ under the restriction that $\\mathrm{deg}(F_i)\\leq \\alpha n$. In the\nnon-adaptive setting, the $F_i$ sets are selected at the beginning of the\nsimulation, while in the adaptive setting, these edges can be chosen based on\nthe entire history of the protocol up to round $i$.\n  We show general compilers for the non-adaptive, adaptive, and deterministic\nsettings. A key component of our algorithms is a new resilient routing scheme\nwhich may be of independent interest. Our approach is based on a combination of\ntechniques, including error-correcting-code, locally decodable codes,\ncover-free families, and sparse recovery sketches.",

Diffusion models, a class of generative\nartificial intelligence (GenAI), are well-suited for ensuring data security to\nattack. Through iteratively adding and then removing noise, diffusion models\ncan generate meaningful information despite the presence of the unknown noise.\nThis article proposes a diffusion-based framework to enhance the security of\nsemantic transmission for the attacks including eavesdropping and jamming.\nSpecifically, the proposed framework incorporates both the artificial noise and\nnatural channel noise into the forward process of the diffusion models during\nthe semantic transmission, with the reverse process used to remove noise at the\nlegitimate receiver. In the eavesdropping scenarios, the artificial noise is\nthe friendly noise designed to prevent semantic eavesdropping. In the jamming\nscenarios, the artificial noise is the malicious jamming generated by the\njammer, which disrupts the semantic transmission.

    "abstract": "This work presents a novel unfitted finite element framework to simulate\ncoupled surface-bulk problems in time-dependent domains, focusing on\nfluid-fluid interactions in animal cells between the actomyosin cortex and the\ncytoplasm. The cortex, a thin layer beneath the plasma membrane, provides\nstructural integrity and drives shape changes by generating surface contractile\nforces akin to tension. Cortical contractions generate Marangoni-like surface\nflows and induce intracellular cytoplasmic flows that are essential for\nprocesses such as cell division, migration, and polarization, particularly in\nlarge animal cells. Despite its importance, the spatiotemporal regulation of\ncortex-cytoplasm interactions remains poorly understood and computational\nmodelling can be very challenging because surface-bulk dynamics often lead to\nlarge cell deformations. To address these challenges, we propose a\nsharp-interface framework that uniquely combines the trace finite element\nmethod for surface flows with the aggregated finite element method for bulk\nflows. This approach enables accurate and stable simulations on fixed Cartesian\ngrids without remeshing. The model also incorporates mechanochemical feedback\nthrough the surface transport of a molecular regulator of active tension. We\nsolve the resulting mixed-dimensional system on a fixed Cartesian grid using a\nlevel-set-based method to track the evolving surface. Numerical experiments\nvalidate the accuracy and stability of the method, capturing phenomena such as\nself-organised pattern formation, curvature-driven relaxation, and cell\ncleavage. This novel framework offers a powerful and extendable tool for\ninvestigating increasingly complex morphogenetic processes in animal cells.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic datasets have enabled significant progress in point tracking by\nproviding large-scale, densely annotated supervision. However, deploying these\nmodels in real-world domains remains challenging due to domain shift and lack\nof labeled data-issues that are especially severe in surgical videos, where\nscenes exhibit complex tissue deformation, occlusion, and lighting variation.\nWhile recent approaches adapt synthetic-trained trackers to natural videos\nusing teacher ensembles or augmentation-heavy pseudo-labeling pipelines, their\neffectiveness in high-shift domains like surgery remains unexplored. This work\npresents SurgTracker, a semi-supervised framework for adapting\nsynthetic-trained point trackers to surgical video using filtered\nself-distillation. Pseudo-labels are generated online by a fixed\nteacher-identical in architecture and initialization to the student-and are\nfiltered using a cycle consistency constraint to discard temporally\ninconsistent trajectories. This simple yet effective design enforces geometric\nconsistency and provides stable supervision throughout training, without the\ncomputational overhead of maintaining multiple teachers. Experiments on the\nSTIR benchmark show that SurgTracker improves tracking performance using only\n80 unlabeled videos, demonstrating its potential for robust adaptation in\nhigh-shift, data-scarce domains.",

Existing studies typically enforce a one-step mapping that uses\ndeep neural networks to project the visual features to mimic the distribution\nof textual features. However, they typically face difficulties in finding such\na projection due to the two modalities in both the distribution of class-wise\nsamples and the range of their feature values. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a novel Semantic-Space-Intervened Diffusive Alignment method,\ntermed SeDA, models a semantic space as a bridge in the visual-to-textual\nprojection, considering both types of features share the same class-level\ninformation in classification. More importantly, a bi-stage diffusion framework\nis developed to enable the progressive alignment between the two modalities.\nSpecifically, SeDA first employs a Diffusion-Controlled Semantic Learner to\nmodel the semantic features space of visual features by constraining the\ninteractive features of the diffusion model and the category centers of visual\nfeatures. In the later stage of SeDA, the Diffusion-Controlled Semantic\nTranslator focuses on learning the distribution of textual features from the\nsemantic space. Meanwhile, the Progressive Feature Interaction Network\nintroduces stepwise feature interactions at each alignment step, progressively\nintegrating textual information into mapped features. Experimental results show\nthat SeDA achieves stronger cross-modal feature alignment, leading to superior\nperformance over existing methods across multiple scenarios.",

In three of the participating codes, a distinct,\nrotation-dominated inner core emerges with a formation timescale of $\\lesssim\n300$ Myr, largely driven by a major merger event, while two other codes exhibit\nsimilar signs of wet compaction -- gaseous shrinkage into a compact starburst\nphase -- at earlier epochs. The remaining three codes show only weak evidence\nof wet compaction. Consequently, we divide the simulated galaxies into two\ngroups: those with strong compaction signatures and those with weaker ones.\nGalaxies in these two groups differ in size, stellar age gradients, and\ndisk-to-total mass ratios. Specifically, codes with strong wet compaction build\ntheir outer disks in an inside-out fashion, leading to negative age gradients,\nwhereas codes with weaker compaction feature flat or positive age gradients\ncaused primarily by outward stellar migration. Although the stellar half-mass\nradii of these two groups diverge at $z \\sim 3$, the inclusion of dust\nextinction brings their sizes and shapes in mock observations closer to each\nother and to observed galaxies. We attribute the observed morphological\ndifferences primarily to variations in the stellar feedback implementations --\nsuch as delayed cooling timescales, and feedback strengths -- that regulate\nboth the onset and duration of compaction.

    "abstract": "The long waiting time at airport security has become an emergent issue as\ndemand for air travel continues to grow. Not only does queuing at security\ncause passengers to miss their flights, but also reduce the amount of time\npassengers spend at the airport post-security, potentially leading to less\nrevenue for the airport operator. One of the key issues to address to reduce\nwaiting time is the management of arrival priority. As passengers on later\nflights can arrive before passengers on earlier flights, the security system\ndoes not always process passengers in the order of the degree of urgency. In\nthis paper, we propose a chance-constrained optimization model that decides in\nwhich time slot passengers should be recommended to arrive. We use chance\nconstraints to obtain solutions that take the uncertainty in passenger\nnon-compliance into account. The experimental results, based on a sample day of\nflight schedules at the Barcelona airport, show a reduction of 85% in the total\nwaiting time. Compared to the deterministic case, in which passengers are\nassumed to fully comply with the recommendations, we see a 30% increase in the\nreduction of the total waiting time. This highlights the importance of\nconsidering variation in passenger compliance in the management of airport\nsecurity queues.",

In view of this difficulty,\nwe propose a framework that uses neural networks and the associated feature\nimportance analysis to improve the efficiency of symbolic turbulence modeling.\nIn doing so, the gradient-based method can be used to efficiently learn neural\nnetwork-based representations of Reynolds stress from indirect data, which is\nfurther transformed into simplified mathematical expressions with symbolic\nregression. Moreover, feature importance analysis is introduced to accelerate\nthe convergence of symbolic regression by excluding insignificant input\nfeatures. The proposed training strategy is tested in the flow in a square\nduct, where it correctly learns underlying analytic models from indirect\nvelocity data. Further, the method is applied in the flow over the periodic\nhills, demonstrating that the feature importance analysis can significantly\nimprove the training efficiency and learn symbolic turbulence models with\nsatisfactory generalizability.",

The Kakeya conjecture states\nthat any Kakeya set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ has Hausdorff dimension $n$. We consider\na restricted case where the midpoint of each line segment $I_e$ must belong to\na fixed set $A$ with packing dimension at most $s \\in [0, n]$. In this case, we\nshow that the Hausdorff dimension of the Kakeya set is at least $n - s$.\nFurthermore, using the \"bush argument\", we improve the lower bound to $\\max \\{\nn - s, n - g_n(s)\\}$, where $g_n(s)$ is defined inductively. For example, when\n$n = 4$, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension is at least $\\max\\{\\frac{19}{5}\n- \\frac{3}{5}s,4-s\\}$. We also establish Kakeya maximal function analogues of\nthese results.",

    "abstract": "The integration of AI into daily life has generated considerable attention\nand excitement, while also raising concerns about automating algorithmic harms\nand re-entrenching existing social inequities. While the responsible deployment\nof trustworthy AI systems is a worthy goal, there are many possible ways to\nrealize it, from policy and regulation to improved algorithm design and\nevaluation. In fact, since AI trains on social data, there is even a\npossibility for everyday users, citizens, or workers to directly steer its\nbehavior through Algorithmic Collective Action, by deliberately modifying the\ndata they share with a platform to drive its learning process in their favor.\nThis paper considers how these grassroots efforts to influence AI interact with\nmethods already used by AI firms and governments to improve model\ntrustworthiness. In particular, we focus on the setting where the AI firm\ndeploys a differentially private model, motivated by the growing regulatory\nfocus on privacy and data protection. We investigate how the use of\nDifferentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) affects the\ncollective's ability to influence the learning process. Our findings show that\nwhile differential privacy contributes to the protection of individual data, it\nintroduces challenges for effective algorithmic collective action. We\ncharacterize lower bounds on the success of algorithmic collective action under\ndifferential privacy as a function of the collective's size and the firm's\nprivacy parameters, and verify these trends experimentally by simulating\ncollective action during the training of deep neural network classifiers across\nseveral datasets.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Deep learning has demonstrated strong potential for MRI\nreconstruction, but conventional supervised learning methods require\nhigh-quality reference images, which are often unavailable in practice.\nSelf-supervised learning offers an alternative, yet its performance degrades at\nhigh acceleration rates. To overcome these limitations, we propose hybrid\nlearning, a novel two-stage training framework that combines self-supervised\nand supervised learning for robust image reconstruction.\n  Methods: Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the\nfirst stage, self-supervised learning is employed to generate improved images\nfrom noisy or undersampled reference data. These enhanced images then serve as\npseudo-ground truths for the second stage, which uses supervised learning to\nrefine reconstruction performance and support higher acceleration rates. We\nevaluated hybrid learning in two representative applications: (1) accelerated\n0.55T spiral-UTE lung MRI using noisy reference data, and (2) 3D T1 mapping of\nthe brain without access to fully sampled ground truth.\n  Results: For spiral-UTE lung MRI, hybrid learning consistently improved image\nquality over both self-supervised and conventional supervised methods across\ndifferent acceleration rates, as measured by SSIM and NMSE. For 3D T1 mapping,\nhybrid learning achieved superior T1 quantification accuracy across a wide\ndynamic range, outperforming self-supervised learning in all tested conditions.\n  Conclusions: Hybrid learning provides a practical and effective solution for\ntraining deep MRI reconstruction networks when only low-quality or incomplete\nreference data are available. It enables improved image quality and accurate\nquantitative mapping across different applications and field strengths,\nrepresenting a promising technique toward broader clinical deployment of deep\nlearning-based MRI.",

This construction canonically defines adjacency via facet maps\nwhile inherently preserving hyperedge provenance. We establish that the\nnormalized degree zero sheaf Laplacian on our symmetric simplicial lifting\nreduces exactly to the traditional graph normalized sheaf Laplacian when\nrestricted to graphs, validating its mathematical consistency with prior\ngraph-based sheaf theory. Furthermore, the induced structure preserves all\nstructural information from the original hypergraph, ensuring that every\nmulti-way relational detail is faithfully retained.

We fit our shape-constrained regression model under\nBayesian framework to take advantage of its ability to account for the\nheterogeneity in disease progression among individuals.

    "abstract": "Existing sequence to sequence models for structured language tasks rely\nheavily on the dot product self attention mechanism, which incurs quadratic\ncomplexity in both computation and memory for input length N. We introduce the\nGraph Wavelet Transformer (GWT), a novel architecture that replaces this\nbottleneck with a learnable, multi scale wavelet transform defined over an\nexplicit graph Laplacian derived from syntactic or semantic parses. Our\nanalysis shows that multi scale spectral decomposition offers an interpretable,\nefficient, and expressive alternative to quadratic self attention for graph\nstructured sequence modeling.",

    "abstract": "With the global transition towards cleaner energy and sustainable processes,\nthe demand for efficient catalysts, especially for the oxygen reduction\nreaction, has gained attention from the scientific community. This research\nwork investigates cerium-doped graphene-based materials as catalysts for this\nprocess with density functional theory calculations. The electrochemical\nperformance of Ce-doped graphene was assessed within the computation hydrogen\nelectrode framework. Our findings reveal that Ce doping, especially when\nsynergized with an oxygen atom, shows improved catalytic activity and\nselectivity. For instance, Ce doping in combination with an oxygen atom,\nlocated near a border, can be selective for the 2-electron pathway. Overall,\nthe combination of Ce doping with structural defects and oxygenated functions\nlowers the reaction free energies for the oxygen reduction compared to pure\ngraphene, and consequently, might improve the catalytic activity. This research\nsheds light from a computational perspective on Ce-doped carbon materials as a\nsustainable alternative to traditional costly metal-based catalysts, offering\npromising prospects for green energy technologies and electrochemical\napplications.",

    "abstract": "Wearable sensors are widely used to collect physiological data and develop\nstress detection models. However, most studies focus on a single dataset,\nrarely evaluating model reproducibility across devices, populations, or study\nconditions. We previously assessed the reproducibility of stress detection\nmodels across multiple studies, testing models trained on one dataset against\nothers using heart rate (with R-R interval) and electrodermal activity (EDA).\nIn this study, we extended our stress detection reproducibility to consumer\nwearable sensors. We compared validated research-grade devices, to consumer\nwearables - Biopac MP160, Polar H10, Empatica E4, to the Garmin Forerunner 55s,\nassessing device-specific stress detection performance by conducting a new\nstress study on undergraduate students. Thirty-five students completed three\nstandardized stress-induction tasks in a lab setting. Biopac MP160 performed\nthe best, being consistent with our expectations of it as the gold standard,\nthough performance varied across devices and models. Combining heart rate\nvariability (HRV) and EDA enhanced stress prediction across most scenarios.\nHowever, Empatica E4 showed variability; while HRV and EDA improved stress\ndetection in leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) evaluations (AUROC up to 0.953),\ndevice-specific limitations led to underperformance when tested with our\npre-trained stress detection tool (AUROC 0.723), highlighting generalizability\nchallenges related to hardware-model compatibility. Garmin Forerunner 55s\ndemonstrated strong potential for real-world stress monitoring, achieving the\nbest mental arithmetic stress detection performance in LOSO (AUROC up to 0.961)\ncomparable to research-grade devices like Polar H10 (AUROC 0.954), and Empatica\nE4 (AUROC 0.905 with HRV-only model and AUROC 0.953 with HRV+EDA model), with\nthe added advantage of consumer-friendly wearability for free-living contexts.",

It uses metallic (4,4) carbon nanotubes as the conductive leads, a\nlinear segment of Lonsdaleite (hexagonal diamond) as the channel, Lonsdaleite\nas the insulating layer between the channel and the gate, and a (20,20)\nmetallic carbon nanotube as the surrounding gate. The (4,4) nanotube leads are\nbonded to the channel using a mix of 5- and 6-membered rings, and to the gate\nusing 5-, 6- and 7-membered rings. Issues of component design assessment and\noptimization using quantum chemical methods are discussed throughout.

Thus, the classical\nphenomenology a la Kolmogorov can be observed in the inertial range of scale,\nwith the energy spectra decaying as $k^{-5/3}$ and the third order structure\nfunction obeying the $4/5$ law.

    "abstract": "The motion planning problem involves finding a collision-free path from a\nrobot's starting to its target configuration. Recently, self-supervised\nlearning methods have emerged to tackle motion planning problems without\nrequiring expensive expert demonstrations. They solve the Eikonal equation for\ntraining neural networks and lead to efficient solutions. However, these\nmethods struggle in complex environments because they fail to maintain key\nproperties of the Eikonal equation, such as optimal value functions and\ngeodesic distances. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nself-supervised temporal difference metric learning approach that solves the\nEikonal equation more accurately and enhances performance in solving complex\nand unseen planning tasks. Our method enforces Bellman's principle of\noptimality over finite regions, using temporal difference learning to avoid\nspurious local minima while incorporating metric learning to preserve the\nEikonal equation's essential geodesic properties. We demonstrate that our\napproach significantly outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods in\nhandling complex environments and generalizing to unseen environments, with\nrobot configurations ranging from 2 to 12 degrees of freedom (DOF).",
