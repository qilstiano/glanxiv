    "abstract": "Accurate pedestrian intention estimation is crucial for the safe navigation\nof autonomous vehicles (AVs) and hence attracts a lot of research attention.\nHowever, current models often fail to adequately consider dynamic traffic\nsignals and contextual scene information, which are critical for real-world\napplications. This paper presents a Traffic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph\nConvolutional Network (TA-STGCN) that integrates traffic signs and their states\n(Red, Yellow, Green) into pedestrian intention prediction. Our approach\nintroduces the integration of dynamic traffic signal states and bounding box\nsize as key features, allowing the model to capture both spatial and temporal\ndependencies in complex urban environments. The model surpasses existing\nmethods in accuracy. Specifically, TA-STGCN achieves a 4.75% higher accuracy\ncompared to the baseline model on the PIE dataset, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in improving pedestrian intention prediction.",

Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69).

The sample population branching factor-the expected number\nof new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in\nbehavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring\npatient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes\nprocess with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial\npooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency\nindividuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian\ninference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via\nconvergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple\nGoodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's\nmodification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem\n(RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise\nbranching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +-\n0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This\nled to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical\nmodel. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood\nperturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse\nindividuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical\nmodel. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust\nestimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient\nvariability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous\nevents supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning\nsystems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.",

    "abstract": "Bounding box regression (BBR) is fundamental to object detection, where the\nregression loss is crucial for accurate localization. Existing IoU-based losses\noften incorporate handcrafted geometric penalties to address IoU's\nnon-differentiability in non-overlapping cases and enhance BBR performance.\nHowever, these penalties are sensitive to box shape, size, and distribution,\noften leading to suboptimal optimization for small objects and undesired\nbehaviors such as bounding box enlargement due to misalignment with the IoU\nobjective. To address these limitations, we propose InterpIoU, a novel loss\nfunction that replaces handcrafted geometric penalties with a term based on the\nIoU between interpolated boxes and the target. By using interpolated boxes to\nbridge the gap between predictions and ground truth, InterpIoU provides\nmeaningful gradients in non-overlapping cases and inherently avoids the box\nenlargement issue caused by misaligned penalties. Simulation results further\nshow that IoU itself serves as an ideal regression target, while existing\ngeometric penalties are both unnecessary and suboptimal. Building on InterpIoU,\nwe introduce Dynamic InterpIoU, which dynamically adjusts interpolation\ncoefficients based on IoU values, enhancing adaptability to scenarios with\ndiverse object distributions.

The efficiency of NTT computation directly impacts the\noverall performance of FHE, making hardware acceleration a critical technology\nthat will enable realistic FHE applications. Custom accelerators, in FPGAs or\nASICs, offer significant performance advantages due to their ability to exploit\nmassive parallelism and specialized optimizations. However, the operation of\nNTT over large moduli requires large word-length modulo arithmetic that limits\nachievable clock frequencies in hardware and increases hardware area costs.

The goal of this work is to leverage\ndigit-serial modulo arithmetic combined with appropriate redundant data\nrepresentation to design modular pipelined NTT accelerators that operate\nuniformly on arbitrary small digits, without the need for intermediate\n(de)serialization.

While hippocampal\nneurons encoding position and orientation are well documented, the large-scale\nneural dynamics supporting spatial representation, particularly during\nnaturalistic, passive experience, remain poorly understood. Here, we\ndemonstrate for the first time that non-invasive brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) based on electroencephalography (EEG) can decode spontaneous,\nfine-grained egocentric 6D pose, comprising three-dimensional position and\norientation, during passive viewing of egocentric video. Despite EEG's limited\nspatial resolution and high signal noise, we find that spatially coherent\nvisual input (i.e., continuous and structured motion) reliably evokes decodable\nspatial representations, aligning with participants' subjective sense of\nspatial engagement. Decoding performance further improves when visual input is\npresented at a frame rate of 100 ms per image, suggesting alignment with\nintrinsic neural temporal dynamics. Using gradient-based backpropagation\nthrough a neural decoding model, we identify distinct EEG channels contributing\nto position -- and orientation specific -- components, revealing a distributed\nyet complementary neural encoding scheme. These findings indicate that the\nbrain's spatial systems operate spontaneously and continuously, even under\npassive conditions, challenging traditional distinctions between active and\npassive spatial cognition.

This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user\nsatisfaction even when the target image is retrieved.

This\nclass of nonsmooth functions was studied extensively in two decades since but\nhas not received much attention in today's wide optimization literature. This\nregrettable omission is in spite of the fact that many functions in modern day\napplications of optimization can be shown to be quasi-differentiable. In\nessence, a quasi-differentiable function is one whose directional derivative at\nan arbitrary reference vector, as a function of the direction, is the\ndifference of two positively homogenous, convex functions. Thus, to bring\nquasi-differentiable functions closer to the class of difference-of-convex\nfunctions that has received fast growing attention in recent years in\nconnection with many applied subjects, we propose to rename\nquasi-differentiable functions as quasi-difference-convex (quasi-dc) functions.\nBesides modernizing and advancing this class of nonconvex and nondifferentiable\nfunctions, our research aims to put together a unified treatment of iterative\nconvex-programming based descent algorithms for solving a broad class of\ncomposite quasi-dc programs and to establish their subsequential convergence,\nsequential convergence, and rates of convergence; the latter two topics are in\nline with the modern focus of such analysis for convex programs and some\nextensions and are departures from the sole emphasis of subsequential\nconvergence in the traditional studies of quasi-differentiable optimization.\nThrough this research, we have gained significant new insights and\nunderstanding, advanced the fundamentals, and broadened the applications of\nthis neglected yet pervasive class of nonconvex and nondifferentiable functions\nand their optimization.",

We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting,\nand then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based\non nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric\nmethod that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P).\nExperiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both\nNOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.",

    "abstract": "The Galactic fast radio burst (FRB) FRB 200428 was associated with a short\nX-ray burst (XRB) from the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 during one of its active\nphases. This FRB-associated XRB exhibits distinct properties compared to other\ntypical XRBs, including a significantly higher cutoff energy and a steeper\npower-law index. Its recovered X-ray light curve shows a multiple-peak\nstructure, with the time of arrival offset from that of the FRB. These unique\nfeatures imply a special physical link between the FRB and X-ray emissions. In\n2022 October, a similar FRB-XRB association was detected from the same source.\nIn this paper, we propose a model in which the observed spectral and temporal\nfeatures of the associated XRBs can be attributed to the inverse Compton\nscattering (ICS) of FRB photons by an extreme pair flow around the light\ncylinder, with a bulk Lorentz factor of $\\Gamma\\sim10$ and a power-law\ndistribution in the comoving frame, characterized by a typical Lorentz factor\n$\\gamma^\\prime_\\mathrm{m}\\sim5\\times 10^4$. This extreme pair flow could\noriginate from the compression of a transient pulse of\n$\\sim10^{40}-10^{41}\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$ and the acceleration through magnetic\nreconnection in the current sheet during magnetar activity. The Doppler-boosted\nICS spectra and the arrival time shifts in such a scenario can well explain the\nobserved features of the FRB 200428-associated XRB and can also account for\nanother associated event in 2022.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and predicting the activity of oxide perovskite catalysts for\nthe oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires descriptors that are both accurate\nand physically interpretable. While symbolic regression (SR) offers a path to\ndiscover such formulas, its performance degrades with high-dimensional inputs\nand small datasets. We present a two-phase framework that combines neural\nnetworks (NN), feature importance analysis, and symbolic regression (SR) to\ndiscover interpretable descriptors for OER activity in oxide perovskites. In\nPhase I, using a small dataset and seven structural features, we reproduce and\nimprove the known {\\mu}/t descriptor by engineering composite features and\napplying symbolic regression, achieving training and validation MAEs of 22.8\nand 20.8 meV, respectively. In Phase II, we expand to 164 features, reduce\ndimensionality, and identify LUMO energy as a key electronic descriptor. A\nfinal formula using {\\mu}/t, {\\mu}/RA, and LUMO energy achieves improved\naccuracy (training and validation MAEs of 22.1 and 20.6 meV) with strong\nphysical interpretability. Our results demonstrate that NN-guided symbolic\nregression enables accurate, interpretable, and physically meaningful\ndescriptor discovery in data-scarce regimes, indicating interpretability need\nnot sacrifice accuracy for materials informatics.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black\nhole (spherically symmetric) on the basis of a completely topological method\nintroduced by Robson, Villari, and Biancalana (RVB). This topological method\ncan give the exact Hawking temperature of the charged Ads black hole. We have\nalso derived the Hawking temperature of a charged Ads black hole considering\nmassive gravity. Due to the presence of mass term in the metric function of the\ncharged Ads black hole in massive gravity, the effect of mass term can't be\nneglected when calculating the Hawking temperature. In massive gravity, the\naccurate Hawking temperature can be obtained by including an integral constant\nterm, which can be derived from the standard definition.",

    "abstract": "We derive constraints on the neutrino mass using a variety of recent\ncosmological datasets, including DESI BAO, the full-shape analysis of the DESI\nmatter power spectrum and the one-dimensional power spectrum of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest (P1D) from eBOSS quasars as well as the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). The constraints are obtained in the frequentist formalism by\nconstructing profile likelihoods and applying the Feldman-Cousins prescription\nto compute confidence intervals. This method avoids potential prior and volume\neffects that may arise in a comparable Bayesian analysis. Parabolic fits to the\nprofiles allow one to distinguish changes in the upper limits from variations\nin the constraining power $\\sigma$ of the different data combinations. We find\nthat all profiles in the $\\Lambda$CDM model are cut off by the $\\sum m_\\nu \\geq\n0$ bound, meaning that the corresponding parabolas reach their minimum in the\nunphysical sector. The most stringent 95% C.L. upper limit is obtained by the\ncombination of DESI DR2 BAO, Planck PR4 and CMB lensing at 53 meV, below the\nminimum of 59 meV set by the normal ordering. Extending $\\Lambda$CDM to\nnon-zero curvature and $w_0w_\\mathrm{a}$CDM relaxes the constraints past 59 meV\nagain, but only $w_0w_\\mathrm{a}$CDM exhibits profiles with a minimum at a\npositive value. Using a combination of DESI DR1 full-shape, BBN and eBOSS\nLyman-$\\alpha$ P1D, we successfully constrain the neutrino mass independently\nof the CMB. This combination yields $\\sum m_\\nu \\leq 285$ meV (95% C.L.). The\naddition of DESI full-shape or Lyman-$\\alpha$ P1D to CMB and DESI BAO results\nin small but noticeable improvement of the constraining power of the data.\nLyman-$\\alpha$ free-streaming measurements especially improve the constraint.\nSince they are based on eBOSS data, this sets a promising precedent for\nupcoming DESI data.",

We consider a swarm of nanobots locating a single cancerous region and\ntreating it by releasing an onboard payload of drugs at the site. At nanoscale,\nthe computation, communication, sensing, and locomotion capabilities of\nindividual agents are extremely limited, noisy, and/or nonexistent.\n  We present a general model to formally describe the individual and collective\nbehavior of agents in a colloidal environment, such as the bloodstream, for\ncancer detection and treatment by nanobots. This includes a feasible and\nprecise model of agent locomotion, inspired by actual nanoparticles that, in\nthe presence of an external chemical gradient, move towards areas of higher\nconcentration by means of self-propulsion. We present two variants of our\ngeneral model: The first assumes an endogenous chemical gradient that is fixed\nover time and centered at the targeted cancer site; the second is a more\nspeculative and dynamic variant in which agents themselves create and amplify a\nchemical gradient centered at the cancer site. In both settings, agents can\nsense the gradient and ascend it noisily, locating the cancer site more quickly\nthan via simple Brownian motion.\n  For the first variant of the model, we present simulation results to show the\nbehavior of agents under our locomotion model, as well as {analytical results}\nto bound the time it takes for the agents to reach the cancer site. For the\nsecond variant, simulation results highlight the collective benefit in having\nagents issue their own chemical signal. While arguably more speculative in its\nagent capability assumptions, this variant shows a significant improvement in\nruntime performance over the first variant, resulting from its chemical signal\namplification mechanism.",

In this work, we address this\ngap. Specifically, we prove how instance-level accuracy of these methods is\nprecisely characterized by the geometry of the verifier's ROC curve.\nInterestingly, while scaling is determined by the local geometry of the ROC\ncurve for rejection sampling, it depends on global properties of the ROC curve\nfor BoN. As a consequence when the ROC curve is unknown, it is impossible to\nextrapolate the performance of rejection sampling based on the low-compute\nregime. Furthermore, while rejection sampling outperforms BoN for fixed\ncompute, in the infinite-compute limit both methods converge to the same level\nof accuracy, determined by the slope of the ROC curve near the origin.

Our results indicate moderate\nsuccess rates on simpler small grids, where visual input or few-shot text\nprompting offered some benefits. However, performance significantly degraded on\nlarger grids, highlighting a scalability challenge. While larger models\ngenerally achieved higher average success, the visual modality was not\nuniversally dominant over well-structured text for these multimodal systems,\nand successful paths on simpler grids were generally of high quality.

Depending on the symmetry-breaking pattern,\nthey can be either topologically stable or metastable. Intriguingly, metastable\nstrings have been proposed as a possible origin of the gravitational wave (GW)\nbackground observed by recent pulsar timing array experiments. When metastable\nstrings decay, they fragment into segments with monopoles and antimonopoles\nattached at their endpoints. The monopole and antimonopole are strongly pulled\nby the string tension. Violent oscillations of these segments have been\nconsidered as a potential GW source, in addition to contributions from string\nloops. We show that, in realistic situations, the monopoles frequently collide\nwith thermal fluctuations on the string segments, which act as a resistance and\nprevent the oscillation. As a result, we find that the contribution from string\nsegments to the GW background is negligible.",

The\npremise of our study is twofold: firstly, the further two states are from each\nother, transition-wise, the less relevant the value of the first state is when\nlearning the $\\epsilon$-optimal value of the second; secondly, the amount of\n'effort', sample-complexity-wise, expended in learning the $\\epsilon$-optimal\nvalue of a state is independent of the number of samples required to learn the\n$\\epsilon$-optimal value of a second state that is a sufficient number of\ntransitions away from the first. Inversely, states within each other's vicinity\nhave values that are dependent on each other and will require a similar number\nof samples to learn. By approximating the original MDP using smaller MDPs\nconstructed using subsets of the original's state-space, we are able to reduce\nthe sample-complexity by a logarithmic factor to $O(SA \\log A)$ timesteps,\nwhere $S$ and $A$ are the state and action space sizes.

However, they face challenges such as\nambiguity in user requests processed by LLMs. To address these challenges, this\npaper introduces and evaluates a multi-agent debate framework designed to\nenhance detection and resolution capabilities beyond single models. The\nframework consists of three LLM architectures (Llama3-8B, Gemma2-9B, and\nMistral-7B variants) and a dataset with diverse ambiguities. The debate\nframework markedly enhanced the performance of Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B\nvariants over their individual baselines, with Mistral-7B-led debates achieving\na notable 76.7% success rate and proving particularly effective for complex\nambiguities and efficient consensus. While acknowledging varying model\nresponses to collaborative strategies, these findings underscore the debate\nframework's value as a targeted method for augmenting LLM capabilities. This\nwork offers important insights for developing more robust and adaptive language\nunderstanding systems by showing how structured debates can lead to improved\nclarity in interactive systems.",

Tyche provides an API for partitioning, sharing, attesting, and\nreclaiming resources through its core abstraction, trust domains (TDs). To\nprovide fine-grain isolation, TDs can recursively create and manage sub-TDs.\nTyche captures these relationships in attestations, allowing cloud tenants to\nreason about end-to-end security.

    "abstract": "Gender bias has been widely observed in speech perception tasks, influenced\nby the fundamental voicing differences between genders. This study reveals a\ngender bias in the perception of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) speech. In a\nperception experiment involving 16 Chinese listeners evaluating both Chinese\nand Greek speech, we identified that male speech was more frequently identified\nas AD, with this bias being particularly pronounced in Chinese speech. Acoustic\nanalysis showed that shimmer values in male speech were significantly\nassociated with AD perception, while speech portion exhibited a significant\nnegative correlation with AD identification. Although language did not have a\nsignificant impact on AD perception, our findings underscore the critical role\nof gender bias in AD speech perception. This work highlights the necessity of\naddressing gender bias when developing AD detection models and calls for\nfurther research to validate model performance across different linguistic\ncontexts.",

However,\nsince brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of\nthis process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording\nneural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography\n(fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and\nscarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer\nthe well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve\nunderstanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better\ndetection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an\nunpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which\nnotably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative\nresults at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired\ndataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature\nnewborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that\nour method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error\nin the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the\nfrequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We\nset a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our\ndeveloped tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis.\nOverall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired\nsignal translation applications.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring that neural models used in real-world applications cannot infer\nsensitive information, such as demographic attributes like gender or race, from\ntext representations is a critical challenge when fairness is a concern. We\naddress this issue through concept erasure, a process that removes information\nrelated to a specific concept from distributed representations while preserving\nas much of the remaining semantic information as possible. Our approach\ninvolves learning an orthogonal projection in the embedding space, designed to\nmake the class-conditional feature distributions of the discrete concept to\nerase indistinguishable after projection. By adjusting the rank of the\nprojector, we control the extent of information removal, while its\northogonality ensures strict preservation of the local structure of the\nembeddings. Our method, termed $\\overline{\\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD, achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in nonlinear erasure of a discrete attribute on\nclassic natural language processing benchmarks. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat $\\overline{\\mathrm{L}}$EOPARD effectively mitigates bias in deep nonlinear\nclassifiers, thereby promoting fairness.",

    "abstract": "The focus of the present paper is to forecast mortality rates for small\nsub-populations that are parts of a larger super-population. In this setting\nthe assumption is that it is possible to produce reliable forecasts for the\nsuper-population, but the sub-populations may be too small or lack sufficient\nhistory to produce reliable forecasts if modelled separately. This setup is\naligned with the ideas that underpin credibility theory, and in the present\npaper the classical credibility theory approach is extended to be able to\nhandle the situation where future mortality rates are driven by a latent\nstochastic process, as is the case for, e.g., Lee-Carter type models.\n  This results in sub-population credibility predictors that are weighted\naverages of expected future super-population mortality rates and expected\nfuture sub-population specific mortality rates. Due to the predictor's simple\nstructure it is possible to derive an explicit expression for the mean squared\nerror of prediction. Moreover, the proposed credibility modelling approach does\nnot depend on the specific form of the super-population model, making it\nbroadly applicable regardless of the chosen forecasting model for the\nsuper-population.\n  The performance of the suggested sub-population credibility predictor is\nillustrated on simulated population data. These illustrations highlight how the\ncredibility predictor serves as a compromise between only using a\nsuper-population model, and only using a potentially unreliable sub-population\nspecific model.",

In this work, we demonstrate that employing\nNPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we\nextend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically,\nthe NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating\nfundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support\ndeletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational\ncomplexity of the NPD is $O(AN\\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a\ncomputational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel.\nWe evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates\n$\\delta\\in\\{0.01, 0.1\\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by\nthe trellis decoder by Tal et al.

    "abstract": "With the increasing energy demand and the growing integration of renewable\nsources of energy, power systems face operational challenges such as overloads,\nlosses, and stability concerns, particularly as networks operate near their\ncapacity limits. Flexible alternating current transmission system (FACTS)\ndevices are essential to ensure reliable grid operations and enable the\nefficient integration of renewable energy. This work introduces a mixed-integer\nsecond-order cone programming (MISOCP) model for the multi-period scheduling of\nkey FACTS devices in electric transmission systems. The proposed model\nintegrates four key control mechanisms: (i) on-load tap changers (OLTCs) for\nvoltage regulation via discrete taps; (ii) static synchronous compensators\n(STATCOMs) and (iii) shunt reactors for reactive power compensation; and (iv)\nthyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSCs) for adjustable impedance and\nflow control. The objective is to minimize active power losses using a limited\nnumber of control actions while meeting physical and operational constraints at\nall times throughout the defined time horizon. To ensure tractability, the\nmodel employs a second-order cone relaxation of the power flow. Device-specific\nconstraints are handled via binary expansion and linearization: OLTCs and shunt\nreactors are modelled with discrete variables, STATCOMs through reactive power\nbounds, and TCSCs using a reformulation-linearization technique (RLT). A\nmulti-period formulation captures the sequential nature of decision making,\nensuring consistency across time steps. The model is evaluated on the IEEE\n9-bus, 30-bus, and RTS96 test systems, demonstrating its ability to reduce\nlosses, with potential applicability to larger-scale grids.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and predicting the phase behavior of intrinsically disordered\nproteins (IDPs) is of significant interest due to their role in many biological\nprocesses. However, effectively characterizing phase behavior and its complex\ndependence on protein primary sequence remains challenging. In this study, we\nevaluate the efficacy of several simple computational metrics to quantify the\npropensity of single-component IDP solutions to phase separate; specific\nmetrics considered include the single-chain radius of gyration, the second\nvirial coefficient, and a newly proposed quantity termed the expenditure\ndensity. Each metric is computed using coarse-grained molecular dynamics\nsimulations for 2,034 IDP sequences. Using machine learning, we analyze this\ndata to understand how sequence features correlate with the predictive\nperformance of each metric and to develop insight into their respective\nstrengths and limitations. The expenditure density is determined to be a\nbroadly useful metric that combines simplicity, low computational cost, and\naccuracy; it also provides a continuous measure that remains informative across\nboth phase-separating and non-phase-separating sequences. Additionally, this\nmetric shows promise in its ability to improve predictions of other properties\nfor IDP systems. This work extends existing literature by advancing beyond\nbinary classification, which can be useful for rapidly screening phase behavior\nor predicting other properties of IDP-related systems.",

In the realm\nof Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like\nRegister-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,\ndespite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a\ndearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware\ndescription languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these\nmodels across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their\nsuitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This\nmethod not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization\nbut also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs\nfor VHDL.",

    "abstract": "Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing\n(NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation\nidentification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant\nadvances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the\nabsence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the\nexisting anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and\ndevelopment of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive\nempirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection,\nleveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide\narray of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of\nembedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language\nmodels (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI\n(small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media,\nscientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC).\nOur experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality\nsignificantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based\napproaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow\nalgorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived\nembeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in\ncross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid\nmodel evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical\napplications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes\nall embeddings from different models and code at\nhttps://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work\nprovides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly\ndetection systems.",

We propose a novel \\textbf{concept erasure} method for\ntext-to-image diffusion models, designed to remove specified concepts (e.g., a\nprivate individual or a harmful stereotype) from the model's generative\nrepertoire. Our method, termed \\textbf{FADE} (Fair Adversarial Diffusion\nErasure), combines a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy with an adversarial\nobjective to ensure the concept is reliably removed while preserving overall\nmodel fidelity. Theoretically, we prove a formal guarantee that our approach\nminimizes the mutual information between the erased concept and the model's\noutputs, ensuring privacy and fairness. Empirically, we evaluate FADE on Stable\nDiffusion and FLUX, using benchmarks from prior work (e.g., object, celebrity,\nexplicit content, and style erasure tasks from MACE). FADE achieves\nstate-of-the-art concept removal performance, surpassing recent baselines like\nESD, UCE, MACE, and ANT in terms of removal efficacy and image quality.\nNotably, FADE improves the harmonic mean of concept removal and fidelity by\n5--10\\% over the best prior method. We also conduct an ablation study to\nvalidate each component of FADE, confirming that our adversarial and\ntrajectory-preserving objectives each contribute to its superior performance.\nOur work sets a new standard for safe and fair generative modeling by\nunlearning specified concepts without retraining from scratch.",

    "abstract": "We present an all-sky search for long-duration gravitational waves (GWs) from\nthe first part of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA fourth observing run (O4), called O4a\nand comprising data taken between 24 May 2023 and 16 January 2024. The GW\nsignals targeted by this search are the so-called \"long-duration\" (> 1 s)\ntransients expected from a variety of astrophysical processes, including\nnon-axisymmetric deformations in magnetars or eccentric binary coalescences. We\nmake minimal assumptions on the emitted GW waveforms in terms of morphologies\nand durations. Overall, our search targets signals with durations ~1-1000 s and\nfrequency content in the range 16-2048 Hz. In the absence of significant\ndetections, we report the sensitivity limits of our search in terms of\nroot-sum-square signal amplitude (hrss) of reference waveforms. These limits\nimprove upon the results from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3) by\nabout 30% on average. Moreover, this analysis demonstrates substantial progress\nin our ability to search for long-duration GW signals owing to enhancements in\npipeline detection efficiencies. As detector sensitivities continue to advance\nand observational runs grow longer, unmodeled long-duration searches will\nincreasingly be able to explore a range of compelling astrophysical scenarios\ninvolving neutron stars and black holes.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic\nsuperconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar\nmetallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a\nfundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a\nregime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length.\nThe foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic\ndevice that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence\nbetween fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we\ndemonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result\nin rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport\nand screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the\njunction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current\ncrowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional\nswitching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field\nrectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between\ntransport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics\nwithin the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent\nGinzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental\nobservations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and\nrearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various\ngeometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement\nin determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in\nbridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our\nfindings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for\ndesigning and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.",

The cold dust component, which dominates the dust mass,\nis primarily heated by stellar radiation, including both young, massive stars\nand the diffuse emission from older stars.

Using 18 large, face-on spiral galaxies from the DustPedia project,\nwe apply two complementary approaches: (1) correlation analysis between dust\ntemperature (T_dust), SFR surface density (Sigma_SFR), and stellar mass surface\ndensity (Sigma_Mstar); and (2) study of the relationship between T_dust and\ndust mass surface density (Sigma_dust).\n  Results. T_dust peaks at ~24 K in galaxy centers and drops to ~15 K at large\nradii. Galaxies with and without AGNs show similar T_dust profiles.

While linear wave theory provides a first-order description\nof wave motion, real-world oceanic environments are governed by nonlinear\ninteractions that are responsible for a transfer of energy between waves of\ndifferent lengths. The pioneering research by O. Phillips, K. Hasselmann, and\nV. Zakharov in the 1960s introduced the concept that four-wave resonant\ninteractions serve as the primary mechanism for energy transfers among wave\ncomponents in oceanic surface wave fields. Although the presence and efficiency\nof these resonant interactions have been demonstrated in controlled determinist\nwave tank experiments, their direct identification in the real ocean, where a\nlarge number of random waves interact, has remained elusive. Here, using a\nstereoscopic system that enables the measurement of surface elevation in both\nspace and time, we provide experimental evidence of resonant interactions in\nocean wind waves. Our data not only reproduce the well-known figure-eight\npattern predicted by Phillips, but also reveal a continuum of different\nresonant configurations that closely match the theoretical predictions. These\nfindings support the validity of third-generation ocean wave models,\nstrengthening their ability to accurately capture wave dynamics in the ocean",

Naturally occurring fluoride and industrial runoff can\nresult in concentrations far exceeding the World Health Organization's\nrecommended limits in water supplies. In this study, we derive a model\nincorporating the dominant mechanisms governing fluoride removal from drinking\nwater using the two adsorbents mineral-rich carbon (MRC) and chemically treated\nmineral-rich carbon (TMRC). Using both new and previously published\nexperimental data, we validate the model for MRC, TMRC, and their mixture,\nusing both batch and column data. Despite the filters containing approximately\n40:1 MRC:TMRC ratio by mass, we find that TMRC dominates fluoride removal,\nwhile MRC contributes at early and late times. The full column model, which\nuses parameters from isotherm batch studies, achieves excellent agreement with\nexperimental breakthrough data across varying inlet concentrations and flow\nrates (R$^2>0.991$, SSE$<0.0632$). Motivated by this, we propose a reduced\nmodel based solely on TMRC adsorption, with a single fitting parameter, which\nstill performs well across all breakthrough curves (R$^2 > 0.983$, SSE\n$<0.117$). The simplicity of this model means that it is straightforward and\ninexpensive to work with numerically. In both models, batch and column\nbehaviours are reconciled and, for the case of breakthrough curves with varying\ninlet concentrations, a set of globally optimised parameters is found. The\nstrong agreement with experimental data supports the model's robustness and\nreinforces the physical interpretability of its parameters.

The scalar\nfield possesses a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) during inflation, so\nthat its interaction with the axion effectively serves as an explicit\nPeccei-Quinn (PQ) violating term. At a temperature below the PQ phase\ntransition, the effective PQ violating interaction generates the axion\npotential which generally contains multiple degenerate vacua leading to the\nformation of the axion string-domain wall networks. The following QCD phase\ntransition provides another contribution to the axion potential making domain\nwalls decay before they dominate the Universe. Later, the scalar field starts\nto relax to the minimum of its potential with a vanishing VEV, turning off the\neffective PQ violating interaction so that the axion potential is aligned with\nthe QCD vacuum. We keep track of the evolution of the axion-scalar system and\ndiscuss the production of the axion DM through the domain wall decay and the\n(trapped) misalignment. We find that the string-wall network in some cases can\ndecay due to its structural instability, rather than the volume pressure, and\nthe correct axion DM abundance is realized with the decay constant larger than\nthat of the conventional post-inflationary QCD axion without fine tuning.",

The fundamental problem of this description is associated with\nthe polycrystalline nature of the crust: similar to terrestrial materials, the\nelastic moduli, strictly speaking, depend on the shape and orientation of\ncrystallites, but for the crust, they are unknown. As a result, some\nassumptions are generally required to predict the elastic properties or\nconstrain their possible range. In this paper, we follow the commonly believed\nassumption that the crust is (locally) isotropic, which allows us to describe\nelastic properties by two (effective) parameters: bulk and shear moduli. The\nbulk modulus is well determined by the Voigt-Reuss bounds, and we constrain the\nshear modulus by applying, for the first time in astrophysics of compact stars,\nthe variational Hashin-Shtrikman approach, based on the additional assumption\nthat there are no correlations in the orientation of crystallites. We analyse\nthe Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the one-component crust taking into account the\nelectron screening and the motion of the nuclei, and for two-component static\ncrystals. In particular, we demonstrate that within applied assumptions the\neffective shear modulus should be lower than the Voigt estimate, typically\napplied in the astrophysical literature.",

    "abstract": "Ever since Clos topologies were used in datacenter networks (DCNs), a\npractical centralized scheduling algorithm that supports dynamic scheduling has\nbeen absent. The introduction of optical switches in DCNs as a future-proof\nsolution exacerbates this problem due to several properties of optical\nswitches, such as the fact that they are generally bufferless and therefore\nrely on centralized scheduling, and that they have long switching times and\ntherefore require the number of rearrangements to be minimized.\n  In this paper, we propose a centralized scheduling algorithm that achieves\ntheoretical maximum throughput even in one-rate bidirectional Clos networks,\nwhile producing schemes with near-minimal numbers of rearrangements. It is the\nonly algorithm that directly supports bidirectional Clos networks and has a\ntime efficiency high enough to support dynamic scheduling to date. For static\nminimal rewiring, its running time ranges from a fraction to a few hundredths\nof other algorithms, and the number of rearrangements has also been steadily\nimproved, allowing for more frequent adjustments and less impact on ongoing\ncommunications. In addition, the algorithm is very flexible and can support\nvarious functional requirements in real-world environments. We achieve this\nresult through the replacement chain concept and bitset optimization.",

In this study, we address\nthis challenge by introducing a framework for learning a surrogate quantum\ncircuit (SQC) that approximates the full Bhatnagar Gross Krook (BGK) collision\noperator for the D2Q9 lattice. The four qubit circuit is trained to respect the\nphysical properties of the BGK collision operator, including mass and momentum\nconservation, D8 equivariance and scale equivariance.

We\nintroduce spVarBayes, a suite of fast variational Bayesian approaches for\nlarge-scale geospatial data analysis using NNGP. Our contributions are\nprimarily computational. We replace auto-differentiation with a combination of\ncalculus of variations, closed-form gradient updates, and linear response\ncorrections for improved variance estimation. We also accommodate covariates\n(fixed effects) in the model and offer inference on the variance parameters.\nSimulation experiments demonstrate that we achieve comparable accuracy to\nspNNGP but with reduced computational costs, and considerably outperform\nexisting variational inference methods in terms of both accuracy and speed.\nAnalysis of a large forest canopy height dataset illustrates the practical\nimplementation of proposed methods and shows that the inference results are\nconsistent with those obtained from the MCMC approach.

This behaviour,\nobserved through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and\ncreation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including\ntheir average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect\na genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed\noscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical\nanalysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation\nof the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported\nby a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number,\nsuggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after\na finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical\nproof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a\nnon-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic\noscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the\nreported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with\nhigh-order squeezing states.",

Linear combinations of such functions are\ncalled graph motif parameters and have recently received significant attention\nin counting complexity after a seminal paper by Curticapean, Dell and Marx\n(STOC'17). We show that, among linear combinations of functions #IndSub(H,*)\ninvolving only graphs H without isolated vertices, precisely those with\npositive integer coefficients maintain a combinatorial interpretation. It is\nimportant to note that graph motif parameters can be nonnegative for all inputs\nG, even when some coefficients are negative.\n  Formally, we show that evaluating any graph motif parameter with a negative\ncoefficient is impossible in an oracle variant of #P, where an implicit graph\nis accessed by oracle queries. Our proof follows the classification of the\nrelativizing closure properties of #P by Hertrampf, Vollmer, and Wagner\n(SCT'95) and the framework developed by Ikenmeyer and Pak (STOC'22), but our\napplication of the required Ramsey theorem turns out to be more subtle, as\ngraphs do not have the required Ramsey property.\n  Our techniques generalize from graphs to relational structures, including\ncolored graphs. Vastly generalizing this, we introduce motif parameters over\ncategories that count occurrences of sub-objects in the category. We then prove\na general dichotomy theorem that characterizes which such parameters have a\ncombinatorial interpretation.

When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several\nperspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the\ncontent creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating\nthe repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern\nacross all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes\nplace when recommender systems are almost \"too good\", making recommendations so\ntailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of\nopinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas.

    "abstract": "Phrase grounding, i.e., mapping natural language phrases to specific image\nregions, holds significant potential for disease localization in medical\nimaging through clinical reports. While current state-of-the-art methods rely\non discriminative, self-supervised contrastive models, we demonstrate that\ngenerative text-to-image diffusion models, leveraging cross-attention maps, can\nachieve superior zero-shot phrase grounding performance. Contrary to prior\nassumptions, we show that fine-tuning diffusion models with a frozen,\ndomain-specific language model, such as CXR-BERT, substantially outperforms\ndomain-agnostic counterparts. This setup achieves remarkable improvements, with\nmIoU scores doubling those of current discriminative methods. These findings\nhighlight the underexplored potential of generative models for phrase grounding\ntasks. To further enhance performance, we introduce Bimodal Bias Merging (BBM),\na novel post-processing technique that aligns text and image biases to identify\nregions of high certainty. BBM refines cross-attention maps, achieving even\ngreater localization accuracy. Our results establish generative approaches as a\nmore effective paradigm for phrase grounding in the medical imaging domain,\npaving the way for more robust and interpretable applications in clinical\npractice.

More to the point, it is generally unclear what to expect of\nmachine-learning approaches, let alone single out which approaches are\npromising. In the work at hand, we advocate Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for\nmicromechanics, empowering them by insights from computational micromechanics\nmethods based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We construct an FNO\nsurrogate mimicking the basic scheme foundational for FFT-based methods and\nshow that the resulting operator predicts solutions to cell problems with\narbitrary stiffness distribution only subject to a material-contrast constraint\nup to a desired accuracy. In particular, there are no restrictions on the\nmaterial symmetry like isotropy, on the number of phases and on the geometry of\nthe interfaces between materials. Also, the provided fidelity is sharp and\nuniform, providing explicit guarantees leveraging our physical empowerment of\nFNOs. To show the desired universal approximation property, we construct an FNO\nexplicitly that requires no training to begin with. Still, the obtained neural\noperator complies with the same memory requirements as the basic scheme and\ncomes with runtimes proportional to classical FFT solvers. In particular,\nlarge-scale problems with more than 100 million voxels are readily handled. The\ngoal of this work is to underline the potential of FNOs for solving\nmicromechanical problems, linking FFT-based methods to FNOs.

We find\nthat the strain is primarily sourced by the Newtonian gravitational\nacceleration of the mirrors toward the clump and by the Shapiro time delay of\nthe photons in the laser beams as they pass through the gravitational potential\ncreated by the dark matter clump.

Indeed, this was a\nprimary source of skepticism regarding the feasibility of DNNs in the early\ndays of the field. The past decades of progress in deep learning have revealed\nthis skepticism to be misplaced, and a large body of empirical evidence shows\nthat sufficiently large DNNs following standard training protocols exhibit\nwell-behaved optimization dynamics that converge to performant solutions. This\nsuccess has biased the community to use convex optimization as a mental model\nfor learning, leading to a focus on training efficiency, either in terms of\nrequired iteration, FLOPs or wall-clock time, when improving optimizers. We\nargue that, while this perspective has proven extremely fruitful, another\nperspective specific to DNNs has received considerably less attention: the\noptimizer not only influences the rate of convergence, but also the qualitative\nproperties of the learned solutions. Restated, the optimizer can and will\nencode inductive biases and change the effective expressivity of a given class\nof models. Furthermore, we believe the optimizer can be an effective way of\nencoding desiderata in the learning process. We contend that the community\nshould aim at understanding the biases of already existing methods, as well as\naim to build new optimizers with the explicit intent of inducing certain\nproperties of the solution, rather than solely judging them based on their\nconvergence rates. We hope our arguments will inspire research to improve our\nunderstanding of how the learning process can impact the type of solution we\nconverge to, and lead to a greater recognition of optimizers design as a\ncritical lever that complements the roles of architecture and data in shaping\nmodel outcomes.",

From optical and mid-IR oxygen\nemission lines, we measured direct-method abundances for three ionic states of\noxygen, including O$^{3+}$/H$^+$. In contrast to previous studies of I Zw 18,\nthe high spatial resolution afforded by KCWI and MIRI/MRS revealed chemical\ninhomogeneities on 60 pc scales in the form of metal-poor pockets and\nmetal-enriched gas. These are located outside I Zw 18's star-forming complexes\nhaving possibly been dispersed beyond these regions via stellar feedback\neffects. We found that metallicities derived using a single low-ionization\ndensity tracer, and T$_{\\rm e}$([O II]) derived from a temperature relationship\ncommonly used in high-$z$ galaxy studies, exhibited the largest scatter and\nunderestimated the metallicity compared to those derived using multi-ion\ndensities and estimated T$_{\\rm e}$([N II]). Finally, we compared\nO$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundances from a theoretical ionization correction factor (ICF)\nagainst observed values and found that the oxygen ICF underestimates the\nO$^{3+}$/H$^+$ abundance by a factor of 2, indicating that either additional\nionizing sources are needed or standard stellar population models are unable to\nproduce the requisite ionizing flux.",

Existing synchronization methods,\nsuch as the previous-tick approach, suffer from information loss and create\nartificial price staleness. We introduce a novel framework that recasts the\ndata synchronization challenge as a constrained matrix completion problem. Our\napproach recovers the potential matrix of high-frequency price increments by\nminimizing its nuclear norm -- capturing the underlying low-rank factor\nstructure -- subject to a large-scale linear system derived from observed,\nasynchronous price changes. Theoretically, we prove the existence and\nuniqueness of our estimator and establish its convergence rate. A key\ntheoretical insight is that our method accurately and robustly leverages\ninformation from both frequently and infrequently traded assets, overcoming a\ncritical difficulty of efficiency loss in traditional methods. Empirically,\nusing extensive simulations and a large panel of S&P 500 stocks, we demonstrate\nthat our method substantially outperforms established benchmarks. It not only\nachieves significantly lower synchronization errors, but also corrects the bias\nin systematic risk estimates (i.e., eigenvalues) and the estimate of betas\ncaused by stale prices. Crucially, portfolios constructed using our\nsynchronized data yield consistently and economically significant higher\nout-of-sample Sharpe ratios. Our framework provides a powerful tool for\nuncovering the true dynamics of asset prices, with direct implications for\nhigh-frequency risk management, algorithmic trading, and econometric inference.",

In this study, we\ninvestigate a physics-informed linear model (PILM) that uses linear\ncombinations of basis functions to represent solutions, thereby enabling an\nanalytical representation of optimal solutions.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness\nin spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully\nobservable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt\nChinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate\nrules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such\nenvironments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a\nlarge-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert\nannotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce\nXiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning\nfor legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating\nstrategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying\nreinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with\nmulti-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our\nExperimental results indicate that, despite their size and power,\ngeneral-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these\ntasks.

Additionally, through detailed modeling of each\ncycle process, particularly the recycling process, and utilizing the gas-phase\nmass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z=0$ as a constraint, our model establishes\na relation between the recycle fraction and halo mass.

In fact, the first statement\nof the theorem mathematically proves the uniqueness of the equilibrium\ntemperature that is attained when n different bodies at different temperatures\nare brought in contact. The second statement of the theorem gives a\nmathematical proof of the fact that the process in which n bodies at different\ntemperatures when brought in contact equilibriate to a common temperature is\nspontaneous,i.e., entropically favourable.

    "abstract": "Existing LGL methods typically consider only partial information (e.g.,\ngeometric features) from LiDAR observations or are designed for homogeneous\nLiDAR sensors, overlooking the uniformity in LGL. In this work, a uniform LGL\nmethod is proposed, termed UniLGL, which simultaneously achieves spatial and\nmaterial uniformity, as well as sensor-type uniformity. The key idea of the\nproposed method is to encode the complete point cloud, which contains both\ngeometric and material information, into a pair of BEV images (i.e., a spatial\nBEV image and an intensity BEV image). An end-to-end multi-BEV fusion network\nis designed to extract uniform features, equipping UniLGL with spatial and\nmaterial uniformity. To ensure robust LGL across heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, a\nviewpoint invariance hypothesis is introduced, which replaces the conventional\ntranslation equivariance assumption commonly used in existing LPR networks and\nsupervises UniLGL to achieve sensor-type uniformity in both global descriptors\nand local feature representations. Finally, based on the mapping between local\nfeatures on the 2D BEV image and the point cloud, a robust global pose\nestimator is derived that determines the global minimum of the global pose on\nSE(3) without requiring additional registration. To validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed uniform LGL, extensive benchmarks are conducted in real-world\nenvironments, and the results show that the proposed UniLGL is demonstratively\ncompetitive compared to other State-of-the-Art LGL methods. Furthermore, UniLGL\nhas been deployed on diverse platforms, including full-size trucks and agile\nMicro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), to enable high-precision localization and mapping\nas well as multi-MAV collaborative exploration in port and forest environments,\ndemonstrating the applicability of UniLGL in industrial and field scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement\nmethods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This\nleads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making\nthe model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper\nproposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature\nspace decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet\ntransform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and\nhigh-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by\nadjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through\nmulti-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature\nspace is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and\nmultiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo\nlow-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to\nimprove enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided\ncross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency\nbranches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting\nvaluable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the\nhigh-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is\nproposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset\nconsisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform\nillumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate\nthat our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while\neffectively recovering high-frequency information.

Out-of-domain\nuncertainty arises when the system operates under conditions not represented in\nthe initial training dataset, while in-domain uncertainty results from\nreal-world variability and flaws in the model structure or training process. To\nhandle out-of-domain uncertainty, a slow learning component, inspired by the\nhuman brain's slow thinking process, learns system dynamics under unexplored\noperating conditions, and it is activated only when a monitoring strategy deems\nit necessary. This component consists of an ensemble of models, featuring (i) a\ncombination rule that weights individual models based on the statistical\nproximity between their training data and the current operating condition, and\n(ii) a monitoring algorithm based on statistical control charts that supervises\nthe ensemble's reliability and triggers the offline training and integration of\na new model when a new operating condition is detected. To address in-domain\nuncertainty, a fast learning component, inspired by the human brain's fast\nthinking process, continuously compensates in real time for the mismatch of the\nslow learning model. This component is implemented as a Gaussian process (GP)\nmodel, trained online at each iteration using recent data while discarding\nolder samples.

While game-theoretic methods\nare widely acknowledged for their effectiveness in managing multi-agent\ninteractions, significant impediments persist when it comes to accommodating\nthe intentional uncertainties of agents. In the context of intentional\nuncertainties, the heavy computational burdens associated with existing\ngame-theoretic methods are induced, leading to inefficiencies and poor\nscalability. In this paper, we propose a novel game-theoretic interactive\ntrajectory planning method to effectively address the intentional uncertainties\nof agents, and it demonstrates both high efficiency and enhanced scalability.\nAs the underpinning basis, we model the interactions between agents under\nintentional uncertainties as a general Bayesian game, and we show that its\nagent-form equivalence can be represented as a potential game under certain\nminor assumptions. The existence and attainability of the optimal interactive\ntrajectories are illustrated, as the corresponding Bayesian Nash equilibrium\ncan be attained by optimizing a unified optimization problem. Additionally, we\npresent a distributed algorithm based on the dual consensus alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) tailored to the parallel solving of the\nproblem, thereby significantly improving the scalability. The attendant\noutcomes from simulations and experiments demonstrate that the proposed method\nis effective across a range of scenarios characterized by general forms of\nintentional uncertainties.

In this work, we examine a geometric approach to\ninvestigating the matter-antimatter asymmetry, grounded not in physics beyond\nthe Standard Model, but in the structure of spacetime itself.

We study the Dirac spinor field in this\nbackground and derive the corresponding Dirac equation.

    "abstract": "This article introduces an advanced space mapping (SM) technique that applies\na shared electromagnetic (EM)-based coarse model for multistate tuning-driven\nmultiphysics optimization of tunable filters. The SM method combines the\ncomputational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of\nmultiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics\nresponses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values.\nConversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of\nmultiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter\nvalues. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate\nmodels, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping\nneural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM\nsingle-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in\nthe multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate\ntransition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each\nsubsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but\npossesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple\nsubsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each\ntuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning\nstates, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their\nrespective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts\nfor all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state\nrequirements. Multiple EM and multiphysics training samples are generated\nconcurrently to develop the surrogate model. Compared with existing direct\nmultiphysics parameterized modeling techniques, our proposed method achieves\nsuperior multiphysics modeling accuracy with fewer training samples and reduced\ncomputational costs.",

Sidewalk delivery\nrobots, increasingly deployed in urban environments, offer a promising solution\nto these limitations. This paper explores how these robots can serve as mobile\ndata collection platforms, capturing sidewalk-level features related to\nwalkability in a scalable, automated, and real-time manner. A sensor-equipped\nrobot was deployed on a sidewalk network at KTH in Stockholm, completing 101\ntrips covering 900 segments. From the collected data, different typologies of\nfeatures are derived, including robot trip characteristics (e.g., speed,\nduration), sidewalk conditions (e.g., width, surface unevenness), and sidewalk\nutilization (e.g., pedestrian density). Their walkability-related implications\nwere investigated with a series of analyses. The results demonstrate that\npedestrian movement patterns are strongly influenced by sidewalk\ncharacteristics, with higher density, reduced width, and surface irregularity\nassociated with slower and more variable trajectories. Notably, robot speed\nclosely mirrors pedestrian behavior, highlighting its potential as a proxy for\nassessing pedestrian dynamics. The proposed framework enables continuous\nmonitoring of sidewalk conditions and pedestrian behavior, contributing to the\ndevelopment of more walkable, inclusive, and responsive urban environments.",

To overcome these dual challenges, we\npropose a Bilateral Grid-based Pixel-Adaptive Multi-layer Perceptron (BPAM)\nframework. Our approach synergizes the spatial modeling of bilateral grids with\nthe non-linear capabilities of MLPs. Specifically, we generate bilateral grids\ncontaining MLP parameters, where each pixel dynamically retrieves its unique\ntransformation parameters and obtain a distinct MLP for color mapping based on\nspatial coordinates and intensity values. In addition, we propose a novel grid\ndecomposition strategy that categorizes MLP parameters into distinct types\nstored in separate subgrids. Multi-channel guidance maps are used to extract\ncategory-specific parameters from corresponding subgrids, ensuring effective\nutilization of color information during slicing while guiding precise parameter\ngeneration.

The problem is famous for its intriguing properties and for evading\nstandard techniques for designing and analyzing online algorithms. Even on\nuniform metric spaces with sufficiently many points, the deterministic\ncompetitive ratio of weighted $k$-server is known to increase doubly\nexponentially with respect to $k$, while the behavior of its randomized\ncompetitive ratio is not fully understood. Specifically, no upper bound better\nthan doubly exponential is known, while the best known lower bound is singly\nexponential in $k$. In this paper, we close the exponential gap between these\nbounds by giving an $\\exp(O(k^2))$-competitive randomized online algorithm for\nthe weighted $k$-server problem on uniform metrics, thus breaking the doubly\nexponential barrier for deterministic algorithms for the first time. This is\nachieved by a recursively defined notion of a phase which, on the one hand,\nforces a lower bound on the cost of any offline solution, while, on the other\nhand, also admits a randomized online algorithm with bounded expected cost. The\nalgorithm is also recursive; it involves running several algorithms virtually\nand in parallel and following the decisions of one of them in a random order.\nWe also show that our techniques can be lifted to construct an\n$\\exp(O(k^2))$-competitive randomized online algorithm for the generalized\n$k$-server problem on weighted uniform metrics.",

A key mechanism in this\nprocess is chemical interface damping (CID), where surface plasmons are damped\nby adsorbed molecules, enabling the transfer of charge to adsorbed molecules.\nIn this study, we investigate the relationship between CID and\nadsorbate-induced changes in DC electrical resistivity for four molecular\nadsorbates-adenine, 4-aminothiophenol (ATP), biphenyl thiol (BPT), and\n1-dodecanethiol (DDT)-on gold surfaces. Our results reveal two distinct CID\nregimes. BPT causes CID via direct electronic transitions to the lowest\nunoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which is centered at approx. 2 eV above\nthe Fermi level and can be resonantly excited by the plasmon. This mechanism is\ndependent on plasmon energy. In contrast, ATP, adenine and DDT lead to plasmon\ndamping through inelastic electron scattering at the metal-molecule interface.\nThis regime shows a weaker dependency on plasmon energy since it does not\ninvolve resonant electron excitation between hybridized metal-molecule states.\nThis same mechanism contributes to adsorbate-induced changes in DC resistivity,\nsuggesting that resistivity measurements can serve as a probe of plasmonic\nenergy transfer, as highlighted by the good correlation between the two\neffects.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in spatially selective active noise control (SSANC) using\nmultiple microphones have enabled hearables to suppress undesired noise while\npreserving desired speech from a specific direction. Aiming to achieve minimal\nspeech distortion, a hard constraint has been used in previous work in the\noptimization problem to compute the control filter. In this work, we propose a\nsoft-constrained SSANC system that uses a frequency-independent parameter to\ntrade off between speech distortion and noise reduction. We derive both time-\nand frequency-domain formulations, and show that conventional active noise\ncontrol and hard-constrained SSANC represent two limiting cases of the proposed\ndesign. We evaluate the system through simulations using a pair of open-fitting\nhearables in an anechoic environment with one speech source and two noise\nsources. The simulation results validate the theoretical derivations and\ndemonstrate that for a broad range of the trade-off parameter, the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and the speech quality and intelligibility in terms of\nPESQ and ESTOI can be substantially improved compared to the hard-constrained\ndesign.",

However, due to the exponential\ngrowth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical\nsimulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the\nother hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states\nas quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and\nthe Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable\ndynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This\nformalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function\ndynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in\nterms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of\nqubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over\nphase-space.",

The simulations were\nproduced with the latest version of the PINOCCHIO code, and provide the\nlargest, public set of simulated skies. Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by\npopulating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD)\nmodel extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid\nCollaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling\na 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg\nradius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of\n$1.5\\times10^{11}$ Msun/h. The relatively small box size makes this set unfit\nfor measuring very large scales. The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000\nsimulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that\ncovers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we\nproduced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose\ncomoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two\nsets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point\ncorrelation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is\nconsistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although\nwe noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show\ncosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that\nusing one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock\nproduces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample\nvariance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis\nof Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1).",

Next, the effect of the chromium\nconcentration on the film roughness and crystal quality is investigated.\nFinally, both the substrate temperature and the chromium concentration are\ninvestigated with respect to their effect on the magneto-transport properties\nof the magnetic topological insulator thin films. It becomes apparent that the\nsubstrate temperature and the chromium concentration can be used to tune the\nFermi level of the film which allows to make the material intrinsically charge\nneutral.

A CDAD may arise from\nintrinsic material properties like chirality, spin-orbit interaction, or\nquantum-geometrical effects on the electronic structure. In addition, CDAD has\nalso been reported for achiral organic molecules at the interface to metallic\nsubstrates. For this latter case, we investigate two prototypical\n$\\pi$-conjugated molecules, namely tetracene and pentacene, whose frontier\norbitals have a similar shape but exhibit distinctly different symmetries. By\ncomparing experimental CDAD momentum maps with simulations within\ntime-dependent density functional theory, we show how the final state of the\nphotoelectron must be regarded as the source of the CDAD in such otherwise\nachiral systems.

    "abstract": "The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental\nchallenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint\nstate-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL)\nmethod for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous\nvehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions:\nFirst, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow,\neffectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease\nthe search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game\ntopology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a\ntopology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual\ninformation. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV\npenetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations\nencompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic\nperformance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL\nsuccessfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits\nsuperior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision\nsmoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates\ndecision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in\nboth mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

However,\nexisting Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their\ninability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In\nthis work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph\nretrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over\ntemporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal\nambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units\n(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal\nanchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture\ntemporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event\ngraph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting\nefficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent\ngeneration, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that\nretrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time\nChain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This\nunified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event\nsequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG\nsystems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of\nthree typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more\nfaithful and temporal-aware generation.

However, the rapid\nexpansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps\nteams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that\nis both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for\npricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and\nscale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing\n(iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these\nchallenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines\noperational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in\nresponse to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We\npresent an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML\npricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while\nminimizing human error.

In this paper, we address these challenges through\ntwo main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse\nlongitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different\nurban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building\noutlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles\nthroughout the year and at different times of day.

Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to\nlearn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of\nedge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and\nincorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of\nshade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g.,\ntime of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in\ngenerating shade images.

Which model (i.e., predictor) is more\n\"useful\" in downstream decision tasks? To answer this, our first contribution\nintroduces the notion of the informativeness gap between any two predictors,\ndefined as the maximum normalized payoff advantage one predictor offers over\nthe other across all decision-making tasks. Our framework strictly generalizes\nseveral existing notions: it subsumes U-Calibration [KLST-23] and Calibration\nDecision Loss [HW-24], which compare a miscalibrated predictor to its\ncalibrated counterpart, and it recovers Blackwell informativeness [Bla-51,\nBla-53] as a special case when both predictors are perfectly calibrated. Our\nsecond contribution is a dual characterization of the informativeness gap,\nwhich gives rise to a natural informativeness measure that can be viewed as a\nrelaxed variant of the earth mover's distance (EMD) between two prediction\ndistributions. We show that this measure satisfies natural desiderata: it is\ncomplete and sound, and it can be estimated sample-efficiently in the\nprediction-only access setting. Along the way, we also obtain novel\ncombinatorial structural results when applying this measure to perfectly\ncalibrated predictors.",

    "abstract": "Accurate mapping of individual trees is an important component for precision\nagriculture in orchards, as it allows autonomous robots to perform tasks like\ntargeted operations or individual tree monitoring. However, creating these maps\nis challenging because GPS signals are often unreliable under dense tree\ncanopies. Furthermore, standard Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\napproaches struggle in orchards because the repetitive appearance of trees can\nconfuse the system, leading to mapping errors. To address this, we introduce\nTree-SLAM, a semantic SLAM approach tailored for creating maps of individual\ntrees in orchards. Utilizing RGB-D images, our method detects tree trunks with\nan instance segmentation model, estimates their location and re-identifies them\nusing a cascade-graph-based data association algorithm. These re-identified\ntrunks serve as landmarks in a factor graph framework that integrates noisy GPS\nsignals, odometry, and trunk observations. The system produces maps of\nindividual trees with a geo-localization error as low as 18 cm, which is less\nthan 20\\% of the planting distance. The proposed method was validated on\ndiverse datasets from apple and pear orchards across different seasons,\ndemonstrating high mapping accuracy and robustness in scenarios with unreliable\nGPS signals.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale enterprise systems utilizing Protocol Buffers (protobuf) present\nsignificant challenges for performance testing, particularly when targeting\nintermediate business interfaces with complex nested data structures.\nTraditional test data generation approaches are inadequate for handling the\nintricate hierarchical and graph-like structures inherent in enterprise\nprotobuf schemas. This paper presents a novel test data generation framework\nthat leverages Python's metaclass system for dynamic type enhancement and\nstatistical analysis of production logs for realistic value domain extraction.\nOur approach combines automatic schema introspection, statistical value\ndistribution analysis, and recursive descent algorithms for handling deeply\nnested structures. Experimental evaluation on three real-world enterprise\nsystems demonstrates up to 95\\% reduction in test data preparation time and\n80\\% improvement in test coverage compared to existing approaches. The\nframework successfully handles protobuf structures with up to 15 levels of\nnesting and generates comprehensive test suites containing over 100,000 test\ncases within seconds.",

Despite recent revival on magnetic Kagome compounds, no spectroscopic\naccess to their magnetic properties has been available so far due to small\ndomain sizes and lack of appropriate techniques. Furthermore, their real space\nmagnetic texture is often complex and temperature-dependent. We investigate the\nmagnetic Kagome metal DyMn$_6$Sn$_6$ using high-resolution micro-focused\ncircular-dichroic angle-resolved photoemission ($\\mu$-CD-ARPES) to probe its\nmagnetic and electronic properties. By tuning the kinetic energy to various\nfeatures of the Dy $4f$ multiplet, we resolve magnetic domains in samples\ncryo-cooled down to 20 K. Smaller, but clear signatures are detected in the Mn\n$3p$ levels. The behavior of both Dy $4f$ and Mn $3p$ features are in\nremarkable agreement with our modeling based on the Hartree-Fock method,\nrevealing ferrimagnetic alignment of Dy and Mn local moments, and further\nstrengthening our interpretation. Adjusting the energy to the Mn $3d$-dominated\nvalence bands reveals signatures which we relate to the orbital magnetization\nthrough a comparison to {\\it ab initio} electronic structure calculations.

Even though mutation\nscheduling is a key factor influencing fuzzing effectiveness, existing fuzzers\nhave primarily explored seed scheduling and generation, while mutation\nscheduling has been rarely addressed by prior work. In this work, we propose a\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)-based Multi-feedback Smart Contract Fuzzing\nframework (LLAMA) that integrates LLMs, evolutionary mutation strategies, and\nhybrid testing techniques. Key components of the proposed LLAMA include: (i) a\nhierarchical prompting strategy that guides LLMs to generate semantically valid\ninitial seeds, coupled with a lightweight pre-fuzzing phase to select\nhigh-potential inputs; (ii) a multi-feedback optimization mechanism that\nsimultaneously improves seed generation, seed selection, and mutation\nscheduling by leveraging runtime coverage and dependency feedback; and (iii) an\nevolutionary fuzzing engine that dynamically adjusts mutation operator\nprobabilities based on effectiveness, while incorporating symbolic execution to\nescape stagnation and uncover deeper vulnerabilities. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that LLAMA outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in both coverage\nand vulnerability detection. Specifically, it achieves 91% instruction coverage\nand 90% branch coverage, while detecting 132 out of 148 known vulnerabilities\nacross diverse categories.

This enables the derivation of a reward distribution,\na compact yet informative representation of the target agent's behavior within\nthe given scene context via IRL. Guided by this reward heuristic, we perform\npolicy rollouts to reason about multiple plausible intentions, providing\nvaluable priors for subsequent trajectory generation. Finally, we develop a\nhierarchical DETR-like decoder integrated with bidirectional selective state\nspace models to produce accurate future trajectories along with their\nassociated probabilities.

However, because these linguistic cues remain intact, they can be\nexploited to identify semantic speech patterns associated with specific\nspeakers. In this work, we present VoxATtack, a novel multimodal\nde-anonymization model that incorporates both acoustic and textual information\nto attack anonymization systems. While previous research has focused on\nrefining speaker representations extracted from speech, we show that\nincorporating textual information with a standard ECAPA-TDNN improves the\nattacker's performance. Our proposed VoxATtack model employs a dual-branch\narchitecture, with an ECAPA-TDNN processing anonymized speech and a pretrained\nBERT encoding the transcriptions. Both outputs are projected into embeddings of\nequal dimensionality and then fused based on confidence weights computed on a\nper-utterance basis. When evaluating our approach on the VoicePrivacy Attacker\nChallenge (VPAC) dataset, it outperforms the top-ranking attackers on five out\nof seven benchmarks, namely B3, B4, B5, T8-5, and T12-5. To further boost\nperformance, we leverage anonymized speech and SpecAugment as augmentation\ntechniques. This enhancement enables VoxATtack to achieve state-of-the-art on\nall VPAC benchmarks, after scoring 20.6% and 27.2% average equal error rate on\nT10-2 and T25-1, respectively.

    "abstract": "A simple parametrized family of quantum systems consisting of two entangled\nsubsystems, dubbed left and right ones, both of them featuring N qubits is\nconsidered in the thermofield double formalism. We assume that the system\nevolves in a purely geometric manner based on the parallel transport condition\ndue to Uhlmann. We explore the different interpretations of this evolution\nrelative to observers either coupled to the left or to the right subsystems.\nThe Uhlmann condition breaks the symmetry between left and right by regarding\none of the two possible sets of local unitary operations as gauge degrees of\nfreedom. Then gauging the right side we show that the geometric evolution on\nthe left manifests itself via certain local operations reminiscent of\nnon-unitary filtering measurements. On the other hand on the right the basic\nevolutionary steps are organized into a sequence of unitary operations of a\nholonomic quantum computation. We calculate the Uhlmann connection governing\nthe transport for our model which turns out to be related to higher dimensional\ninstantons. Then we evaluate the anholonomy of the connection for geodesic\ntriangles with geodesic segments defined with respect to the Bures metric. By\nanalysing the explicit form of the local filtering measurements showing up on\nthe left side we realize that they are also optimal measurements for\ndistinguishing two given mixed states in the statistical sense. We also point\nout that by conducting an interference experiment on the right side one can\nobserve the physical effects of the anholonomic quantum computation. We\ndemonstrate this by calculating explicit examples for phase shifts and\nvisibility patterns arising in such interference experiments. Finally a\nsequence of geodesic triangles producing the iSWAP gate via anholonomy needed\nfor computational universality is presented.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel methodology for determining representational\nstructure, which builds upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. This new\ntool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can emerge and\norganise in autoencoder models, through a controlled ablation study in which\nonly the activation function is altered. Using this technique, the validity of\nwhether function-driven symmetries can act as implicit inductive biases on\nrepresentations is determined. Representations are found to tend to discretise\nwhen the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic\npermutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a\ncontinuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. This confirms the\nhypothesis that the symmetries of network primitives can carry unintended\ninductive biases, which produce task-independent artefactual structures in\nrepresentations. The discrete symmetry of contemporary forms is shown to be a\nstrong predictor for the production of discrete representations emerging from\notherwise continuous distributions -- a quantisation effect. This motivates\nfurther reassessment of functional forms in common usage due to such unintended\nconsequences. Moreover, this supports a general causal model for one mode in\nwhich discrete representations may form, and could constitute a prerequisite\nfor downstream interpretability phenomena, including grandmother neurons,\ndiscrete coding schemes, general linear features and possibly Superposition.\nHence, this tool and proposed mechanism for the influence of functional form on\nrepresentations may provide insights into interpretability research. Finally,\npreliminary results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to\ncorrelate with a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing\nprevious conjectures that this collapse can be detrimental.",

To address its validity over a highly heterogeneous\nforest clearcut surface, we utilize an extensive Distributed Temperature\nSensing (DTS) and Eddy Covariance (EC) datasets. The DTS measured space-time\ncorrelation curves of temperature fluctuations are used to compute the bulk\nconvective speeds of temperature structures in buoyant conditions at a height\nof 3.1 m above the clearing. These convective speeds are compared with the mean\nwind speed and turbulent intensities of streamwise velocities obtained from the\nEC system at the middle of the clearcut.

    "abstract": "Sidewalk delivery robots are a promising solution for urban freight\ndistribution, reducing congestion compared to trucks and providing a safer,\nhigher-capacity alternative to drones. However, unreliable travel times on\nsidewalks due to pedestrian density, obstacles, and varying infrastructure\nconditions can significantly affect their efficiency. This study addresses the\nrobust route planning problem for sidewalk robots, explicitly accounting for\ntravel time uncertainty due to varying sidewalk conditions. Optimization is\nintegrated with simulation to reproduce the effect of obstacles and pedestrian\nflows and generate realistic travel times. The study investigates three\ndifferent approaches to derive uncertainty sets, including budgeted,\nellipsoidal, and support vector clustering (SVC)-based methods, along with a\ndistributionally robust method to solve the shortest path (SP) problem. A\nrealistic case study reproducing pedestrian patterns in Stockholm's city center\nis used to evaluate the efficiency of robust routing across various robot\ndesigns and environmental conditions. The results show that, when compared to a\nconventional SP, robust routing significantly enhances operational reliability\nunder variable sidewalk conditions. The Ellipsoidal and DRSP approaches\noutperform the other methods, yielding the most efficient paths in terms of\naverage and worst-case delay. Sensitivity analyses reveal that robust\napproaches consistently outperform the conventional SP, particularly for\nsidewalk delivery robots that are wider, slower, and have more conservative\nnavigation behaviors. These benefits are even more pronounced in adverse\nweather conditions and high pedestrian congestion scenarios.",

We also examine the existence of equivariant Borel right\ninverses for the distributional Laplacian, the heat operator, and the\n$\\bar{\\partial}$-operator on the space of smooth functions. We demonstrate that\nBorel equivariant inverses for these maps exist on the free part of the range\n(for the heat operator, this holds up to the removal of a null set with respect\nto any invariant probability measure). In general, the freeness assumptions\ncannot be omitted and Borelness cannot be strengthened to continuity. Our\npositive results follow from a theorem establishing sufficient conditions for\nthe existence of equivariant Borel liftings. Two key ingredients are Runge-type\napproximation theorems and the existence of Borel toasts, which are Borel\nanalogues of Rokhlin towers from ergodic theory.",

Both observations and modern theoretical models show that\nsuch stars have highly structured and variable atmospheres and winds. We\npresent first spectral synthesis based on 3D time-dependent unified RHD model\natmospheres with winds for O stars. We first carried out time-dependent, 3D\nsimulations of unified atmospheres with winds. We then used 3D radiative\ntransfer to compute surface brightness maps for the optical continuum as well\nas integrated flux profiles for select diagnostic lines. To derive occupation\nnumbers and source functions, an aNLTE method was used, as well as scattering\nsource functions. Our continuum intensity maps of a prototypical early O star\nreveal a highly variable and time-dependent surface, characterised by local\nemergent radiation temperature variations. Our averaged synthetic line profiles\nof optical absorption lines have large widths, without applying any macro- or\nmicroturbulence. From the simulations we find correspondingly large velocity\ndispersions in the photospheric layers. Additionally, the absorption line EWs\nare larger than for comparable 1D models. First results using scattering source\nfunctions further demonstrate that characteristic features like the softening\nof the blue edge of strong ultra-violet wind lines are qualitatively\nwell-reproduced by our models. Our 3D simulations clearly predict a highly\nstructured and strongly variable O star surface. First line profile results\nfurther suggest that several observed features are naturally reproduced by our\nmodels without the need to introduce ad-hoc spectral fitting parameters. We\nalso discuss how using 3D rather than 1D simulations as a basis for future\nstudies may affect the derivation of fundamental stellar parameters.",

Recognizing that these roles serve distinct functions within\nthe ecosystem, we introduce a three-party model that distinguishes among the\nprincipal (the requester), the intermediary (the platform), and the pool of\nagents (the workers). The principal, unable to directly engage with agents,\nrelies on the intermediary to recruit and incentivize them. This interaction\nunfolds in two stages: first, the principal designs a profit-sharing contract\nwith the intermediary; second, the intermediary implements a mechanism to\nselect an agent to complete the delegated task.\n  We analyze the proposed model as an extensive-form Stackelberg game. Our\ncontributions are fourfold: (1) We fully characterize the subgame perfect\nequilibrium. In particular, we reduce the principal's contract design problem\nto a novel auction-theoretic formulation we term virtual value pricing, and\nreveals that linear contracts are optimal even when the task have multiple\noutcomes and agents' cost distributions are asymmetric. (2) To quantify the\nprincipal's utility loss from delegation and information asymmetry, we\nintroduce the price of double marginalization (PoDM) and the classical price of\nanarchy (PoA), and derive tight or nearly tight bounds on both ratios under\nregular and monotone hazard rate (MHR) distributions.

A key privacy issue in FRS is protecting the user's\nface template, as the characteristics of the user's face image can be recovered\nfrom the template. Although recent advances in cryptographic tools such as\nhomomorphic encryption (HE) have provided opportunities for securing the FRS,\nHE cannot be used directly with FRS in an efficient plug-and-play manner. In\nparticular, although HE is functionally complete for arbitrary programs, it is\nbasically designed for algebraic operations on encrypted data of predetermined\nshape, such as a polynomial ring. Thus, a non-tailored combination of HE and\nthe system can yield very inefficient performance, and many previous HE-based\nface template protection methods are hundreds of times slower than plain\nsystems without protection. In this study, we propose IDFace, a new HE-based\nsecure and efficient face identification method with template protection.\nIDFace is designed on the basis of two novel techniques for efficient searching\non a (homomorphically encrypted) biometric database with an angular metric. The\nfirst technique is a template representation transformation that sharply\nreduces the unit cost for the matching test. The second is a space-efficient\nencoding that reduces wasted space from the encryption algorithm, thus saving\nthe number of operations on encrypted templates. Through experiments, we show\nthat IDFace can identify a face template from among a database of 1M encrypted\ntemplates in 126ms, showing only 2X overhead compared to the identification\nover plaintexts.",

To enhance performance,\ndistributed ANC methods have been introduced, enabling information exchange\namong ANC nodes; however, the resulting communication latency often compromises\nsystem stability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-boosted\nweight-constrained filtered-reference least mean square (SB-WCFxLMS) algorithm\nfor the distributed MCANC system without internode communication. The WCFxLMS\nalgorithm is specifically designed to mitigate divergence issues caused by the\ninternode cross-talk effect. The self-boosted strategy lets each ANC node\nindependently adapt its constraint parameters based on its local noise\nreduction performance, thus ensuring effective noise cancellation without the\nneed for inter-node communication. With the assistance of this mechanism, this\napproach significantly reduces both computational complexity and communication\noverhead. Numerical simulations employing real acoustic paths and compressor\nnoise validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed system. The\nresults demonstrate that our proposed method achieves satisfactory noise\ncancellation performance with minimal resource requirements.",

In\nprevious editions, the challenge used four-channel audio formats of first-order\nAmbisonics (FOA) and microphone array. In contrast, this year's challenge\ninvestigates SELD with stereo audio data (termed stereo SELD). This change\nshifts the focus from more specialized 360{\\deg} audio and audiovisual scene\nanalysis to more commonplace audio and media scenarios with limited\nfield-of-view (FOV). Due to inherent angular ambiguities in stereo audio data,\nthe task focuses on direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in the azimuth plane\n(left-right axis) along with distance estimation. The challenge remains divided\ninto two tracks: audio-only and audiovisual, with the audiovisual track\nintroducing a new sub-task of onscreen/offscreen event classification\nnecessitated by the limited FOV. This challenge introduces the DCASE2025 Task3\nStereo SELD Dataset, whose stereo audio and perspective video clips are sampled\nand converted from the STARSS23 recordings. The baseline system is designed to\nprocess stereo audio and corresponding video frames as inputs. In addition to\nthe typical SELD event classification and localization, it integrates\nonscreen/offscreen classification for the audiovisual track. The evaluation\nmetrics have been modified to introduce an onscreen/offscreen accuracy metric,\nwhich assesses the models' ability to identify which sound sources are\nonscreen. In the experimental evaluation, the baseline system performs\nreasonably well with the stereo audio data.",

While it is easy to accurately estimate a population's\ndistribution of feedback given feedback from a large number of individuals,\ncost constraints typically necessitate using smaller groups. A simple method to\napproximate the population distribution is regularized averaging: compute the\nempirical distribution and regularize it toward a prior. Can we do better? As\nwe will discuss, the answer to this question depends on feedback granularity.\n  Suppose one wants to predict a population's distribution of feedback using\nfeedback from a limited number of individuals. We show that, as feedback\ngranularity increases, one can substantially improve upon predictions of\nregularized averaging by combining individuals' feedback in ways more\nsophisticated than regularized averaging.\n  Our empirical analysis using questions on social attitudes confirms this\npattern. In particular, with binary feedback, sophistication barely reduces the\nnumber of individuals required to attain a fixed level of performance. By\ncontrast, with five-point feedback, sophisticated methods match the performance\nof regularized averaging with about half as many individuals.",

The distributed round\ncomplexity of locally optimal cut has been wide open; the problem is known to\nrequire $\\Omega(\\log n)$ rounds in the deterministic LOCAL model and\n$\\Omega(\\log \\log n)$ rounds in the randomized LOCAL model, but the only known\nupper bound is the trivial brute-force solution of $O(n)$ rounds.

Persistent\noverprovisioning and operational complexity often stem from heterogeneous\nplatforms and layered abstractions, while systems lacking explainability and\nmaintainability become fragile, impede safe recovery, and accumulate technical\ndebt. Existing solutions are frequently reactive, limited to single abstraction\nlayers, or require intrusive platform changes, leaving efficiency and\nmaintainability gains unrealized.\n  This paper addresses safe, transparent, and low-effort resource optimization\nin dynamic, multi-tenant edge-cloud systems, without disrupting operator\nworkflows or increasing technical debt. We introduce ARRC, a recommender system\nrooted in software engineering design principles, which delivers explainable,\ncross-layer resource recommendations directly into operator workflows (such as\ntickets and GitOps pull requests). ARRC encapsulates optimization logic in\nspecialized, auditable agents coordinated via a shared interface, supporting\nmaintainability and extensibility through transparency and the ability to\ninspect both recommendations and their rationale.\n  Empirical evaluation in a multi-region industrial deployment shows that ARRC\nreduces operator workload by over 50%, improves compute utilization by up to\n7.7x, and maintains error rates below 5%, with most benefits achieved through\nincremental, operator-approved changes. This demonstrates that explainable,\nrecommendation-based architectures can achieve sustainable efficiency and\nmaintainability improvements at production scale.\n  ARRC provides an empirically evaluated framework for integrating explainable,\nworkflow-driven automation into resource management, intended to advance best\npractices for robust, maintainable, and transparent edge-cloud continuum\nplatforms.",

    "abstract": "6G networks are composed of subnetworks expected to meet ultra-reliable\nlow-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for mission-critical\napplications such as industrial control and automation. An often-ignored aspect\nin URLLC is consecutive packet outages, which can destabilize control loops and\ncompromise safety in in-factory environments. Hence, the current work proposes\na link adaptation framework to support extreme reliability requirements using\nthe soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm\nthat jointly optimizes energy efficiency (EE) and reliability under dynamic\nchannel and interference conditions. Unlike prior work focusing on average\nreliability, our method explicitly targets reducing burst/consecutive outages\nthrough adaptive control of transmit power and blocklength based solely on the\nobserved signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The joint optimization\nproblem is formulated under finite blocklength and quality of service\nconstraints, balancing reliability and EE. Simulation results show that the\nproposed method significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms, reducing\noutage bursts while consuming only 18\\% of the transmission cost required by a\nfull/maximum resource allocation policy in the evaluated scenario. The\nframework also supports flexible trade-off tuning between EE and reliability by\nadjusting reward weights, making it adaptable to diverse industrial\nrequirements.",

Instead of a\nhierarchical scheme using layers, like in classical networks and present\nquantum network stack models, we propose a resource-centric task-based scheme.\nIn this scheme, quantum applications pose objectives, initiated by a node, to a\nquantum network, such as sharing an entangled state or sending a qubit along a\npath. The quantum network node initiating the objective consequently derives a\ndistributed workflow, referred to as saga, comprising numerous tasks operating\non resources, which completes the objective. We identify three different kinds\nof resources with their own and independent topology, namely classical\nmessaging, quantum channels and entanglement. Sagas can either be centrally\norchestrated or performed in choreography by the network nodes. The tasks of a\nsaga originate from and operate on resources of the network, such as quantum\nchannels or entanglement, and they not only comprise operations and\nmeasurements, but potentially also include other tasks or even entire\nprotocols, such as sending a qubit, distributing entanglement or performing\nentanglement purification steps.",

While recent advances have made significant progress in this area,\nexisting NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on\nsingle-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view\ndata, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their\nreliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in\nunstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors\nsuch as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided\nMulti-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to\nexplore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view\nlevel, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel\nclasses, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into\nview-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices\ncapture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor\nmatrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level,\nwe utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of\nnovel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted\nfusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known\nclasses based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel\nclass learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed\napproach.",

Existing methods regard the RGB\ndomain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such\nas daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the\ndomain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple\nsubdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper\nproposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In\nterms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID)\nmodule in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content\ninformation being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can\ndecouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter\nbank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven\ndecoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In\nterms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which\nrealizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids.\nMeanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the\nbaseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR\ndatasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on\nthe FLIR-ADAS dataset.",

This paper introduces a\nnovel QAS framework employing hybrid quantum reinforcement learning with\nquantum curriculum learning strategies, enabling learning agents to tackle\nincreasingly complex quantum circuit design tasks. We benchmark four\nstate-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning algorithms (A2C, PPO, DDQN,\nTD3) against their quantum-enhanced counterparts (QA2C, QPPO, QDDQN, QTD3) for\noptimizing variational quantum circuits (VQCs). Our approach progressively\nincreases circuit depth and gate complexity during training, leveraging\nparameterized quantum circuits as function approximations. To improve learning\nefficiency and stability, all algorithms, both classical and quantum, are\naugmented with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). Experimental results show\nthat quantum-enhanced RL significantly outperforms classical methods. In a\n2-qubit environment, PERQDDQN achieves a success probability of 0.46 with\n~3,000 optimal successes, surpassing classical PERDDQN (0.42, ~2,400). In the\nmore complex 3-qubit setting, PERQDDQN and PERQTD3 reach success probabilities\nof ~0.47, with optimal success counts of ~3,800 and ~3,600, respectively,\noutperforming their classical counterparts. Additionally, we apply our QAS-QTN\napproach to a classification problem, where the optimized quantum circuit\nachieves an accuracy of 90.33\\%, outperforming quantum models consisting of\nrandom ansatz.

The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert\nannotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common\nmethod is data augmentation.

Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection\nbaselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings.

However, the attention\nmechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the\nstacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency\nvanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose\na novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention\nModulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly\nmodulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two\ntechniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling\n(FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental\nelements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass\nfiltering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and\ndynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different\nfrequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response\nfunction. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we\ndemonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to\nconsistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer,\nDeiT, and MaskDINO.

We define two new integral graph invariants,\n$c^*(H)$ and $d^*(H)$, with $d^*(H) \\leq c^*(H) \\leq d^*(H)+1$, and show that\nfor every graph $H$, List $H$-Coloring\n  -- has a kernel with $\\mathcal{O}(k^{c^*(H)})$ vertices,\n  -- admits no kernel of size $\\mathcal{O}(k^{d^*(H)-\\varepsilon})$ for any\n$\\varepsilon > 0$, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.\n  -- Furthermore, if $c^*(H) > d^*(H)$, then there is a kernel with\n$\\mathcal{O}(k^{c^*(H)-\\varepsilon})$ vertices where $\\varepsilon \\geq\n2^{1-c^*(H)}$.\n  Additionally, we show that for some classes of graphs, including powers of\ncycles and graphs $H$ where $\\Delta(H) \\leq c^*(H)$ (which in particular\nincludes cliques), the bound $d^*(H)$ is tight, using the polynomial method. We\nconjecture that this holds in general.",

    "abstract": "This thesis addresses challenges related to data and parameter efficiency in\nneural language models, with a focus on representation analysis and the\nintroduction of new optimization techniques. The first part examines the\nproperties and dynamics of language representations within neural models,\nemphasizing their significance in enhancing robustness and generalization. It\nproposes innovative approaches based on representation smoothness, including\nregularization strategies that utilize Jacobian and Hessian matrices to\nstabilize training and mitigate sensitivity to input perturbations. The second\npart focuses on methods to significantly enhance data and parameter efficiency\nby integrating active learning strategies with parameter-efficient fine-tuning,\nguided by insights from representation smoothness analysis. It presents\nsmoothness-informed early-stopping techniques designed to eliminate the need\nfor labeled validation sets and proposes innovative combinations of active\nlearning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning to reduce labeling efforts and\ncomputational resources. Extensive experimental evaluations across various NLP\ntasks demonstrate that these combined approaches substantially outperform\ntraditional methods in terms of performance, stability, and efficiency. The\nthird part explores weak supervision techniques enhanced by in-context learning\nto effectively utilize unlabeled data, further reducing dependence on extensive\nlabeling. It shows that using in-context learning as a mechanism for weak\nsupervision enables models to better generalize from limited labeled data by\nleveraging unlabeled examples more effectively during training. Comprehensive\nempirical evaluations confirm significant gains in model accuracy,\nadaptability, and robustness, especially in low-resource settings and dynamic\ndata environments.",

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful\ncapabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant\nchallenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with\ngraph structures.

In\nMLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to\nenhance graph fraud detection methods.

For a plane wave incident onto a flat dielectric slab,\nreflection becomes strongly dependent on the incident angle as the electrical\nthickness becomes large. This behavior limits the applicability of conventional\nsingle- and multilayer anti-reflective coatings. Recently, inspired by the\ngeneralized Huygens' condition, synthesized admittance sheets implemented as\nmetasurfaces with local response have been shown to remove reflection from a\ndielectric slab in a wide range of incident angles, applicable, however, only\nin the case of small optical slab thickness. In this work, we study plane wave\ntransmission through dielectric slabs with arbitrary thickness coated from both\nsides by identical metasurfaces with nonlocal response, whose grid impedance is\nangularly dependent (spatially dispersive). Nonlocality is shown to play a key\nrole in obtaining wide-angle reflection suppression in the case of optically\nthick slabs. To validate our approach, we study a metasurface realization\ncomposed of Interconnected Split-Ring Resonators that approximates the\npredicted spatial dispersion law. As demonstrated numerically and\nexperimentally, such properly devised nonlocal metasurface coatings indeed\nprovide transmittance enhancement (and reflectance suppression) of thick\ndielectric slabs across a broad range of angles, paving the path to optically\nthin and easy-to-fabricate anti-reflective coatings efficiently operating in a\nwide angular range even for optically thick dielectric slabs.",

Although unsupervised\npart discovery can eliminate the reliance on labels, most of them cannot\nmaintain robustness across various categories and scenarios, which restricts\ntheir application range. To overcome this limitation, we present a more\neffective paradigm for unsupervised part discovery, named Masked Part\nAutoencoder (MPAE).

Then, the masked regions are filled with the learned part\ndescriptors based on the similarity between the local features and descriptors.\nBy restoring these masked patches using the part descriptors, they become\nbetter aligned with their part shapes, guided by appearance features from\nunmasked patches. Finally, MPAE robustly discovers meaningful parts that\nclosely match the actual object shapes, even in complex scenarios. Moreover,\nseveral looser yet more effective constraints are proposed to enable MPAE to\nidentify the presence of parts across various scenarios and categories in an\nunsupervised manner. This provides the foundation for addressing challenges\nposed by occlusion and for exploring part similarity across multiple\ncategories.

Log spaces in the sense of Fontaine and Illusie were first described in\nprint by Kato, in a 1988 paper. Rounding of complex log spaces was introduced\nin a 1999 paper by Kato and Nakayama and is a functorial generalization of\nA'Campo's 1975 notion of a real oriented blowup. It allows to cut canonically\nany complex toroidal variety $X$ along its toroidal boundary $\\partial X$,\nproducing a topological manifold-with-boundary, whose boundary is a canonical\nrepresentative of the boundary of any tubular neighborhood of $\\partial X$ in\n$X$. In singularity theory, roundings may be used to get canonical\nrepresentatives of links of isolated complex analytic singularities and of\nMilnor fibers of smoothings of complex singularities, once toroidal resolutions\nof the singularity or of the smoothing are chosen. The text starts with\nintroductions to not necessarily normal toric varieties, it passes then to\ntoroidal varieties and to their real oriented blowups. It continues with\nintroductions to log spaces and to rounding of complex log spaces. It concludes\nwith an important theorem of Nakayama and Ogus about the local triviality of\nthe rounding of special types of log morphisms. The notions of affine toric\nvariety, real oriented blowup, log structure and rounding are introduced by\nmeans of the classical passage to polar coordinates.",

Such an evaluation hence\nrequires a deeper understanding of conformance checking as an analysis domain.\nTo this end, we propose a task taxonomy, which categorizes the tasks that can\noccur when conducting conformance checking analyses. This taxonomy supports\nresearchers in determining the purpose of visualizations, specifying relevant\nconformance checking tasks in terms of their goal, means, constraint type, data\ncharacteristics, data target, and data cardinality. Combining concepts from\nprocess mining and visual analytics, we address researchers from both\ndisciplines to enable and support closer collaborations.",

    "abstract": "Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms\nhas been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used\nbut the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased\ncomputational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have\nsuccessfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their\napplication to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate\nsimultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to\nRL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our\nnetworks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the\nRL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions\nfor 0/1 Random Variables $\\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The\nstochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote\nconvergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little\nto the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered\npermanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware,\nsparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture\nof OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of\nthe parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with\nthe regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are\nautomatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network\ncompression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo)\nand the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned\nconsiderably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm\nthat pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher\nperforming RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.",

Yet, many biological control mechanisms\nare `simple' -- they restore homeostasis through low-dimensional\nrepresentations of the system's high-dimensional state. How do low-dimensional\ncontrollers maintain homeostasis in high-dimensional systems? We develop an\nanalytically tractable model of integral feedback for complex systems in\nfluctuating environments. We find that selection for homeostasis leads to the\nemergence of a soft mode that provides the dimensionality reduction required\nfor the functioning of simple controllers. Our theory predicts that simple\ncontrollers that buffer environmental perturbations (e.g., stress response\npathways) will also buffer mutational perturbation, an equivalence we test\nusing experimental data across ~5000 strains in the yeast knockout collection.\nWe also predict, counterintuitively, that knocking out a simple controller will\n\\emph{decrease} the dimensionality of the response to environmental change; we\noutline transcriptomics tests to validate this. Our work suggests an\nevolutionary origin of soft modes whose function is for dimensionality\nreduction in and of itself rather than direct function like allostery, with\nimplications ranging from cryptic genetic variation to global epistasis.",

To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel 3D Hierarchical\nProxy Node representation.

Each\nnode stores local shape and texture information (implicitly encoded by a small\nMLP) within its neighborhood. Querying any 3D coordinate's properties involves\nefficient neural interpolation and lightweight decoding from relevant nearby\nand parent nodes. This framework yields a highly compact representation where\nnodes align with local semantics, enabling direct drag-and-edit manipulation,\nand offers scalable quality-complexity control.

In this paper, we present Global-Spatial Bias Learner (GS-Bias),\nan efficient and effective TTA paradigm that incorporates two learnable biases\nduring TTA, unfolded as the global bias and spatial bias. Particularly, the\nglobal bias captures the global semantic features of a test image by learning\nconsistency across augmented views, while spatial bias learns the semantic\ncoherence between regions in the image's spatial visual representation. It is\nworth highlighting that these two sets of biases are directly added to the\nlogits outputed by the pretrained VLMs, which circumvent the full\nbackpropagation through VLM that hinders the efficiency of existing TTA\nmethods. This endows GS-Bias with extremely high efficiency while achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance on 15 benchmark datasets.

Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently\ndequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on\nGPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit\nmanipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization\nframework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in\nextremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference\nthrough more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the\nquantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)\ninitialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)\nrefine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT\npost-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer\nquantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our\nPoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating\npoint inference and leads to $3.67\\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and\n$1.63\\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.",

    "abstract": "Microbiomes, which are collections of interacting microbes in an environment,\noften substantially impact the environmental patches or living hosts that they\noccupy. In microbiome models, it is important to consider both the local\ndynamics within an environment and exchanges of microbiomes between\nenvironments. One way to incorporate these and other interactions across\nmultiple scales is to employ metacommunity theory. Metacommunity models\ncommonly assume continuous microbiome dispersal between the environments in\nwhich local microbiome dynamics occur. Under this assumption, a single\nparameter between each pair of environments controls the dispersal rate between\nthose environments. This metacommunity framework is well-suited to abiotic\nenvironmental patches, but it fails to capture an essential aspect of the\nmicrobiomes of living hosts, which generally do not interact continuously with\neach other. Instead, living hosts interact with each other in discrete time\nintervals. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that encodes such\ndiscrete interactions and uses two parameters to separately control the\ninteraction frequencies between hosts and the amount of microbiome exchange\nduring each interaction. We derive analytical approximations of models in our\nframework in three parameter regimes and prove that they are accurate in those\nregimes. We compare these approximations to numerical simulations for an\nillustrative model. We demonstrate that both parameters in our modeling\nframework are necessary to determine microbiome dynamics. Key features of the\ndynamics, such as microbiome convergence across hosts, depend sensitively on\nthe interplay between interaction frequency and strength.",

Class-wise prototypes, representing class centroids, serve as\ndomain-invariant cues that benefit generalization due to their stability and\nsemantic consistency. However, this approach faces three challenges. First,\nexisting methods often adopt coarse prototypical alignment strategies, which\nmay hinder performance. Second, naive prototypes computed by averaging source\nbatch features are prone to overfitting and may be negatively affected by\nunrelated source data. Third, most methods treat all source samples equally,\nignoring the fact that different features have varying adaptation difficulties.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for generalizable\nsemantic segmentation: Prototypical Progressive Alignment and Reweighting\n(PPAR), leveraging the strong generalization ability of the CLIP model.\nSpecifically, we define two prototypes: the Original Text Prototype (OTP) and\nVisual Text Prototype (VTP), generated via CLIP to serve as a solid base for\nalignment. We then introduce a progressive alignment strategy that aligns\nfeatures in an easy-to-difficult manner, reducing domain gaps gradually.\nFurthermore, we propose a prototypical reweighting mechanism that estimates the\nreliability of source data and adjusts its contribution, mitigating the effect\nof irrelevant or harmful features (i.e., reducing negative transfer).

To address these limitations, this paper\nproposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL\nenhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and\ngenerates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing\naction verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on\nbenchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that\nRaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in\npositional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships\nbetween instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating\nimages that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each\ninstance within the multi-instance image.",

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels.

We then propose the ORAN-based\nNTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These\ninclude the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent\ncontrollers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment\narchitecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research\ndirections, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other\nenabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are\nhighlighted.",

The competition between ASL states and edge\nnon-Hermitian skin states are further identified by their complex and real\neigenenergies, respectively.

Yet mental visualization is a critical cognitive skill\nin humans, supporting abilities such as spatial navigation, predicting physical\ntrajectories, and solving complex visual problems through imaginative\nsimulation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hyperphantasia, a synthetic\nbenchmark designed to evaluate the mental visualization abilities of MLLMs\nthrough four carefully constructed puzzles.

Furthermore, the\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge (SB) has recently been used in diffusion-based SE to\nimprove speech quality by resolving a mismatch between the endpoint of the\nforward process and the starting point of the reverse process. However, the SB\nstill exhibits slow inference owing to the necessity of a large number of\nfunction evaluations (NFE) for inference to obtain high-quality results. While\nConsistency Models (CMs) address this issue by employing consistency training\nthat uses distillation from pretrained models in the field of image generation,\nit does not improve generation quality when the number of steps increases. As a\nsolution to this problem, Consistency Trajectory Models (CTMs) not only\naccelerate inference speed but also maintain a favorable trade-off between\nquality and speed. Furthermore, SoundCTM demonstrates the applicability of CTM\ntechniques to the field of sound generation. In this paper, we present\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge Consistency Trajectory Models (SBCTM) by applying the\nCTM's technique to the Schr\\\"odinger bridge for SE. Additionally, we introduce\na novel auxiliary loss, including a perceptual loss, into the original CTM's\ntraining framework. As a result, SBCTM achieves an approximately 16x\nimprovement in the real-time factor (RTF) compared to the conventional\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge for SE. Furthermore, the favorable trade-off between\nquality and speed in SBCTM allows for time-efficient inference by limiting\nmulti-step refinement to cases where 1-step inference is insufficient.

We rigorously compare its performance, in terms of mean-squared\nerror (MSE) and cost of power per sensor, against more conventional\nNon-Feedback (NF) architectures by evaluating conditions of feasibility and\nadvantage under different architecture specifications (e.g., communication\ndelay rate, power cost rate, maximum back-off time, sampling period,\nobservation noise). Here, we defined the advantage as the performance gain\nachieved by FB over NF, while FB is said to be feasible if the advantage region\nis nonempty. Our theoretical analyses show that the feasibility of FB depends\nmore on the communication power cost, while the advantage depends on the\nsensors' propagation delay per transmission interval; we derive concrete\nconditions under which these outcomes hold.

We further\npropose a relation that connects the extensional viscosity to micellar\nstructures and kinetics. This relation provides a unified description of the\nextensional viscosity of unentangled wormlike micellar solutions for various\ntemperatures, concentrations, and extension rates.",

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating the proportion of true signals among a large number of\nvariables is crucial for enhancing the precision and reliability of scientific\nresearch. Traditional signal proportion estimators often assume independence\namong variables and specific signal sparsity conditions, limiting their\napplicability in real-world scenarios where such assumptions may not hold. This\npaper introduces a novel signal proportion estimator that leverages arbitrary\ncovariance dependence information among variables, thereby improving\nperformance across a wide range of sparsity levels and dependence structures.\nBuilding on previous work that provides lower confidence bounds for signal\nproportions, we extend this approach by incorporating the principal factor\napproximation procedure to account for variable dependence. Our theoretical\ninsights offer a deeper understanding of how signal sparsity, signal intensity,\nand covariance dependence interact. By comparing the conditions for estimation\nconsistency before and after dependence adjustment, we highlight the advantages\nof integrating dependence information across different contexts. This\ntheoretical foundation not only validates the effectiveness of the new\nestimator but also guides its practical application, ensuring reliable use in\ndiverse scenarios. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art estimators in both estimation accuracy and\nthe detection of weaker signals that might otherwise go undetected.",

    "abstract": "The decomposition of complex, multicomponent, and non-stationary signals into\ntheir constituent modes is a fundamental yet significant challenge in science\nand engineering. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off among\naccuracy, computational cost, and the need for prior information such as the\nnumber of modes. This paper introduces time-frequency mode decomposition\n(TFMD), a novel framework for the fast, robust, and adaptive decomposition of\nsuch signals. TFMD operates on the principle that modes form contiguous\nhigh-energy regions in the time-frequency domain. Its non-iterative pipeline\nreframes signal decomposition as an image segmentation task: a signal is\ntransformed into a spectrogram, which is then smoothed to enhance the\ncontinuity of these high-energy regions. A sequence of adaptive thresholding\nand connected-component labeling with size-based filtering is then employed to\nautomatically segment the spectrogram and generate a mask for each mode. The\nmodes are finally reconstructed via the inverse short-time Fourier transform.\nValidation on diverse synthetic signals demonstrates that TFMD accurately\ndetermines the number of modes and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Its\nperformance is particularly strong in high-noise conditions. A comparative\nanalysis confirms that TFMD provides robust, competitive performance across a\nwider variety of signal types, while a theoretical complexity analysis reveals\nits superior computational efficiency stemming from its non-iterative design.\nThe method's practical utility is further demonstrated by successfully\nextracting modal responses from a real-world footbridge vibration signal.

    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding models for brain-computer interfaces\n(BCIs) struggle with cross-dataset learning and generalization due to channel\nlayout inconsistencies, non-stationary signal distributions, and limited\nneurophysiological prior integration. To address these issues, we propose a\nplug-and-play Alignment-Based Frame-Patch Modeling (AFPM) framework, which has\ntwo main components: 1) Spatial Alignment, which selects task-relevant channels\nbased on brain-region priors, aligns EEG distributions across domains, and\nremaps the selected channels to a unified layout; and, 2) Frame-Patch Encoding,\nwhich models multi-dataset signals into unified spatiotemporal patches for EEG\ndecoding. Compared to 17 state-of-the-art approaches that need dataset-specific\ntuning, the proposed calibration-free AFPM achieves performance gains of up to\n4.40% on motor imagery and 3.58% on event-related potential tasks. To our\nknowledge, this is the first calibration-free cross-dataset EEG decoding\nframework, substantially enhancing the practicalness of BCIs in real-world\napplications.",

Moreover, the lack of standardization\nmeans these controls can vary widely across services. The technical or\nconfusing terminology used to describe these controls further complicates\nusers' ability to understand and use them effectively. This paper presents a\nlarge-scale empirical analysis investigating usability challenges of web\nprivacy controls across 18,628 websites. While aiming for a multi-scenario\nview, our automated data collection faced significant hurdles, particularly in\nsimulating sign-up and authenticated user visits, leading to more focused\ninsights on guest visit scenarios and challenges in automated capture of\ndynamic user interactions. Our heuristic evaluation of three different user\nvisit scenarios identifies significant website usability issues. Our results\nshow that privacy policies are most common across all visit scenarios, with\nnudges and notices being prevalent in sign-up situations. We recommend\ndesigning privacy controls that: enhance awareness through pop-up nudges and\nnotices; offer a table of contents as navigational aids and customized settings\nlinks in policies for more informed choice; and ensure accessibility via direct\nlinks to privacy settings from nudges.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world tasks such as recommending videos with the kids tag can be\nreduced to finding most similar vectors associated with hard predicates. This\ntask, filtered vector search, is challenging as prior state-of-the-art\ngraph-based (unfiltered) similarity search techniques quickly degenerate when\nhard constraints are considered. That is, effective graph-based filtered\nsimilarity search relies on sufficient connectivity for reaching the most\nsimilar items within just a few hops. To consider predicates, recent works\npropose modifying graph traversal to visit only the items that may satisfy\npredicates. However, they fail to offer the just-a-few-hops property for a wide\nrange of predicates: they must restrict predicates significantly or lose\nefficiency if only a small fraction of items satisfy predicates.\n  We propose an opposite approach: instead of constraining traversal, we build\nmany indexes each serving different predicate forms. For effective\nconstruction, we devise a three-dimensional analytical model capturing\nrelationships among index size, search time, and recall, with which we follow a\nworkload-aware approach to pack as many useful indexes as possible into a\ncollection. At query time, the analytical model is employed yet again to\ndiscern the one that offers the fastest search at a given recall. We show\nsuperior performance and support on datasets with varying selectivities and\nforms: our approach achieves up to 8.06x speedup while having as low as 1%\nbuild time versus other indexes, with less than 2.15x memory of a standard HNSW\ngraph and modest knowledge of past workloads.",

The outstanding question\nis why the reconnection rate is $\\mathcal{O}(0.01 - 0.1)$ in many astrophysical\nphenomena, for example solar flares and terrestrial substorms. Previous studies\nhave shown two ideas of Hall reconnection and plasmoid instability. However,\nthere is no consensus on which process is the reason for the fast reconnection.\nIn this paper, we discuss the formation of secondary plasmoids in \\rewrite{2D\nantiparallel collisionless reconnection} using 2.5-dimensional particle-in-cell\nsimulations and discuss whether plasmoid-mediated reconnection occur in\ncollisionless systems by comparing with plasmoid instability in resistive MHD\nsimulations. We find that in collisionless systems secondary plasmoids can\nindeed form. However, the mass ratio has a strong effect on the formation of\nsecondary plasmoids, and it indicates that secondary plasmoids do not emerge\nusing realistic ion-electron mass ratio ($m_i/m_e = 1836$). Furthermore, we\nfind that there is no enhancement of the reconnection rate due to the secondary\nplasmoid in the collisionless system, as discussed in the plasmoid-mediated\nreconnection.

Therefore, evaluating the visual quality of compressed videos is\ncrucial for guiding the practical usage and further development of video\ncompression algorithms. Although numerous compressed video quality assessment\n(VQA) methods have been proposed, they often lack the generalization capability\nneeded to handle the increasing diversity of video types, particularly high\ndynamic range (HDR) content. In this paper, we introduce CompressedVQA-HDR, an\neffective VQA framework designed to address the challenges of HDR video quality\nassessment. Specifically, we adopt the Swin Transformer and SigLip 2 as the\nbackbone networks for the proposed full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nVQA models, respectively. For the FR model, we compute deep structural and\ntextural similarities between reference and distorted frames using\nintermediate-layer features extracted from the Swin Transformer as its\nquality-aware feature representation. For the NR model, we extract the global\nmean of the final-layer feature maps from SigLip 2 as its quality-aware\nrepresentation. To mitigate the issue of limited HDR training data, we\npre-train the FR model on a large-scale standard dynamic range (SDR) VQA\ndataset and fine-tune it on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. For the NR model, we employ\nan iterative mixed-dataset training strategy across multiple compressed VQA\ndatasets, followed by fine-tuning on the HDRSDR-VQA dataset. Experimental\nresults show that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to\nexisting FR and NR VQA models.

As workloads in cloud environments become increasingly\ndynamic and unpredictable, load balancing strategies are evolving from\ntraditional static methods to more adaptive and intelligent approaches. In this\nstudy, the Cloud Analyst simulation tool was used to evaluate the performance\nof different load balancing algorithms under various scenarios, including both\ncentralized and distributed resource setups. The results highlight that while\nthe Round Robin algorithm yields slightly better processing times within a\nsingle data center, Equally Spread and Throttled techniques perform\ncompetitively, especially when network latency is considered. More importantly,\nwhen resources are distributed across multiple data centers, response times are\nsignificantly reduced, emphasizing the value of proximity and efficient load\ndistribution. In these distributed environments, Equally Spread and Throttled\nalgorithms not only maintain quick response times but also contribute to lower\noperational costs. These findings demonstrate the necessity of strategic\nresource placement and proactive infrastructure planning to balance performance\nand cost.

The dataset was enriched with sociodemographic data\nfrom the national census (population density, average residents per household),\nthe proportion of slum areas per neighborhood, a dummy variable for high-income\nneighborhoods (above 7.5 minimum wages), seasonal information (rainy/dry), and\nwater indicators derived from NDWI and MNDWI indexes. We first tested for\nspatial dependence in dengue cases per square kilometer using Moran's I, which\nconfirmed significant spatial autocorrelation, justifying spatial econometric\nmodels. We then applied the SAR (Spatial Autoregressive) model with the listed\nvariables and tested four spatial weight structures (Queen, Rook, KNN, Distance\nBand). The best-performing model was SAR with Rook contiguity, yielding a\npseudo-R-squared of 0.6864 and a spatial pseudo-R-squared of 0.6934. Five\nvariables showed p-values below 0.05. Moran's I applied to the residuals showed\nno significant spatial autocorrelation, suggesting the model effectively\ncaptured spatial structure. The SAC model (also with Rook) was tested but SAR\nremained slightly superior. In addition to generating a thematic risk map, the\nSAR model ranked neighborhoods by predicted vulnerability. The Spearman\ncorrelation between predicted and observed rankings was 0.901. These findings\nsupport SAR as a robust tool for understanding urban dengue patterns and for\ninforming graph-based SIR models.",

This study uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to examine the 2025\nswarm's statistical properties and compare them with historical patterns. The\n2025 swarm's frequency and magnitude distributions closely resemble those of\n2021 swarms, which coincided with volcanic activity at Suwanose Island, 10 km\nfrom the epicentral region, suggesting a magma-seismicity link. Statistical\nanalysis shows a low magnitude scale ({\\sigma} = 0.37) and moderate mean\nmagnitude ({\\mu} = 2.8), consistent with magma-driven seismicity, unlike the\nhigher {\\sigma} (1.2) and {\\mu} (3.6) before the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The\nexponential distribution of earthquake intervals ({\\lambda} = 1/0.19 hours)\nfurther supports magma-induced activity.

Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency\nModulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency\nbefore downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling.\nSpecifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and\ndesign a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to\nscale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the\nFrequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling\n(MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency\ninformation through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves\nsegmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely\nand sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly\nintegrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural\nnetworks to transformers.

    "abstract": "The classical k-means clustering, based on distances computed from all data\nfeatures, cannot be directly applied to incomplete data with missing values. A\nnatural extension of k-means to missing data, namely k-POD, uses only the\nobserved entries for clustering and is both computationally efficient and\nflexible. However, for high-dimensional missing data including features\nirrelevant to the underlying cluster structure, the presence of such irrelevant\nfeatures leads to the bias of k-POD in estimating cluster centers, thereby\ndamaging its clustering effect. Nevertheless, the existing k-POD method\nperforms well in low-dimensional cases, highlighting the importance of\naddressing the bias issue. To this end, in this paper, we propose a regularized\nk-POD clustering method that applies feature-wise regularization on cluster\ncenters into the existing k-POD clustering. Such a penalty on cluster centers\nenables us to effectively reduce the bias of k-POD for high-dimensional missing\ndata. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to mitigate bias in\nk-means-type clustering for high-dimensional missing data, while retaining the\ncomputational efficiency and flexibility. Simulation results verify that the\nproposed method effectively reduces bias and improves clustering performance.\nApplications to real-world single-cell RNA sequencing data further show the\nutility of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we examine a sequential setting of a cooperative game in which\nplayers arrive dynamically to form coalitions and complete tasks either\ntogether or individually, depending on the value created. Upon arrival, a new\nplayer as a decision maker faces two options: forming a new coalition or\njoining an existing one. We assume that players are greedy, i.e., they aim to\nmaximize their rewards based on the information available at their arrival. The\nobjective is to design an online value distribution policy that incentivizes\nplayers to form a coalition structure that maximizes social welfare. We focus\non monotone and bounded cooperative games. Our main result establishes an upper\nbound of $\\frac{3\\mathsf{min}}{\\mathsf{max}}$ on the competitive ratio for any\nirrevocable policy (i.e., one without redistribution), and proposes a policy\nthat achieves a near-optimal competitive ratio of $\\min\\left\\{\\frac{1}{2},\n\\frac{3\\mathsf{min}}{\\mathsf{max}}\\right\\}$, where $\\mathsf{min}$ and\n$\\mathsf{max}$ denote the smallest and largest marginal contribution of any\nsub-coalition of players respectively.

However, their motion\nplanning is severely constrained by tether length limitations and entanglement\nrisks, posing significant challenges to achieving optimal path planning. To\naddress these challenges, this study introduces CDT-TCS (Convex Dissection\nTopology-based Tethered Configuration Search), a novel algorithm that leverages\nCDT Encoding as a homotopy invariant to represent topological states of paths.\nBy integrating algebraic topology with geometric optimization, CDT-TCS\nefficiently computes the complete set of optimal feasible configurations for\ntethered robots at all positions in 2D environments through a single\ncomputation. Building on this foundation, we further propose three\napplication-specific algorithms: i) CDT-TPP for optimal tethered path planning,\nii) CDT-TMV for multi-goal visiting with tether constraints, iii) CDT-UTPP for\ndistance-optimal path planning of untethered robots. All theoretical results\nand propositions underlying these algorithms are rigorously proven and\nthoroughly discussed in this paper.

    "abstract": "LLMs are trained to refuse harmful instructions, but do they truly understand\nharmfulness beyond just refusing? Prior work has shown that LLMs' refusal\nbehaviors can be mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, i.e., a refusal\ndirection. In this work, we identify a new dimension to analyze safety\nmechanisms in LLMs, i.e., harmfulness, which is encoded internally as a\nseparate concept from refusal. There exists a harmfulness direction that is\ndistinct from the refusal direction. As causal evidence, steering along the\nharmfulness direction can lead LLMs to interpret harmless instructions as\nharmful, but steering along the refusal direction tends to elicit refusal\nresponses directly without reversing the model's judgment on harmfulness.\nFurthermore, using our identified harmfulness concept, we find that certain\njailbreak methods work by reducing the refusal signals without reversing the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. We also find that adversarially\nfinetuning models to accept harmful instructions has minimal impact on the\nmodel's internal belief of harmfulness. These insights lead to a practical\nsafety application: The model's latent harmfulness representation can serve as\nan intrinsic safeguard (Latent Guard) for detecting unsafe inputs and reducing\nover-refusals that is robust to finetuning attacks. For instance, our Latent\nGuard achieves performance comparable to or better than Llama Guard 3 8B, a\ndedicated finetuned safeguard model, across different jailbreak methods. Our\nfindings suggest that LLMs' internal understanding of harmfulness is more\nrobust than their refusal decision to diverse input instructions, offering a\nnew perspective to study AI safety",

While current methods have made progress in modeling spatiotemporal\npatterns, they face three key limitations: (1) lack of generalizable framework\napplicable to diverse disease progression prediction tasks; (2) frequent\noverlook of the ordinal nature inherent in disease staging; (3) susceptibility\nto representation collapse due to structural similarities between adjacent time\npoints, which can obscure subtle but discriminative progression biomarkers. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a Generalizable LOngitudinal Medical\nImage Analysis framework for disease Progression prediction (GLOMIA-Pro).\nGLOMIA-Pro consists of two core components: progression representation\nextraction and progression-aware fusion. The progression representation\nextraction module introduces a piecewise orthogonal attention mechanism and\nemploys a novel ordinal progression constraint to disentangle finegrained\ntemporal imaging variations relevant to disease progression. The\nprogression-aware fusion module incorporates a redesigned skip connection\narchitecture which integrates the learned progression representation with\ncurrent imaging representation, effectively mitigating representation collapse\nduring cross-temporal fusion. Validated on two distinct clinical applications:\nknee osteoarthritis severity prediction and esophageal cancer treatment\nresponse assessment, GLOMIA-Pro consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art\nlongitudinal analysis methods. Ablation studies further confirm the\ncontribution of individual components, demonstrating the robustness and\ngeneralizability of GLOMIA-Pro across diverse clinical scenarios.",

Freshly formed coolant molecules (e.g., CO) and warm\ndust can be found in CCSNe as early as ~100 d after the explosion, allowing the\nstudy of their evolution with time series observations. In the Type II SN\n2023ixf, we aim to investigate the temporal evolution of the temperature,\nvelocity, and mass of CO and compare them with other CCSNe, exploring their\nimplications for the dust formation in CCSNe. From observations of velocity\nprofiles of lines of other species (e.g., H and He), we also aim to\ncharacterize and understand the interaction of the SN ejecta with preexisting\ncircumstellar material (CSM). We present a time series of 16 near-infrared\nspectra of SN 2023ixf from 9 to 307 d, taken with multiple instruments:\nGemini/GNIRS, Keck/NIRES, IRTF/SpeX, and MMT/MMIRS. The early (t<70 d) spectra\nindicate interaction between the expanding ejecta and nearby CSM. At t<20 d,\nintermediate-width line profiles corresponding to the ejecta-wind interaction\nare superposed on evolving broad P Cygni profiles. We find intermediate-width\nand narrow lines in the spectra until t<70 d, which suggest continued CSM\ninteraction. We also observe and discuss high-velocity absorption features in H\n$\\alpha$ and H $\\beta$ line profiles formed by CSM interaction. The spectra\ncontain CO first overtone emission between 199 and 307 d after the explosion.\nWe model the CO emission and find the CO to have a higher velocity (3000-3500\nkm/s) than that in Type II-pec SN 1987A (1800-2000 km/s) during similar phases\n(t=199-307 d) and a comparable CO temperature to SN 1987A.

The NANO\nfilter interprets Bayesian filtering as solutions to two distinct optimization\nproblems, which allows to define optimal Gaussian approximation and derive its\ncorresponding extremum conditions. The algorithm design still follows the\ntwo-step structure of Bayes filters. In the prediction step, NANO filter\ncalculates the first two moments of the prior distribution, and this process is\nequivalent to a moment-matching filter. In the update step, natural gradient\ndescent is employed to directly minimize the objective of the update step,\nthereby avoiding errors caused by model linearization. Comparative tests are\nconducted on four classic systems, including the damped linear oscillator,\nsequence forecasting, modified growth model, and robot localization, under\nGaussian, Laplace, and Beta noise to evaluate the NANO filter's capability in\nhandling nonlinearity. Additionally, we validate the NANO filter's robustness\nto data outliers using a satellite attitude estimation example.

Traditional neural operators primarily map either the PDE\ncoefficients or source terms independently to the solution, limiting their\nflexibility and applicability. In contrast, our proposed MNO architecture\ngeneralizes these approaches by mapping multiple parameters including PDE\ncoefficients, source terms, and boundary conditions to the solution space in a\nunified manner. Our MNO is motivated by the hierarchical nested bases of the\nFast Multipole Method (FMM) and is constructed systematically through three key\ncomponents: a parameter efficient Generalized FMM (GFMM) block, a Unimodal\nNeural Operator (UNO) built upon GFMM blocks for single parameter mappings, and\nmost importantly, a multimodal fusion mechanism extending these components to\nlearn the joint map. We demonstrate the multimodal generalization capacity of\nour approach on both linear and nonlinear BVPs. Our experiments show that the\nnetwork effectively handles simultaneous variations in PDE coefficients and\nsource or boundary terms.",

    "abstract": "This dissertation develops and justifies a novel method for deriving\napproximate formulas to estimate two parameters in stochastic volatility\ndiffusion models with exponentially-affine characteristic functions and single-\nor two-factor variance. These formulas aim to improve the accuracy of option\npricing and enhance the calibration process by providing reliable initial\nvalues for local minimization algorithms. The parameters relate to the\nvolatility of the stochastic factor in instantaneous variance dynamics and the\ncorrelation between stochastic factors and asset price dynamics.\n  The study comprises five chapters. Chapter one outlines the currency option\nmarket, pricing methods, and the general structure of stochastic volatility\nmodels. Chapter two derives the replication strategy dynamics and introduces a\nnew two-factor volatility model: the OUOU model. Chapter three analyzes the\ndistribution and surface dynamics of implied volatilities using principal\ncomponent and common factor analysis. Chapter four discusses calibration\nmethods for stochastic volatility models, particularly the Heston model, and\npresents the new Implied Central Moments method to estimate parameters in the\nHeston and Sch\\\"obel-Zhu models. Extensions to two-factor models, Bates and\nOUOU, are also explored. Chapter five evaluates the performance of the proposed\nformulas on the EURUSD options market, demonstrating the superior accuracy of\nthe new method.\n  The dissertation successfully meets its research objectives, expanding tools\nfor derivative pricing and risk assessment. Key contributions include faster\nand more precise parameter estimation formulas and the introduction of the OUOU\nmodel - an extension of the Sch\\\"obel-Zhu model with a semi-analytical\nvaluation formula for European options, previously unexamined in the\nliterature.",

One of its\nassumptions is that occurrence of outcome events does not influence later event\nrate, or in other words, absence of 'event dependence'. This study proposes,\nevaluates and illustrates a bias reduction method when this assumption is\nviolated. Study Design and Setting: We propose the conditional frailty method\nfor implementation of PERR in the presence of event dependence and evaluate its\nperformance by simulation. We demonstrate the use of the method with a study of\nemergency department visit rate and palliative care in patients with advanced\ncancer in Singapore. Results: Simulations showed that, in the presence of\nnegative (positive) event dependence, the crude PERR estimate of treatment\neffect was biased towards (away from) the null value. The proposed method\nsuccessfully reduced the bias, with median of absolute level of relative bias\nat about 5%. Dynamic random-intercept modelling revealed positive event\ndependence in emergency department visits among patients with advanced cancer.\nWhile conventional time-to-event regression analysis with covariate adjustment\nestimated higher rate of emergency department visits among palliative care\nrecipients (HR=3.61, P<0.001), crude PERR estimate and the proposed PERR\nestimate were 1.45 (P=0.22) and 1.22 (P=0.57), respectively.

However, whether such beam focusing can fully eliminate\ninterference under perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI),\nrendering advanced interference management schemes unnecessary, remains an open\nquestion. To address this, we investigate rate-splitting multiple access\n(RSMA)-enabled near-field communications (NFC) under imperfect SCI. Our\ntransmit scheme employs a sub-connected hybrid analog-digital (HAD)\narchitecture to reduce hardware overhead while incorporating imperfect\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) for practical implementation. A\nminimum rate maximization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the\nanalog beamfocuser, the digital beamfocuser, and the common rate allocation. To\nsolve the non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based block coordinate\ndescent (BCD) algorithm, deriving closed-form expressions for the optimal\nanalog and digital beamfocusers solutions. Furthermore, to reduce computational\ncomplexity, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, where analog and digital\nbeamfocusers are designed in two separate stages. Simulation results underscore\nthat: 1) beamfocusing alone is insufficient to fully suppress interference even\nunder perfect CSI; 2) RSMA exhibits superior interference management over SDMA\nunder imperfect CSI and SIC conditions; 3) sub-connected HAD architecture\ndelivers near-optimal digital beamfocusing performance with fewer radio\nfrequency chains.",

    "abstract": "The development of advanced packaging is essential in the semiconductor\nmanufacturing industry. However, non-destructive testing (NDT) of advanced\npackaging becomes increasingly challenging due to the depth and complexity of\nthe layers involved. In such a scenario, Magnetic field imaging (MFI) enables\nthe imaging of magnetic fields generated by currents. For MFI to be effective\nin NDT, the magnetic fields must be converted into current density. This\nconversion has typically relied solely on a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for\nmagnetic field inversion; however, the existing approach does not consider eddy\ncurrent effects or image misalignment in the test setup. In this paper, we\npresent a spatial-physics informed model (SPIM) designed for a 3D spiral sample\nscanned using Superconducting QUantum Interference Device (SQUID) microscopy.\nThe SPIM encompasses three key components: i) magnetic image enhancement by\naligning all the \"sharp\" wire field signals to mitigate the eddy current effect\nusing both in-phase (I-channel) and quadrature-phase (Q-channel) images; (ii)\nmagnetic image alignment that addresses skew effects caused by any misalignment\nof the scanning SQUID microscope relative to the wire segments; and (iii) an\ninversion method for converting magnetic fields to magnetic currents by\nintegrating the Biot-Savart Law with FFT. The results show that the SPIM\nimproves I-channel sharpness by 0.3% and reduces Q-channel sharpness by 25%.\nAlso, we were able to remove rotational and skew misalignments of 0.30 in a\nreal image.

Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient\nway for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their\ngenes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the\nworkload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic\nprediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the\nmodels to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids,\nwhich remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we\nproposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice\nbreeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally\nensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual\nprojection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual\nanalysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene\nvisualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory\ngenes and hybrids.

However, existing numerical abstract\ninterpreters rely on hand-crafted, instruction-specific transformers tailored\nto each domain, with no general algorithm for handling common operations across\ndomains. This limits extensibility, prevents precise compositional reasoning\nover instruction sequences, and forces all downstream tasks to use the same\nfixed transformer regardless of their precision, efficiency, or task-specific\nrequirements. To address these limitations, we propose a universal transformer\nsynthesis algorithm that constructs a parametric family of sound abstract\ntransformers for any given polyhedral numerical domain and a concrete operator\nfrom the class of Quadratic-Bounded Guarded Operators (QGO), which includes\nboth individual instructions and structured sequences. Each instantiation in\nthis family is sound by construction, enabling downstream analyses to adapt the\ntransformer to their particular needs. The space of transformers is\ndifferentiable but complex. To efficiently explore this space of transformers,\nwe introduce the Adaptive Gradient Guidance (AGG) procedure, a gradient-guided\nsearch strategy that steers the search process based on downstream analysis\nobjectives and runtime constraints. We implement these ideas in the USTAD\nframework and evaluate their effectiveness across three numerical abstract\ndomains: Zones, Octagons, and Polyhedra. Our results demonstrate that the\nuniversal synthesis algorithm successfully constructs sound families of\ntransformers across domains, and that USTAD achieves significant, tunable\nprecision gains over baselines by leveraging compositional reasoning and\nefficient gradient-guided traversal of the transformer space.",

    "abstract": "Turbulence holds immense importance across various scientific and engineering\ndisciplines. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulence proposed by\nOrszag in 1970 is a milestone in fluid mechanics, which began an era of\nnumerical experiment for turbulence. Many researchers have reported that\nturbulence should be chaotic, since spatiotemporal trajectories are very\nsensitive to small disturbance. In 2006 E.D. Lorenz discovered that numerical\nnoise might have a great influence on statistic characteristics of chaotic\nsystems. The above-mentioned facts logically lead to the conclusion that\nnumerical noises of turbulence (as a chaotic system) might have great influence\non turbulent flows. This is indeed true for a two-dimensional (2D) Kolmogorov\nturbulent flow, as currently revealed by a much more accurate algorithm than\nDNS, namely the ``clean numerical simulation'' (CNS). Different from DNS, CNS\ncan greatly reduce both of truncation error and round-off error to any required\nsmall level so that artificial numerical noise can be rigorously negligible\nthroughout a time interval long enough for calculating statistics. However, In\nphysics, 3D turbulent flow is more important than 2D turbulence, as pointed out\nby Nobel Prize winner T.D. Lee. So, for the first time, we solve a 3D turbulent\nKolmogorov flow by means of CNS in this paper, and compare our CNS result with\nthat given by DNS in details. It is found that the spatial-temporal\ntrajectories of the 3D Kolmogorov turbulent flow given by DNS are badly\npolluted by artificial numerical noise rather quickly, and the DNS result has\nhuge deviations from the CNS benchmark solution not only in the flow field and\nthe energy cascade but also even in statistics.",

This paper presents the Framework for\nAccelerating Interdisciplinary Research in Computer Science (FAIR-CS), a method\nfor achieving research goals, developing research communities, and supporting\nhigh quality mentorship in an online research environment. This method advances\nvirtual research operations by orchestrating dynamic partnerships between\nmaster's level researchers and academic mentors, resulting in interdisciplinary\npublications. We then discuss the implementation of FAIR-CS in the\nHuman-Augmented Analytics Group (HAAG), with researchers from the Georgia\nTech's Online Master of Computer Science program. Through documented project\nrecords and experiences with 72 active users, we present our lessons learned\nand evaluate the evolution of FAIR-CS in HAAG. This paper serves as a\ncomprehensive resource for other institutions seeking to establish similar\nvirtual research initiatives, demonstrating how the traditional research lab\nenvironment can be effectively replicated in the virtual space while\nmaintaining robust collaborative relationships and supporting knowledge\ntransfer.",

In the\ncurrent paper we consider the focused transport equation in conservative form\nalso called modified focused transport equation. This equation conserves the\nnorm but does not describe pitch-angle isotropization. We use the previously\ndeveloped subspace method to solve the focused transport equation analytically\nand numerically. For a pure analytical treatment we employ the two-dimensional\nsubspace approximation.

Photospheric current\nhelicity, defined as the integral of the product of vertical electric current\ndensity and vertical magnetic field ($H_c=\\int j_zB_z\\ dS$), serves as a key\nparameter in understanding the eruptions. Using a 3D magnetohydrodynamic model,\nwe identify a current helicity reversal pattern associated with the eruption: a\npre-eruption decrease and a post-eruption increase. This helicity reversal is\nattributed to the redistribution of electric currents: before the eruption,\ncurrents concentrate toward the polarity inversion line (PIL); after the\neruption they move away from the PIL, consistent with the flare ribbon\nseparation, which is caused by the upward progression reconnection site. To\nvalidate this pattern, we conducted an observational analysis of 50 $\\geq$M5.0\neruptive flares. The results reveal that 58\\% of cases exhibited a pre-eruption\ndecrease and 92\\% showed the post-eruption increase in current helicity.\nDetailed analysis of two cases with this reversal suggests that they share the\nsame current redistribution pattern, consistent with the mechanism identified\nin the simulations. Moreover, the pre-eruption decrease could be observed\nclearly even in the long-term evolution of the two cases.

To better understand the value of using other\ninput modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we\ngenerate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional\ngeographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and\nsegmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional\ngeographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model\nperformance.

We have developed a public tool to predict kilonova\nlight curves using simulated low-latency alert data from the International\nGravitational Wave Network during observing runs 4 (O4) and 5 (O5). It uses a\nbidirectional long-short-term memory (LSTM) model to forecast kilonova light\ncurves from binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers in the\nZwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space\nand Time filters. The model achieves a test mean squared error (MSE) of 0.19\nfor ZTF filters and 0.22 for Rubin filters, calculated by averaging the squared\nerror over all time steps, filters, and light curves in the test set. We verify\nthe performance of the model against merger events followed-up by the ZTF\npartnership during O4a and O4b. We also analyze the effect of incorporating\nskymaps and constraints on physical features such as ejecta mass through a\nhybrid convolutional neural network and LSTM model. Using ejecta mass, the\nperformance of the model improves to an MSE of 0.1. However, using full skymap\ninformation results in slightly lower model performance.

The\ninability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their\nover-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards\ngeneral-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models\n(EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the\nreal-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research\nprogress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of\nfirst-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current\nstate-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end,\nthis study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their\nmethodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that\nmost EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on\ntransformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for\nself-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely\nlimited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility.\nIn addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work\nshould demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and\ntrustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline.

    "abstract": "Constructing confidence intervals for the value of an optimal treatment\npolicy is an important problem in causal inference. Insight into the optimal\npolicy value can guide the development of reward-maximizing, individualized\ntreatment regimes. However, because the functional that defines the optimal\nvalue is non-differentiable, standard semi-parametric approaches for performing\ninference fail to be directly applicable. Existing approaches for handling this\nnon-differentiability fall roughly into two camps. In one camp are estimators\nbased on constructing smooth approximations of the optimal value. These\napproaches are computationally lightweight, but typically place unrealistic\nparametric assumptions on outcome regressions. In another camp are approaches\nthat directly de-bias the non-smooth objective. These approaches don't place\nparametric assumptions on nuisance functions, but they either require the\ncomputation of intractably-many nuisance estimates, assume unrealistic\n$L^\\infty$ nuisance convergence rates, or make strong margin assumptions that\nprohibit non-response to a treatment. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\nconstructing smooth approximations of non-differentiable functionals. By\ncarefully controlling first-order bias and second-order remainders, we show\nthat a softmax smoothing-based estimator can be used to estimate parameters\nthat are specified as a maximum of scores involving nuisance components. In\nparticular, this includes the value of the optimal treatment policy as a\nspecial case. Our estimator obtains $\\sqrt{n}$ convergence rates, avoids\nparametric restrictions/unrealistic margin assumptions, and is often\nstatistically efficient.",

The model in [15] is a particle system,\nregulated at the left boundary point. The more general model of this paper is\nsuch that we allow regulation boundaries on either side, or both sides, or no\nregulation at all. We consider the mean-field asymptotic regime, when the\nnumber of particles $n$ and the job arrival rates go to infinity, while the job\narrival rates per particle remain constant. The results include: the\nexistence/uniqueness of fixed points of mean-field limits (ML), which describe\nthe limiting dynamics of the system; conditions for the steady-state asymptotic\nindependence (concentration, as $n \\to\\infty$, of the stationary distribution\non a single state, which is necessarily an ML fixed point); the limits, as $n\n\\to\\infty$, of the average velocity at which unregulated (free) particle system\nadvances. In particular, our results for the left-regulated system unify and\ngeneralize the corresponding results in [15].

The enhancement in the\nGamow-Teller (GT) transition strength in $^{70}$Br compared to the\n$\\beta$-decay of the lighter $^{62}$Ge was suggested as an indication for\nincreased neutron-proton ($np$) pairing correlation. To explore the $np$\ncorrelations in nuclei, we systematically examined the $\\beta$-decay properties\nof the even-even nuclei $A=58,62,66,$ and $70$ into $N=Z$ odd-odd nuclei. By\nemploying an interaction involving solely $J=1, T=0$ and $J=0, T=1$ pairing\nmatrix elements, we observe that the pairing does not necessarily lead to an\nenhancement in the GT strength for the same coupling strength. But with the\ninclusion of the $g_{9/2}$ orbital, the GT strength can be increased with\nincreasing $np$ pairing in connection with the enhanced contribution from the\n$g_{9/2}$ orbital. We further compare those results with realistic calculations\nin the $fp$ and $f_{5/2}pg_{9/2}$ model space to gauge the contribution from\n$f_{7/2}$ and $g_{9/2}$ orbitals in the GT strengths. With the JUN45\ninteraction, there is an increment for the yrast $1^+$ state for the decay of\n$^{70}$Kr as compared to the decay of $^{62}$Ge due to increased $g_{9/2}$\ncontribution. Additionally, we probe the effect of $np$ pairing on $B_{\\rm GT}$\nby modifying the single-particle energies and the $T = 0$ matrix elements of\nthe interaction responsible for the decay transition strength.

Since there is a limited amount of approaches in this\ndirection, in this work we deliver a general DP approach for CP that we call\nPrivate Conformity via Quantile Search (P-COQS). The proposed approach adapts\nan existing randomized binary search algorithm for computing DP quantiles in\nthe calibration phase of CP thereby guaranteeing privacy of the consequent\nprediction sets. This however comes at a price of slightly under-covering with\nrespect to the desired $(1 - \\alpha)$-level when using finite-sample\ncalibration sets (although broad empirical results show that the P-COQS\ngenerally targets the required level in the considered cases). Confirming\nproperties of the adapted algorithm and quantifying the approximate coverage\nguarantees of the consequent CP, we conduct extensive experiments to examine\nthe effects of privacy noise, sample size and significance level on the\nperformance of our approach compared to existing alternatives. In addition, we\nempirically evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including\nCIFAR-10, ImageNet and CoronaHack. Our results suggest that the proposed method\nis robust to privacy noise and performs favorably with respect to the current\nDP alternative in terms of empirical coverage, efficiency, and informativeness.\nSpecifically, the results indicate that P-COQS produces smaller conformal\nprediction sets while simultaneously targeting the desired coverage and privacy\nguarantees in all these experimental settings.",

Recently, generative machine learning methods have emerged as a\npromising, more efficient method than molecular dynamics for sampling of\nconformations from the Boltzmann distribution. In this paper, we introduce\nTorsional-GFN, a conditional GFlowNet specifically designed to sample\nconformations of molecules proportionally to their Boltzmann distribution,\nusing only a reward function as training signal. Conditioned on a molecular\ngraph and its local structure (bond lengths and angles), Torsional-GFN samples\nrotations of its torsion angles. Our results demonstrate that Torsional-GFN is\nable to sample conformations approximately proportional to the Boltzmann\ndistribution for multiple molecules with a single model, and allows for\nzero-shot generalization to unseen bond lengths and angles coming from the MD\nsimulations for such molecules. Our work presents a promising avenue for\nscaling the proposed approach to larger molecular systems, achieving zero-shot\ngeneralization to unseen molecules, and including the generation of the local\nstructure into the GFlowNet model.",

In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong\nanatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first\nsystematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce\nMulti-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures\nthat facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational\ncost.

Spatially contiguous paths -- simple\nhorizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal\nscans.

In many situations these sequences are generated by slowly converging\niterative procedures and this led practitioners to seek faster alternatives to\nreach the limit. ``Acceleration techniques'' comprise a broad array of methods\nspecifically designed with this goal in mind. They started as a means of\nimproving the convergence of general scalar sequences by various forms of\n``extrapolation to the limit'', i.e., by extrapolating the most recent iterates\nto the limit via linear combinations. Extrapolation methods of this type, the\nbest known example of which is Aitken's Delta-squared process, require only the\nsequence of vectors as input. However, limiting methods to only use the\niterates is too restrictive. Accelerating sequences generated by fixed-point\niterations by utilizing both the iterates and the fixed-point mapping itself\nhas proven highly successful across various areas of physics. A notable example\nof these Fixed-Point accelerators (FP-Accelerators) is a method developed by D.\nAnderson in 1965 and now widely known as Anderson Acceleration (AA).\nFurthermore, Quasi-Newton and Inexact Newton methods can also be placed in this\ncategory as well.

    "abstract": "The donation game is a well-established framework for studying the emergence\nand evolution of cooperation in multi-agent systems. The cooperative behavior\ncan be influenced by the environmental noise in partially observable settings\nand by the decision-making strategies of agents, which may incorporate not only\nreputation but also traits such as generosity and forgiveness. Traditional\nsimulations often assume fully random interactions, where cooperation is tested\nbetween randomly selected agent pairs. In this paper, we investigate\ncooperation dynamics using the concept of Stephen Wolfram's one-dimensional\nbinary cellular automata. This approach allows us to explore how cooperation\nevolves when interactions are limited to neighboring agents. We define binary\ncellular automata rules that conform to the donation game mechanics.\nAdditionally, we introduce models of perceptual and action noise, along with a\nmutation matrix governing the probabilistic evolution of agent strategies. Our\nempirical results demonstrate that cooperation is significantly affected by\nagents' mobility and their spatial locality on the game board. These findings\nhighlight the importance of distinguishing between entirely random multi-agent\nsystems and those in which agents are more likely to interact with their\nnearest neighbors.",

Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel\nsynthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a\nlimited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for\ndiversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key\ninsight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong\ncorrectness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such\nguarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse\nformulations.

Various approaches have been developed to\nloosen the axioms, of which the use of signed measures is the most successful\n(e.g. the Wigner quasiprobability distribution). As part of our larger effort\nAssumptions of Physics, we have been considering the various roles of measures,\nwhich are used in physics not only for probability, but also to quantify the\ncount of possible states and configurations. These measures play a crucial role\nin classical mechanics, as they effectively define its geometric structure. If\none tries to construct a parallel in quantum mechanics, the measure to quantify\nthe count of states turns out to be non-additive. The proper extension of\nprobability calculus may require the use of non-additive measures, which is\nsomething that, to our knowledge, has not yet been explored. The purpose of\nthis paper is to present the general idea and the open problems to an audience\nthat is knowledgeable of the subject of non-additive set functions, though not\nnecessarily in quantum physics, in the hope that it will spark helpful\ndiscussions. We go through the motivation in simple terms, which stems from the\nlink between the entropy of a uniform distribution and the logarithm of the\nmeasure associated to its support. If one extends this notion to quantum\nmechanics, the associated measure is non-additive. We will explore some\nproperties of this \"quantum measure\", its reasonableness in terms of the\nphysics, but its peculiarity on the math side. We will explore the need for a\nset of properties that can properly characterize the measure and a\ngeneralization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative to define a properly extended\nprobability calculus that reduces to the standard additive one on sets of\nphysically distinguishable cases (i.e. orthogonal measurement outcomes).",

This study presents the\nfirst dedicated economic assessment of geomagnetic storm impacts on Aotearoa\nNew Zealand, quantifying potential GDP losses across seven disruption and\nmitigation scenarios due to an extreme coronal mass ejection (CME). The primary\nfocus is upon the damaging impacts of geomagnetically induced currents (GICs)\non the electrical power transmission network. The goal is to support\ndecision-making around space weather mitigation investments by providing a\nfirst-order approximation of their potential economic benefits. We find that in\nthe absence of mitigation, a severe but realistic storm could result in up to\nNZ\\$8.36 billion in lost GDP, with more than half stemming from cascading\nsupply chain effects. Yet, even less severe scenarios incur losses exceeding\nNZ\\$3 billion. Importantly, research-led operational strategies, such as\noptimized switching and islanding, can avoid up to NZ\\$370 million in losses\nfor as little as NZ\\$500,000 in expenditure, delivering a benefit-cost ratio of\n740 to 1. Moreover, physical protections such as GIC blocking devices further\nreduce disruption to as low as NZ\\$1.12 billion, with avoided GDP losses up to\nNZ\\$2.3 billion, and benefit-cost returns up to 80 to 1.

This paper demonstrates that Picat's features, especially its\nSAT-based constraint solving and tabling, enable concise, declarative, and\nhighly efficient implementations of problems that would require significantly\nmore effort in imperative languages.",

Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines\nexcel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor\nscenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise.

    "abstract": "Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various\nhierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of\ndelivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local\nforecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in\nhandling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem.\nThese methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally\nexpensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In\ncontrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance\nprediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through\nglobalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load\nforecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of\ndifferent modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore\nfeature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how\nglobalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In\naddition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its\npotential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the\nbalance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series\nclustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming\nmodels and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models.\nThrough extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity\nload, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently\noutperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global\nfeatures and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming\nmodels face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring\nTSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.",

However, ABPM data are often reduced to summary statistics,\nsuch as means or medians, which obscure temporal features like nocturnal\ndipping and individual chronotypes. Functional data analysis methods better\ncapture these temporal dynamics but typically treat each ABPM measurement\nseparately, limiting their ability to leverage correlations among matched\nmeasurements. In this work, we observe that aligning ABPM data along\nmeasurement type, time, and patient ID lends itself to a tensor\nrepresentation--a multidimensional array. Although tensor learning has shown\ngreat potential in other fields, it has not been applied to ABPM data. Existing\ntensor learning approaches often lack temporal smoothing constraints, assume no\nmissing data, and can be computationally demanding. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel smooth tensor decomposition method that\nincorporates a temporal smoothing penalty and accommodates missing data. We\nalso develop an automatic procedure for selecting the optimal smoothing\nparameter and tensor ranks. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method\nreliably reconstructs smooth temporal trends from noisy, incomplete data.\nApplication to ABPM data from patients with concurrent obstructive sleep apnea\nand type 2 diabetes uncovers clinically relevant associations between patient\ncharacteristics and ABPM measurements, which are missed by summary-based\napproaches.",

This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this\npaper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of\nthe extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In\nparticular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we\nneither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is\nsemisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by\nthe desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its\nrealizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations\nof pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting\nfunctorial weight filtration.\n  We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition\nin the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial\nupper bound $F_{-1}\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier\ncriteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special\ncontexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the\nresults to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight\nfiltration $W_\\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with\nour general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the\nset of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a\ngiven graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\\underline{Hom}(M,M)$.",

    "abstract": "As the global population of people with disabilities (PWD) continues to grow,\nso will the need for mobility solutions that promote independent living and\nsocial integration. Wheelchairs are vital for the mobility of PWD in both\nindoor and outdoor environments. The current SOTA in powered wheelchairs is\nbased on either manually controlled or fully autonomous modes of operation,\noffering limited flexibility and often proving difficult to navigate in\nspatially constrained environments. Moreover, research on robotic wheelchairs\nhas focused predominantly on complete autonomy or improved manual control;\napproaches that can compromise efficiency and user trust. To overcome these\nchallenges, this paper introduces the CoNav Chair, a smart wheelchair based on\nthe Robot Operating System (ROS) and featuring shared control navigation and\nobstacle avoidance capabilities that are intended to enhance navigational\nefficiency, safety, and ease of use for the user. The paper outlines the CoNav\nChair's design and presents a preliminary usability evaluation comparing three\ndistinct navigation modes, namely, manual, shared, and fully autonomous,\nconducted with 21 healthy, unimpaired participants traversing an indoor\nbuilding environment. Study findings indicated that the shared control\nnavigation framework had significantly fewer collisions and performed\ncomparably, if not superior to the autonomous and manual modes, on task\ncompletion time, trajectory length, and smoothness; and was perceived as being\nsafer and more efficient based on user reported subjective assessments of\nusability. Overall, the CoNav system demonstrated acceptable safety and\nperformance, laying the foundation for subsequent usability testing with end\nusers, namely, PWDs who rely on a powered wheelchair for mobility.",

While\nthis approach itself is still in its infancy, and many obstacles must still be\novercome before its physical implementation, challenges from the software and\nalgorithmic side must also be identified and addressed. For instance, this\nparadigm shift requires a new form of compiler that considers the network\nconstraints in general as well as phenomena arising due to the nature of\nquantum communication. In distributed quantum computing, large circuits are\ndivided into smaller subcircuits such that they can be executed individually\nand simultaneously on multiple QPUs that are connected through quantum\nchannels. As quantum communication, for example, in the form of teleportation,\nis expensive, it must be used sparingly. We address the problem of assigning\nqubits to QPUs to minimize communication costs in two different ways. First by\napplying time-aware algorithms that take into account the changing connectivity\nof a given circuit as well as the underlying network topology. We define the\noptimization problem, use simulated annealing and an evolutionary algorithm and\ncompare the results to graph partitioning and sequential qubit assignment\nbaselines. In another approach, we propose an evolutionary-based quantum\ncircuit optimization algorithm that adjusts the circuit itself rather than the\nschedule to reduce the overall communication cost. We evaluate the techniques\nagainst random circuits and different network topologies. Both evolutionary\nalgorithms outperform the baseline in terms of communication cost reduction.

In this work, we focus specifically on the setting where the\nreward functions are determined by Borda scores. We begin by establishing a\nregret lower bound for PbMDPs with Borda scores. As a preliminary step, we\npresent a simple instance to prove a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{HSAT})$ for\nepisodic MDPs with adversarial losses, where $H$ is the number of steps per\nepisode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, and $T$ is\nthe number of episodes.

Next, we develop algorithms that\nachieve a regret bound of order $T^{2/3}$.

    "abstract": "Background: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an essential design\ntool for ventricular assist devices (VADs), where the goal of maximizing\nperformance often conflicts with biocompatibility. This tradeoff becomes even\nmore pronounced in pediatric applications due to the stringent size constraints\nimposed by the smaller patient population. This study presents an automated\nCFD-driven shape optimization of a new intermediate diffuser stage for the\nPediaFlow pediatric VAD, positioned immediately downstream of the impeller to\nimprove pressure recovery.\n  Methods: We adopted a multi-objective optimization approach to maximize\npressure recovery while minimizing hemolysis. The proposed diffuser stage was\nisolated from the rest of the flow domain, enabling efficient evaluation of\nover 450 design variants using Sobol sequence, which yielded a Pareto front of\nnon-dominated solutions. The selected best candidate was further refined using\nlocal T-search algorithm. We then incorporated the optimized front diffuser\ninto the full pump for CFD verification and in vitro validation.\n  Results: We identified critical dependencies where longer blades increased\npressure recovery but also hemolysis, while the wrap angle showed a strong\nparabolic relationship with pressure recovery but a monotonic relationship with\nhemolysis. Counterintuitively, configurations with fewer blades (2-3)\nconsistently outperformed those with more blades (4-5) in both metrics. The\noptimized two-blade design enabled operation at lower pump speeds (14,000 vs\n16,000 RPM), improving hydraulic efficiency from 26.3% to 32.5% and reducing\nhemolysis by 31%.\n  Conclusion: This approach demonstrates that multi-objective CFD optimization\ncan systematically explore complex design spaces while balancing competing\npriorities of performance and hemocompatibility for pediatric VADs.",

Various\ndescriptions exist in the literature for modelling the surface manifestation of\nconvection, the choice of which affects our interpretations. We aim to evaluate\nthe performance of and preference for various granulation background models for\na suite of 3D hydrodynamical simulations of convection across the HR diagram,\nthereby expanding the number of simulations and coverage of parameter space for\nwhich such studies have been made. We take a statistical approach by\nconsidering the granulation in power density spectra of 3D simulations, where\nno biases or systematics of observational origin are present. To properly\ncontrast the performance of the models, we develop a Bayesian nested sampling\nframework for model inference and comparison. This framework was extended to\nreal stellar data using KIC 8006161 (Doris) and the Sun. We find that\nmulti-component models are consistently preferred over a single-component\nmodel, with each tested multi-component model demonstrating merit in specific\ncases. This occurs for simulations with no magnetic activity, thus ruling out\nstellar faculae as the sole source of the second granulation component. Like a\nprevious study, we find that a hybrid model with a single overall amplitude and\ntwo characteristic frequencies performs well for numerous simulations.\nAdditionally, a tentative third granulation component beyond the value of\n$\\nu_\\mathrm{max}$ is seen for some simulations, but its potential presence in\nobservations requires further efforts. Studying the granulation signatures in\nthese simulations paves the way to studying stars with accurate granulation\nmodels.

While current observations\nfocus on stellar accretion and inner dust emission, the fate of the\nvolatile-rich material expelled during disruption remains poorly understood. We\ninvestigate whether the hydrogen- and helium-rich gas expelled from the\ndisrupted planet's envelope and atmosphere can escape the inner system and be\ngravitationally captured by a low-mass outer planet, potentially forming a\ntransient atmosphere and producing detectable volatile contamination. We model\nthe outward diffusion of gas from a tidally stripped giant using 2D\nhydrodynamical simulations, complemented by analytical estimates of volatile\nobservability and atmospheric escape. We assess the efficiency of gas capture\nby outer planets and the survival timescales of the resulting secondary\natmospheres under high-energy stellar irradiation.

Current solutions often rely on machine learning\nannotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we\nintroduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative\nAI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them\ninto a ``skeletonized\" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements\nof the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined\nset of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images\nacquired by the DESI Legacy Survey.

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive analysis of the\nimplications of data selection on the spurious bias levels of the selected\ncoresets and the robustness of downstream models trained on them. We use an\nextensive experimental setting spanning ten different spurious correlations\nbenchmarks, five score metrics to characterize sample importance/ difficulty,\nand five data selection policies across a broad range of coreset sizes.\nThereby, we unravel a series of nontrivial nuances in interactions between\nsample difficulty and bias alignment, as well as dataset bias and resultant\nmodel robustness. For example, we find that selecting coresets using\nembedding-based sample characterization scores runs a comparatively lower risk\nof inadvertently exacerbating bias than selecting using characterizations based\non learning dynamics. Most importantly, our analysis reveals that although some\ncoreset selection methods could achieve lower bias levels by prioritizing\ndifficult samples, they do not reliably guarantee downstream robustness.",

    "abstract": "(abridged) We consider a secular orbital evolution of a supermassive binary\nblack hole (SBBH) with unequal masses $M_p$ and $M_s < M_p$ in a central part\nof a non-spherical nuclear star cluster (NSC). When the mass of NSC inside the\norbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The\nsubsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal\npotential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential\nis mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the\nsecular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular\nmomentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits\ncan experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational\nwaves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study\nanalytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the\nimportant effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest\npossible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of\nfast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly\neccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital\nperiod. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale\nof the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular\nvalues of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from\nthe ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the\neccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is\nalso noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings,\ne.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary\nsystem inside a massive deformed gas cloud.",

Although conjectured to be\nPSPACE-complete, it remains open whether Pinwheel Scheduling is NP-hard (unless\na compact input encoding is used) or even contained in NP.\n  We introduce k-Visits, a finite version of Pinwheel Scheduling, where given n\ndeadlines, the goal is to schedule each task exactly k times. While we observe\nthat the 1-Visit problem is trivial, we prove that 2-Visits is strongly\nNP-complete through a surprising reduction from Numerical 3-Dimensional\nMatching (N3DM). As intermediate steps in the reduction, we define NP-complete\nvariants of N3DM which may be of independent interest. We further extend our\nstrong NP-hardness result to a generalization of k-Visits $k\\geq 2$ in which\nthe deadline of each task may vary throughout the schedule, as well as to a\nsimilar generalization of Pinwheel Scheduling, thus making progress towards\nsettling the complexity of Pinwheel Scheduling.\n  Additionally, we prove that 2-Visits can be solved in linear time if all\ndeadlines are distinct, rendering it one of the rare natural problems which\nexhibit the interesting dichotomy of being in P if their input is a set and\nNP-complete if the input is a multiset. We achieve this through a Turing\nreduction from 2-Visits to a variation of N3DM, which we call Position\nMatching. Based on this reduction, we also show an FPT algorithm for 2-Visits\nparameterized by a value related to how close the input deadlines are to each\nother, as well as a linear-time algorithm for instances with up to two distinct\ndeadlines.",

    "abstract": "Twelve years have passed since World IPv6 Launch Day, but what is the current\nstate of IPv6 deployment? Prior work has examined IPv6 status as a binary: can\nyou use IPv6, or not? As deployment increases we must consider a more nuanced,\nnon-binary perspective on IPv6: how much and often can a user or a service use\nIPv6? We consider this question as a client, server, and cloud provider.\nConsidering the client's perspective, we observe user traffic. We see that the\nfraction of IPv6 traffic a user sends varies greatly, both across users and\nday-by-day, with a standard deviation of over 15%. We show this variation\noccurs for two main reasons. First, IPv6 traffic is primarily human-generated,\nthus showing diurnal patterns. Second, some services are IPv6-forward and\nothers IPv6-laggards, so as users do different things their fraction of IPv6\nvaries. We look at server-side IPv6 adoption in two ways. First, we expand\nanalysis of web services to examine how many are only partially IPv6 enabled\ndue to their reliance on IPv4-only resources. Our findings reveal that only\n12.5% of top 100k websites qualify as fully IPv6-ready. Finally, we examine\ncloud support for IPv6. Although all clouds and CDNs support IPv6, we find that\ntenant deployment rates vary significantly across providers. We find that ease\nof enabling IPv6 in the cloud is correlated with tenant IPv6 adoption rates,\nand recommend best practices for cloud providers to improve IPv6 adoption. Our\nresults suggest IPv6 deployment is growing, but many services lag, presenting a\npotential for improvement.",

Secondly, we show that important quantum\nalgorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search\nalgorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal\nProcessing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give\nclean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics.\nFinally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of\nour language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to\nthese semantics.

    "abstract": "We investigate quantum electrodynamics in the infrared regime (QED-IR) using\nthe adiabatic approximation and the framework of the functional Berry phase. In\nthis approach, the physical state space is exact, nonperturbatively dressed,\nand endowed with a topological structure. Electrons do not exist as bare\nparticles, but as topologically protected electron-photon clouds, defining a\nnew kind of infrared quantum. These clouds are weakly bound in energy -- with a\nbinding scale estimated at $\\Lambda_{\\text{IR}} \\sim 0.2$ eV -- and remain\nstable provided photon energies remain below this threshold. Crucially, the\ntheory becomes exactly solvable in this regime due to the quantization of the\nfunctional Berry flux, which governs the infrared dynamics of the dressed\nstates. When hard (high-energy) processes are involved, this topological\nprotection is lifted, and the theory smoothly recovers conventional\nperturbative QED. In contrast, in the deep infrared, the electromagnetic\ninteraction never fully vanishes, leading to observable effects. We argue that\nthe energy required to dissolve the infrared electron-photon cloud in QED is\napproximately 0.2 eV, well above the thermal energy of the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB). However, the observed temperature anisotropies correspond to\nfluctuations near $10^{-9}$ eV, which may lie at the threshold for perturbing,\nbut not destroying, the topological structure of the dressed state. This\nsuggests that CMB deviations could reflect residual topological imprints of the\nfunctional infrared dynamics. Finally, we propose that analogous cloud-like\nstructures may manifest in other quantum systems governed by low-energy photon\ndynamics, such as atomic and molecular environments.",

This study uses high\nfidelity simulations of a mackerel-inspired caudal fin swimmer across a wide\nrange of Reynolds and Strouhal numbers to analyze the relationship between\nswimming kinematics and hydrodynamic forces. Central to this work is the\nderivation and use of a model for the leading edge vortex on the caudal fin.\nThis vortex dominates the thrust production from the fin and the LEV model\nforms the basis for the derivation of scaling laws grounded in flow physics.\nScaling laws are derived for thrust, power, efficiency, cost-of-transport, and\nswimming speed, and are parameterized using data from high fidelity\nsimulations. These laws are validated against published simulation and\nexperimental data, revealing several new kinematic and morphometric parameters\nthat critically influence hydrodynamic performance. The results provide a\nmechanistic framework for understanding thrust generation, optimizing swimming\nperformance, and assessing the effects of scale and morphology in aquatic\nlocomotion of both fish and biorobotic underwater vehicles.",

    "abstract": "Quasar sightline observations reveal that low-ionization-state gas corotates\nwith the galaxy disk and often at sub-centrifugal velocities, suggesting that\nthe gas is spiraling towards the galaxy disk. However, while observations\nubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\\sim L^*$\nstar-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk,\nespecially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O\nVI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk\nrotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\\approx0.2$\nstar-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) within 45$^\\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while\nindividual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the\nbulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match\nO VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of\ntheir velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion\nmatches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more\nlikely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI\nvelocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the\nextended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches\nrepresent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is\ntheoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular\nmomentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent\nto mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results.",

    "abstract": "Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key\nfor AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these\ngains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains\na challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this\nintuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge,\nhuman-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as\nverifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and\nrobotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a\nstrong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often\ngenerating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is\npervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several\nmethods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs\ndespite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To\naddress this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method\nthat enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing\ntheir own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV\noperates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors\nabout task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then,\nconditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate\ntrajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in\naccuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of\nheterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld,\na diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting\na new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.",

We explore how N/O relates to\ndensity structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age,\ncompactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those\nof galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV\nnitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic\ntime. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns\nwith the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that\ngalaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant\nredshift evolution in N/O. We identify a significant correlation between\nelectron density $n_{\\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure\ncontributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with\nhigh SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong\ncorrelation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity\noutflows (v$_{out}$ > 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to\nelevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role.

A detailed sensitivity analysis of drag models is performed to establish\nthe solid-fluid interaction in the slurry flow. The numerical model is\nvalidated with the experimental data from the literature and shows a fair\nagreement. The validated model is used to simulate the settling behavior of the\nslurry in the flume. The mean particle diameter of the solid particles in the\nslurry is in the range of 75-296 $\\mu$m with a median diameter of 188 $\\mu$m.\nThe effect of particle size distributions (PSDs), flume inclination, bubble\nsize and bubble volume fraction on the particle settling inside the flume is\ninvestigated in the parametric study. The analysis of our results revealed that\nthe settling of solids is significantly affected by PSDs in the open channel\nsystem. In particular, the increase in flume inclination progresses the\nsettling and dissipation of fine and coarse particles, respectively. Additional\nsimulations showed that the inception of bubbles influences the settling\nvelocity of solids, which changes the settling behavior of multisize solids\ninside the flume.

    "abstract": "Wind-forced near-inertial waves (NIWs) propagate through a sea of mesoscale\neddies, which can fundamentally alter their evolution. The nature of this\nNIW--mesoscale interaction depends on how dispersive the waves are. For weakly\ndispersive waves, ray tracing suggests that the NIW frequency should be shifted\nby $\\frac{1}{2}\\zeta$, where $\\zeta$ is the mesoscale vorticity, and that the\nwaves are refracted into anticyclones. Strongly dispersive waves, in contrast,\nretain the large-scale structure of the wind forcing and exhibit a small\nnegative frequency shift. Previous in situ observational studies have indeed\nrevealed varying degrees of NIW--mesoscale interaction. Here, observations of\nNIWs from drifters are used to map the geography of NIW--mesoscale interactions\nglobally, and idealized simulations and a simple model are used to identify the\nunderlying physical processes. Almost everywhere in the ocean, with the notable\nexception of the North Pacific, the NIW frequency is strongly modulated by the\nmesoscale vorticity, with the slope of the frequency shift vs. vorticity taking\nvalues of approximately $0.4$. Concentration of NIW energy into anticyclones is\na common feature throughout the ocean. Other aspects of the observations,\nhowever, show signatures of strongly dispersive waves: a negative frequency\nshift and weaker concentration into anticyclones in regions with strong eddies\nas well as weak modulation of the NIW frequency by mesoscale eddies in the\nNorth Pacific. The signatures of both weakly and strongly dispersive NIW\nbehavior can be rationalized by the geography of the wave dispersiveness and\nthe fact that wind forcing excites multiple vertical modes with different wave\ndispersiveness. These results have implications for NIW-induced mixing in the\nupper-ocean.",

In particular, we\nstudy the dynamics of charged matter (scalars and spinors) on the background of\nMelvin's electric universe in the framework of NC gauge field theory. Melvin's\nelectric/magnetic universe is a static, axially symmetric solution of the\nEinstein-Maxwell equations, representing a parallel bundle of self-gravitating\nelectric/magnetic flux.

    "abstract": "Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a\nhigh-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score\n(MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging\nfor many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent\nvariance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions\nhave been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual\nfactors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead\nto unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework\nthat pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning\non just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS\nprediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are\nthen used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity\ninformation and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean\nLibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at\ndifferent signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with\naudio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results\nsuggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly\nimproves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared\nagainst the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These\nfindings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly\ncontributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.",

    "abstract": "The detection of gravitational waves (GW) by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK)\nnetwork has opened up a new era in astrophysics. The identification of the\nelectromagnetic counterparts of GW sources is crucial for multi-messenger\nastronomy, one way of which is to use galaxy catalogues to guide optical\nfollow-up observations. In this paper, we test the utility of galaxy-targeted\napproach with mass prioritised galaxy ranking for the ongoing LIGO O4 run. We\nhave used the simulated results for the expected LIGO O4 events and the NED-LVS\ngalaxy catalogue and based our study for small field of view telescopes,\nspecifically the GROWTH-India Telescope (GIT). With the increase in sensitivity\nof LIGO/Virgo in the ongoing observing run O4, the expected number of total\ndetections have gone up but most of these are also now poorly localised. We\nshow that a larger volume covered in the same field-of-view (FoV) on the sky\nresults in a large increase in the total number of galaxies in each FoV. A\nsignificant top-heaviness is observed in the mass-ranked list of galaxies,\nwhich still number to a few thousand in most cases. At larger distances, such\nhigh numbers of deep follow-up observations are infeasible in most cases\nrendering galaxy catalogues useful in limited cases, but these are still useful\nat lower distances where LVK detectors are currently sensitive and where galaxy\ncompleteness is higher. We also explore the effect of mass-filling to account\nfor galaxy catalogue incompleteness at large distances. If mass-filled\nprobabilities are considered as the metric for ranking and coverage, we find\nthat the conventional 2D probability search performs better than a 3D galaxy\ncatalogue (without mass-filling) based search at distances larger than 300 Mpc\n(upto which NED-LVS is ~70% complete), and using 3D mass times probability in\neach tile performs better for nearby events.",

    "abstract": "Protoplanetary discs around Very Low Mass Stars (VLMS) show hydrocarbon-rich\nMIR spectra indicative of C/O>1 in their inner discs, in contrast to discs\naround higher-mass hosts which mostly show O-bearing species. One scenario\nproposed to elevate C/O in VLMS inner discs is the advection of O-depleted gas\nfrom the outer disc. However, if CO gas remains abundant, C/O can be at most\n~1. We test if chemical transformation of CO into other species allows this\ntransport scenario to produce C/O significantly above 1. We track the evolving\ninner disc C/H and O/H with a 1D disc evolution code. We model the transport of\nmolecules in gas and ice and add conversions of species to represent key\nreaction pathways at the midplane. We explore the role of disc mass, size,\nionization rate, and substructures. The inner disc C/O increases over time due\nto sequential delivery where O-rich species (e.g. H2O) give way to C-rich\nspecies (e.g. CH4). To reach C/O>1, separating C and O is key, hence the\nliberation of C from gaseous CO by He+ is critical. Ionization drives this\nchemistry and needs rates >~10^-17 s^-1 for VLMSs for sufficient chemical\nevolution within a disc lifetime. However, <~10^-17 s^-1 is needed to ensure\nthat C/O stays <1 for the first few Myr in T Tauri discs. While C/O is usually\nhigher for VLMS than T Tauri stars due to faster sequential delivery, C/O\nsignificantly above 1 is only produced by combining gas-phase CO destruction\nwith gas advection and radial drift. Sufficient O depletion and hydrocarbon\nproduction around VLMSs can then be achieved but may imply higher ionization\nrates than T Tauris. Observations of older discs may distinguish whether higher\nionization rates are indeed needed or faster physical evolution timescales\nalone are sufficient. CH3OH ice photodissociation at a dust trap between the\nCH3OH and CH4 snowlines may also liberate C as CH4 gas that can enrich the\ninner disc.",

While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such\nintertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition\nbetween non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we\nintroduce a novel multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, which enables the\nmeasurement of time-resolved tunneling (trSTM), time-resolved point-contact\n(trPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescales-all\nwithin a single instrument. We apply these techniques to investigate the\ncollective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator\n(TaSe4)2I. Our trSTM and trPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22\nTHz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted\nbehavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Higgs\nmechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz\nexhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode\nintensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking\nsuggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the\nsplitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via\nparametric amplification-analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two\nphotons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason\ncompetes with and suppresses the amplitudon at the same frequency. Our studies\nreveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective\nexcitations and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast\nphenomena.",

    "abstract": "The nucleation of bubbles during a first-order phase transition has recently\nbeen explored using holographic duality, which can provide an important\ncomplement to standard perturbative methods. These computations typically\nrequire finding static and spatially inhomogeneous saddle points, known as\ncritical bubbles, which correspond in the gravitational dual to solutions of\nnonlinear partial differential equations. A computationally simpler alternative\nis to use the gravitational dual to derive the effective action of the boundary\ntheory in a derivative expansion, and then solve the resulting\nlower-dimensional equations of motion. Once the effective action, typically\ntruncated at two derivatives, is obtained, the holographic theory can be set\naside, and bubble solutions can be found from ordinary differential equations.\nIn this paper, we test this approach in a simple holographic setup: a probe\nscalar field in a black brane background with nonlinear multi-trace boundary\nconditions. We compute critical bubble solutions both from the effective action\nand by solving the full gravitational equations, and find good agreement\nbetween the two methods.",

Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and\nautomated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs\nare not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative\non-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on\ntwo-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal\ncar-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral\nlane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human\nfactors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a\nHCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based\non the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model\nbased on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the\nelitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and\nefficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under\ndifferent traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The\nfindings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in\nenhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging\nprocess, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption\ncompared with benchmarks.",

Using VLT/UVES\nand HST/COS quasar spectra, we analyse MgI, MgII, HI, CII, CIII, and OVI\nabsorption relative to galaxy rotation curves from Keck/LRIS and Magellan/MagE\nspectra. We find that at lower $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir}\\leq 0.2$), over 80% of\nabsorption in all ions lies on the side of systemic velocity matching disk\nrotation, and the optical-depth-weighted median velocity ($v_{abs}$) is\nconsistent with the peak rotation speed. At higher $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir} >\n0.2$), the kinematics diverge by ionisation state: For low ionisation gas, the\namount of co-rotating absorption remains >80%, yet $v_{abs}$ drops to 60% of\nthe galaxy rotation speed. For high ionisation gas (OVI), only 60% of the\nabsorption is consistent with co-rotation and $v_{abs}$ drops to 20% of the\nrotation speed. Furthermore, the velocity widths, corresponding to 50% of the\ntotal optical depth ($\\Delta v_{50}$) for low ionisation gas is 1.8 times\nlarger in the inner halo than at larger radii, while for CIII and OVI $\\Delta\nv_{50}$ remains unchanged with distance. These results suggest a radially\ndependent CGM kinematic structure: the inner halo hosts cool, dynamically broad\ngas tightly coupled to disk rotation, whereas beyond 0.2$R_{vir}$, particularly\ntraced by OVI and HI, the CGM shows weaker rotational alignment and lower\nvelocity dispersion. Therefore, low-ionisation gas likely traces extended\nco-rotating gas, inflows and/or recycled accretion, while high-ionisation gas\nreflects a mixture of co-rotating, lagging, discrete collisionally ionised\nstructures, indicating a kinematic stratification of the multi-phase CGM.\n[Abridged]",

Although over 30\nsuch quasars are now known at $z > 5.5$, the signal remains elusive in\npractice, owing to instrumental noise, the intrinsic weakness of the absorption\nfeatures, and the limited brightness of available background sources. Recent\nstudies have focused on the one-dimensional transmission power spectrum as a\nstatistical observable, but this approach also demands high signal-to-noise\nratios. Here, we present a systematic comparison of five inference pipelines\nfor recovering IGM parameters from mock 21-cm forest spectra at $z = 6$,\nincorporating realistic instrumental noise and telescope characteristics. We\nshow that likelihood-free inference based on machine learning substantially\noutperforms traditional Bayesian methods. In particular, our most effective\nmethod dispenses with the power spectrum entirely: we use a convolutional U-Net\nto extract a latent-space encoding of the input spectrum and perform parameter\nregression using XGBoost. This approach yields accurate constraints on the IGM\nneutral fraction and X-ray heating efficiency even with a single 50-hour uGMRT\nsightline, which is an orders-of-magnitude improvement in integration time\nrelative to existing techniques. We publicly release our code, training data,\nand models.

    "abstract": "Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations at 1.3mm\nhave recently revealed surprising complexity in the circumstellar environment\nof DFK 52, a red supergiant (RSG) located in the Stephenson 2 massive open\ncluster. We provide an initial characterisation of the star's mass-loss\nproperties by studying its circumstellar emission in continuum, $^{12}$CO,\n$^{13}$CO, and SiO rotational lines. We find that DFK 52 is surrounded by an\nextremely large outflow (up to 50,000 au in radius) that shows complex\nmorphologies in both its molecular and dust emission. The size of the\ncircumstellar medium is unprecedented, even when compared with other known\nextreme RSGs, and its lower luminosity indicates that its mass ejection\nmechanism may be unique among this population. The molecular emission can be\npartially reproduced by a two-component model consisting of a fast (27 km/s)\ndetached equatorial component with $M{\\sim}0.05$ $M_{\\odot}$ and a slow (10\nkm/s) spherical envelope with $\\dot{M}\\sim3\\times10^{-6}$ $M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$. This suggests that DFK 52 underwent a dramatic mass-loss event\n$\\sim$4000 years ago, but has since transitioned into having a slower more\nsymmetric mass loss. We conservatively estimate a total mass of $0.1-1$\n$M_{\\odot}$ in the complex extended regions of the outflow. The uncertain\nnature of the dramatic mass loss warrants extensive follow-up of this likely\nsupernova progenitor.",

However, modeling this\npopulation remains difficult due to the wide range of luminosities and black\nhole masses involved, and the high computational costs of capturing the\nhydrodynamic response of gas and evolving radiation fields on-the-fly. In this\nstudy, we present a new suite of simulations based on the IllustrisTNG galaxy\nformation framework, enhanced with on-the-fly radiative transfer, to examine\nAGN at high redshift (z > 5) in a protocluster environment extracted from the\nMillenniumTNG simulation. We focus on the co-evolution of black holes and their\nhost galaxies, as well as the radiative impact on surrounding intergalactic\ngas. The model predicts that black holes form in overdense regions and lie\nbelow the local black hole-stellar mass relation, with stellar mass assembly\npreceding significant black hole accretion. Ionizing photons are primarily\nproduced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive\nreionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original\nIllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1,\nresulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty\ngrowth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching. However, the resulting AGN remain\nsignificantly fainter than observed high-redshift quasars. As such, to\nincorporate this missing population, we introduce a quasar boosted model, in\nwhich we artificially boost the AGN luminosity.

    "abstract": "In the 1960s and 1970s a series of observations and theoretical developments\nhighlighted the presence of several anomalies which could, in principle, be\nexplained by postulating one of the following two working hypotheses: (i) the\nexistence of dark matter, or (ii) the modification of standard gravitational\ndynamics in low accelerations. In the years that followed, the dark matter\nhypothesis as an explanation for dark matter phenomenology attracted far more\nattention compared to the hypothesis of modified gravity, and the latter is\nlargely regarded today as a non-viable alternative. The present article takes\nan integrated history and philosophy of science approach in order to identify\nthe reasons why the scientific community mainly pursued the dark matter\nhypothesis in the years that followed, as opposed to modified gravity. A\nplausible answer is given in terms of three epistemic criteria for the\npursuitworthiness of a hypothesis: (a) its problem-solving potential, (b) its\ncompatibility with established theories and the feasibility of incorporation,\nand (c) its independent testability. A further comparison between the problem\nof dark matter and the problem of dark energy is also presented, explaining why\nin the latter case the situation is different, and modified gravity is still\nconsidered a viable possibility.",

First, they fail to maintain consistent background details,\nwhich limits their applicability. Furthermore, when the foreground character\nundergoes large motion variations, inconsistencies in identity and clothing\ndetails become evident. To address these problems, we propose CharaConsist,\nwhich employs point-tracking attention and adaptive token merge along with\ndecoupled control of the foreground and background.

Our approach incorporates physical priors -- such as inertia,\ndamping, a learned potential function, and stochastic forces -- to represent\nboth autonomous and non-autonomous processes in neural systems. Crucially, the\npotential function is parameterized as a network of locally coupled\noscillators, biasing the model toward oscillatory and flow-like behaviors\nobserved in biological neural populations. Our model features a recurrent\nencoder, a one-layer Transformer decoder, and Langevin dynamics in the latent\nspace. Empirically, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on\nsynthetic neural populations generated by a Lorenz attractor, closely matching\nground-truth firing rates. On the Neural Latents Benchmark (NLB), the model\nachieves superior held-out neuron likelihoods (bits per spike) and forward\nprediction accuracy across four challenging datasets.

In this uniquely data-rich regime,\nwe take initial steps towards a more tailored IA modelling approach by building\na library of IA measurements across colour, luminosity, stellar mass, and\nredshift. We map the dependence between galaxy type -- in terms of rest-frame\ncolour, strength of the 4000 Angstrom break, and specific star formation rate\n-- and IA amplitude; the bluest galaxies have an alignment consistent with\nzero, across low ($0.05<z<0.5$) and high ($0.8<z<1.55$) redshifts. In order to\nconstruct cosmic shear samples that are minimally impacted by IA but maintain\nmaximum sample size and statistical power, we map the dependence of alignment\nwith colour purity. Red, quenched galaxies are strongly aligned and the\namplitude of the signal increases with luminosity, which is tightly correlated\nwith stellar mass in our catalogues. For DESI galaxies between $0<z<1.5$,\ntrends in luminosity and colour alone are sufficient to explain the alignments\nwe measure -- with no need for an explicit redshift dependence. In a companion\npaper (Jeffrey et al., in prep), we perform detailed modelling of the IA\nsignals with significant detections, including model comparison.

    "abstract": "Ambiguity in natural language instructions poses significant risks in\nsafety-critical human-robot interaction, particularly in domains such as\nsurgery. To address this, we propose a framework that uses Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for ambiguity detection specifically designed for collaborative\nsurgical scenarios. Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each\nconfigured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,\ncontextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator\nis included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential\nissues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal\nprediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled\ncalibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed\nclassification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from\nunambiguous surgical instructions. Our approach improves the safety and\nreliability of human-robot collaboration in surgery by offering a mechanism to\nidentify potentially ambiguous instructions before robot action.",

A principle of dynamics is\ndeveloped within special relativity and has direct implications in\nastrophysics, especially for galaxy rotation curves. The presence of a minimal\nacceleration significantly reduces the amount of dark matter required to\naccount for these curves. The model presented here is however conceptually\ndifferent from fiduciary Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). The modified\ninertia with the minimal acceleration bound closely matches with many observed\ngalaxy rotation curves and the radial acceleration relation, showing a better\nagreement than MOND in the $10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ regime.

Traditional methods and early deep learning models, such\nas convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to capture long-range\ndependencies and global context essential for accurate change detection in\ncomplex scenes. While Transformer-based models mitigate these issues, their\ncomputational complexity limits their applicability in high-resolution remote\nsensing.

This\nfundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that\nphoton number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A\ndeviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard\ncosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low\nredshifts ($z < 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project\nwith $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa).

Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to\nderive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only\nBAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$.\nHowever, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this\ndegeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific\ncosmological model or distance-ladder techniques.

The\nalgorithm jointly aligned typical continuous (age, BMI) and categorical (sex,\nrace, ethnicity) variables by constructing multidimensional bins based on\ndiscretized covariates. For a given target size, DISTINCT samples individuals\nto match the joint demographic distribution of the reference population. We\nevaluated the demographic similarity between VLST and progressively larger NLST\nsubsamples using Wasserstein and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distances to identify\nthe maximal subsample size with acceptable alignment. The algorithm identified\na maximal aligned NLST subsample of 9,974 participants, preserving demographic\nsimilarity to the VLST population. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)\nanalysis using risk scores for lung cancer detection showed that area under the\ncurve (AUC) estimates stabilized beyond 6,000 participants, confirming the\nsufficiency of aligned subsamples for virtual imaging trial evaluation.\nStratified AUC analysis revealed substantial performance variation across\ndemographic subgroups, reinforcing the importance of covariate alignment in\ncomparative studies.",

Motivated by this\nquestion, we study the associated Threshold problem: deciding whether there\nexists a correlated equilibrium whose value exceeds a given threshold. We prove\nthat this problem is PSPACE-hard for NFCE in multiplayer extensive-form games\nwith perfect recall, even for fixed thresholds. To contextualize this result,\nwe also establish the complexity of the Threshold problem for Nash equilibria\nin this setting, showing it is ER-complete. These results uncover a surprising\ncomplexity reversal: while optimal correlated equilibria are computationally\nsimpler than optimal Nash in normal-form games, the opposite holds in\nextensive-form games, where computing optimal correlated equilibria is provably\nharder. Building on this line of inquiry, we also address a related question by\n[VSF08], who introduced the notions of extensive-form correlated equilibrium\n(EFCE) and agent-form correlated equilibrium (AFCE). They asked how difficult\nthe Threshold problem is for AFCE; we answer this question by proving that it\nis NP-hard, even in two-player games without chance nodes. Complementing our\nhardness results, we establish tight complexity classifications for the\nThreshold problem across several correlated equilibrium concepts - including\nEFCE, AFCE, normal-form coarse, extensive-form coarse, and agent-form coarse\ncorrelated equilibria. For each of these solution concepts in multiplayer\nstochastic extensive-form games with perfect recall, we prove NP-completeness\nby providing matching NP upper bounds to the previously known hardness results.\nTogether, our results provide the most complete landscape to date for the\ncomplexity of optimal equilibrium computation in extensive-form games.",

The properties of clumps and their\nformation mechanisms, however, remain highly debated. In this work we analyze a\nsample of 18 Supercompact Ultraviolet Luminous Galaxies observed with the\nOSIRIS spectrograph at the Keck Telescope, targeting their Pa-alpha emission.\nThese galaxies, although at z~0.1-0.2, share many similar properties with\nstar-forming galaxies at cosmic noon. We find a total of 84 star-forming clumps\nwith typical sizes of a few hundred parsecs. The star-forming clumps exhibit\nlow values of velocity shear (~12 km/s) and high velocity dispersion (~70\nkm/s). The dynamical masses of the clumps are typically higher than gas masses\ninferred from the measured star-formation rates of each clump. We also\nartificially redshift our data to emulate observations at z=2.2 and allow for a\ndirect comparison with other galaxies at higher redshift. Our results indicate\nthat, due to the effects of clump clustering and low-resolution observations,\nhigh-z clumps appear larger at greater cosmological distances. This underscores\nthe importance of using low-redshift observations to anchor studies at earlier\nepochs. Finally, our results support the idea of growing clump sizes in\nstar-forming galaxies as a function of redshift, although not to scales of kpc\nas found by other works without the benefits of adaptive optics or\ngravitational lensing.",

The\nclosing of the cavity generates a thrust-producing jet. Our previous\nexperimental study (Mahulkar and Arakeri, PRF, 2024) compared the flow fields\nof the clapping body in two cases: free-moving (dynamic) and\nforward-constrained (stationary). The experiments revealed significant\ndifferences in body motion and flow structures. This numerical study further\ninvestigates these differences using plate motion data from the experiments.\nOur computations show that, in dynamic cases, interplate cavity pressure is\nlower than in stationary cases. A basic unsteady Bernoulli analysis explains\nthat forward acceleration reduces interplate pressure. Furthermore, stationary\ncases exhibit distinct vortex dynamics, with starting vortex tubes forming at\nthe plate edges and reconnecting with stopping vortex tubes to form triangular\nvortex loops in the rear wake, along with two sideways-oriented ringlets. In\ndynamic cases, the starting vortex tubes slide backward and reconnect with\nbound-vorticity threads shed from the outer surface of the plates, forming\nelliptical loops that reconnect circumferentially. Referring to Sullivan et al.\n(JFM, 2008), we quantify the energy deficit in isolated axisymmetric vortex\nrings using separate simulations and propose a model for the potential energy\nin the vortex core at the formation time. Using this model, we show that the\ntotal wake energy (kinetic + potential) equals the initial slug energy for the\nvortex ring, and in clapping, it equals the work done on the fluid by the\npressure torque on the plates.",

While these planning stages are\ntraditionally addressed sequentially, their interdependencies often lead to\nsuboptimal vehicle usage. We propose the VCR-PESP, an integrated formulation\nthat minimizes fleet size while ensuring feasible and infrastructure-compliant\nperiodic timetables. We present the first Satisfiability Modulo Theories\n(SMT)-based method for the VCR-PESP to solve the resulting large-scale\ninstances. Unlike the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT), which requires time\ndiscretisation, SMT supports continuous time via difference constraints,\neliminating the trade-off between temporal precision and encoding size. Our\napproach avoids rounding artifacts and scales effectively, outperforming both\nSAT and Mixed Integer Program (MIP) models across non-trivial instances. Using\nreal-world data from the Swiss narrow-gauge operator RhB, we conduct extensive\nexperiments to assess the impact of time discretisation, vehicle circulation\nstrategies, route flexibility, and planning integration. We show that discrete\nmodels inflate vehicle requirements and that fully integrated solutions\nsubstantially reduce fleet needs compared to sequential approaches. Our\nframework consistently delivers high-resolution solutions with tractable\nruntimes, even in large and complex networks. By combining modeling accuracy\nwith scalable solver technology, this work establishes SMT as a powerful tool\nfor integrated railway planning.

Addressing key methodological\ngaps in existing literature, the analysis leverages Retrofitted Word Embeddings\nto encode discrete emotional cues tailored to ESG-relevant narratives. Unlike\nprior studies that rely on lexicon-based or transformer-based models, this\napproach explicitly incorporates domain-specific emotional semantics while\naccounting for firm-level heterogeneity and temporal sentiment fluctuations.\nUsing a dataset of 16 multinational firms and sentiment data extracted from\nSeeking Alpha headlines, the study tests three hypotheses: (1) emotion-specific\nsentiment independently predicts stock returns; (2) the moderating effect of\nsentiment varies across ESG dimensions; and (3) positive (negative) sentiment\namplifies (dampens) ESG performance effects. The analysis implements a dual\nsentiment aggregation strategy and introduces a triple-significance filtering\ncriterion to identify robust interactions. Results support Hypotheses 1 and 2,\nwith emotions such as anticipation and trust showing consistent associations\nwith return variation across firms and ESG categories. However, findings for\nHypothesis 3 are mixed: while some sentiment-ESG combinations align with\ntheoretical expectations, many contradictory interactions exhibit stronger\neffects. In this study, retrofitted embeddings outperform the NRC Emotion\nLexicon in explaining stock return variation within ESG-sentiment interaction\nmodels, underscoring the value of emotional nuance in ESG-finance modeling.\nThese results underscore the importance of emotion-sensitive sentiment modeling\nin understanding investor behavior and ESG-related stock price movements.",

We propose a framework, inspired\nby open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three \"dogmas.\" We\nrevisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To\nmake our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first\nestablish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains\nover an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational\nprocesses. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary\ninsights to enrich the \"adaptation-rather-than-search\" view of learning. We\nthen address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis,\nusing analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs.\nmulti-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration\nin RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence\nof a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the\nevolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it\ngestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from\norigins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication\noffer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained\nreinforcement learning in biological systems.",

We present\nCombinatorial Convolution-based Circle Fitting for Blurry Images (3C-FBI), an\nalgorithm that bridges the gap between circle detection and precise parametric\nfitting by combining (1) efficient combinatorial edge pixel (edgel) sampling\nand (2) convolution-based density estimation in parameter space.\n  We evaluate 3C-FBI across three experimental frameworks: (1) real-world\nmedical data from Parkinson's disease assessments (144 frames from 36 videos),\n(2) controlled synthetic data following established circle-fitting benchmarks,\nand (3) systematic analysis across varying spatial resolutions and outlier\ncontamination levels. Results show that 3C-FBI achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy (Jaccard index 0.896) while maintaining real-time performance (40.3\nfps), significantly outperforming classical methods like RCD (6.8 fps) on a\nstandard CPU (i7-10875H). It maintains near-perfect accuracy (Jaccard almost\n1.0) at high resolutions (480x480) and reliable performance (Jaccard higher\nthan 0.95) down to 160x160 with up to 20% outliers.\n  In extensive synthetic testing, 3C-FBI achieves a mean Jaccard Index of 0.989\nacross contamination levels, comparable to modern methods like Qi et al.

We report novel observations of phenomena such as\nhyperscaling breakdown and intermediate-ranged modulations among others. The\nzero field thermodynamic curvature $R_0$ is shown to systematically sub-divide\nthe ground state phases into regions of attractive or repulsive effective\ninteractions of varying strength. Furthermore, $R_0$ brings forth the\nsignificance of some third order moments in describing the effects of\nfrustration, including the multiphase lines.

IoT devices typically collect data\nfrom various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of\nthis data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is\ncentralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased\ncommunication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective\nalternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the\nneed to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and\nenvironmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different\nlocations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.\nAccurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is\ncrucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather\nforecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction\naccuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how\nnon-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized\nextreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.\n(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series\ndata influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated\nseveral synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and\ntrained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL\napproaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world\ndatasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental\nresults show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when\ndealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate\ndetrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different\ndata distributions.",

As an\ninstantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast\nstate-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack\n(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and\nversatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous\nand partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick\nreplanning. We present various multirotor and ground robot demonstrations,\nincluding the deployment of 15 real multirotors with random, consecutive target\nupdates while a person walks through the operational workspace.",

    "abstract": "We study when a Riemann difference of order $ n $ possesses the\nMarcinkiewicz-Zygmund (MZ) property: that is, whether the conditions $ f(h) =\no(h^{n-1}) $ and $ Df(h) = o(h^n) $ imply $ f(h) = o(h^n) $. This implication\nis known to hold for some classical examples with geometric nodes, such as $\n\\{0, 1, q, \\dots, q^{n-1}\\} $ and $ \\{1, q, \\dots, q^n\\} $, leading to a\nconjecture that these are the only such Riemann differences with the MZ\nproperty. However, this conjecture was disproved by the third-order example\nwith nodes $ \\{-1, 0, 1, 2\\} $, and we provide further counterexamples and a\ngeneral classification here.\n  We establish a complete analytic criterion for the MZ property by developing\na recurrence framework: we analyze when a function $ R(h) $ satisfying $ D(h) =\nR(qh) - A R(h) $, together with $ D(h) = o(h^n) $ and $ R(h) = o(h^{n-1}) $,\nforces $ R(h) = o(h^n) $. We prove that this holds if and only if $ A $ lies\noutside a critical modulus annulus determined by $ q $ and $ n $, covering both\n$ |q| > 1 $ and $ |q| < 1 $ cases. This leads to a complete characterization of\nall Riemann differences with geometric nodes that possess the MZ property, and\nprovides a flexible analytic framework applicable to broader classes of\ngeneralized differences.",

However, using\nredshifts as distance proxies introduces distortions in the 3D galaxy\ndistribution. If uncorrected, these distortions lead to systematic errors in\nLSS analyses and cosmological parameter estimation. We present a new method\nthat combines linear theory (LT) and a neural network (NN) to mitigate redshift\nspace distortions (RSDs). The hybrid LT+NN approach is trained and validated on\ndark matter halo fields from z = 1 snapshots of the Quijote N-body simulations.\nLT corrects large-scale distortions in the linear regime, while the NN learns\nquasi-linear and small-scale features. The LT correction is applied first, then\nthe NN is trained on the resulting fields to improve accuracy across scales.\nThe method uses a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and yields significant\nperformance gains: approximately 50% improvement over LT alone and 12% over NN\nalone. The reconstructed fields from the LT+NN method show stronger\ncorrelations with the true real-space fields than either LT or NN separately.\nThe hybrid method also improves clustering statistics such as halo-halo and\nhalo-void correlations, with benefits extending to BAO scales. Compared to\nNN-only, it provides better suppression of spurious anisotropies on large and\nquasi-linear scales, as measured by the quadrupole moments of correlation\nfunctions. This work shows that combining a physically motivated dynamical\nmodel with a machine learning algorithm leverages the strengths of both\napproaches. The LT+NN method achieves high accuracy with modest training data\nand computational cost, making it a promising tool for future applications to\nmore realistic galaxy surveys.",

Using Von Neumann entropy as our\nmeasure, we derive precise mathematical relationships for maximum entanglement\nin graph states as a function of qubit number. Our analysis reveals that\nentanglement follows a quadratic relationship with the number of qubits, but\nwith distinct behaviors for odd versus even qubit systems. For odd n-qubit\ngraph states, maximum entanglement follows $E_{\\max} = n^2 - n$, while even\nn-qubit states exhibit higher entanglement with varying formulae depending on\nspecific configurations. Notably, systems with qubit counts that are multiples\nof 12 demonstrate enhanced entanglement properties.

    "abstract": "Accurate preoperative assessment of lymph node (LN) metastasis in rectal\ncancer guides treatment decisions, yet conventional MRI evaluation based on\nmorphological criteria shows limited diagnostic performance. While some\nartificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black\nboxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these\nmodels typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level\ncontext. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven\nRelational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic\ntask from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and\nranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a\npatient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological\nfeatures. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these\nreports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based\non the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a\nretrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of\ndeep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies\nconfirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational\nranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant\nperformance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our\nwork demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning\nthrough a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and\neffective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.",

However, its reliance on equilibrium quantities excludes analysis of\nnonequilibrium dynamics at early times. Most works have thus focused on\nobtaining rates and transition time and path distributions in equilibrium.\nInstead, here we consider early-time nonequilibrium dynamics in a model system\nof a particle with overdamped dynamics hopping over the barrier in a\ndouble-well potential, using the Smoluchowski equation (SE) and stochastic path\nintegral (SPI) mapping of the Langevin equation. We identify several key\ntimescales relevant to nonequilibrium dynamics and quantify them using the SE\nand SPI approaches. The shortest timescale corresponds to equilibration in a\nwell at time $t \\ll \\tau_{\\rm B}$, where $\\tau_{\\rm B}$ is the Brownian\ndiffusion time. The second important timescale is when an inflexion point\nappears in the effective potential constructed from the density at $t\n\\lessapprox \\tau_{\\rm B}$. Shortly after, the existence of a second potential\nwell can be inferred from sufficient sampling of the dynamics. Interestingly,\nthis timescale decreases with increasing barrier height. We find significant\ndeviations from the equilibrium limit unless $t \\gg \\tau_{\\rm B}$. We further\ncalculate \\red{the} density current at the barrier for bistable and asymmetric\npotentials and find that it crosses over to that from equilibrium rate theory\nat a time that does not appear to depend on the barrier height.

    "abstract": "The partially dissipative systems that characterize many physical phenomena\nwere first pointed out by Godunov (1961), then investigated by Friedrichs-Lax\n(1971) who introduced the convex entropy, and later by Shizuta-Kawashima\n(1984,1985) who initiated a simple sufficient criterion ensuring the global\nexistence of smooth solutions and their large-time asymptotics. There has been\nremarkable progress in the past several decades, through various different\nattempts. However, the decay character theory for partially dissipative\nhyperbolic systems remains largely open, as the Fourier transform of Green's\nfunction is generally not explicit in multi-dimensions. In this paper, we\npropose a general $L^p$ energy method and provide the positive answer to the\nunsolved question left in [5]. Under the convex entropy and Shizuta-Kawashima\nconditions, we pinpoint the critical regularity for the global solutions to the\npartially dissipative systems in the hybrid Besov spaces with different\nexponents on conservative and dissipative components in low and high\nfrequencies, from the viewpoint of spectral analysis and the $L^1$ time\nintegrability of Lipschitz bound. Furthermore, a new effective quantity\n$\\Psi(t,x)$ capturing the interaction of conservative and dissipative\ncomponents is introduced, which enables us to establish the sharp\ncharacterization of large-time asymptotic behavior. Finally, we also show that,\nwith faster orders of convergence, the conservative and dissipative components\nof solutions can be asymptotically approximated by new profiles generated from\nparabolic systems subjected to $\\Psi_0$ (the initial effective quantity), in\nthe spirit of Chapman-Enskog expansion.",

Alternatively, some algorithms also exist for the reconfiguration of\nindependent sets in the token sliding paradigm for graph classes with bounded\ndegree or large girth.\n  We show that DSR-TS is W[2]-hard when parameterized $k$, the pathwidth of the\ninstance, and the iteration of the reconfiguration sequence (a recently\nintroduced parameter).

The CFD models\nwere validated against field data collected from a coal slurry pipeline of 128\n$km$ in length, 0.575~$m$ in diameter, achieving an average error of less than\n15\\% for outlet solid concentration over time.

The obtained outcomes indicate that higher water velocity is\npreferred and an increase in water velocity from $1.88~m/s$ to $5.88~m/s$\nreduces the water consumption by $28\\%$. Large bubbles may hinder the flushing\nprocess and increase the water consumption by $23\\%$.

Synchrotron losses may be\nhigher in the emitter if it is separated from the accelerator, but this\nrequires a very hard particle injection spectrum. An accelerator based on an\nultrarelativistic outflow can alleviate these requirements.

    "abstract": "Activation functions are critical to the performance of deep neural networks,\nparticularly in domains such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),\nwhere nonlinearity, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal variability\nposes significant challenges to model accuracy. However, the impact of\nactivation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain\nremains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current\nliterature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific\nactivation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep\nlearning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet,\nMDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset\nrecorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks\nwere trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent\ntraining parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions\nsuch as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly\nused functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the\narchitecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was\nconducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further\nsupporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance\ngains. These findings underscore the importance of selecting proper activation\nfunctions that align with the signal characteristics of fNIRS data.",

While they are characterized by a relatively low parameter\ncount, they still require a considerable number of operations, implying a\nhigher execution time. This problem is exacerbated by the trend towards bigger\nmodels trained on large amounts of data to solve more general tasks, such as\nthe recently introduced task-aware unified source separation (TUSS) model.\nTUSS, which aims to solve audio source separation tasks using a single,\nconditional model, is built upon TF-Locoformer, a TF dual-path model combining\nconvolution and attention layers. The task definition comes in the form of a\nsequence of prompts that specify the number and type of sources to be\nextracted. In this paper, we analyze the design choices of TUSS with the goal\nof optimizing its performance-complexity trade-off.

The\nstarting point is the least square fit of a set of experimental values of\nelastic differential cross sections, varying the relevant optical potential\nparameters. This is done using standard $\\chi^2$ minimization codes, that\nprovide the covariance matrix of the parameters. A maximum likelihood\nexploration of the $\\chi^2$ surface in parameter space allows to determine the\ncovariance matrix of the parameters associated to a contour of a given $\\chi^2$\nvalue. Bayes theorem allows to assign probabilities (p-values) to the regions\nin parameter space, characterized by $\\chi^2$ contours.

    "abstract": "Solving chance-constrained optimal control problems for systems subject to\nnon-stationary uncertainties is a significant challenge.Conventional robust\nmodel predictive control (MPC) often yields excessive conservatism by relying\non static worst-case assumptions, while standard stochastic MPC methods\nstruggle when underlying uncertainty distributions are unknown a priori.This\narticle presents a Risk-Aware Adaptive Robust MPC (RAAR-MPC) framework,a\nhierarchical architecture that systematically orchestrates a novel synthesis of\nproactive, learning-based risk assessment and reactive risk regulation. The\nframework employs a medium-frequency risk assessment engine, which leverages\nGaussian process regression and active learning, to construct a tight,\ndata-driven characterization of the prediction error set from operational\ndata.Concurrently, a low-timescale outer loop implements a self-correcting\nupdate law for an adaptive safety margin to precisely regulate the empirical\nrisk and compensate for unmodeled dynamics.This dual-timescale adaptation\nenables the system to rigorously satisfy chance constraints with a user-defined\nprobability, while minimizing the conservatism inherent in traditional\napproaches.We formally establish that the interplay between these adaptive\ncomponents guarantees recursive feasibility and ensures the closed-loop system\nsatisfies the chance constraints up to a user-defined risk level with high\nprobability.Numerical experiments on a benchmark DC-DC converter under\nnon-stationary parametric uncertainties demonstrate that our framework\nprecisely achieves the target risk level, resulting in a significantly lower\naverage cost compared to state-of-the-art robust and stochastic MPC strategies.",

We introduce\na novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically\ngenerates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of\nconstructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies\nthat boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond\nclassical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary\nmatrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable\nexploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using\nentanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define\nunconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per\nqubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and\nevaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified\n64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently\noutperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing\nconfigurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical\nmodel (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,\nnearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the\nclassical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered\nup to ~20% higher accuracy.

One application is the reconstruction of incomplete or noisy data. Here\na baseline, lightweight convolutional autoencoder is used to examine the\nutility for planetary image reconstruction or inpainting in situations where\nthere is destructive random noise (i.e., either luminance noise with zero\nreturned data in some image pixels, or color noise with random additive levels\nacross pixel channels).

In contrast, neural network models suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting: a significant degradation in performance on previously learned\ntasks when acquiring new information. The Complementary Learning Systems (CLS)\ntheory offers an explanation for this human ability, proposing that the brain\nhas distinct systems for pattern separation (encoding distinct memories) and\npattern completion (retrieving complete memories from partial cues). To capture\nthese complementary functions, we leverage the representational generalization\ncapabilities of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and the robust memory storage\nproperties of Modern Hopfield networks (MHNs), combining them into a neurally\nplausible continual learning model. We evaluate this model on the Split-MNIST\ntask, a popular continual learning benchmark, and achieve close to\nstate-of-the-art accuracy (~90%), substantially reducing forgetting.\nRepresentational analyses empirically confirm the functional dissociation: the\nVAE underwrites pattern completion, while the MHN drives pattern separation. By\ncapturing pattern separation and completion in scalable architectures, our work\nprovides a functional template for modeling memory consolidation,\ngeneralization, and continual learning in both biological and artificial\nsystems.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted\nextensive attentions in the sensing field due to their theoretically ultra-high\nresonance quality factors (Q-factors). Among them, Friedrich-Wintgen (F-W)\nBICs, which arise from the interference between different coupled modes, are\nparticularly promising for acoustic sensing applications owing to the easy\nrealization. Most existing F-W BICs are realized in open systems through the\ninterference between waveguides and resonant cavities. However, with increasing\ndemands for higher resolution and sensitivity in modern chemical and biological\nsensing, the practically measured Q-factors of conventional open-system F-W\nBICs often fall short of expectations.In this work, we introduce F-P resonance\nvia acoustic-solid coupling to explore the formation mechanism and realization\nmethod of high-Q F-W BICs in quasi-closed systems, and further investigate\ntheir application in gas sensing. A coupled resonator model combining elastic\nand acoustic waves in a quasi-closed cavity is first established. Coupled mode\ntheory is employed to calculate the eigenmodes of both localized and radiative\nmodes. Based on this, the Hamiltonian matrix of the coupled system is\nconstructed, from which the acoustic transmission spectrum is derived. The\nresults show that the Q-factor of the F-W BIC induced by acoustic-solid\ncoupling is significantly higher than that of open systems, which is further\nvalidated by experiments.Based on this, a gas concentration sensing technique\nbased on acoustic-solid coupled F-W BIC behavior is developed. A sensing device\nis fabricated accordingly, and gas concentration measurements are carried out.\nExperimental results demonstrate a pronounced response to gases with different\nconcentrations, confirming the feasibility and reliability of this novel gas\nsensing approach.",

Specifically,\nutilizing sparse/incomplete measured data, a time-dependent optimization\nproblem is formulated for determining the expansion coefficients of an\nassociated low-dimensional representation of the stochastic wind field.\nCompared to an alternative, standard, compressive sampling treatment of the\nproblem, the developed methodology exhibits the following advantages. First,\nthe Bayesian formulation enables also the quantification of the uncertainty in\nthe estimates. Second, the requirement in standard CS-based applications for an\na priori selection of the expansion basis is circumvented. Instead, this is\ndone herein in an adaptive manner based on the acquired data. Overall, the\nmethodology exhibits enhanced extrapolation accuracy, even in cases of\nhigh-dimensional data of arbitrary form, and of relatively large extrapolation\ndistances. Thus, it can be used, potentially, in a wide range of wind\nengineering applications where various constraints dictate the use of a limited\nnumber of sensors. The efficacy of the methodology is demonstrated by\nconsidering two case studies. The first relates to the extrapolation of\nsimulated wind velocity records consistent with a prescribed joint\nwavenumber-frequency power spectral density in a three-dimensional domain (2D\nand time).

Quasar catalogues from narrow-band photometric data are used in a\nvariety of applications, including targeting for spectroscopic follow-up,\nmeasurements of supermassive black hole masses, or Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations. Here, we present the final quasar catalogue, including redshift\nestimates, from the miniJPAS Data Release constructed using several flavours of\nmachine-learning algorithms. Methods. In this work, we use a machine learning\nalgorithm to classify quasars, optimally combining the output of 8 individual\nalgorithms. We assess the relative importance of the different classifiers. We\ninclude results from 3 different redshift estimators to also provide improved\nphotometric redshifts. We compare our final catalogue against both simulated\ndata and real spectroscopic data. Our main comparison metric is the $f_1$\nscore, which balances the catalogue purity and completeness. Results. We\nevaluate the performance of the combined algorithm using synthetic data. In\nthis scenario, the combined algorithm outperforms the rest of the codes,\nreaching $f_1=0.88$ and $f_1=0.79$ for high- and low-z quasars (with $z\\geq2.1$\nand $z<2.1$, respectively) down to magnitude $r=23.5$. We further evaluate its\nperformance against real spectroscopic data, finding different performances. We\nconclude that our simulated data is not realistic enough and that a new version\nof the mocks would improve the performance. Our redshift estimates on mocks\nsuggest a typical uncertainty of $\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD} =0.11$, which, according to\nour results with real data, could be significantly smaller (as low as\n$\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}=0.02$). We note that the data sample is still not large\nenough for a full statistical consideration.",

We use updated constraints on the mass, radius, and\ntidal deformability of neutron star (NS) objects and pulsars to examine nuclear\nequations of state (EOS) based on realistic finite-range M3Y nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction, which have been successfully used to describe low- and high-dense\nnuclear matter (NM). We then employ these EOSs to examine the impact of tidal\ndeformability and compactness of NSs on their structure. We found that the EOSs\nfrom CDM3Y-230 to CDM3Y-330 characterized with the saturation incompressibility\n${K}_{0}=230-330$ MeV together yield more limited ranges of tidal deformability\nand radius for NS objects than their experimentally inferred ranges. For light\nNS ($M<\\text{M}_{\\odot}$), both ${k}_{2}$ and $\\mathcal{C}$ decreases upon\ndecreasing the NS mass, which enhances its tidal deformability. The stiffness\nof the NS core matter has shown a minor effect on the tidal deformability of\nsuch NS ($M<\\text{M}_{\\odot}$). An opposite behavior is obtained as an increase\nin the tidal Love number but a decrease in the more effective compactness of NS\n($M>\\text{M}_{\\odot}$), upon increasing (decreasing) the stiffness of the\nemployed EOS (its mass). This appears as enhanced tidal deformability indicated\nat a larger radius for NS of stiffer NM and for the lighter NS above\n$\\text{M}_{\\odot}$. Unified description of some correlations between tidal\ndeformability, tidal Love number, and NS compactness is provided independent of\nthe details of the considered EOS.",

In this work, we study the interplay of collider, direct and\nindirect detection constraints on an extension of the dark Abelian Higgs model\nthat includes a Dirac fermionic DM candidate, $\\chi$. We take into account in a\nconsistent fashion the dilution of the indirect and direct detection signals\nwhen the relic abundance of $\\chi$ is smaller than the total observed DM\ndensity (assuming that it is a subdominant component in those cases). As a\nconsequence, we show that indirect detection constraints cannot probe regions\nwith large kinetic mixing, and direct detection experiments provide the leading\nconstraints in most of the parameter space. Collider searches for the\n(invisibly decaying) vector mediator provide complementary bounds in areas with\nlarge kinetic mixing. We find that the only way to avoid both indirect and\ndirect detection limits is in narrow windows of parameter space close to\n$m_\\chi\\lesssim m_{Z_D}/2$, when $\\chi$ is produced resonantly in the early\nuniverse, and it can constitute all of the DM. For this to happen, a small dark\nsector coupling is required: $\\alpha_D~\\lesssim10^{-3}$ for DM masses below $6$\nGeV, or $\\alpha_D~\\lesssim10^{-5}$ for DM masses larger than $10$ GeV. The\nremaining areas of the parameter space can be probed in a complementary way by\nfuture direct detection experiments (which will narrow down the allowed area\naround the resonant region) and collider searches (which will set limits for\nsmaller values of the kinetic mixing).",

Traditional methods approximate Nash equilibria (NE) using either\nregret-based methods (time-average convergence) or contraction-map-based\nmethods (last-iterate convergence). We propose a new method based on\nHamiltonian dynamics in physics and prove that it can characterize the set of\nNE in a finite (linear) number of iterations of alternating gradient descent in\nthe unbounded setting, modulo degeneracy, a first in online optimization.\nUnlike standard methods for computing NE, our proposed approach can be\nparallelized and works with arbitrary learning rates, both firsts in\nalgorithmic game theory. Experimentally, we support our results by showing our\napproach drastically outperforms standard methods.",

Unstructured\ndata, which lacks a predefined format, encompasses various forms such as\nemails, reports, and scans. It is estimated to constitute approximately 80% of\nenterprise data. Despite the valuable insights it can offer, extracting\nmeaningful information from unstructured data is more complex compared to\nstructured data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has gained popularity for\nautomating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, and reducing errors.\nHowever, RPA is traditionally reliant on structured data, limiting its\napplication to processes involving unstructured documents. This study addresses\nthis limitation by developing the UNstructured Document REtrieval SyStem\n(UNDRESS), a system that uses fuzzy regular expressions, techniques for natural\nlanguage processing, and large language models to enable RPA platforms to\neffectively retrieve information from unstructured documents. The research\ninvolved the design and development of a prototype system, and its subsequent\nevaluation based on text extraction and information retrieval performance.

The model endogenously identifies the worst\nregional Dunkelflaute events, prolonged periods of low wind and solar\navailability, and incorporates multiple extreme weather realizations within a\nsingle optimization run. Results show that system costs rise nonlinearly with\nthe geographic extent of these events: a single worst-case regional disruption\nincreases costs by 9%, but broader disruptions across multiple regions lead to\nmuch sharper increases, up to 51%. As Dunkelflaute conditions extend across\nmost of Europe, additional cost impacts level off, with a maximum increase of\n71%.

While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics\nplans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume\nan idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for\nuncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle\nuncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to\nentry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they\nremain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety\nand cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility\nof natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation.\nIt converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies\nits own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive\nclarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold.

The aim of this paper is to analyse the carbon abundance\ndetermination for the large empirical X-shooter Spectral Library (XSL),\ncommonly used as a benchmark for the development of stellar population models.\nThe analysis was performed over strong molecular CH bands in the G-band region.\nWe used the GAUGUIN automated spectrum synthesis code, and adopted two\ndifferent grids of reference synthetic spectra separately, each with the same\n[C/Fe] abundance coverage. We carried out a detailed comparison between both\ngrids to evaluate the accuracy and the model dependence of the measured [C/Fe]\nabundances. We obtained a large and precise unbiased [C/Fe] abundance catalogue\nfrom both theoretical grids, well distributed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR)\ndiagram and with no trend with the stellar parameters. We also measured\ncompatible values from each independent CH band, with a high-quality [C/Fe]\nabundance estimate for both dwarfs and giants indistinctly. We observed a\ndispersed flat trend around [C/Fe] = 0.0 dex all along the metallicity regime,\nin agreement with some literature studies. However, we reported variations up\nto 0.8 dex in the [C/Fe] composition of the star depending on the adopted grid.\nWe did not find such differences in the $\\alpha$-element measurements. This\nbehaviour implies a strong model dependence in the [C/Fe] abundance estimate.\nPotential sources of error could be associated with the use of spectral\nsynthesis methods to derive stellar carbon abundances in the CH4300A band.\nIntrinsic small differences in the synthetic models over this crowded and\nblended region may induce a large disparity in the precise abundance estimate\nfor any stellar type, leading to inaccurate carbon measurements without being\nnoticed",

This approach allows for improved temporal resolution compared\nto conventional nanosecond diagnostics, enabling measurements of\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ as small as 50 ps, the corresponding $N_H$ reaching down\nto $10^{14} cm^{-3}$. Atomic densities are calibrated by performing identical\nps--TALIF measurements in krypton gas contained in a custom-built low-pressure\ncuvette. Physical mechanisms that may be involved in the TALIF scheme such as\nphotoionisation and/or stimulated emission are also assessed, ensuring reliable\nstudies. The determined $\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and $N_H$ increase with the\nhelium flow rate ($Q_{He}$) in the range $Q_{He}=0.3-1$ slm. Both quantities\nare maximized near the exit nozzle of the $\\mu$APPJ, obtaining values below 400\nps and $6x10^{14} cm^{-3}$, respectively. As the axial distance increases,\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ declines with a rate of $\\approx$65 ps/mm for $Q_{He}=1$\nslm which is about 3 times smaller than for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm. These findings\nreveal a strong correlation between the experimentally-measured\n$\\tau_{eff_{H(n=3)}}$ and the local air entrainment into the jet as indicated\nby their comparison with calculated effective lifetimes based on published\nquenching rates. Furthermore, operating the $\\mu$APPJ in the burst mode allows\nfor the estimation of the residence time ($t_{res}$) of ground state H--atoms\nin the helium gas channel, which is larger for $Q_{He}=0.3$ slm ($t_{res}\n\\approx 1.2 ms$) compared to $Q_{He}=1$ slm ($t_{res} \\approx 0.5 ms$). H-atoms\nconsumption in the gas channel can be affected by diffusion and mechanisms\ninvolving neutral ground-state and metastable species among others.\nFurthermore, based on an error propagation analysis, density uncertainty as\nhigh as 64% (depending on the operating condition) is revealed. This mainly\noriginates in the ratio of the two-photon absorption cross sections of Kr and H\natoms ( $\\sigma^{(2)}Kr$ / $\\sigma^{(2)}H$) which has not yet been measured in\nthe picosecond regime.

Among these, CuInS$_{2}$ QDs have gained significant\nattention owing to their remarkable broadband emission, making them highly\ndesirable for various optoelectronic applications requiring efficient\nluminescent nanomaterials. However, maximizing radiative recombination in\nCuInS$_{2}$ QDs often necessitates minimizing intragap trap states. A common\napproach involves the introduction of Zn during the synthesis, which typically\npromotes the formation of a ZnS shell that passivates the QD surface.\n  Despite its importance, the characterization and quantification of Zn\nincorporation using conventional techniques, such as optical spectroscopy or\nelectron microscopy, remains challenging. In this study, we utilized X-ray\nabsorption spectroscopy (XAS), in both X-ray absorption near-edge structure\n(XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectral ranges,\nto investigate Zn incorporation into CuInS$_{2}$ QDs with element-specific\nprecision. This approach allowed us to detect the formation of a ZnS surface\nshell and to resolve the spatial distribution of Zn atoms within the QD\nlattice, distinguishing between Zn as a substituent, or as an interstitial\ndefect.\n  Additionally, we explored the optical and dynamical properties of CuInS$_{2}$\nQDs using time-resolved optical spectroscopies, particularly in the presence of\nelectron and hole acceptors.

This lack of omni datasets and lightweight,\ncapable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video\nunderstanding.

The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs\nprobing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we\npropose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from\nGemini 2.5 Flash.

Demand-driven\nnavigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on\nimplicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,\ntraditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model\ntraining and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in\nunseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that\nemulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and\nslow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to\nfulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by\nsemantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.\nFurthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising\na Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that\nanalyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously\nimproves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the\ndecision-making process.

However,\nexisting MVS methods often struggle with challenging regions, such as\ntextureless regions and reflective surfaces, where feature matching fails. In\ncontrast, monocular depth estimation inherently does not require feature\nmatching, allowing it to achieve robust relative depth estimation in these\nregions. To bridge this gap, we propose MonoMVSNet, a novel monocular feature\nand depth guided MVS network that integrates powerful priors from a monocular\nfoundation model into multi-view geometry. Firstly, the monocular feature of\nthe reference view is integrated into source view features by the attention\nmechanism with a newly designed cross-view position encoding. Then, the\nmonocular depth of the reference view is aligned to dynamically update the\ndepth candidates for edge regions during the sampling procedure. Finally, a\nrelative consistency loss is further designed based on the monocular depth to\nsupervise the depth prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMonoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU and\nTanks-and-Temples datasets, ranking first on the Tanks-and-Temples Intermediate\nand Advanced benchmarks.

    "abstract": "Progress in high-energy physics has been closely tied to the development of\nhighperformance electromagnetic calorimeters. Recent experiments have\ndemonstrated the possibility to significantly accelerate the development of\nelectromagnetic showers inside scintillating crystals typically used in\nhomogeneous calorimeters based on scintillating crystals when the incident beam\nis aligned with a crystallographic axis to within a few mrad. In particular, a\nreduction of the radiation length has been measured when ultrarelativistic\nelectron and photon beams were incident on a high-Z scintillator crystal along\none of its main axes. Here, we propose the possibility to exploit this physical\neffect for the design of a new type of compact e.m. calorimeter, based on\noriented ultrafast lead tungstate (PWO-UF) crystals, with a significant\nreduction in the depth needed to contain electromagnetic showers produced by\nhigh-energy particles with respect to the state-of-the-art. We report results\nfrom tests of the crystallographic quality of PWO-UF samples via\nhigh-resolution X-ray diffraction and photoelastic analysis. We then describe a\nproof-of-concept calorimeter geometry defined with a Geant4 model including the\nshower development in oriented crystals. Finally, we discuss the experimental\ntechniques needed for the realization of a matrix of scintillator crystals\noriented along a specific crystallographic direction. Since the angular\nacceptance for e.m. shower acceleration depends little on the particle energy,\nwhile the decrease of the shower length remains pronounced at very high energy,\nan oriented crystal calorimeter will open the way for applications at the\nmaximum energies achievable in current and future experiments. Such\napplications span from forward calorimeters, to compact beam dumps for the\nsearch for light dark matter, to source-pointing space-borne {\\gamma}-ray\ntelescopes.",

However, current\nsystolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing\nFlashAttention. Systolic arrays achieve high utilization primarily for\nconsecutive and large matrix multiplications, whereas FlashAttention requires\nfrequent interleaving of matrix multiplications and softmax operations.\n  The frequent data swaps between matrix multiplications on the systolic array\nand softmax operations on external units result in low array utilization.\nMoreover, when these computations run concurrently, the softmax stage contends\nwith matrix multiplication for register file and SRAM ports, further degrading\nperformance.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array\narchitecture that enables the FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely within a\nsingle systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units. At the\ncore of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps\nFlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise\noverlap. This approach significantly improves array utilization while\npreserving the original floating-point operation order to maintain numerical\nstability.\n  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against\nstate-of-the-art commercial accelerators.

    "abstract": "The paper describes the objectives, design and findings of the pre-launch\nground characterisation campaigns of the Euclid infrared detectors. The pixel\nproperties, including baseline, bad pixels, quantum efficiency, inter pixel\ncapacitance, quantum efficiency, dark current, readout noise, conversion gain,\nresponse nonlinearity, and image persistence were measured and characterised\nfor each pixel. We describe in detail the test flow definition that allows us\nto derive the pixel properties and we present the data acquisition and data\nquality check software implemented for this purpose. We also outline the\nmeasurement protocols of all the pixel properties presented and we provide a\ncomprehensive overview of the performance of the Euclid infrared detectors as\nderived after tuning the operating parameters of the detectors. The main\nconclusion of this work is that the performance of the infrared detectors\nEuclid meets the requirements. Pixels classified as non-functioning accounted\nfor less than 0.2% of all science pixels. IPC coupling is minimal and crosstalk\nbetween adjacent pixels is less than 1% between adjacent pixels. 95% of the\npixels show a QE greater than 80% across the entire spectral range of the\nEuclid mission. The conversion gain is approximately 0.52 ADU/e-, with a\nvariation less than 1% between channels of the same detector. The reset noise\nis approximately equal to 23 ADU after reference pixels correction. The readout\nnoise of a single frame is approximately 13 $e^-$ while the signal estimator\nnoise is measured at 7 $e^-$ in photometric mode and 9 $e^-$ in spectroscopic\nacquisition mode. The deviation from linear response at signal levels up to 80\nk$e^-$ is less than 5% for 95% of the pixels. Median persistence amplitudes are\nless than 0.3% of the signal, though persistence exhibits significant spatial\nvariation and differences between detectors.",

    "abstract": "Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for\nreliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to\ncomplex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited\nannotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions\nAdaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity\nNetwork (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically\ncombines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a\nwavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a\nbiologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature\nenhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained\nand continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate\nuncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and\nlightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without\nsacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate\nthat HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an\naverage symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap\nerror (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the\n3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of\n1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different\ndatasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in\nproviding anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor\nsegmentation.",

To make the actual risk associated with the privacy budget more\ntransparent, multiple privacy metrics (PMs) have been proposed to assess the\nprivacy risk of the data.

While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support\ncontestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks\n(EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs\ncan be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability\nproblem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences)\nto achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a\ntopic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation\nattribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic\nargument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing\ninterpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building\non G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the\nedge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach\nexperimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural\ncharacteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer\nperceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.",

Modeled as directed graphs with\nnon-reciprocal hopping, these systems reveal quantized decay charges, defined\nas the sum of decay constants along edges at each node, offering a novel\ntopological invariant. We derive universal conditions for these modes, enabling\nversatile configurations from one-dimensional rings, directed graphs with\ncomplicated connectivity, to higher-dimensional lattices.

However, while 3D objects can be of complex and diverse shapes\nin the real world, existing GS-based methods only limitedly use a single type\nof splatting primitive (Gaussian ellipse or Gaussian ellipsoid) to represent\nobject surfaces during their reconstruction. In this paper, we highlight that\nthis can be insufficient for object surfaces to be represented in high quality.\nThus, we propose a novel framework that, for the first time, enables Gaussian\nSplatting to incorporate multiple types of (geometrical) primitives during its\nsurface reconstruction process. Specifically, in our framework, we first\npropose a compositional splatting strategy, enabling the splatting and\nrendering of different types of primitives in the Gaussian Splatting pipeline.\nIn addition, we also design our framework with a mixed-primitive-based\ninitialization strategy and a vertex pruning mechanism to further promote its\nsurface representation learning process to be well executed leveraging\ndifferent types of primitives. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of our\nframework and its accurate surface reconstruction performance.",

When energy\nis the only conserved quantity, one would expect similar results in the\nanharmonic case, as conjectured for the temperature profile and energy flux.\nHowever, outside the harmonic case, explicit computations are generally no\nlonger possible, thus making a rigorous proof of this hydrodynamic limit\ndifficult. Consequently, we numerically investigate the plausibility of this\nlimit for the particular case of a chain with $\\beta$-FPUT interactions and\nharmonic pinning. We present our simulation results suggesting that the\nconjectured PDE for the limiting temperature profile and Green--Kubo type\nformula for the limiting energy current conjectured are correct. We then use\nthis Green--Kubo type formula to investigate the relationship between the\nenergy current and period of the forcing. This relationship is investigated in\nthe case of significant rate of momentum flip, small rate of momentum flip and\nno momentum flip. We compare the relationship observed in the anharmonic case\nto that of the harmonic case for which explicit formulae are available.",

    "abstract": "In this study, various nanoparticle species-including Au and Gd$_2$O$_3$-were\nirradiated with low-energy gamma rays, such as 59.5 keV photons from\n$^{241}$Am. Pulse-height spectra were recorded using a liquid-scintillation\ncounting system before and after dispersing the nanoparticles into the\nscintillator, and the differences between them were analyzed to infer the\ninteraction outcomes. Gd$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles emitted numerous electrons;\nhowever, under identical experimental conditions, no detectable electron\nemission was observed from Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). Here, \"detectable electron\nemission\" refers to electrons with energies high enough to be registered by the\nliquid-scintillation detector used (approx 100 eV and, more typically, >= 1-2\nkeV); however, it excludes electrons that may be emitted at lower energies.\nThus, a species-dependent radiation-nanoparticle interaction was observed.\nRigorous controls and falsification tests excluded various artefacts-including\ndetector insensitivity, surface contamination, aggregation, quenching, and\nself-absorption-as causes for the absence of detectable electron emission from\nAuNPs. This observation potentially prompts a re-evaluation of the common\nassumption that nanoparticles behave like their bulk counterparts and emit\nelectrons upon gamma-irradiation. Instead, our results suggest that the\ndistinct internal environment of nanoparticles influences their interaction\nwith radiation.

This is known as trajectory\ninference. If the process is differentiation, this amounts to reconstructing\nthe corresponding differentiation tree. One way of doing this in practice is to\nestimate the shortest-path distance between nodes based on cell similarities\nobserved in sequencing data. Recent sequencing techniques make it possible to\nmeasure two types of data: gene expression levels, and RNA velocity, a vector\nthat predicts changes in gene expression. The data then consist of a discrete\nvector field on a (subset of a) Euclidean space of dimension equal to the\nnumber of genes under consideration. By integrating this velocity field, we\ntrace the evolution of gene expression levels in each single cell from some\ninitial stage to its current stage. Eventually, we assume that we have a\nfaithful embedding of the differentiation tree in a Euclidean space, but which\nwe only observe through the curves representing the paths from the root to the\nnodes.

These methods often lack the robustness\nneeded to handle incomplete, heterogeneous, or noisy intelligence, and they\nprovide limited transparency in decision-making-factors that reduce their\neffectiveness in real-world threat environments. To address these limitations,\nwe propose LRCTI, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework designed for\nmulti-step CTI credibility verification. The framework first employs a text\nsummarization module to distill complex intelligence reports into concise and\nactionable threat claims. It then uses an adaptive multi-step evidence\nretrieval mechanism that iteratively identifies and refines supporting\ninformation from a CTI-specific corpus, guided by LLM feedback. Finally, a\nprompt-based Natural Language Inference (NLI) module is applied to evaluate the\ncredibility of each claim while generating interpretable justifications for the\nclassification outcome. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets,\nCTI-200 and PolitiFact show that LRCTI improves F1-Macro and F1-Micro scores by\nover 5%, reaching 90.9% and 93.6%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art\nbaselines.

Due to the low distance to the source and its\nintrinsically high luminosity MAXI J1820$+$070 was observed extensively over\nthis time period, resulting in high-cadence and quasi-simultaneous observations\nacross the electromagnetic spectrum. These data sets provide the opportunity to\nprobe the connection between accretion and the launch of jets in greater detail\nthan for the majority of black hole X-ray binaries. In this work we present\nradio (Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array, MeerKAT), X-ray (Swift), and\noptical (Las Cumbres Observatory) observations of MAXI J1820$+$070 throughout\nits entire outburst, including its initial hard state, subsequent soft state,\nand further hard-state-only re-brightenings (covering March 2018 to August\n2022). Due to the regularity and temporal density of our observational data we\nare able to create a Radio - X-ray - Optical activity plane where we find a\nhigh degree of correlation between the three wave bands during the hard states,\nand observe hysteresis as MAXI J1820$+$070 enters and exits the soft state.\nBased on the morphology of the optical light curves we see evidence for optical\njet contributions during the soft-to-hard state transition, as well as fading\noptical emission well before the hard to soft transition. We establish that the\nremarkably similar profiles of the re-brightening events are broadly consistent\nwith modified disk instability models where irradiation from the inner\naccretion disk is included.",

Real-world flight tests\ndemonstrate that our combination of event camera and low-latency neural network\nis capable of replacing the inertial measurement unit in a traditional flight\ncontrol loop. Furthermore, we investigate the network's generalization across\ndifferent environments, and the impact of memory and different fields of view.\nWhile networks with memory and access to horizon-like visual cues achieve best\nperformance, variants with a narrower field of view achieve better relative\ngeneralization.

    "abstract": "Imputation is an attractive tool for dealing with the widespread issue of\nmissing values. Consequently, studying and developing imputation methods has\nbeen an active field of research over the last decade. Faced with an imputation\ntask and a large number of methods, how does one find the most suitable\nimputation? Although model selection in different contexts, such as prediction,\nhas been well studied, this question appears not to have received much\nattention. In this paper, we follow the concept of Imputation Scores (I-Scores)\nand develop a new, reliable, and easy-to-implement score to rank missing value\nimputations for a given data set without access to the complete data. In\npractice, this is usually done by artificially masking observations to compare\nimputed to observed values using measures such as the Root Mean Squared Error\n(RMSE). We discuss how this approach of additionally masking observations can\nbe misleading if not done carefully and that it is generally not valid under\nMAR. We then identify a new missingness assumption and develop a score that\ncombines a sensible masking of observations with proper scoring rules. As such\nthe ranking is geared towards the imputation that best replicates the\ndistribution of the data, allowing to find imputations that are suitable for a\nrange of downstream tasks. We show the propriety of the score and discuss an\nestimation algorithm involving energy scores. Finally, we show the efficacy of\nthe new score in simulated data examples, as well as a downstream task.",

The 3D MIR integrates a deep learning\n(DL)-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), spatial-physics-based\nconstraints, and optimization techniques. The method operates in three stages:\ni) The CNN model processes the MFI data to predict ($\\ell/z_o$), where $\\ell$\nis the wire length and $z_o$ is the wire's vertical depth beneath the magnetic\nsensors and classify segment type ($c$). ii) By leveraging\nspatial-physics-based constraints, the routine provides initial estimates for\nthe position ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$), length ($\\ell$), current ($I$), and current\nflow direction (positive or negative) of the current segment. iii) An optimizer\nthen adjusts these five parameters ($x_o$, $y_o$, $z_o$, $\\ell$, $I$) to\nminimize the difference between the reconstructed MFI and the actual MFI.

This\nproblem arises in various contexts in computer science and statistics and has\nbeen studied extensively in exact-, parameterized-, approximate-,\nproperty-testing- and other formulations.\n  In this paper, we study pattern matching in a streaming setting, when the\ninput $\\tau$ is revealed sequentially, one element at a time. There is\nextensive work on the space complexity of various statistics in streams of\nintegers. The novelty of our setting is that the input stream is a permutation,\nwhich allows inferring some information about future inputs.

This paper\ninvestigates the optimization of the sensing accuracy of a UAV swarm deployed\nto perform multi-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)\nsensing. In conventional single-baseline InSAR systems, only one synthetic\naperture radar (SAR) antenna pair acquires two SAR images from two distinct\nangles to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) of the target area. However,\nmulti-baseline InSAR extends this concept by aggregating multiple acquisitions\nfrom different angles, thus, significantly enhancing the vertical accuracy of\nthe DEM. The heavy computations required for this process are performed on the\nground and, therefore, the radar data is transmitted in real time to a ground\nstation (GS) via a frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) air-to-ground\nbackhaul link. This work focuses on improving the sensing precision by\nminimizing the height error of the averaged DEM while simultaneously ensuring\nsensing and communication quality-of-service (QoS). To this end, the UAV\nformation, velocity, and communication power allocation are jointly optimized\nusing evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Our approach is benchmarked against\nestablished optimization methods, including genetic algorithms (GAs), simulated\nannealing (SA), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques.

We consider a\nlow-level language with access to an allocator that provides malloc and free\nprimitives in a flat memory model. Pointers are just integers, and as such it\nis trivial to write memory-unsafe programs. The basic intuition of gradual\nallocator independence is that of noninterference, namely that allocators must\nnot influence program execution. This intuition is refined in two important\nways to account for the allocators running out-of-memory and for programs to\nhave pointer-to-integer casts.

However, the recent abundance and precision of\nobservational data shows that this problem is far from solved. A modern\napproach should be developed by using multidimensional models.\n  Aims. We established a new theoretical framework for comparison between\none-dimensional and multidimensional convection models by mapping the\ntwo-dimensional structure of the convective zone and optimizing the modeling\nparameters of the SPHERLS code.\n  Methods. We constructed a series of static envelope models for the same RR\nLyrae stars, but with different horizontal sizes and resolutions. We then used\na series of statistical methods to quantify the sizes of convective eddies, map\nthe energy cascade, and describe the different structural parts of the\nconvective zone. These include integral length scales, Fourier series, and the\ndetermination of the convective flux through horizontal averaging.\n  Results. The structure of the convective zone depends significantly on the\nmodel size, below an angular size of $9^\\circ$. The horizontal resolution of\nearlier studies is adequate to describe the granulation pattern in the large\neddy simulation approach. In quasi-static RR Lyrae stars, the convective zone\nconsists of two distinct dynamically unstable regions that are loosely\nconnected. Approximately half of the convective flux is supplied by the\ntransport of ionization energy in the partial hydrogen ionization zone.\n  Conclusions. The 2D models presented in this work with the described size and\nresolution parameters can be used for comparison against 1D models. The\nstructure of the convective zone urges reconsideration of some recent\napproaches to describe the convective flux currently used in radial stellar\npulsation codes, which will be addressed in a separate paper.",

Using a full microscopic model that includes cascaded Lindblad\ndynamics and chiral emitter-bath couplings, we reveal how the topology of the\nbath mediates nonreciprocal, long-range interactions between emitters.

    "abstract": "Upon the impact of a flat disk on a boiling liquid, i.e., a liquid that is in\nthermal equilibrium with its own vapor, a thin vapor layer is entrapped under\nthe disk. Due to the tendency of vapor to undergo phase change under pressure\nvariation upon impact, the dynamics of this entrapped vapor pocket are\ndifferent from those of a non-condensable air pocket. In this work, we\nexperimentally investigate the dynamics of the entrapped vapor pocket, more\nspecifically its time evolution and its subsequent influence on the\nhydrodynamic loads at different equilibrium ambient temperatures and impact\nvelocities. We find that the retraction of the vapor pocket at high ambient\ntemperature and small impact velocity is slow, occurring from the disk edge,\nand driven by the dynamic pressure $\\rho_{\\text{L}}U_0^2$. In contrast, at\nlower ambient temperatures and large impact velocities, after a short initial\nstage, the vapor pocket will collapse rapidly due to condensation. This\nscenario is confirmed by conducting experiments where, by heating the disk, the\nvapor pocket collapse is observed to slow down. We attribute this to the\nvaporization of liquid near the three-phase contact line region that frustrates\nthe condensation process and reduces the impact pressure on the disk. The\nviolent collapse of the vapor pocket may impart additional instantaneous\nmomentum, but the overall pressure and force impulses are still found to be\nclosely associated with the liquid added mass. Finally, we found that at a high\ntilt angle of the disk, the three-phase contact line movement over the disk\nsurface may hinder the proper entrapment and compression of the vapor pocket,\nwhich results in a lower central impact pressure as rapid condensation at the\ncentral disk region does not occur.",

We\nprovide a rigorous theoretical framework proving the convergence guarantees of\nLyAm in complex, non-convex settings. Extensive experiments on like as CIFAR-10\nand CIFAR-100 show that LyAm consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\noptimizers in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and stability, establishing\nit as a strong candidate for robust deep learning optimization.",

However, existing methods struggle with disentangling\ntargets from anchors in complex multi-anchor queries and resolving\ninconsistencies in spatial descriptions caused by perspective variations. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose ViewSRD, a framework that formulates 3D\nvisual grounding as a structured multi-view decomposition process. First, the\nSimple Relation Decoupling (SRD) module restructures complex multi-anchor\nqueries into a set of targeted single-anchor statements, generating a\nstructured set of perspective-aware descriptions that clarify positional\nrelationships. These decomposed representations serve as the foundation for the\nMulti-view Textual-Scene Interaction (Multi-TSI) module, which integrates\ntextual and scene features across multiple viewpoints using shared, Cross-modal\nConsistent View Tokens (CCVTs) to preserve spatial correlations. Finally, a\nTextual-Scene Reasoning module synthesizes multi-view predictions into a\nunified and robust 3D visual grounding. Experiments on 3D visual grounding\ndatasets show that ViewSRD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,\nparticularly in complex queries requiring precise spatial differentiation.

However, when sensitive attributes such as skin color are continuous,\ndividing into default groups may overlook or obscure the discrimination\nexperienced by certain minority subpopulations. To address this limitation, we\npropose a fairness-based grouping approach for continuous (possibly\nmultidimensional) sensitive attributes. By grouping data according to observed\nlevels of discrimination, our method identifies the partition that maximizes a\nnovel criterion based on inter-group variance in discrimination, thereby\nisolating the most critical subgroups.\n  We validate the proposed approach using multiple synthetic datasets and\ndemonstrate its robustness under changing population distributions - revealing\nhow discrimination is manifested within the space of sensitive attributes.\nFurthermore, we examine a specialized setting of monotonic fairness for the\ncase of skin color. Our empirical results on both CelebA and FFHQ, leveraging\nthe skin tone as predicted by an industrial proprietary algorithm, show that\nthe proposed segmentation uncovers more nuanced patterns of discrimination than\npreviously reported, and that these findings remain stable across datasets for\na given model. Finally, we leverage our grouping model for debiasing purpose,\naiming at predicting fair scores with group-by-group post-processing.

However, due\nto the lack of evaluation benchmarks specifically designed for long video\ngeneration models, the current assessment of these models primarily relies on\nbenchmarks with simple narrative prompts (e.g., VBench). To the best of our\nknowledge, our proposed NarrLV is the first benchmark to comprehensively\nevaluate the Narrative expression capabilities of Long Video generation models.\nInspired by film narrative theory, (i) we first introduce the basic narrative\nunit maintaining continuous visual presentation in videos as Temporal Narrative\nAtom (TNA), and use its count to quantitatively measure narrative richness.\nGuided by three key film narrative elements influencing TNA changes, we\nconstruct an automatic prompt generation pipeline capable of producing\nevaluation prompts with a flexibly expandable number of TNAs.

Decidability of\nthe problem is open in general, with the most notable positive result being a\ndecision procedure for LRS of order at most 4.\n  In this paper we consider a bounded version of the Skolem Problem, in which\nthe input consists of an LRS $\\langle u_n \\rangle_{n=0}^\\infty$ and a bound $N\n\\in \\mathbb N$ (with all integers written in binary), and the task is to\ndetermine whether there exists $n\\in\\{0,\\ldots,N\\}$ such that $u_n=0$.

Although a lot of research has gone into improving\nnetwork architectures and training paradigms, most approaches operate directly\non the raw audio waveform or on general-purpose time-frequency representations.\nWe investigate the use of Sawtooth-Inspired Pitch Estimation (SWIPE) kernels as\nan audio frontend and find that these hand-crafted, task-specific features can\nmake neural pitch estimators more accurate, robust to noise, and more\nparameter-efficient. We evaluate supervised and self-supervised\nstate-of-the-art architectures on common datasets and show that the SWIPE audio\nfrontend allows for reducing the network size by an order of magnitude without\nperformance degradation.

We report\non the detection of a long type-I X-ray burst from this source. We perform a\ndetailed spectroscopic analysis of the long X-ray burst, lasting for $\\sim 600$\ns, seen in the NuSTAR observation carried out on 2022 September. The persistent\nemission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model\n(nthcomp), and the source exhibits a soft spectral state during this\nobservation. The observed burst exhibits a rise time of $\\sim 25$ s and a decay\ntime of $\\sim 282$ s. The time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst shows a\nsignificant departure from a pure thermal spectrum and is described with a\nmodel consisting of a varying-temperature blackbody plus an evolving persistent\nemission component. We observe a significant enhancement in the persistent\nemission during the burst. The enhancement of the pre-burst persistent flux is\npossibly due to Poynting-Robertson drag or coronal reprocessing. At the peak of\nthe burst, the blackbody temperature and the blackbody emitting radius reached\na maximum of $2.10\\pm 0.07$ keV and $5.5\\pm 2.1$ km, respectively. The peak\nflux ($F_{peak}$) during the burst is $\\approx 2.4\\times 10^{-8}$ ergs\ncm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a luminosity of $\\approx 9.7\\times\n10^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$.",

Existing studies often focus on individual neurons, but their\npolysemantic nature makes it difficult to isolate language-specific units from\ncross-lingual representations. To address this, we explore sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) for their ability to learn monosemantic features that represent concrete\nand abstract concepts across languages in LLMs. While some of these features\nare language-independent, the presence of language-specific features remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we introduce SAE-LAPE, a method based on feature\nactivation probability, to identify language-specific features within the\nfeed-forward network. We find that many such features predominantly appear in\nthe middle to final layers of the model and are interpretable. These features\ninfluence the model's multilingual performance and language output and can be\nused for language identification with performance comparable to fastText along\nwith more interpretability.

Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and\nlocal information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods\noften suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between\ncorrect and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address\nthis, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with\ndual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by\nsegregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message\npassing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways,\npreventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination.\nIn addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which\npartitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the\ncandidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which\nalleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments\non various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a\n1.8$\\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.",

These\nregions are kinematically cold (|v| < 40 km/s), prompting the alternative\nhypothesis that the correlation reflects an age bias: planetary systems in\noverdensities are systematically younger and therefore less likely to have\nundergone tidal inspiral and destruction. We test whether the apparent excess\nof HJs in phase space overdensities arises from differences in intrinsic host\nproperties -- mass, metallicity, age -- which may correlate with phase space\ndensity or whether there is evidence for an additional environmental effect. We\nderive homogeneous estimates for the mass, metallicity, and age of\nplanet-hosting stars using 2MASS and Gaia DR3 photometry, parallaxes, and\nself-consistent spectroscopic and spectrophotometric observables. In a sample\nof 2265 confirmed exoplanet hosts, we find a significant relative excess of HJs\norbiting stars in overdense regions. However, we also find that overdensities\npreferentially host younger, more massive, and more metal-rich stars compared\nto underdensities. After correcting for these differences, either by detrending\nthe phase space density against age or by matching host properties across\nsubsamples, we find no significant differences in the HJ populations between\nover- and underdense regions. Our results suggest that the previously reported\ncorrelation between HJ occurrence and phase space density is driven by\nunderlying differences in host star demographics rather than an intrinsic\nenvironmental effect.",

Since some applications\nfavor straight edges, we also study two problem variants in which the output\nregions must be polygons, but are not restricted to have boundaries from a\nfixed subdivision. In the first variant, region vertices must lie on the\nboundaries of the input polygons. The second variant requires them to be\nvertices of the input polygons.

This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,\noften stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is\ndifficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these\nlatent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support\nfor psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese\nparent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on\nideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a\nRole-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes\ndialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,\ndescribe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual\nattributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these\noutputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert\nagents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable\nfeedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show\nthat the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate\naccuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.\nMoreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited\nsigns of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the\nframework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family\ninteractions.",

Additionally, we identify\ntwo significant $\\gamma$-ray excesses outside the remnant, including a\npreviously unreported source to the south. These features are likely produced\nby cosmic rays that have escaped Puppis A and are interacting with nearby dense\nmolecular material. From this extended emission, we estimate the total energy\nin escaping cosmic rays to be $W_{CR} \\sim 1.5 \\times 10^{49}$ erg, providing\nimportant constraints on cosmic-ray propagation around the remnant.",

While existing methods attempt to address various\nincomplete multimodal scenarios by balancing the training of each modality\ncombination through additional gradients, these approaches face a critical\nlimitation: training gradients from different modality combinations conflict\nwith each other, ultimately degrading the performance of the final prediction\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a unimodal decoupled dynamic low-rank\nadaptation method based on modality combinations, named MCULoRA, which is a\nnovel framework for the parameter-efficient training of incomplete multimodal\nlearning models. MCULoRA consists of two key modules, modality combination\naware low-rank adaptation (MCLA) and dynamic parameter fine-tuning (DPFT). The\nMCLA module effectively decouples the shared information from the distinct\ncharacteristics of individual modality combinations. The DPFT module adjusts\nthe training ratio of modality combinations based on the separability of each\nmodality's representation space, optimizing the learning efficiency across\ndifferent modality combinations. Our extensive experimental evaluation in\nmultiple benchmark datasets demonstrates that MCULoRA substantially outperforms\nprevious incomplete multimodal learning approaches in downstream task accuracy.",

This review examines the emerging role of\nsimulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a\nfocus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as\nnormalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive\noverview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based\ninference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio\nestimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency\nmodels. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse\ngravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter\nestimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and\nconducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed\nimprovements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their\nmodel-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to\ntheir widespread adoption.

The present work aims to analyze the characteristics of ZLK\noscillations within this extended framework, focusing on phase-space\nstructures, the location of ZLK center, the maximum eccentricity reached, the\nboundaries of librating cycles, and the critical inclination required to\ntrigger ZLK resonance. Under the extended Hamiltonian, we introduce the Lidov\nintegral C_ZLK, which is a combination of the Hamiltonian and the z-component\nof angular momentum, to characterize the modified ZLK properties. It is found\nthat the librating and circulating cycles are separated by C_ZLK=0, which is\nconsistent with the classical theory. Furthermore, we derive analytical\nexpressions of these ZLK properties using perturbation techniques. Analytical\npredictions are compared to numerical results, showing an excellent agreement\nbetween them.

Specifically, we realize the efficient\nverification with a favorable scaling of the required number of copies versus\ninfidelity as $-1.39$, outperforming the standard quantum limit of $-2$.\nMeanwhile, a fidelity of $97.07(\\pm 0.26)\\%$ via direct estimation is achieved\nusing only $9$ measurement settings and $10^4$ samples, which is independently\nconfirmed by quantum state tomography to be $98.58(\\pm 0.12)\\%$ with\napproximately $10^6$ measurements. This work presents the first experimental\ndemonstration of QSV actively assisted with state preparation, establishing it\nas a powerful and resource-efficient alternative to full tomography for\nreal-time quantum state engineering.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural\nnetwork-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these\nmodels have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most\nexisting approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the\nconstruction of a separate model for each time series, which results in\nsubstantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing\npenalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal\nrelationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural\nGranger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model\nand applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and\noutput to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific\ntime series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures\nsuch as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical\nsimulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC\noutperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational\noverhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder\nurothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in\nreconstructing gene regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on global navigation\nsatellite system (GNSS) pseudorange measurements for accurate real-time\nlocalization and navigation. However, this dependence exposes them to\nsophisticated spoofing threats, where adversaries manipulate pseudoranges to\ndeceive UAV receivers. Among these, drift-evasive spoofing attacks subtly\nperturb measurements, gradually diverting the UAVs trajectory without\ntriggering conventional signal-level anti-spoofing mechanisms. Traditional\ndistributional shift detection techniques often require accumulating a\nthreshold number of samples, causing delays that impede rapid detection and\ntimely response. Consequently, robust temporal-scale detection methods are\nessential to identify attack onset and enable contingency planning with\nalternative sensing modalities, improving resilience against stealthy\nadversarial manipulations. This study explores a Bayesian online change point\ndetection (BOCPD) approach that monitors temporal shifts in value estimates\nfrom a reinforcement learning (RL) critic network to detect subtle behavioural\ndeviations in UAV navigation. Experimental results show that this temporal\nvalue-based framework outperforms conventional GNSS spoofing detectors,\ntemporal semi-supervised learning frameworks, and the Page-Hinkley test,\nachieving higher detection accuracy and lower false-positive and false-negative\nrates for drift-evasive spoofing attacks.",

This\nmechanism provides a portal between the dark sector and visible matter. In this\nstudy, we present a procedure to derive theoretical upper bounds on the kinetic\nmixing parameter $\\varepsilon^2(M_U)$ by analyzing dilepton spectra from\nheavy-ion collisions across a broad energy range, from SIS to LHC energies. Our\nanalysis is based on the microscopic Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD)\ntransport approach, which successfully reproduces the measured dilepton spectra\nin $p+p$, $p+A$, and $A+A$ collisions across the same energy range. Besides the\ndilepton channels resulting from interactions and decays of Standard Model\nparticles (such as mesons and baryons), the PHSD has been extended to include\nthe decay of hypothetical dark photons into dileptons, $U \\to e^+ e^-$. The\nproduction of these dark photons occurs via Dalitz decays of $\\pi^0$, $\\eta$,\n$\\omega$, $\\eta^{\\prime}$, and $\\Delta$ resonances; direct decays of $\\rho$,\n$\\omega$, and $\\phi$; the kaon mode $K^+ \\to \\pi^+ U$; and thermal $q\\bar q$\nannihilation in the quark-gluon plasma.

    "abstract": "In recent years, contrastive learning has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance in the territory of self-supervised representation learning. Many\nprevious works have attempted to provide the theoretical understanding\nunderlying the success of contrastive learning. Almost all of them rely on a\ndefault assumption, i.e., the label consistency assumption, which may not hold\nin practice (the probability of failure is called labeling error) due to the\nstrength and randomness of common augmentation strategies, such as random\nresized crop (RRC). This paper investigates the theoretical impact of labeling\nerror on the downstream classification performance of contrastive learning. We\nfirst reveal several significant negative impacts of labeling error on\ndownstream classification risk. To mitigate these impacts, data dimensionality\nreduction method (e.g., singular value decomposition, SVD) is applied on\noriginal data to reduce false positive samples, and establish both theoretical\nand empirical evaluations. Moreover, it is also found that SVD acts as a\ndouble-edged sword, which may lead to the deterioration of downstream\nclassification accuracy due to the reduced connectivity of the augmentation\ngraph. Based on the above observations, we give the augmentation suggestion\nthat we should use some moderate embedding dimension (such as $512, 1024$ in\nour experiments), data inflation, weak augmentation, and SVD to ensure large\ngraph connectivity and small labeling error to improve model performance.",

The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate\nturbulence-driving mechanisms in the outer disk region. Since the VSI requires\nrapid gas cooling, dust grains in disks can influence and potentially control\nVSI-driven turbulence. However, VSI-driven turbulence has strong vertical\nmotion, causing vertical dust diffusion. As a result, it remains unclear how\nturbulent structures and dust distributions form. We aim to clarify whether the\nVSI can achieve a quasi-steady dust profile under cooling rate evolution\nassociated with turbulently diffusing dust. We also elucidate the dependence of\nthe dust size and dust-to-gas mass ratio on the realization and persistence of\nthe equilibrium state. We perform global two-dimensional hydrodynamical\nsimulations of an axisymmetric disk to investigate how the VSI drives\nturbulence and maintains a balance between dust settling and diffusion. These\nsimulations account for the dynamic interplay between dust distribution,\ncooling rates, and turbulence. We find that VSI mixing, dust settling, and\nlocal cooling reach an equilibrium, forming a thick dust layer with a\ndimensionless vertical mixing coefficient of approximately 10^{-3}. The ability\nof the VSI to sustain this state also depends on the dust size and dust-to-gas\nmass ratio. Larger grains or lower mass ratios weaken turbulence, leading to\ndust settling. The condition of equilibrium state existence is consistent with\nthe prediction of the semi-analytic model presented by Fukuhara & Okuzumi\n(2024). Our results indicate that efficient turbulent dust mixing and efficient\ncooling can occur simultaneously. They also imply that turbulence in\nVSI-dominated disks has different intensity levels depending on the grain size.\nThis suggests that the efficiency of dust growth can depend on the VSI in\nprotoplanetary disks.",

    "abstract": "In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum\ndelay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is\ncrucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an\nArithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to\nperform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger,\nsynchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum\nclock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static\nTiming Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can\nbe determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead\nto suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In\nthis work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum\ndelay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally\nhard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring\nextremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem\ninto ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address\ncomplex problems in hardware design.",

Our focus is primarily on\npositive $2\\times2$ block operator matrices in Hilbert spaces. Subsequently, we\nexamine the analogous problem for operators that attain their minimum modulus\non every nonzero closed subspace; these are referred to as absolutely minimum\nattaining operators (or $\\mathcal{AM}$-operators, in short). We provide\nconditions under which these operators belong to the operator norm closure of\nthe above two classes. In addition, we give a characterization of idempotent\noperators that fall into these three classes. Finally, we illustrate our\nresults through examples that involve concrete operators.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, landslide disasters have reported frequently due to the\nextreme weather events of droughts, floods , storms, or the consequence of\nhuman activities such as deforestation, excessive exploitation of natural\nresources. However, automatically observing landslide is challenging due to the\nextremely large observing area and the rugged topography such as mountain or\nhighland. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end deep-learning-based model\nwhich explores the remote sensing images for automatically observing landslide\nevents. By considering remote sensing images as the input data, we can obtain\nfree resource, observe large and rough terrains by time. To explore the remote\nsensing images, we proposed a novel neural network architecture which is for\ntwo tasks of landslide detection and landslide segmentation. We evaluated our\nproposed model on three different benchmark datasets of LandSlide4Sense, Bijie,\nand Nepal. By conducting extensive experiments, we achieve F1 scores of 98.23,\n93.83 for the landslide detection task on LandSlide4Sense, Bijie datasets; mIoU\nscores of 63.74, 76.88 on the segmentation tasks regarding LandSlide4Sense,\nNepal datasets. These experimental results prove potential to integrate our\nproposed model into real-life landslide observation systems.",

Our approach is efficient in terms of the number of queries to the\nblock encoding of a Hamiltonian. Also, our approach can avoid Suzuki-Trotter\ndecomposition. We constructed quantum circuits for GQSP-based quantum power\nmethods, estimated the number of queries, and numerically verified that this\nframework works. We additionally benchmark various quantum power methods with\nmolecular Hamiltonians and demonstrate that Quantum Power Lanczos converges\nfaster and more reliably than standard Quantum Power Iteration, while Quantum\nInverse Iteration outperforms existing inverse iteration variants based on\ntime-evolution operators. We also show that the Quantum Folded Spectrum Method\ncan obtain excited states without variational optimization. Overall, our\nresults indicate that GQSP-based implementations of power methods combine\nscalability, flexibility, and robust convergence, paving the way for practical\ninitial state preparations on fault-tolerant quantum devices.",

    "abstract": "We present a new algorithm for integration-by-parts (IBP) reduction of\nFeynman integrals with high powers of numerators or propagators, a demanding\ncomputational step in evaluating multi-loop scattering amplitudes. The\nalgorithm starts with solving syzygy equations in individual sectors to produce\nIBP operators that turn seed integrals into IBP equations without artificially\nraised propagator powers. The IBP operators are expressed in terms of\nindex-shift operators and number operators. We perform row reduction to\nsystematically reshuffle the IBP operators and expose reduction rules with\nsymbolic dependence on the powers of propagators and numerators. When this is\ninsufficient, we produce more symbolic reduction rules by directly solving the\nlinear system of IBP equations in which some propagator/numerator powers are\nkept symbolic. This linear system is kept small, as the equations are generated\nfrom a small set of seed integrals in the neighborhood of the target integral.\nWe stress-test our algorithm against two highly non-trivial examples, namely\nrank-20 integrals for the double box with an external mass and the massless\npentabox. As an application, we revisit the IBP reduction in a calculation of\nscattering amplitudes for spinning black hole binary systems, which involves\ntwo-loop Feynman integrals with complexity greater than 20, and achieve much\nfaster IBP reduction than that of the original calculation.",

The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely\nresembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation\nlevels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the\ntroposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere\nremains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore\nmicrobial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to\nastrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in\naccess and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE\n(Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne\npayload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them\nin conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and\ndesigned in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main\npayload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that\ndetermines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed\nduring flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control)\nto monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS\ntrackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once\nsampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload.\nUpon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be\nsent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the\npresence and nature of collected material.",

Terahertz (THz) band-enabled simultaneous wireless\ninformation and power transfer (SWIPT) systems offer ultra-high data rates and\nexpansive bandwidth. However, THz waves are inherently susceptible to severe\npath loss and beam misalignment due to their narrow-beam characteristics. In\nthis context, this paper proposes a reconfigurable intelligent\nsurface(RIS)-assisted transmitter architecture for the THz-SWIPT system, which\nenables end-to-end self-alignment for steady-state transmission. The proposed\nsystem incorporates phase conjugate circuits to achieve self-aligned\nbeamforming, facilitating the dynamic tracking of mobile IoT devices without\nthe need for beam training. Additionally, active amplification within the RIS\narrays compensates for cascaded channel attenuation through an iterative power\ncycle, thereby enhancing the energy transmission efficiency. Theoretical models\nand simulations indicate that the proposed system significantly mitigates\nsidelobe interference, achieving a transmission efficiency of up to 73.26% over\na 2 meter distance with self-alignment.",

SN 2024abfo is the seventh SN IIb with a\ndirect progenitor detection. We find that the position of the supernova in our\nERIS adaptive optics imaging agrees with the progenitor position in archival\nHST imaging to within 19 mas. The progenitor SED is consistent with an A5\ngiant. Single star models predict an initial mass in the range 11 to 15 solar\nmasses, while the most probable binary model is a 12+1.2 solar mass system with\nan initial period of 1.73 years. We also find significant evidence for\nvariability of the progenitor candidate in the years prior to core-collapse. SN\n2024abfo is the least luminous SN IIb with a direct progenitor detections. At\nlate times the r-band light curve decays more slowly than the comparison SNe,\nwhich may be due to increased gamma-ray trapping. Similar to SN 2008ax, SN\n2024abfo does not show a prominent double-peaked light curve. Our semi-analytic\nlight curve modelling shows that this may be due to a very low mass of hydrogen\nin the outer envelope. Spectrally, SN 2024abfo is most similar to SN 2008ax at\nearly times while at later times (80 days) it appears to show persistent Halpha\nabsorption compared to the comparison sample. We prefer a binary system to\nexplain the supernova and its progenitor, although we are unable to rule out\nsingle-star models. We recommend late-time observations to search for a binary\ncompanion and signatures of CSM-interaction. The absence of these features\nwould support the hypothesis that SN 2024abfo resulted from a system which\nunderwent a period of binary mass transfer well before (1000 yr) the explosion,\nresulting in a low-mass hydrogen-rich envelope.",

In particular, models based on\na recursive, autoregressive-type structure such as the well-known\ninteger-valued autoregressive (INAR) models are very popular in practice. The\ndistribution of such INAR models is fully determined by a vector of\nautoregressive binomial thinning coefficients and the discrete innovation\ndistribution. While fully parametric estimation techniques for these models are\nmostly covered in the literature, a semi-parametric approach allows for\nconsistent and efficient joint estimation of the model coefficients and the\ninnovation distribution without imposing any parametric assumptions. Although\nthe limiting distribution of this estimator is known, which, in principle,\nenables asymptotic inference and INAR model diagnostics on the innovations, it\nis cumbersome to apply in practice.\n  In this paper, we consider a corresponding semi-parametric INAR bootstrap\nprocedure and show its joint consistency for the estimation of the INAR\ncoefficients and for the estimation of the innovation distribution. We discuss\ndifferent application scenarios that include goodness-of-fit testing,\npredictive inference and joint dispersion index analysis for count time series.\nIn simulations, we illustrate the finite sample performance of the\nsemi-parametric INAR bootstrap using several innovation distributions and\nprovide real-data applications.",

Their inherent\nambiguity or similarity, coupled with the lack of explicit definitions, makes\nthem a fundamental bottleneck. These issues not only limit the design of\ntargeted learning strategies but also diminish the model's robustness under\nclothing or viewpoint changes. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmultimodal-guided Hard Sample Generation and Learning (HSGL) framework, which\nis the first effort to unify textual and visual modalities to explicitly\ndefine, generate, and optimize hard samples within a unified paradigm. HSGL\ncomprises two core components: (1) Dual-Granularity Hard Sample Generation\n(DGHSG), which leverages multimodal cues to synthesize semantically consistent\nsamples, including both coarse- and fine-grained hard positives and negatives\nfor effectively increasing the hardness and diversity of the training data. (2)\nHard Sample Adaptive Learning (HSAL), which introduces a hardness-aware\noptimization strategy that adjusts feature distances based on textual semantic\nlabels, encouraging the separation of hard positives and drawing hard negatives\ncloser in the embedding space to enhance the model's discriminative capability\nand robustness to hard samples. Extensive experiments on multiple CC-ReID\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the\npotential of multimodal-guided hard sample generation and learning for robust\nCC-ReID.

In this work, we\nsystematically analyzed the Swift/XRT data of long GRBs with plateau emission\nthat were detected before 2023 December, and estimated the physical parameters\nby considering the $R/I$ evolutionary effects. We found that neglecting the\n$R/I$ evolutionary effects can lead to systematic overestimation or\nunderestimation of magnetar parameters such as $B_p$, $P_0$, and $\\epsilon$\nfrom 20\\% to 50\\%. We also found that some tight correlations, which can be\napproximately expressed as $\\epsilon\\propto P_0^{1.57\\pm0.22}$,\n$\\epsilon\\propto B_p^{0.97\\pm0.13}$, $B_p\\propto P_0^{1.30\\pm0.16}$, $E_{\\rm\nwind}\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{0.83\\pm0.07}(E_{\\rm jet}^{0.76\\pm0.06})$,\n$P_0\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{-0.29\\pm0.03}(E_{\\rm jet}^{-0.26\\pm0.02})$,\n$B_p\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{-0.58\\pm0.06}(E_{\\rm jet}^{-0.55\\pm0.05})$, and\n$\\epsilon\\propto E_{\\rm jet,iso}^{-0.55\\pm0.07}(E_{\\rm jet}^{-0.52\\pm0.06})$\nfor our selected EoSs. The universal correlations suggest that a nascent\nmagnetar with the faster $P_0$, lower $B_p$, and lower $\\epsilon$ are more\ninclined to power a more energetic GRB jet, and the $\\epsilon$ and $P_0$ of\nnewborn magnetar are likely to originate from the magnetically induced\ndistortion and correspond to the equilibrium spin period as a result of\ninteraction between the magnetar and its accretion disk, respectively. Finally,\nwe found that the GW signals from the remnants of those GW-dominated GRBs with\nredshift measurements cannot reach aLIGO sensitivity threshold, and only two\ncases (GRBs 150323A and 170607A) can reach ET sensitivity threshold.

Among various candidates,\nself-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) remain highly promising due to\ntheir ability to emit coherent and indistinguishable photons, as well as their\ncompatibility with photonic integration. In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of post-growth rapid thermal annealing (RTA) on the quantum optical\nproperties of single self-assembled QDs embedded in a p-i-n diode structure.\nThe annealing process induces a controlled blueshift of the emission wavelength\nby promoting Ga in-diffusion and intermixing. Using resonance fluorescence\nmeasurements at cryogenic temperatures (4.2 K), we investigate the\nsingle-photon statistics, the emission linewidths, and coherence time $T_2$ of\nthe emitted photons. Our results show that, despite the high annealing\ntemperature of $760^\\circ$C, the process does not degrade the optical quality\nof the quantum dots strongly. Instead, we observe single-photon emission with\nnear transform-limited linewidths, where the dephasing time $T_2$ is only a\nfactor 1.5 above the Fourier-limit $T_2=2T_1$. These findings demonstrate that\nrapid thermal annealing (RTA) serves as an effective tuning method that\npreserves the key single-photon emission properties and may help reduce\nundesirable effects such as non-radiative Auger recombination in quantum\nphotonic applications.",

To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves\nup to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior\nbaseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and\nby 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of\nharmful content in the jailbreak prompt.

    "abstract": "Recently, several studies have indicated that data poisoning attacks pose a\nsevere security threat to deep learning-based (DL-based) code search models.\nAttackers inject carefully crafted malicious patterns into the training data,\nmisleading the code search model to learn these patterns during training.\nDuring the usage of the poisoned code search model for inference, once the\nmalicious pattern is triggered, the model tends to rank the vulnerability code\nhigher. However, existing detection methods for data poisoning attacks on\nDL-based code search models remain insufficiently effective. To address this\ncritical security issue, we propose MT4DP, a Data Poisoning Attack Detection\nFramework for DL-based Code Search Models via Metamorphic Testing. MT4DP\nintroduces a novel Semantically Equivalent Metamorphic Relation (SE-MR)\ndesigned to detect data poisoning attacks on DL-based code search models.\nSpecifically, MT4DP first identifies the high-frequency words from search\nqueries as potential poisoning targets and takes their corresponding queries as\nthe source queries. For each source query, MT4DP generates two semantically\nequivalent follow-up queries and retrieves its source ranking list. Then, each\nsource ranking list is re-ranked based on the semantic similarities between its\ncode snippets and the follow-up queries. Finally, variances between the source\nand re-ranked lists are calculated to reveal violations of the SE-MR and warn\nthe data poisoning attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MT4DP\nsignificantly enhances the detection of data poisoning attacks on DL-based code\nsearch models, outperforming the best baseline by 191% on average F1 score and\n265% on average precision.

Both ghost types exhibit a characteristic morphology and are\noffset from the originating stars. The offsets are well modelled using 2D\npolynomials, with only stars brighter than approximately 10 magnitudes in each\nfilter producing significant ghost contributions. The masking radii for these\nghosts depend on both the source-star brightness and the filter wavelength,\nranging from 20 to 40 pixels. We present the final relations and models used in\nthe near-infrared (NIR) data pipeline to mask these ghosts for Euclid's Quick\nData Release (Q1).",

As the expectations for precision,\nautomation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are\nincreasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress\nin computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect\ndetection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant\ndevelopment has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection\nframeworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and\nfacilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a\ncohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains\nelusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both\nclosed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D\nmodalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the\nrising prominence of open-set techniques.

This method follows the principles of transfer\nlearning by enabling generalization across different datasets through\nphysics-informed adaptation. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by\ntransferring a pre-trained model from a rectangular plate dataset to a violin\ntop plate dataset, where it shows improved reconstruction accuracy compared to\nthe pre-trained model and delivers performance comparable to that of\nCompressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM).

To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse\nviews and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian\nSplatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key\ninsight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling\nfocused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate\nartifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,\nensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.\nFurthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the\nreconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and\nchain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.\nTRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it\nconsistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based\nstate-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean\nabsolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,\ndespite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\\delta} < 2.5 cm\naccuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.\nCode and more results are available at https://jeongyun0609.github.io/TRAN-D/.",

In binary\nsystems, tidal forces and magnetic interactions can further shape the magnetic\ngeometry. We report a longitudinal preference of star spots, chromospheric\nactivities, and flares in the active single-lined spectroscopic PMS binary\nsystem V2279 Cyg, based on long-term photometric observations from\n\\textit{Kepler} and \\textit{TESS} alongside spectroscopic data from LAMOST. The\nsystem is classified as a weak-line T Tauri binary, with component masses\nestimated at 0.86 $M_\\odot$ and 0.27 $M_\\odot$. V2279 Cyg's nearly circular\norbit is synchronized with its 4.126-day rotational period. Observations reveal\nlarge star spot regions clustered near the far-side hemisphere. Spectroscopic\ndata show strong, double-peak H$\\alpha$ emission, the strength of which is\nhighly correlated with star spot distribution, indicating the presence of an\nactive longitude on the primary star. We also mapped the prominence structure\nco-rotating with the primary star, suggesting a dense structure close to the\nnear-side hemisphere. Furthermore, we identify an inactive longitude of flares\nduring the 4-year \\textit{Kepler} observations, where the frequency of flare\nactivity is significantly reduced after the superior conjunction, marking the\nfirst such identification in active binary systems. Additionally, a white light\nsuperflare, releasing energy of $2.5 \\times 10^{37}$ erg, was detected in\n\\textit{TESS} observations. These findings provide valuable insights into the\nmagnetic field geometry and dynamo processes in PMS binaries, underscoring the\ncritical role of tidal interactions in shaping magnetic activities.",

In this paper we consider a sequence\nconsisting of two segments, that leads to an uncertainty in the determining of\nabsorption - one value of the Q parameter corresponds to two values of the\nnon-reddened color index. We propose a method to select a segment of the\nzero-reddening sequence for the main sequence stars of the cluster. The method\nis based on the difference in the position of stars of different segments in\nthe cluster luminosity function. To test the proposed method, we simulate the\nluminosity functions of clusters with the non-uniform absorption distribution\nin the cluster region. With the typical absorption values in embedded clusters,\nabout 10 % of stars are erroneously assigned, but in some cases this fraction\ncan reach 20 %. Thus, despite the fact that irregular absorption distorts the\ndistribution of stars of different segments on the cluster luminosity function,\nour method allows to separate stars with an error of no more than 20 %.",

    "abstract": "Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as\nthe growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially\nincreases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency\ndivision duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused\non CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining\nmomentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced\nstandards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited\nbeamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such\nconstraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce\nthe concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS),\nwhich jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data\nthroughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a\nstandards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by\ntreating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling\nefficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results\nusing ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed\nmethod, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.",

    "abstract": "Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is a powerful tool for addressing a\nwide range of real-world problems, but it lacks a clear structure for comparing\ninstances. A reliable similarity metric could establish meaningful\nrelationships between instances, enabling more effective evaluation of instance\nset heterogeneity and providing better guidance to solvers, particularly when\nmachine learning is involved. Existing similarity metrics often lack precision\nin identifying instance classes or rely heavily on labeled data, which limits\ntheir applicability and generalization. To bridge this gap, this paper\nintroduces the first mathematical distance metric for MILP instances, derived\ndirectly from their mathematical formulations. By discretizing right-hand\nsides, weights, and variables into classes, the proposed metric draws\ninspiration from the Earth mover's distance to quantify mismatches in\nweight-variable distributions for constraint comparisons. This approach\nnaturally extends to enable instance-level comparisons. We evaluate both an\nexact and a greedy variant of our metric under various parameter settings,\nusing the StrIPLIB dataset. Results show that all components of the metric\ncontribute to class identification, and that the greedy version achieves\naccuracy nearly identical to the exact formulation while being nearly 200 times\nfaster.

In contrast,\nsymmetric bidirectional input yields genuine log-normal statistics across all\ntime scales. These findings are validated using two complementary disorder\nmodels--delta-correlated Gaussian noise and piecewise-constant\nfluctuations--demonstrating that the observed statistics are robust and\ngoverned by input symmetry.

However,\nachieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian\nSplatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently\nambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these\nlimitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that\nenables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a\nrobust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction\n(3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model\nview-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and\nconsistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a\nregularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional\nregularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled\nLatent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality\npart-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region\nwhile preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as\nGaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond\nthe existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local\n3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects\nqualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and\nflexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS)\nfingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its\ncompatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve\naccuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but\nthey assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to\nincorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of\nreal-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous\nmobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS\nreadings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models\nby encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal\nrelationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise\ndistributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded\naccuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these\nchallenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive\ngraph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor\nstate-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to\nmitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces\n1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a\nnovel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind\nspot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic\ngraph adaptation.

However,\nas computing demands continue to increase in size and speed, these wired\ninterconnects can become longer and less effective. One possible solution is to\nenhance the wired interconnects with short-range wireless communication (SRWC),\nwhich offers flexible resource allocation and the ability to broadcast data.\nHowever, implementing SRWC inside a computer chassis presents challenges due to\nmultiple scattering. This scattering stretches the channel impulse response\n(CIR), leading to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and limiting data rates. To\naddress this issue, we propose transforming the computer chassis into a smart\nradio environment by utilizing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The\nRIS elements adjust the phase of reflected waves so that the multipath\ncomponents combine at the receiver in a way that creates a pulse-like CIR. This\napproach has been experimentally validated within a typical computer chassis.\nThe results of this study pave the way for integrating RIS-enabled SRWC to\nenhance wireless links in both current and future data processing units.",

    "abstract": "The kinematics analysis of foot-ankle complex during gait is essential for\nadvancing biomechanical research and clinical assessment. Collecting accurate\nsurface geometry data from the foot and ankle during dynamic gait conditions is\ninherently challenging due to swing foot occlusions and viewing limitations.\nThus, this paper introduces FootGait3D, a novel multi-view dataset of\nhigh-resolution ankle-foot surface point clouds captured during natural gait.\nDifferent from existing gait datasets that typically target whole-body or\nlower-limb motion, FootGait3D focuses specifically on the detailed modeling of\nthe ankle-foot region, offering a finer granularity of motion data. To address\nthis, FootGait3D consists of 8,403 point cloud frames collected from 46\nsubjects using a custom five-camera depth sensing system. Each frame includes a\ncomplete 5-view reconstruction of the foot and ankle (serving as ground truth)\nalong with partial point clouds obtained from only four, three, or two views.\nThis structured variation enables rigorous evaluation of 3D point cloud\ncompletion methods under varying occlusion levels and viewpoints. Our dataset\nis designed for shape completion tasks, facilitating the benchmarking of\nstate-of-the-art single-modal (e.g., PointTr, SnowflakeNet, Anchorformer) and\nmulti-modal (e.g., SVDFormer, PointSea, CSDN) completion networks on the\nchallenge of recovering the full foot geometry from occluded inputs. FootGait3D\nhas significant potential to advance research in biomechanics and multi-segment\nfoot modeling, offering a valuable testbed for clinical gait analysis,\nprosthetic design, and robotics applications requiring detailed 3D models of\nthe foot during motion.

This paper\nderives an expression for SNR in target detection scenarios where dual RISs\nassist a monostatic radar in NLoS situations. We calculate the power received\nat the radar through a dual RIS configuration. We show that the SNR performance\nof RIS-assisted radars can improve with known locations of the radar and RISs.\nOur results demonstrate that the required accuracy in target localization can\nbe achieved by controlling the number of RISs, the number of unit cells in each\nRIS, and properly selecting the locations of RISs to cover the desired region.\nThe performance of dual RIS-assisted radar systems can surpass that of single\nRIS-assisted radar systems under favourable alignment and sufficiently large\nRIS sizes.",

Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features\nto capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and\noften inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce\nfrequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches\nlimits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the\nDark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel\ndual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment\nacross spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two\nkey modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a\npixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance\nhaze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware\nspectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which\nfuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid\ngating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior\nCorrection Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback\nmechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed\nfeatures and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in\nchallenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze\ndatasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nsuperior robustness and real-time efficiency.

To investigate these mechanisms, we developed the Rosetta\nStone project: an end-to-end (simulations-observations) framework that is based\non the systematic production of realistic synthetic observations of clump\nfragmentation and their comparison with real data. In this work, we compare\nALMA 1.3mm continuum dust emission observations from the SQUALO survey with a\nnew set of 24 radiative magnetohydrodynamical simulations of high-mass clump\nfragmentation, post-processed using the CASA software to mimic the observing\nstrategy of SQUALO. The simulations were initialized combining typical values\nof clump mass (500,1000 solar masses) and radius (~0.4pc) with two levels of\nturbulence (Mach number of 7,10) and three levels of magnetization\n(mass-to-flux ratio of ~3,10,100). Following the clump evolution over time with\ntwo random seeds projected along three orthogonal directions, we produced a\ncollection of 732 synthetic fields. The synthetic observations of clump\nfragmentation at ~7000AU revealed between 2 and 14 fragments per field. Among\nthe initial conditions of the simulations, magnetic fields have the largest\nimpact on the fragment multiplicity at these scales. In advanced stages of\nclump evolution, a lower number of fragments is preferentially associated with\nmagnetized clumps. Fragments identified at ~7000AU correspond to individual or\nmultiple sink particles in ~75% of the cases, suggesting that not all fragments\nare actively forming stars. Both sinks and fragments accrete mass throughout\nthe whole clump evolution, favoring a scenario in which fragments are not\nisolated from the environment. Our study demonstrates the importance of\nsynthetic observations in interpreting results from interferometric\nobservations.",

We further improve the performance by\nenriching the representation of text prompts by injecting visual embeddings of\nthe personal concept into them.

On the other hand, pathwise policy\ngradients alleviate the training variance, but are reliable only when driven by\nan accurate action-conditioned value function which is notoriously hard to\ntrain without relying on past off-policy data. In this paper, we discuss how to\nconstruct a value-gradient driven, on-policy algorithm that allow training\nQ-value models purely from on-policy data, unlocking the possibility of using\npathwise policy updates in the context of on-policy learning. We show how to\nbalance stochastic policies for exploration with constrained policy updates for\nstable training, and evaluate important architectural components that\nfacilitate accurate value function learning. Building on these insights, we\npropose Relative Entropy Pathwise Policy Optimization (REPPO), an efficient\non-policy algorithm that combines the sample-efficiency of pathwise policy\ngradients with the simplicity and minimal memory footprint of standard\non-policy learning.

    "abstract": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing\nlarge language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and\ncomputational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods\noften rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error,\nunder the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained\nfull-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation\nprocess introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights\nand their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally\nflawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly\nincorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error\ncompensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference\nbetween latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited\ngeneralization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach\nintroduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages\nprecomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian\nsubmatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models\nand benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical\nGPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of\nLlama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from\n51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%.\nFurthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as\nGPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging\nW4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision\nbaselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve.

The\nkey task addressed is the autonomous deployment of flexible solar panels using\nan extendable ladder-like structure and a robotic manipulator with real-time\nfeedback for precision. The manipulator relays position and force-torque data,\nenabling dynamic error detection and adaptive control during deployment. To\nmitigate the effects of sinkage, variable payload, and low-lighting conditions,\nefficient motion planning strategies are employed, supplemented by human\ncontrol that allows operators to intervene in ambiguous scenarios. Digital twin\nsimulation enhances system robustness by enabling continuous feedback,\niterative task refinement, and seamless integration with the deployment\npipeline.

However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a\nsimplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural\nrepresentations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin\nto those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information\nredundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive\nperformance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight\narchitectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information\nprocessing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled\nby kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order\nspatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further\nmodulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise\nredundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently\ngather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental\nresults in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable\nparameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular,\non the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M\nparameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver\nstrong performance through an efficient design.

Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual\nsimilarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it\ndifficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional\ngradient-based methods prioritise $\\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing\nadversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making\nthem detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a\nmixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial\nexamples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical\nfeatures into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve\nstatistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to\nmeasure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically\nindistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly\navailable datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method\nachieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance\ncompared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted\nfrom image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes\nhyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative\narchitectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically\non reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient\ntraining data is available.

We show that compared with competing methods with alternative sampling\nstrategies such as slice sampling, our proposals lead to superior performance\nin variable selection, Bayesian estimation and statistical inference. In\nparticular, our numeric studies indicate that even without imposing exact\nsparsity, the one-group horseshoe priors can still yield valid Bayesian\ncredible intervals under robust high-dimensional linear regression models.\nApplications of the proposed and alternative methods on real data further\nillustrates the advantage of the proposed methods.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a Eulerian theory to elucidate the molecular kinematics\nin polymer networks and their connection to continuum deformation, grounded in\nfundamental statistical physics and thermodynamics. Three key innovations are\nincorporated: 1. The network behavior is described through a global\nthermodynamic equilibrium condition that maximizes the number of accessible\nmicrostates for all segments, instead of directly dealing with the\nwell-established single-chain models commonly adopted in traditional\napproaches. A variational problem is then posed in the Eulerian framework to\nidentify this equilibrium state under geometric fluctuation constraints. Its\nsolution recaptures the classical single-chain model and reveals the dependence\nof chain kinematics upon continuum deformation. 2. The chain stretch and\norientation probability are found to be explicitly specified through the\nEulerian logarithmic strain and spatial direction. The resulting hyperelastic\nmodel, with only two physical parameters, outperforms the extant models with\nsame number of parameters. It further provides a physical justification for\nprior models exhibiting superior predictive capabilities: the model becomes\nequivalent to the Biot-chain model at moderate deformations, while converging\nto the classical Hencky strain energy in the small strain limit. 3.A novel\nbiaxial instability emerges as a phase transition in chain orientation. At\nsufficiently large deformation, chains increasingly align with the primary\nstretched direction, depleting their density in other directions. Consequently,\nthe stresses in non-primary stretched directions would decrease as the loss in\nchain density outweighs the gain in chain force. For equal biaxial tension,\ninstability is therefore triggered because perfect equality of the two\nprincipal stretches without any perturbation is practically unachievable.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for learning vision-based robotic policies\nfor contact-rich manipulation tasks that generalize spatially across task\nconfigurations. We focus on achieving robust spatial generalization of the\npolicy for the peg-in-hole (PiH) task trained from a small number of\ndemonstrations. We propose EquiContact, a hierarchical policy composed of a\nhigh-level vision planner (Diffusion Equivariant Descriptor Field, Diff-EDF)\nand a novel low-level compliant visuomotor policy (Geometric Compliant ACT,\nG-CompACT). G-CompACT operates using only localized observations (geometrically\nconsistent error vectors (GCEV), force-torque readings, and wrist-mounted RGB\nimages) and produces actions defined in the end-effector frame. Through these\ndesign choices, we show that the entire EquiContact pipeline is\nSE(3)-equivariant, from perception to force control. We also outline three key\ncomponents for spatially generalizable contact-rich policies: compliance,\nlocalized policies, and induced equivariance. Real-world experiments on PiH\ntasks demonstrate a near-perfect success rate and robust generalization to\nunseen spatial configurations, validating the proposed framework and\nprinciples.

    "abstract": "Prior human-robot interaction (HRI) research has primarily focused on\nsingle-user interactions, where robots do not need to consider the timing or\nrecipient of their responses. However, in multi-party interactions, such as at\nmalls and hospitals, social robots must understand the context and decide both\nwhen and to whom they should respond. In this paper, we propose a\nTransformer-based multi-task learning framework to improve the decision-making\nprocess of social robots, particularly in multi-user environments. Considering\nthe characteristics of HRI, we propose two novel loss functions: one that\nenforces constraints on active speakers to improve scene modeling, and another\nthat guides response selection towards utterances specifically directed at the\nrobot. Additionally, we construct a novel multi-party HRI dataset that captures\nreal-world complexities, such as gaze misalignment. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in respond\ndecisions, outperforming existing heuristic-based and single-task approaches.\nOur findings contribute to the development of socially intelligent social\nrobots capable of engaging in natural and context-aware multi-party\ninteractions.",

Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this\nhypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle -\nand very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have\nbeen given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference\nof the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to\ncircular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of\nthem involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a\ntime-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy\nvalues of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on\nwhich we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our\nuniverse's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced\nas an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the\nstandard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its \"1000CE\" variant, the past hypothesis,\nthe second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully\nformal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's\nstipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all\nmake an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single\nmoment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In\nthis aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally\nlegitimate (or not).",

Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the\ncurrent study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a\nfine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human\nperformance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in\nLLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity\nbetween the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity\nbetween the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the\neffectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we\nexamine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in\nhumans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and\nnot just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our\nexperiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)\nand performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as\nGPT-4 and LLaMA3.

To address these issues, this\npaper investigates using diffusion decoders adapted for the discrete data\ndomain. These decoders provide a different approach, allowing sequence\ngeneration to start from any peptide segment, thereby enhancing prediction\naccuracy. We experiment with three different diffusion decoder designs,\nknapsack beam search, and various loss functions. We find knapsack beam search\ndid not improve performance metrics and simply replacing the transformer\ndecoder with a diffusion decoder lowered performance. Although peptide\nprecision and recall were still 0, the best diffusion decoder design with the\nDINOISER loss function obtained a statistically significant improvement in\namino acid recall by 0.373 compared to the baseline autoregressive\ndecoder-based Casanovo model.

As discussed by Newman et\nal., whose results we revise using the complete LATIS survey data, these are\ncandidate ultraviolet (UV)-dim protoclusters that may harbor distinct galaxy\npopulations missed by rest-UV spectroscopic surveys. We present follow-up\nobservations targeting one such candidate embedded within Antu, an extended\nregion of IGM absorption at $z=2.685$ that contains five IGM-selected\nprotoclusters and has a total mass of $3 \\times 10^{15}~M_{\\odot}$. Ly$\\alpha$\nemitters trace the overall structure of Antu but avoid the center of the\ncandidate UV-dim protocluster, which also appears to contain no\nsubmillimeter-selected sources. A near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy census is\nneeded to determine whether this large region is dominated by galaxies with\nreduced or absent star-formation activity. This work adds to a growing and\npuzzling literature on discrepancies among different galaxy and IGM tracers,\nwhose resolution promises to shed light on the early stages of\nenvironment-dependent galaxy evolution.",

A key advantage of Ly$\\alpha$ tomography is that it enables the\ndiscovery of overdense regions without the need to detect their galaxy members\nin spectroscopic surveys, circumventing possible selection biases. We use these\nmaps to identify 37 IGM-selected overdensities as regions of strong and\nspatially coherent Ly$\\alpha$ absorption. Simulations indicate that 85% of\nthese are protoclusters, defined as the progenitors of $z=0$ halos with mass\n$M_{\\rm desc} > 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$, and that nearly all of the rest are\nprotogroups ($10^{13.5} < M_{\\rm desc} / M_{\\odot} < 10^{14}$). We estimate the\nmasses and space densities of the IGM-selected overdensities and show they are\nin accordance with mock surveys. We investigate the LATIS counterparts of some\npreviously reported protoclusters, including the proto-supercluster Hyperion.\nWe identify a new component of Hyperion beyond its previously known extent. We\nshow that the Ly$\\alpha$ transmission of the galaxy density peaks within\nHyperion is consistent with a simple physical model (the fluctuating\nGunn-Peterson approximation), suggesting that active galactic nucleus feedback\nor other processes have not affected the large-scale gas ionization within this\nstructure as whole.

A flexible variational distribution on\ncorrelated latent utilities is defined using neural embeddings, and a\nreparameterization trick is used to ensure the positive definiteness of the\nresulting covariance matrix.

In GeoDistill, the teacher model localizes a panoramic image,\nwhile the student model predicts locations from a limited FoV counterpart\ncreated by FoV-based masking. By aligning the student's predictions with those\nof the teacher, the student focuses on key features like lane lines and ignores\ntextureless regions, such as roads. This results in more accurate predictions\nand reduced uncertainty, regardless of whether the query images are panoramas\nor limited FoV images. Our experiments show that GeoDistill significantly\nimproves localization performance across different frameworks. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel orientation estimation network that predicts relative\norientation without requiring precise planar position ground truth. GeoDistill\nprovides a scalable and efficient solution for real-world cross-view\nlocalization challenges. Code and model can be found at\nhttps://github.com/tongshw/GeoDistill.",

    "abstract": "(Abridged) Stroke and SCI are conditions that can significantly impact the\nQoL of survivors in both the physical and psychosocial domains. Both diseases\noften result in significant motor and sensory impairments that are not fully\nreversible despite current available therapies. Invasive BCIs have emerged as a\npromising means to bypass the site of injury and potentially restore motor and\nsensory function. However, to maximize the utility and participant satisfaction\nwith such technology, participants' willingness to embrace BCIs must be\nassessed, and placed in context with functional goals and rehabilitative\npriorities. Hence, we conducted a survey of a cohort of stroke (n=33), SCI\n(n=37), and both (n=1) participants regarding their receptiveness to invasive\nECoG-based BCIs as well as to assess their goals for functional rehabilitation.\nOverall, participants indicated a high level of willingness to undergo surgery\nto implant ECoG grids for BCI technology if basic motor functions, including\nupper extremity, gait, bowel/bladder, and sensory function were restored. There\nwas no correlation between participant willingness to undergo a prospective BCI\nimplantation and the level of functional recovery offered by the BCI.\nSimilarly, there was no correlation between willingness to undergo surgery and\nthe participants' perceived rehabilitative priorities and level of disability.\nThese findings indicate that participants were interested in invasive BCI\ntechnology even if only basic functions can be restored, regardless of their\nlevel of disability and their rehabilitative priorities. Such observations\nimply that first generation commercial invasive BCIs may not need extensive\nfunctions to garner adoption. Conversely, it also raises a concern that\nparticipants from the stroke and SCI cohort may be overly enthusiastic about\nsuch technology, which poses potential risks for medical exploitation.",

    "abstract": "Data quality remains an important challenge in data-driven systems, as errors\nin tabular data can severely compromise downstream analytics and machine\nlearning performance. Although numerous error detection algorithms have been\nproposed, the lack of diverse, real-world error datasets limits comprehensive\nevaluation. Manual error annotation is both time-consuming and inconsistent,\nmotivating the exploration of synthetic error generation as an alternative. In\nthis work, we introduce TableEG, a framework that leverages large language\nmodels (LLMs) to generate authentic errors. By employing a table fine-tuning\nstrategy and a triplet representation $(I, T, O)$ to model error generation,\ndetection, and correction tasks, TableEG captures the complex dependencies\ninherent in two-dimensional tables. Trained on 12 real-world datasets spanning\n10 diverse domains, TableEG ensures that the synthesized errors faithfully\nreflect authentic error distributions. Experimental results indicate that\nerrors generated by TableEG exhibit superior pattern and distribution\nsimilarity compared to both rule-based methods and LLM-generated errors without\nfine-tuning. Furthermore, performance metrics on TableEG-generated errors\nclosely align with those on real-world errors across nearly all datasets and\ndetection algorithms, particularly for machine learning based detection\ntechniques. Overall, TableEG not only bridges the gap between synthetic and\nreal-world errors but also establishes a robust benchmark for subsequent error\ndetection and correction tasks.",

This\nbehavior reveals an optimal range of twist angles and frequencies for achieving\nhigh-quality MFCs with a large number of comb teeth. Our findings deepen the\nunderstanding of nonlinear interactions in twisted MCs and highlight their\npotential for advancing moir\\'e-based materials in information processing and\nhigh-precision metrology.",

One\nsignature of AGN activity is luminosity variability, which appears in the\nmid-infrared (mid-IR) when circumnuclear dust reprocesses UV and optical\nphotons from the AGN accretion disk. We present here a suite of constraints on\nthe fraction of AGN activity in the most underdense regions of the universe\n(cosmic voids) relative to the rest of the universe (cosmic walls) by using ~12\nyears of combined multi-epoch data from AllWISE and NEOWISE to quantify mid-IR\nvariability. We find clear evidence for a larger mid-IR variability-AGN\nfraction among high and moderate-luminosity void galaxies compared to their\nwall counterparts. We also show that mid-IR variability identifies a rather\nlarge and unique population of AGNs, the majority of which have eluded\ndetection using more traditional AGN-selection methods such as single-epoch\nmid-IR color selection. The fraction of these newly-recovered AGNs is larger\namong galaxies in voids, suggesting once again more prolific AGN activity in\nthe most underdense large scale structures of the universe.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource\nlanguages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as\nhomophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To\naddress this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel\nmeaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT)\nframework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja\n(Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja\ncandidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual\ndisambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation\nto prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge\nsignificantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\\% relative\nimprovement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment\nbetween Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive\ncross-lingual transfer.

    "abstract": "Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests\nbased on their behaviors or auxiliary signals. However, existing methods often\nrely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same\ninterest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with\nreal-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the\ngranularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to\noverly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis\nprovides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we\npropose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more\neffective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to\nflexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters,\nindicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic\ngeneration of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users'\ncollaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions,\nallowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's\nbehaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived\nfrom individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose\naggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more\ncomprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering\nproblem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users'\nbehaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven\nmulti-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.\nExperiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

They are\ncharacterized by two independent topological charges, \\textit{viz}., vorticity\n$S$ and winding number $M$ of the intrinsic twist, whose product determines the\n\\textit{Hopf number}, $Q_{H}=MS$, which is the basic characteristic of the\nhopfions. We construct hopfions as solutions of the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii\nequations (GPEs) for Bose-Einstein condensates in binary atomic gases. The GPE\nsystem includes the cubic mean-field self-attraction, competing with the\nquartic self-repulsive Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) term, which represents effects of\nquantum fluctuations around the mean-field state, and a trapping toroidal\npotential (TP). A systematic numerical analysis demonstrates that families of\nthe states with $S=1,M=0$, i.e., $Q_{H}=0$, are stable, provided that the inner\nTP\\ radius $R_{0}$ exceeds a critical value. Furthermore, true hopfions with\n$S=1,M=1\\sim 7$, which correspond, accordingly, to $Q_{H}=1\\sim 7$, also form\npartly stable families, including the case of the LHY\\ superfluid, in which the\nnonlinearity is represented solely by the LHY term. On the other hand, the\nhopfion family is completely unstable in the absence of the LHY term, when only\nthe mean-field nonlinearity is present. We illustrate the knot-like structure\nof the hopfions by means of an elementary geometric picture. For $Q_{H}=0$,\ncircles which represent the \\textit{preimage} of the full state do not\nintersect. On the contrary, for $Q_{H}\\geq 1$ they intersect at points whose\nnumber is identical to $Q_{H}$. The intersecting curves form multi-petal\nstructures with the number of petals also equal to $Q_{H}$.",

    "abstract": "Commit messages are essential in software development as they serve to\ndocument and explain code changes. Yet, their quality often falls short in\npractice, with studies showing significant proportions of empty or inadequate\nmessages. While automated commit message generation has advanced significantly,\nparticularly with Large Language Models (LLMs), the evaluation of generated\nmessages remains challenging. Traditional reference-based automatic metrics\nlike BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR have notable limitations in assessing commit\nmessage quality, as they assume a one-to-one mapping between code changes and\ncommit messages, leading researchers to rely on resource-intensive human\nevaluation. This study investigates the potential of LLMs as automated\nevaluators for commit message quality. Through systematic experimentation with\nvarious prompt strategies and state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate that LLMs\ncombining Chain-of-Thought reasoning with few-shot demonstrations achieve near\nhuman-level evaluation proficiency. Our LLM-based evaluator significantly\noutperforms traditional metrics while maintaining acceptable reproducibility,\nrobustness, and fairness levels despite some inherent variability. This work\nconducts a comprehensive preliminary study on using LLMs for commit message\nevaluation, offering a scalable alternative to human assessment while\nmaintaining high-quality evaluation.",

Under fuel-rich conditions with relatively low heat\nrelease rates and low flow rates, the flames exhibited quasi-periodic\nsingle-mode oscillations. These oscillations were modulated by low-frequency\nflame flickering instabilities at elevated flow rates, which created sidebands\naround the primary oscillation frequency. At higher heat release rates, the\nflickering instability further triggered mode splitting, eventually leading to\nmulti-mode oscillations.

We then analyse sixty-three\nthousand eight hundred forty-six gait cycles from the OU-ISIR Large-Population\ndataset to quantify correlations between age and five key metrics: stride\nlength, walking speed, step cadence, step-time variability and joint-angle\nentropy, with correlation coefficients of at least 0.27.

In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such as network\nintrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often clusters by\nclass. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and introduce the\nClass Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a quantitative measure.

    "abstract": "Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for\npredicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the\nbenefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and\nMethods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random\nforest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model,\nSurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an\nattention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data.\nPerformance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key\npredictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved\nthe highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85)\nand baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by\ndynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative\nclinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most\ncontributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone\ndisorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most\nimpactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention\nmechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential\nnature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher\naccuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical\nadoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based\ntemporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM\npresents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in\nelective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal,\nexplainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance\ndischarge readiness and individualized patient care.",

In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for\nglobal weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while\nsignificantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic\nmodernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across\nmultiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a\nscale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a\ngeophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data.\nTrained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model\ncontains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on\na single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the\nperformance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting,\nwhile offering a significantly lightweight design.

Using von Neumann entanglement\nentropy, we study a nonentangled state evolved under three variants of the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model with a finite number of Majorana fermions $N$.\nAll the variants exhibit linear entanglement growth at early times, which at\nlate times saturates to a universal value consistent with random matrix theory\n(RMT), but their growth rates differ. We interpret this as a large-$N$ effect,\narising from the enhanced non-locality of fermionic operators in SYK and binary\nSYK, absent in spin operators of the spin-SYK model. Numerically, we find that\nthese differences emerge gradually with increasing $N$. Although all variants\nare quantum chaotic, their entanglement dynamics reflect varying degrees of\nchaos and indicate that the entanglement production rate serves as a\nfine-grained probe of chaos beyond conventional measures. To probe its effect\non thermalization properties of these models, we study the two-point\nautocorrelation function, finding no differences between the SYK variants, but\ndeviations from RMT predictions for $N \\geq 24$, particularly near the\ncrossover from exponential decay to saturation regime.",

The actual drain and shipping costs are\ndetermined by complex production systems that manage the planning and execution\nof customers' orders fulfillment, i.e. from where and how to ship a unit to be\ndelivered to a customer. Accurately modeling these processes is critical for\nregional inventory planning, especially when using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nto develop control policies. For the RL usecase, a drain model is incorporated\ninto a simulator to produce long rollouts, which we desire to be\ndifferentiable. While simulating the calls to the internal software systems can\nbe used to recover this transition, they are non-differentiable and too slow\nand costly to run within an RL training environment. Accordingly, we frame this\nas a probabilistic forecasting problem, modeling the joint distribution of\noutbound drain and shipping costs across all warehouses at each time period,\nconditioned on inventory positions and exogenous customer demand. To ensure\nrobustness in an RL environment, the model must handle out-of-distribution\nscenarios that arise from off-policy trajectories.

    "abstract": "A computational tool, Omnisoot, was developed utilizing the chemical kinetics\ncapabilities of Cantera to model the formation of carbonaceous nanoparticles,\nsuch as soot and Carbon Black (CB), from the reactions of gaseous hydrocarbons.\nOmnisoot integrates constant volume, constant pressure, perfectly stirred, and\nplug flow reactor models with four inception models from the literature, as\nwell as two population balance models: a monodisperse model and a sectional\nmodel. This package serves as an integrated process design tool to predict soot\nmass, morphology, and composition under varying process conditions. The\nmodeling approach accounts for soot inception, surface growth, and oxidation,\ncoupled with detailed gas-phase chemistry, to close the mass and energy\nbalances of the gas-particle system; subsequently, soot and gas-phase chemistry\nare linked to the particle dynamics models that consider the evolving\nfractal-like structure of soot agglomerates. The developed tool was employed to\nhighlight the similarities and differences among the implemented inception\nmodels in predicting soot mass, morphology, and size distribution for three\nuse-cases: methane pyrolysis in a shock tube, ethylene pyrolysis in a flow\nreactor, and ethylene combustion in a perfectly stirred reactor. The\nsimulations of 5% $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ pyrolysis in shock-tube with short residence\ntimes ($\\approx1.5$ ms) demonstrated that multiple combinations of inception\nand surface growth rates minimized the prediction error for carbon yield but\nled to markedly different morphologies, emphasizing the need for measured data\non soot morphology to constrain inception and surface growth rates. The\ncomparison of simulation results in a pyrolysis flow reactor at three different\nflow rates suggested that only irreversible models can predict bimodality in\nparticle size distribution.",

Traditional\napproaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent\nproperties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state\nparabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for\ncomputational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a\nGraph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is\nspecifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in\nneural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent\nrepresentations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration\nprofiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global\ngraph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent\nspace via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration\nof an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models\nwith reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component\neffectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in\nrecurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated\nthrough results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport\nexamples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum\nrelative error <8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to\nprevious surrogate model approaches.",

Breast MRI registration is particularly\ndifficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation\ncaused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal\nstructure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial.\nWhether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level\nof complexity remains an open question.

We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM,\nMedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that\ncapture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and\npatient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that\nfoundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional\nregistration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large\ndomain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular\ntissue.

    "abstract": "Automation in optical microscopy is critical for enabling high-throughput\nimaging across a wide range of biomedical applications. Among the essential\ncomponents of automated systems, robust autofocusing plays a pivotal role in\nmaintaining image quality for both single-plane and volumetric imaging.\nHowever, conventional autofocusing methods often struggle with implementation\ncomplexity, limited generalizability across sample types, incompatibility with\nthick specimens, and slow feedback. We recently discovered a phenomenon that\nthe digitally summed Fourier spectrum of two images acquired from two-angle\nillumination exhibits interference-like fringe modulation when the sample is\ndefocused. These digital fringes correlate directly with defocus through a\nphysics-based relation. Based on this principle, we developed an automatic,\nefficient, and generalizable defocus detection method termed digital defocus\naberration interference (DAbI). Implemented with a simple two-LED setup, DAbI\ncan quantify the defocus distance over a range of 212 times the depth-of-field\n(DoF) for thin samples and 300 times for thick specimens. It can additionally\nextend the natural DoF of the imaging system by 20 folds when integrated with\ncomplex-field imaging. We demonstrated the versatile applications of DAbI on\nbrightfield, complex-field, refractive index, confocal, and widefield\nfluorescence imaging, establishing it as a promising solution for automated,\nhigh-throughput optical microscopy.",

Although synthetic microswimmers offer surrogates\nfor self-propelled living entities, they often lack the complex feedback\nmechanisms that enable organisms to adapt. In this work, we present an\nexperimental platform in which light-activated colloids dispersed in a nematic\nliquid crystal can (i) switch from directed to active Brownian motion depending\non the nematic anchoring and (ii) mechanically adjust their motility in\nresponse to crowding, effectively enforcing quorum-sensing interactions. Both\nfeatures are caused by a distinctive self-propulsion mechanism as unveiled\nthrough experiments, simulations, and theory. We characterize the dynamics of a\nsingle colloid and demonstrate that its motion is captured by an active\nBrownian particle model if the nematic anchoring is homeotropic, and by\ndirected self-propulsion along the nematic director if the anchoring is planar.\nNext, we investigate the many-body dynamics, showing that it undergoes a\nclustering phase separation through effective quorum-sensing interactions.

This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient\nframework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF)\nalgorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.\n  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier\nremoval techniques across multiple public datasets.\n  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly\navailable datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene.\nSince these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted\ntheir segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the\nrobustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation\nand remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors\nand a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a\nfast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for\nreal-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern\naugmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.\n  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance,\nachieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5\nof 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods,\nour model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.\n  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited\nfor real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study\nunderscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when\ndesigning effective AI systems for medical imaging.",

By integrating the full six-dimensional equations\nof motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and\nquantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision.

    "abstract": "Cognitive reappraisal is a key strategy in emotion regulation, involving\nreinterpretation of emotionally charged stimuli to alter affective responses.\nDespite its central role in clinical and cognitive science, real-world\nreappraisal interventions remain cognitively demanding, abstract, and primarily\nverbal. This reliance on higher-order cognitive and linguistic processes is\noften impaired in individuals with trauma or depression, limiting the\neffectiveness of standard approaches. Here, we propose a novel, visually based\naugmentation of cognitive reappraisal by integrating large-scale text-to-image\ndiffusion models into the emotional regulation process. Specifically, we\nintroduce a system in which users reinterpret emotionally negative images via\nspoken reappraisals, which are transformed into supportive, emotionally\ncongruent visualizations using stable diffusion models with a fine-tuned\nIP-adapter. This generative transformation visually instantiates users'\nreappraisals while maintaining structural similarity to the original stimuli,\nexternalizing and reinforcing regulatory intent. To test this approach, we\nconducted a within-subject experiment (N = 20) using a modified cognitive\nemotion regulation (CER) task. Participants reappraised or described aversive\nimages from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), with or without\nAI-generated visual feedback. Results show that AI-assisted reappraisal\nsignificantly reduced negative affect compared to both non-AI and control\nconditions. Further analyses reveal that sentiment alignment between\nparticipant reappraisals and generated images correlates with affective relief,\nsuggesting that multimodal coherence enhances regulatory efficacy. These\nfindings demonstrate that generative visual input can support cogitive\nreappraisal and open new directions at the intersection of generative AI,\naffective computing, and therapeutic technology.",

As a result, applying spherically-symmetric models can result in\nsignificant biases. These biases can be mitigated by fitting a triaxial model,\nrequiring deep multiprobe data and a set of physically motivated models to\ndescribe them. Here we present a multiprobe triaxial analysis methodology based\non the data available for galaxy clusters in the Cluster Heritage project with\nXMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at Endpoint of structure\nformation (CHEX-MATE), which includes X-ray data from XMM-Newton, SZ data from\nPlanck and ACT, and WL data from Subaru. This work builds on our previous\ndevelopment of a gas-only X-ray and SZ triaxial fitting formalism in Paper I.\nWe apply our approach to the CHEX-MATE cluster PSZ2 G313.33+61.13 (Abell 1689)\nand find that it is elongated along the line of sight relative to the plane of\nsky by a factor of $\\mathcal{R}_{LP} = 1.27 \\pm 0.02$.

Additionally, we propose a comprehensive suite of benchmark datasets\nspecifically designed for realistic model evaluation by minimizing leakage,\nincreasing task difficulty, enhancing dataset diversity, and adjustment of base\nrates more likely to be seen in the real world. We train and evaluate multiple\nsolution approaches to provide baseline performance on the benchmark sets. We\nbelieve the availability of this dataset and benchmarks will enable realistic,\nstandardized model comparison and foster further advances in phishing\ndetection. The datasets and benchmarks are available on Hugging Face\n(https://huggingface.co/datasets/phreshphish/phreshphish).",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes fields\nwhere their decisions impact rights and equity. However, LLMs' judicial\nfairness and implications for social justice remain underexplored. When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive\ninconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring\nsevere LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency\ncorrelates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate\nbiases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence\nLLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit\nsignificant effects on judicial fairness. Accordingly, we introduce a publicly\navailable toolkit containing all datasets and code, designed to support future\nresearch in evaluating and improving LLM fairness.",

While the determination of the ``free''\nelements is usually guided by the constraints of some experimental setup, this\ncan make it difficult to study similarities and differences between QRTs. In\nthis work, we argue that QRTs follow from the choice of a preferred algebraic\nstructure $\\mathcal{E}$ to be preserved, thus setting the free operations as\nthe automorphisms of $\\mathcal{E}$. We illustrate our finding by determining\n$\\mathcal{E}$ for the QRTs of entanglement, Clifford stabilizerness, purity,\nimaginarity, fermionic Gaussianity, reference frames, thermodynamics and\ncoherence; showing instances where $\\mathcal{E}$ is a Lie algebra, group, ring,\nor even a simple set. This unified understanding allows us to generalize the\nconcept of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) to\nidentify novel resource non-increasing operations for Lie-algebra based QRTs,\nthus finding a new solution to an open problem in the literature. We showcase\nthe sanity of our new set of operations by rigorously proving that they map\nfree states to free states, as well as determine more general situations where\nthese transformations strictly do not increase the resource of a state.",

In this paper, we examine 399 candidate\nsingle late-M dwarfs with $G - G_{RP} \\geq 1.4$ mag ($\\gtrsim$M6) using TESS\nlight curves. To determine rotation periods, we employed Lomb-Scargle\nPeriodograms to provide a first estimate of the period, then refined them with\na Gaussian Process approach, requiring multi-sector confirmation when\navailable. We found 133 rotation periods, ranging from 2 hours to 6 days, and\namplitudes between 0.08% and 2.71%. We find that the observed variability\nfraction in late-M dwarfs rises with the number of available TESS sectors,\napproaching an apparent ceiling of ~50%. This likely reflects a detection limit\ndetermined by viewing geometry and supports the idea that spot-induced\nvariability is common across the late-M and brown dwarf population. In our\ncomparison with previously published late-M dwarf rotation periods reported, we\nfound consistent results, confirming or updating 31 periods. Our findings\nexpand the number of previously known late-M dwarf periods under 1 day by 76%.\nCombined with published rotation periods for a broader range of spectral types,\nwe find a lower envelope on the rotation period decreasing from 5 hours at\nearly-M dwarfs to 1 hour at L, T, and Y dwarfs.",

Fold-switching proteins challenge\nthis expectation by remodeling their secondary and/or tertiary structures in\nresponse to cellular stimuli. Though these shapeshifting proteins were once\nthought to be haphazard evolutionary byproducts with little intrinsic\nbiological relevance, recent work has shown that evolution has selected for\ntheir dual-folding behavior, which plays critical roles in biological processes\nacross all kingdoms of life. The widening scope of fold switching draws\nattention to the ways it challenges conventional wisdom, raising fundamental\nunanswered questions about protein structure, biophysics, and evolution.

To overcome these challenges, we employ Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CVaR), a popular coherent risk measure, and establish its\nequivalence with the sum-least-$\\alpha$th-quantile (SL$\\alpha$Q) utility. This\nconnection enables an exact convex reformulation of the SL$\\alpha$Q\nmaximization problem, facilitating analytical tractability and precise and\ninterpretable control over cell-edge terminal performance. Utilizing Lagrangian\nduality, we provide (for the first time) parameterized closed-form solutions\nfor the optimal resource policy -- which is of waterfilling-type -- as well as\nthe associated (auxiliary) Value-at-Risk variable. We further develop a novel\ninexact dual subgradient descent algorithm of minimal complexity to determine\nglobally optimal resource policies, and we rigorously establish its\nconvergence. The resulting edge waterfilling algorithm iteratively and\nefficiently allocates resources while explicitly ensuring transmission rate\nfairness across (cell-edge) terminals.

In this work, we explore how graph convolutional\nnetworks (GCNs) can be leveraged to efficiently solve constrained assortment\noptimization under the mixed multinomial logit choice model. We first develop a\ngraph representation of the assortment problem, then train a GCN to learn the\npatterns of optimal assortments, and lastly propose two inference policies\nbased on the GCN's output. Due to the GCN's inherent ability to generalize\nacross inputs of varying sizes, we can use a GCN trained on small-scale\ninstances to facilitate large-scale instances. Extensive numerical experiments\ndemonstrate that given a GCN trained on small-scale instances (e.g., with 20\nproducts), the proposed policies can achieve superior performance (90%+\noptimality) on large-scale instances (with up to 2,000 products) within\nseconds, which outperform existing heuristic policies in both performance and\nefficiency.

    "abstract": "Confinement in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), binding quarks and gluons into\nhadrons, is characterized by a linear potential and the Wilson loop area law.\nWe develop an analytical framework in $\\text{SU(3)}$ gauge theory, proposing a\nhybrid effective string model that integrates chromoelectric flux tubes with\ntopological corrections from \\(\\mathbb{Z}_3\\) center vortices. Using\nstrong-coupling expansion, we derive the Wilson loop expectation value,\nincorporating novel logarithmic vortex corrections, and compute a modified\nconfining potential with non-universal terms. A central focus is the\nentanglement entropy of a confined quark-antiquark pair, modeled as a\nphase-damping quantum channel driven by the $\\text{SU(3)}$ confining potential\nand vortex effects. We analytically demonstrate that confinement increases\nentropy, reflecting suppressed quantum correlations due to flux tube formation,\nwith vortices enhancing decoherence.

We consider\nparticles with competing short-range attraction and long-range repulsion\nsubjected to time-dependent oscillations of the ratio between the attractive\nand repulsive interaction terms, which causes the system to cycle periodically\nbetween crystal and bubble states.

Early and accurate detection of\ndementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.\nWhile classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been\nexplored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle\nwith high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly\nreaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge,\nquantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering\nfaster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims\nto demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the\nperformance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary\nclassification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of\nnoise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness\nof this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can\ntransform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for\nbiomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on\nadvancing healthcare technology.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we explored how online hate is motivated by receiving social\napproval from others. We specifically examined two central tenets of Walther's\n(2024) social approval theory of online hate: (H1a) more signals of social\napproval on hate messages predicts more subsequent hate messages, and (H1b) as\nsocial approval increases, hate speech messages become more extreme. Using over\n110 million posts from Parler (2018-2021), we observed that the number of\nupvotes a person received on a hate speech post was unassociated with the\namount of hate speech in their next post and posts during the next week, month,\nthree months, and six months. Between-person effects revealed an average\nnegative relationship between social approval and hate speech production at the\npost level, but this relationship was mixed at other time intervals. Social\napproval reinforcement mechanisms of online hate may operate differently on\nniche social media platforms.",

Moreover, the rapid detection of\nattacks is essential, especially in critical infrastructure, to prevent\nlarge-scale disruptions. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time\nintrusion detection system based on a semi-supervised contrastive learning\nframework using the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN).

We validate our approach on three benchmark datasets, UNSW-NB15,\nBoT-IoT, and Gas Pipeline, using only 2.20%, 1.28%, and 8% of labeled samples,\nrespectively, to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show that\nour method outperforms existing contrastive learning-based approaches. We\nfurther compare KAN with a traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP),\ndemonstrating KAN's superior performance in both detection accuracy and\nrobustness under limited supervision.

To this end, we\npost-process the simulations with ionizing radiative transfer and perform Monte\nCarlo Lyman-$\\alpha$ (Lya) transfer calculations.

In FWI,\napproximations of the inverse of the Hessian may be used as preconditioners for\nNewton-type or quasi-Newton algorithms, reducing computational costs and\nimproving recovery in deeper subsurface regions. In Bayesian UQ, Hessian\napproximations enable the construction of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nproposals that capture the directional scalings of the posterior, enhancing the\nefficiency of MCMC. Computing the exact Hessian is intractable for large-scale\nproblems because the Hessian is accessible only through matrix-vector products,\nand performing each matrix-vector product requires costly solution of wave\nequations. Moreover, the Hessian is high-rank, which means that low-rank\nmethods, often employed in large-scale inverse problems, are inefficient. We\nadapt two existing high-rank Hessian approximations -- the point spread\nfunction method and the pseudo-differential operator probing method. Building\non an observed duality between these approaches, we develop a novel method that\nunifies their complementary strengths. We validate these methods on a synthetic\nquadratic model and on the Marmousi model. Numerical experiments show that\nthese high-rank Hessian approximations substantially reduce the computational\ncosts in FWI. In UQ, MCMC samples computed using no Hessian approximation or a\nlow-rank approximation explore the posterior slowly, providing little\nmeaningful statistical information after tens of thousands of iterations and\nunderestimating the variance. At the same time, the effective sample size is\noverestimated, providing false confidence.

For interventions targeting\nhabitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on\ndelivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur.\nCurrent practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour)\nbefore user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same\nfor all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly\nfor individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after\nthe target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective.\nIn this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule\ndecision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior\ntiming is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to\nthe predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling\nschedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely\nintervention.

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing\nthe time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or\nvaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence\nantibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent\nyears and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on\nantibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination\nprevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the\ncomplexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a\nsample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a\nrigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov\nchain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic\nframework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We\ndemonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to\nas personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking\nthe probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To\nillustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal\nsevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from\nindividuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work\nis an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics\nthat could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural\nimmunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level,\nand inform booster timing recommendations.",

While recent\nstudies have introduced some methods to improve prediction performance, these\napproaches still face a significant challenge in handling long-term\nextrapolation tasks under such complex scenarios. To overcome this challenge,\nwe propose Phy-SSM, a generalizable method that integrates partial physics\nknowledge into state space models (SSMs) for long-term dynamics forecasting in\ncomplex environments. Our motivation is that SSMs can effectively capture\nlong-range dependencies in sequential data and model continuous dynamical\nsystems, while the incorporation of physics knowledge improves generalization\nability. The key challenge lies in how to seamlessly incorporate partially\nknown physics into SSMs. To achieve this, we decompose partially known system\ndynamics into known and unknown state matrices, which are integrated into a\nPhy-SSM unit. To further enhance long-term prediction performance, we introduce\na physics state regularization term to make the estimated latent states align\nwith system dynamics. Besides, we theoretically analyze the uniqueness of the\nsolutions for our method. Extensive experiments on three real-world\napplications, including vehicle motion prediction, drone state prediction, and\nCOVID-19 epidemiology forecasting, demonstrate the superior performance of\nPhy-SSM over the baselines in both long-term interpolation and extrapolation\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Storage and retrieval refer to the task of encoding an unknown quantum\nchannel $\\Lambda$ into a quantum state, known as the program state, such that\nthe channel can later be retrieved. There are two strategies for this task:\nclassical and quantum strategies. The classical strategy uses multiple queries\nto $\\Lambda$ to estimate $\\Lambda$ and retrieves the channel based on the\nestimate represented in classical bits. The classical strategy turns out to\noffer the optimal performance for the storage and retrieval of unitary\nchannels. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic performance of the classical\nand quantum strategies for the storage and retrieval of isometry channels. We\nshow that the optimal fidelity for isometry estimation is given by $F =\n1-{d(D-d)\\over n} + O(n^{-2})$, where $d$ and $D$ denote the input and output\ndimensions of the isometry, and $n$ is the number of queries. This result\nindicates that, unlike in the case of unitary channels, the classical strategy\nis suboptimal for the storage and retrieval of isometry channels, which\nrequires $n = \\Theta(\\epsilon^{-1})$ to achieve the diamond-norm error\n$\\epsilon$. We propose a more efficient quantum strategy based on port-based\nteleportation, which stores the isometry channel in a program state using only\n$n = \\Theta(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ queries, achieving a quadratic improvement over\nthe classical strategy. As an application, we extend our approach to general\nquantum channels, achieving improved program cost compared to prior results by\nGschwendtner, Bluhm, and Winter [Quantum 5, 488 (2021)].",

The LF formulation provides an alternative computational\napproach to lattice gauge theory, and has recently been investigated as a\nfuture application of quantum computers. A natural question is how quantum\nresources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the\nlaboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D\ntransverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy\noperator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from\nthe instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF\nHamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta\nin IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF\nmomentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the\nIF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to\nprepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point,\ncorresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are\nstabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while\nthe IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF\nmomentum-space.

This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline\ngenerates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot\ninteraction without the need to wait for an action to finish. We showcase the\neffectiveness of our proposed interactive perception method by achieving an\naverage object segmentation accuracy rate 27.5% greater than state-of-the-art\nUOIS methods.

Existing weighting methods\neither assume positivity holds or produce effects that conflate interventions'\nimpacts on ultimate outcomes with their effects on intermediate treatments and\ncovariates. We propose a novel class of estimands -- cumulative cross-world\nweighted effects -- that weights potential outcome differences using propensity\nscores adapting to positivity violations cumulatively across timepoints and\nsimultaneously across both counterfactual treatment histories. This new\nestimand isolates mechanistic differences between treatment regimes, is\nidentifiable without positivity assumptions, and circumvents the limitations of\nexisting longitudinal methods. Further, our analysis reveals two fundamental\ninsights about longitudinal causal inference under positivity violations.\nFirst, while mechanistically meaningful, these effects correspond to\nnon-implementable interventions, exposing a core\ninterpretability-implementability tradeoff. Second, the identified effects\nfaithfully capture mechanistic differences only under a partial common support\nassumption; violations cause the identified functional to collapse to zero,\neven when the causal effect is non-zero. We develop doubly robust-style\nestimators that achieve asymptotic normality and parametric convergence under\nnonparametric assumptions on the nuisance estimators.

We start by analyzing the dynamics of the Pauli coefficients\ntracked in the Heisenberg picture. In addition to surprisingly generic\nconvergence features of the Pauli coefficient distributions, we find certain\nregularities that allow for extrapolation of memory and runtime requirements\nfor smaller and smaller coefficient truncation parameter $\\delta$. We then\nintroduce a framework for understanding convergence in the absence of rigorous\nerror guarantees on PPS. Combined with runtime analysis, we propose bifurcating\nquantum simulation problems broadly into two classes, based on whether there is\napparent convergence of expectation values as a function of $\\delta$. This\nserves as a way for practitioners to understand where their problem falls on\nthe frontier of classical simulability. In the case without apparent\nconvergence, PPS may still serve useful as a Monte Carlo-like estimate. Applied\nto IBM's utility-scale experiments, we show parameter regimes where both\nbehaviors are realized. Some of our key findings challenge conventional\nintuition: reducing $\\delta$ does not always improve accuracy, and deeper\nquantum circuits may actually be easier to simulate than shallower ones. The\nBlueQubit SDK implementing these methods has been released publicly, offering\nresearchers a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating this frontier classical\nsimulation approach.

    "abstract": "Being one of the most populated mean motion resonances (MMR) with Neptune and\nlying close to the inner boundary of the present day cold classical disk,\nobservations of the orbital and surface class distributions of the plutinos in\nthe 3:2 MMR provide constraints on Neptune's migration and insight into the\ncompositional structure of the pre-migration planetesimal disk. Here, we\npresent observations of the surface reflectance of 43 small to mid-size (H_V >~\n5) transneptunian objects (TNOs) through the grz wavelength range, 14 of which\nare plutinos. We classify the surfaces of these TNOs using the two-surface\nclass model (FaintIR and BrightIR surface classes) proposed by Fraser and\ncollaborators, where the FaintIR surface class is dominated by cold classicals.\nIncorporating similar observations of plutinos from the literature for a total\nsample size of 43 plutinos, we find that the osculating inclination\ndistributions (i_osc) of the FaintIR and BrightIR plutinos are statistically\ndistinguishable at 99.3% significance, where (6/7) of the plutinos with i_osc >\n4.5{\\deg} have FaintIR surfaces. This is most easily explained if the FaintIR\nand BrightIR planetesimals were radially partitioned in the primordial\nplanetesimal disk before being captured into the 3:2 resonance. While this\ncould be evidence that the primordial cold classical disk with FaintIR surfaces\nwas broader in the past by ~3 au in the sunward direction, we cannot rule out\nthe alternative explanation that these FaintIR plutinos were scattered from the\n~42.5-48 au region from the Sun and captured into the 3:2 resonance.",

While typically produced in interactions involving charged\nparticles, they could also originate from exotic sources such as annihilations\nof magnetically charged monopole-antimonopole pairs or decays of highly\naccelerated monopoles (10^{21} eV). Detecting such photons would impose\nconstraints on monopole properties. Despite strong theoretical motivations and\nextensive experimental searches, no monopoles have been observed to date. A\npossible explanation beyond high monopole masses arises from Staruszkiewicz's\nquantum theory of infrared electromagnetic fields. His argument, rooted in the\npositivity of the Hilbert space norm, suggests that isolated magnetic monopoles\nmay not be physically realizable.

An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER\nalgorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and\nskin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices\nemployed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two\nstate-of-the-art FER datasets.

It is assumed that particle-antiparticle pair creation\noccurs; however, the system is simultaneously subject to exact charge (isospin)\nconservation. To implement this constraint, we first consider the system within\nthe Grand Canonical Ensemble and then transform to the Canonical Ensemble using\na Legendre transformation. This procedure provides a formally consistent scheme\nfor incorporating the chemical potential at the microscopic level into the\nCanonical Ensemble framework. To enforce exact conservation of charge (isospin,\nN_I), we further analyze the thermodynamic properties of the system within the\nextended Canonical Ensemble, in which the chemical potential becomes a\nthermodynamic function of the temperature and conserved charge. It is shown\nthat as the temperature decreases, the system undergoes a second-order phase\ntransition to a Bose-Einstein condensate at the critical temperature T_c, but\nonly when the conserved charge is finite, N_I=const \\ne 0. In a\nparticle-antiparticle system, the condensate forms exclusively in the component\nwith the dominant particle number density, which determines the excess charge.\nWe demonstrate that the symmetry breaking of the ground state at T=0 results\nfrom a first-order phase transition associated with the formation of a\nBose-Einstein condensate. Although the transition involves symmetry breaking,\nit is not spontaneous in the strict field-theoretic sense, but is instead\ninduced by the external injection of particles. Potential experimental signals\nof Bose-Einstein condensation of pions produced in high-energy nuclear\ncollisions are briefly discussed.",

This has sparked\nsignificant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with\nthe necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and\nAI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy\nconsumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering\nboth near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and\nbeyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net\npositive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally,\nwe discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive\nworkflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and\nconsumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely\nstrain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and\ntherefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of\nbig data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and\ncomplex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and\napplications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more\npromising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its\nability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from\nenergy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon\nfootprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial\nemissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where\ntraditional solutions have fallen short.

Emerging neuromorphic architectures aim to combine traditional\ndigital designs with the computational efficiency of analog computing and novel\ndevice technologies. A crucial problem in the rapid exploration and co-design\nof such architectures is the lack of tools for fast and accurate modeling and\nsimulation. Typical mixed-signal design tools integrate a digital simulator\nwith an analog solver like SPICE, which is prohibitively slow for large\nsystems. By contrast, behavioral modeling of analog components is faster, but\nexisting approaches are fixed to specific architectures with limited energy and\nperformance modeling. In this paper, we propose LASANA, a novel approach that\nleverages machine learning to derive data-driven surrogate models of analog\nsub-blocks in a digital backend architecture. LASANA uses SPICE-level\nsimulations of a circuit to train ML models that predict circuit energy,\nperformance, and behavior at analog/digital interfaces. Such models can provide\nenergy and performance annotation on top of existing behavioral models or\nfunction as replacements to analog simulation. We apply LASANA to an analog\ncrossbar array and a spiking neuron circuit.

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in\nnumerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for\nprocessing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended\noutputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in\nLLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we\npropose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free\nmethod for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables\nLLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range\nmodeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without\nrunning out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key\ninnovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only\nsequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from\nshallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range\ndependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range\ncapabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively\ncompresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache\nsize. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective\ncontinuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across\nvarious tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's\neffectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities.

Thus, organizations\ninvolved in the fight against sex trafficking often use ASW data when\nattempting to identify potential sex trafficking victims. A critical challenge\nin transforming ASW data into actionable insight is text analysis. Previous\nresearch using ASW data has shown that ASW ad text is important for linking\nads. However, working with this text is challenging due to its extensive use of\nemojis, poor grammar, and deliberate obfuscation to evade law enforcement\nscrutiny. We conduct a comprehensive study of language modeling approaches for\nthis application area, including simple information retrieval methods,\npre-trained transformers, and custom transformer models. We demonstrate that\ncharacteristics of ASW text data allow efficient custom transformer models to\nbe trained with relatively small GPU resources and used efficiently for\ninference on consumer hardware.

However, because of the high level of\nmeasurement noise, current reconstruction methods still leave room for\nimprovement. Furthermore, reconstruction efforts typically focus only on a\nsingle aspect of the signal, such as the energy fluence or arrival time.\nBayesian inference is then a natural choice for a holistic approach to\nreconstruction, yet, this problem would be ill-posed, since the electric field\nis a continuous quantity. Information Field Theory provides the solution for\nthis by providing a statistical framework to deal with discretised fields in\nthe continuum limit. We are currently developing models for this novel approach\nto reconstructing extensive air showers. The model described here is based on\nthe best current understanding of the emission mechanisms: It uses\nparametrisations of the lateral signal strength distribution, charge-excess\ncontribution and spectral shape. Shower-to-shower fluctuations and narrowband\nRFI are modelled using Gaussian processes. Combined with a detailed detector\ndescription, this model can infer not only the electric field, but also the\nshower geometry, electromagnetic energy and position of shower maximum. Another\nbig achievement of this approach is its ability to naturally provide\nuncertainties for the reconstruction, which has been shown to be difficult in\nmore traditional methods. With such an open framework and robust computational\nmethods based in Information Field Theory, it will also be easy to incorporate\nnew insights and additional data, such as timing distributions or particle\ndetector data, in the future. This approach has a high potential to exploit the\nfull information content of a complex detector with rigorous statistical\nmethods, in a way that directly includes domain knowledge.",

First, we extend the finite,\nnonlocal quantum field theories to derive a modified Bethe--Salpeter equation\nfor heavy quark--antiquark bound states, incorporating exponential regulator\nfunctions that render all loop amplitudes UV finite. We show that nonlocal\npropagators induce characteristic shifts in the resonance mass and width, which\ncan be contrasted directly with LHC data. By fixing the nonlocal regulator\nscale in the strong sector, our framework yields a prediction of an $\\approx\n8.3\\,\\mathrm{pb}$ enhancement, in excellent agreement with the CMS measurement\nof $8.8 \\pm 1.3\\,\\mathrm{pb}$. We analyze the renormalization group flow of the\nstrong coupling near the top--pair threshold, introducing a holomorphic\ndeformation inspired by unified field--theoretic constructions. We find that\nthe modified $\\beta$-function softens the running of $\\alpha_s$, giving an\nenhancement of the threshold cross-section. Third, we present a systematic\ncomparison of charmonium, bottomonium, and toponium, quantifying differences in\nbinding energies, lifetimes, and production signatures. In particular, the top\nquark's large width precludes long-lived bound states, so that toponium appears\nonly as a transient threshold resonance.

Attempts to extend Scarf's celebrated distribution-free ordering\nrule using risk measures have led to conflicting prescriptions: CVaR-based\nmodels invariably recommend ordering less as risk aversion increases, while\nmean-standard deviation models -- paradoxically -- suggest ordering more,\nparticularly when ordering costs are high. We resolve this behavioral paradox\nthrough a coherent generalization of Scarf's distribution-free framework,\nmodeling risk aversion via distortion functionals from dual utility theory.\nDespite the generality of this class, we derive closed-form optimal ordering\nrules for any coherent risk preference. These rules uncover a consistent\nbehavioral principle: a more risk-averse newsvendor may rationally order more\nwhen overstocking is inexpensive (i.e., when the cost-to-price ratio is low),\nbut will always order less when ordering is costly. Our framework offers a more\nnuanced, managerially intuitive, and behaviorally coherent understanding of\nrisk-averse inventory decisions. It exposes the limitations of non-coherent\nmodels, delivers interpretable and easy-to-compute ordering rules grounded in\ncoherent preferences, and unifies prior work under a single, tractable\napproach.

During\ninference, the model maintains high accuracy on benign samples but\nmisclassifies poisoned samples into an attacker-specified target class.\nExisting research on backdoor attacks has explored developing triggers in the\nspatial, spectral (frequency), and semantic (feature) domains, aiming to make\nthem stealthy. While some approaches have considered designing triggers that\nare imperceptible in both spatial and spectral domains, few have incorporated\nthe semantic domain. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack, termed\n3S-attack, which is stealthy across the spatial, spectral, and semantic\ndomains. The key idea is to exploit the semantic features of benign samples as\ntriggers, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and a\npreliminary model for extraction. The trigger is then embedded in the spectral\ndomain, followed by pixel-level restrictions after converting the samples back\nto the spatial domain. This process minimizes the distance between poisoned and\nbenign samples, making the attack harder to detect by existing defenses and\nhuman inspection. Extensive experiments on various datasets, along with\ntheoretical analysis, demonstrate the stealthiness of 3S-attack and highlight\nthe need for stronger defenses to ensure AI security.

By introducing entire-function\nregulators $F(\\Box) = \\exp\\!\\bigl(\\Box / M_*^2\\bigr)$ into the holomorphic\nEinstein-Hilbert action, we achieve perturbative UV finiteness at all loop\norders, while preserving BRST invariance and holomorphic gauge symmetry. We\nderive the modified gauge-gravity coupling sector, perform a one-loop\neffective-action computation in a contour-regularized metric background, and\ndemonstrate the absence of new counterterms and problematic complex-pole\nstructures. Extending the construction to nontrivial curved backgrounds, we\nverify infrared recovery of General Relativity and full holomorphic gauge\ninvariance. Finally, we explore phenomenological consequences, including\ncorrected graviton and gauge-boson scattering amplitudes in self-dual\nbackgrounds, finite Hawking spectra for regularized Schwarzschild and Kerr\ngeometries, and proposed tests of the equivalence principle. This work lays the\nfoundation for a self-consistent, unitary four-dimensional quantum-gravity and\nHolomorphic Unified Field Theory framework.",

Finally, this distance is easy to\ncompute.\n  We show that $\\epsilon$-distance is also the greatest fixpoint of a\nfunctional and provides a functor.

Just-in-time vulnerability prediction (JIT-VP)\nis a proactive approach to identifying vulnerable commits and providing early\nwarnings about potential security risks. However, we observe that current\nJIT-VP evaluations rely on an idealized setting, where the evaluation datasets\nare artificially balanced, consisting exclusively of vulnerability-introducing\nand vulnerability-fixing commits. To address this limitation, this study\nassesses the effectiveness of JIT-VP techniques under a more realistic setting\nthat includes both vulnerability-related and vulnerability-neutral commits. To\nenable a reliable evaluation, we introduce a large-scale public dataset\ncomprising over one million commits from FFmpeg and the Linux kernel. Our\nempirical analysis of eight state-of-the-art JIT-VP techniques reveals a\nsignificant decline in predictive performance when applied to real-world\nconditions; for example, the average PR-AUC on Linux drops 98% from 0.805 to\n0.016. This discrepancy is mainly attributed to the severe class imbalance in\nreal-world datasets, where vulnerability-introducing commits constitute only a\nsmall fraction of all commits. To mitigate this issue, we explore the\neffectiveness of widely adopted techniques for handling dataset imbalance,\nincluding customized loss functions, oversampling, and undersampling.\nSurprisingly, our experimental results indicate that these techniques are\nineffective in addressing the imbalance problem in JIT-VP. These findings\nunderscore the importance of realistic evaluations of JIT-VP and the need for\ndomain-specific techniques to address data imbalance in such scenarios.",

We propose EDR-MQ (Extracting Document Relations by\nMarginalizing over User Queries), a novel framework that discovers document\nrelationships through query marginalization. EDR-MQ is based on the insight\nthat strongly related documents often co-occur in results across diverse user\nqueries, enabling us to estimate joint probabilities between document pairs by\nmarginalizing over a collection of queries. To enable this query\nmarginalization approach, we develop Multiply Conditioned Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (MC-RAG), which employs conditional retrieval where subsequent\ndocument retrievals depend on previously retrieved content. By observing\nco-occurrence patterns across diverse queries, EDR-MQ estimates joint\nprobabilities between document pairs without requiring labeled training data or\npredefined taxonomies. Experimental results show that our query marginalization\napproach successfully identifies meaningful document relationships, revealing\ntopical clusters, evidence chains, and cross-domain connections that are not\napparent through traditional similarity-based methods.

However, the number of actinide-based\nsystems that exhibit this type of behavior is rather limited. In this work, we\npresent the discovery and characterization of a uranium compound U2Rh2Sb, which\nturns out to be a candidate for the intermediate-valencebehavior. The material\nshows a characteristic feature in the magnetic susceptibility around T = 50 K,\nwhich can be described within the interconfiguration-fluctuation model of\nintermediate valence systems. We find the energy difference between the\n5f3(U3+) and 5f2(U4+) states to be $\\delta$Eex/kB $\\approx$ 400 K and the\ncorresponding valence fluctuation temperature to be Tvf $\\approx$ 140 K. The\nvalue of the electronic specific heat coefficient $\\gamma$ = 50 mJ mol-1 U K-2\nsignals a modest electron effective mass enhancement. The electrical\nresistivity indicates metallic behavior, albeit with a small residual\nresistivity ratio. Measurements of thermoelectric properties indicate a change\nof sign in the Seebeck coefficient around T = 100 K, with a minimum achieved at\nT = 50 K, which coincides with the broad peak observed in magnetic\nsusceptibility. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical\nanalysis, based on the first-principles calculations, including lattice\ndynamics.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Context. The Dust Settling Instabilty (DSI) is a member of the Resonant Drag\nInstabilities (RDI) family, and is thus related to the Streaming Instability\n(SI). Linear calculations found that the unstratified monodisperse DSI has\ngrowth rates much higher than the SI even with lower initial dust to gas\nratios. However, recent nonlinear investigation found no evidence of strong\ndust clumping at the saturation level. Aims. To investigate the nonlinear\nsaturation of the mono- and polydisperse DSI. We examine the convergence\nbehaviour wrt. both the numerical resolution and the number of species. By\ncharacterising the morphology of the dust evolution triggered by the DSI, we\ncan shed more light on its role in planetesimal formation. Methods. We perform\na suite of 2D shearing box hydro simulations with the code Idefix, both in the\nmono- and polydisperse regimes. We focus on the time evolution of the maximum\ndust density, noting the time at which the instability is triggered, as well as\nanalyse the morphology of the resultant structure. Results. In our monodisperse\nsimulations, the maximum dust density increases and the instability saturates\nearlier with higher spatial resolution, with no signs of convergence. The\npolydisperse simulations do seem to converge with the number of species and\nproduce maximum dust densities that are comparable to, albeit lower than, the\nmonodisperse simulations. Different dust species tend to form adjacent but\nseparate dust filaments, which may have implications on dust growth and further\nclumping. Conclusions. The monodisperse DSI produces dust structure at\ndensities high enough that likely leads to clumping. The polydisperse DSI\nproduces lower but comparable dust densities. Our idealised treatment suggests\nthat the DSI is important for planetesimal formation, as it suffers less than\nthe SI from including a dust size distribution.",

We then use our approach as impurity solver for\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) to address the case of a two-orbital,\nrealistic layered structure, recovering the strong crystal-field-driven charge\npolarization observed by solving the DMFT self-consistent cycle with QMC,\nalbeit slightly reduced. Finally, we address a prototype nonequilibrium setup\nby sandwiching this layer between metallic contacts subject to a bias voltage\ndescribed by different chemical potentials. This simplified model demonstrates\nout method's potential to access nonequilibrium steady-state behavior of\nmulti-orbital, realistic materials. These findings provide a first-step basis\nfor theoretical studies of nonequilibrium properties of multi-orbital compounds\ndirectly in the real frequency domain.",

Our analysis employs a full-band continuum\nmodel to capture the relevant physical phenomena.

We observe sharp resonant\ntunneling features emerging from quantum interference effects induced by\nmagnetic confinement. A key outcome of our study is the discovery of distinct\nresonance patterns in the conduction and valence bands. These patterns are\nclosely related to the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in MoS$_2$ and the\nbreaking of time-reversal symmetry by the magnetic field. This results in\nsignificant spin and valley selectivity in electron transport. We demonstrate\nthat adjusting external parameters precisely controls spin-polarized and\nvalley-polarized currents.

    "abstract": "Spectroscopic anomaly detection and isotope identification algorithms are\nintegral components in nuclear nonproliferation applications such as search\noperations. The task is especially challenging in the case of mobile detector\nsystems due to the fact that the observed gamma-ray background changes more\nthan for a static detector system, and a pretrained background model can easily\nfind itself out of domain. The result is that algorithms may exceed their\nintended false alarm rate, or sacrifice detection sensitivity in order to\nmaintain the desired false alarm rate. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)\nhas been shown to be a powerful tool for spectral anomaly detection and\nidentification, but, like many similar algorithms that rely on data-driven\nbackground models, in its conventional implementation it is unable to update in\nreal time to account for environmental changes that affect the background\nspectroscopic signature. We have developed a novel NMF-based algorithm that\nperiodically updates its background model to accommodate changing environmental\nconditions. The Adaptive NMF algorithm involves fewer assumptions about its\nenvironment, making it more generalizable than existing NMF-based methods while\nmaintaining or exceeding detection performance on simulated and real-world\ndatasets.",

We introduce a neural-surrogate\n(neural-network--based approximation of the posterior distribution) framework\nthat predicts the coefficients of known covariate-dependent rate functions\ndirectly from noisy, partially observed token trajectories. Our model employs a\nlightweight 1D Convolutional Residual Network trained end-to-end on\nGillespie-simulated SPN realizations, learning to invert system dynamics under\nrealistic conditions of event dropout. During inference, Monte Carlo dropout\nprovides calibrated uncertainty bounds together with point estimates. On\nsynthetic SPNs with 20% missing events, our surrogate recovers rate-function\ncoefficients with an RMSE = 0.108 and substantially runs faster than\ntraditional Bayesian approaches.

For turbines experiencing\nstall-flutter instability, the influence of gravity on performance metrics is\nminimal when inertial forces dominate or are comparable to gravitational\nforces. At high Froude numbers, buoyancy and weight are negligible, but their\nimpact increases at lower Froude numbers, leading to reduced performance.\nConversely, turbines operating through coupled-flutter instability seem\nunsuitable for horizontal configurations since they require high foil moment of\ninertia and mass, which amplifies the effects of buoyancy and weight, thereby\ndiminishing performance at any Froude number.",

We first\ncompute a locality graph on d-simplices, using the dihedral angle in between\nadjacent simplices as the graph weights, and then compute infinity path\ndistances in this simplex graph. This procedure gives a metric on simplices\nwhich we refer to as the largest angle path distance (LAPD). We analyze the\nproperties of LAPD under random sampling, and prove that with an appropriate\ndenoising procedure, this metric separates the manifold components with high\nprobability. We validate the proposed methodology with extensive numerical\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets. These experiments\ndemonstrate that the method is robust to noise, curvature, and small\nintersection angle, and generally out-performs other MMC algorithms. In\naddition, we provide a highly scalable implementation of the proposed\nalgorithm, which leverages approximation schemes for infinity path distance to\nachieve quasi-linear computational complexity.",

They play an important role in areas\nsuch as coding theory, optimization, and combinatorial geometry, where linear\nstructure is crucial for both theoretical insights and algorithmic\napplications. Since deciding skew-representability is computationally\nintractable, much effort has been focused on identifying necessary or\nsufficient conditions for a matroid to be skew-representable.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to studying\nskew-representability and structural properties of matroids and polymatroid\nfunctions via tensor products. We provide a characterization of\nskew-representable matroids, as well as of those representable over skew fields\nof a given prime characteristic, in terms of tensor products. As an algorithmic\nconsequence, we show that deciding skew-representability, or representability\nover a skew field of fixed prime characteristic, is co-recursively enumerable:\nthat is, certificates of non-skew-representability -- in general or over a\nfixed prime characteristic -- can be verified. We also prove that every rank-3\nmatroid admits a tensor product with any uniform matroid and give a\nconstruction yielding the unique freest tensor product in this setting.\nFinally, as an application of the tensor product framework, we give a new proof\nof Ingleton's inequality and, more importantly, derive the first known linear\nrank inequality for folded skew-representable matroids that does not follow\nfrom the common information property.",

    "abstract": "In this study we introduce a symbolic dataset composed of non-metric Iranian\nclassical music, and algorithms for structural parsing of this music, and\ngeneration of variations. The corpus comprises MIDI files and data sheets of\nDastgah Shour from Radif Mirza Abdollah, the foundational repertoire of Iranian\nclassical music. Furthermore, we apply our previously-introduced algorithm for\nparsing melodic structure (Kanani et al., 2023b)to the dataset. Unlike much\nWestern music, this type of non-metric music does not follow bar-centric\norganisation. The non-metric organisation can be captured well by our parsing\nalgorithm. We parse each tune (Gusheh) into a grammar to identify motifs and\nphrases. These grammar representations can be useful for educational and\nethnomusicological purposes. We also further develop a previously-introduced\nmethod of creating melodic variations (Kanani et al., 2023b). After parsing an\nexisting tune to produce a grammar, by applying mutations to this grammar, we\ngenerate a new grammar. Expanding this new version yields a variation of the\noriginal tune. Variations are assessed by a domain-expert listener.\nAdditionally, we conduct a statistical analysis of mutation with different\nrepresentation setups for our parsing and generation algorithms. The\noverarching conclusion is that the system successfully produces acceptable\nvariations post-mutation. While our case study focuses on Iranian classical\nmusic, the methodology can be adapted for Arabic or Turkish classical music.",

    ],
    "abstract": "Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete\nrenewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called contacts. It is\nwell known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase\ntransition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive\nand the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm\nof the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the\ndelocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is\ndiscontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than\nthe minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to\ncreate one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest\nof the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it\nis known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this big jump phenomenon\nis no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned\nsystem is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we\nshow that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in\nparticular the largest gap is $O(\\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting\nthe improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models\ndeveloped in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a\nquenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect\nof disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as\nan important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a\nsmoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions,\nthus generalizing [11,32].",

    "abstract": "Two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRAs) are designed to maintain accurate\ndirection estimation even in the event of a single sensor failure, leveraging\nthe deliberate coarray redundancy infused into their design. Robust Minimum\nRedundancy Arrays (RMRAs), a specialized class of TFRAs, optimize this\nredundancy to achieve the maximum possible aperture for a given number of\nsensors. However, finding optimal RMRA configurations is an NP-hard problem,\nwith prior research reporting optimal solutions only for arrays of up to ten\nsensors. This paper presents newly discovered optimal RMRA configurations for\narray sizes 11 to 15, identified using a novel Leap-on-Success exhaustive\nsearch algorithm that efficiently reduces computational effort by terminating\nthe search upon locating optimal solutions. The robustness of these arrays was\nvalidated under all single-element failure scenarios using MATLAB simulations,\nconfirming their superior resilience compared to some existing TFRAs vulnerable\nto failures at specific sensor positions. Furthermore, near-optimal\nconfigurations for array sizes 16 to 20 are also reported, highlighting the\npotential applicability of the proposed method for larger array designs given\nsufficient computational resources. This work not only advances the\nstate-of-the-art in RMRA design but also introduces an effective search\nmethodology that can be leveraged for future explorations in array\nconfiguration optimization.",

    "abstract": "Developing accurate numerical methods for strongly interacting fermions is\ncrucial for improving our understanding of various quantum many-body phenomena,\nespecially unconventional superconductivity. Recently, neural quantum states\nhave emerged as a promising approach for studying correlated fermions,\nhighlighted by the hidden fermion and backflow methods, which use neural\nnetworks to model corrections to fermionic quasiparticle orbitals. In this\nwork, we expand these ideas to the space of Pfaffians, a wave-function that\nnaturally expresses superconducting pairings, and propose the hidden fermion\nPfaffian state (HFPS), which flexibly represents both unpaired and\nsuperconducting phases and scales to large systems with favorable asymptotic\ncomplexity. In our numerical experiments, HFPS provides state-of-the-art\nvariational accuracy in different regimes of both the attractive and repulsive\nHubbard models. We show that the HFPS is able to capture both s-wave and d-wave\npairing, and therefore may be a useful tool for modeling phases with\nunconventional superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "Seasonally adjusted series are usually used to analyse the business cycle and\nturning points. When the irregular is too high, it is preferable to smooth the\nseries in order to analyse the trend-cycle component directly. This study\nfocuses on the real-time estimation of the trend-cycle component around shocks\nand turning points. The linear moving averages classically used for estimating\nthe trend-cycle, which are sensitive to the presence of atypical points, are\ncompared with robust non-linear methods. We also propose a methodology for\nextending the Henderson and Musgrave moving averages to take account of\nexternal information and thus construct moving averages that are robust to the\npresence of certain shocks. We describe how to estimate confidence intervals\nfor estimates derived from moving averages, thereby validating the use of these\nnew moving averages. By comparing the methods on simulated and real series, we\nshow that: building robust moving averages makes it possible to reduce\nrevisions and better model turning points around shocks, without degrading the\nestimates when no shock is observed; robust non-linear methods do not make it\npossible to extract a trend-cycle component that is satisfactory for economic\nanalysis, with sometimes significant revisions.

Otherwise, the states are locally distinguishable.\nHowever, locally indistinguishable states may find applications in information\nprocessing protocols. In this sense, locally indistinguishable states are\nuseful. On the other hand, it is usual to consider that locally distinguishable\nstates are useless. Nevertheless, recent works suggest that locally\ndistinguishable states should be given due consideration as in certain\nsituations these states can be converted to locally indistinguishable states\nunder orthogonality-preserving LOCC (OP-LOCC). Such a counterintuitive\nphenomenon motivates us to ask when the aforesaid conversion is possible and\nwhen it is not. In this work, we provide different structures of locally\ndistinguishable product and entangled states which do not allow the aforesaid\nconversion. We also provide certain structures of locally distinguishable\nstates which allow the aforesaid conversion. In this way, we classify the\nlocally distinguishable sets by introducing hierarchies among them. In a\nmultipartite system, this study becomes more involved as there exist\nmultipartite locally distinguishable sets which cannot be converted to locally\nindistinguishable sets by OP-LOCC across any bipartition.

This forms the basis for a\ntopological classification of the local causal structure in terms of the number\nof connected spacelike and timelike regions on the triangulated 2-sphere\nsurrounding the vertex. These local causal data allow us to identify regular\ncausal structures and new types of causal irregular configurations,\ngeneralizing well-known (1+1)-dimensional topologies, such as `Trousers' and\n`Yarmulkes', to higher dimensions.\n  We further investigate the dynamical implications of vertex causality by\nanalyzing the behaviour of deficit angles and the Regge action in explicit\nconfigurations.

We first analyze the general analytical\nproperties of these objects in various contexts, including the time-evolution\noperator of non-interacting Hamiltonians and Haar-random unitaries. We then\nperform a numerical investigation of the natural super-orbitals corresponding\nto both the time-evolution operator and a time-evolved local operator, focusing\non two many-body systems: the fermionic $t\\text{-}V$ chain and an impurity\nmodel, using tensor network simulations. Our results reveal that the\n$t\\text{-}V$ model lacks a preferred super-orbital basis, while in the impurity\nmodel, the occupations of the natural orbitals for both operators decay\nexponentially at all times. This indicates that only a small number of orbitals\ncontribute significantly to quantum correlations, enabling a compact\nmatrix-product-operator representation and a reduced non-stabilizerness in the\nnatural orbital basis. Finally, we examine the spatial spread of the natural\norbitals for time-evolved local operators in the impurity model and show that\nthe complexity of this operator in the natural orbital basis saturates over\ntime. This new framework opens the door to future research that leverages the\ncompressed structure of operators in their natural super-orbital basis,\nenabling for instance the computation of out-of-time-order correlators in large\ninteracting systems over extended time scales.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) methods primarily focus on\nuniform brightness adjustment, often neglecting instance-level semantic\ninformation and the inherent characteristics of different features. To address\nthese limitations, we propose CWNet (Causal Wavelet Network), a novel\narchitecture that leverages wavelet transforms for causal reasoning.\nSpecifically, our approach comprises two key components: 1) Inspired by the\nconcept of intervention in causality, we adopt a causal reasoning perspective\nto reveal the underlying causal relationships in low-light enhancement. From a\nglobal perspective, we employ a metric learning strategy to ensure causal\nembeddings adhere to causal principles, separating them from non-causal\nconfounding factors while focusing on the invariance of causal factors. At the\nlocal level, we introduce an instance-level CLIP semantic loss to precisely\nmaintain causal factor consistency. 2) Based on our causal analysis, we present\na wavelet transform-based backbone network that effectively optimizes the\nrecovery of frequency information, ensuring precise enhancement tailored to the\nspecific attributes of wavelet transforms. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat CWNet significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across\nmultiple datasets, showcasing its robust performance across diverse scenes.\nCode is available at https://github.com/bywlzts/CWNet-Causal-Wavelet-Network.",

To quantify magic, we use the\nStabilizer R\\'enyi Entropy (SRE), which we compute numerically via a perfect\nsampling algorithm. We show that although the SRE remains extensive as the\nsystem transitions from a critical phase to an area-law (disentangled) phase,\nthe structure of magic itself undergoes a delocalization phase transition. This\ntransition is characterized using the bipartite stabilizer mutual information,\nwhich exhibits the same scaling behavior as entanglement entropy: logarithmic\nscaling in the critical phase and a finite constant in the area-law phase.\nAdditionally, we explore the dynamics of SRE. While the total SRE becomes\nextensive in $O(1)$ time, we find that in the critical phase, the relaxation\ntime to the steady-state value is parameterically longer than that in generic\nrandom circuits. The relaxation follows a universal form, with a relaxation\ntime that grows linearly with the system size, providing further evidence for\nthe critical nature of the phase.",

Remarkably, signatures of\nquantum criticality persist over an exceptionally broad range of magnetic\nfields and are well described by the formation of a quantum Griffiths phase, a\nregime in which rare spatially extended regions develop local order within a\nglobally disordered phase. This leads to a quantum phase transition governed by\nan infinite-randomness fixed point and characterized by ultraslow relaxation\ndynamics. Near the quantum critical region, transport measurements reveal\nstrongly nonlinear electrical behavior, including a current-driven reentrant\ntransition from insulating to superconducting transport, providing direct\nevidence of local superconducting order. By tilting the magnetic field, we are\nable to collapse the broad Griffiths regime into a single quantum critical\npoint, QCP, demonstrating a striking level of control over disorder induced\nquantum dynamics.

If\nthey originate from neutron stars (NSs), the existence of such ultra-long\nperiod pulsars (ULPs) challenges our current understanding of NS evolution and\nemission. In this work, we propose a new channel for disk formation based on\nNSs born in close binaries with main-sequence companion stars. Using a\nhydrodynamic simulation of supernova-companion interactions, we show that a\nnewborn NS may gravitationally capture gas as it moves through the complex\ndensity field shaped by the explosion. For a binary separation of\n$20\\rm~R_\\odot$ and a companion mass of $4\\rm~M_\\odot$, we find the occurrence\nfraction for disk formation around unbound NSs to be $\\sim10\\%$. By modeling\nthe disk evolution and its interaction with the NS, we find a bimodal\ndistribution in spin periods: canonical pulsars with $P\\lesssim10\\rm\\,s$ are\nthe ones who lack disks or whose magnetospheres never interacted with the disk,\nand ULPs with $10^3\\lesssim P<10^5\\rm\\,s$ are produced when the system\nundergoes a short-lived ``propeller'' phase during which the NS undergoes rapid\nspin-down. Such ULPs are formed under strong initial dipolar magnetic field\nstrengths $B_0\\gtrsim10^{14}\\rm\\,G$, with a formation rate of\n$10^{-4}\\rm\\,yr^{-1}$ in the Milky Way. We also find that a small population of\npulsars with moderate magnetic field strengths\n($10^{13}\\lesssim~B_0\\lesssim10^{14}\\rm\\,G$) and relatively slow initial\nperiods ($P_0\\gtrsim0.1\\rm\\,s$) evolve to $P\\sim10^2\\rm\\,s$, filling the gap\nbetween the bimodal distribution. Thus, our model provides a unified\nexplanation for pulsars beyond the ``death line.''",

Using a new empirical scaling linking the [Ne v] line\nemission with AGN accretion-driven (continuum) emission, derived from a highly\ncomplete low-redshift AGN sample, we show that the [Ne v] emission in the two z\n> 5 galaxies implies total (bolometric) AGN luminosities of order\nL_bol~(4-8)x10^45 erg/s. Assuming that the radiation emitted from these systems\nis Eddington limited, the (minimal) black hole masses are of order M_BH>10^7\nM_sun. Combined with the published stellar masses of the galaxies, estimated\nfrom dedicated fitting of their spectral energy distributions, the implied\nBH-to-stellar mass ratios are of order M_BH/M_host~0.1-1. This is considerably\nhigher than what is found in the local Universe, but is consistent with the\ngeneral trend seen in some other z > 5 AGN. Given the intrinsic weakness of the\n[Ne v] line and the nature of the [Ne v]-to-L_bol scaling, any (rare) detection\nof the [Ne v] $\\lambda$3427 line at z > 5 would translate to similarly high AGN\nluminosities and SMBH masses, thus providing a unique observational path for\nstudying luminous AGN well into the epoch of reionization, including obscured\nsources.",

In addition to the traditional AGN feedback modes, negative\n(suppressing cooling), and the new positive mode (triggering star formation),\nwe introduce two implementations of a third mode: the ejection of hot gas\nbeyond the virial radius, AGNeject1 and AGNeject2. This component addresses a\nlongstanding issue in semi-analytic models and hydrodynamical simulations: the\noverestimation of hot gas fractions in low and intermediate mass halos. FEGA25\nis calibrated via MCMC using a suite of cosmological N-body simulations YS50HR,\nYS200, and YS300, and a comprehensive set of observed stellar mass functions\nacross a wide redshift range. We find that supernova feedback dominates gas\nejection in halos with logM_{halo} < approximately 12, while AGN feedback\nbecomes increasingly important at higher halo masses. The AGNeject2 model,\nwhich activates primarily at late times, redshift < 1, reproduces a\ncharacteristic cavity, a U shaped feature in the baryon fraction at redshift\nzero, similar to trends observed in simulations like SIMBA and IllustrisTNG.\nConversely, AGNeject1 yields a smoother, redshift independent evolution.

    "abstract": "Observations of the hydrogen hyperfine transition through the 21 cm line near\nthe end of the cosmic dark ages provide unique opportunities to probe new\nphysics. In this work, we investigate the potential of the sky-averaged 21 cm\nsignal to constrain metastable particles produced in the early universe that\ndecay at later times, thereby modifying the thermal and ionization history of\nthe intergalactic medium. The study begins by extending previous analyses of\ndecaying dark matter (DM), incorporating back-reaction effects and tightening\nphoton decay constraints down to DM masses as low as 20.4 eV. The focus then\nshifts to non-minimal dark sectors with multiple interacting components. The\nanalysis covers two key scenarios: a hybrid setup comprising a stable cold DM\ncomponent alongside a metastable sub-component, and a two-component dark sector\nof nearly degenerate states with a metastable heavier partner. A general\nparameterization based on effective mass spectra and fractional densities\nallows for a model-independent study. The final part presents two explicit\nrealizations: an axion-like particle coupled to photons, and pseudo-Dirac DM\ninteracting via vector portals or electromagnetic dipoles. These scenarios\nillustrate how 21 cm cosmology can set leading bounds and probe otherwise\ninaccessible regions of parameter space.",

Using $N$-body simulations, we find that the planet could be\ndynamically stable at a mutual angle inclination up to $\\sim75^\\circ$. The von\nZeipel-Lidov-Kozai (vZLK) mechanism becomes active when the mutual inclination\nis greater than 39.2$^\\circ$. High-inclination orbits exhibit coupled\noscillations in eccentricity and inclination, along with apsidal precession.\nSynthetic radial velocity (RV) modeling shows that these secular variations\nproduce measurable signatures across a broad range of timescales, from full\nvZLK cycles to observationally accessible decades. For instance, a high mutual\ninclination at 75$^\\circ$ can induce RV drifts exceeding 5 m s$^{-1}$ per\nplanetary orbit ($\\sim 1.9 \\,\\text{m s}^{-1}\\, \\text{yr}^{-1}$) in circular\nbinary configurations. The presence of eccentric vZLK further accelerates these\ndrifts, enhancing the detectability. Long-term RV observations of this system\noffer a unique pathway to dynamically constrain the orbital inclination, and\nthus determine the true mass of HD 41004 Ab. The degeneracy of mass-inclination\nis well known when using RV measurements alone. Our results highlight that HD\n41004Ab and potentially other S-type planets in compact binaries are promising\ntargets for breaking such a degeneracy by studying the dynamics induced by the\nvZLK mechanism through long-term high-precision RV monitoring.",

In a number of instances, however,\nthe exact nature of the corresponding ground states remains the subject of\nongoing debate. We show that general symmetry considerations can rule out\ncandidate states that are incompatible with the observed ferrimagnetic\nbehavior. In particular, we demonstrate that a ferrimagnetic response cannot be\nreconciled with a collinear zigzag ground state, owing to the combined\ntime-reversal and translational symmetry inherent to that configuration.\nInstead, the observed behavior is fully compatible with the symmetries of\nnoncollinear multi-$\\mathbf q$ states, such as the triple-$\\mathbf q$ discussed\nin the context of Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. We exemplify this general result by\ncomputing the ferrimagnetic response of an extended Heisenberg-Kitaev-Gamma\nmodel with explicit sublattice symmetry breaking within linear spin-wave\ntheory. If the model realizes a triple-$\\mathbf q$ ground state, the calculated\nmagnetization curve is well consistent with the low-temperature behavior\nobserved in Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$. In this case, a finite magnetization remains\nin the zero-temperature limit as a consequence of quantum fluctuations, even if\nthe $g$-factors on the different sublattices are identical. For a zigzag ground\nstate, by contrast, the total magnetization vanishes both at zero and finite\ntemperatures, independent of possible sublattice-dependent $g$-factors, as\nexpected from the symmetry analysis. The implications of our general result for\nother Kitaev materials exhibiting ferrimagnetic behavior are also briefly\ndiscussed.",

We clarify the relation of this encoding to observer-clone proposals and\nrefute recent arguments about the breakdown of semiclassical physics in such\nspaces. In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks\ndown. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space\nrepresents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the\nquantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed\non observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT\nnevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed\nuniverse in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of\na final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary\nbetween the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the\nemergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final\nstate projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed\nuniverse, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant\ndescription of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data,\nand it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an\nexample of one such observable.

    "abstract": "We study the propagation of cosmic rays (CRs) through a simulation of\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence at unprecedented resolution of\n$10{,}240^3$. We drive turbulence that is subsonic and super-Alfv\\'enic,\ncharacterized by $\\delta B_{\\rm rms}/B_0=2$. The high resolution enables an\nextended inertial range such that the Alfv\\'en scale $l_A$, where $\\delta B\n(l_A)\\approx B_0$, is well resolved. This allows us to properly capture how the\ncascade transitions from large amplitudes on large scales to small amplitudes\non small scales. We find that sharp bends in the magnetic field are key\nmediators of particle transport even on small scales via resonant curvature\nscattering. We further find that particle scattering in the turbulence shows\nstrong hints of self-similarity: (1) the diffusion has weak energy dependence\nover almost two decades in particle energy and (2) the particles' random walk\nexhibits a broad power-law distribution of collision times such that the\ndiffusion is dominated by the rarest, long-distance excursions. Our results\nsuggest that large-amplitude MHD turbulence can provide efficient scattering\nover a wide range of CR energies and may help explain many CR observations\nabove a $\\sim$TeV: the flattening of the B/C spectrum, the hardening of CR\nprimary spectra and the weak dependence of arrival anisotropy on CR energy.",

However, conventional methods for constructing merger trees rely on\nad-hoc assumptions and are unable to incorporate environmental information.\nNguyen et al. (2024) introduced FLORAH, a generative model based on recurrent\nneural networks and normalizing flows, for modeling main progenitor branches of\nmerger trees. In this work, we extend this model, now referred to as\nFLORAH-Tree, to generate complete merger trees by representing them as graph\nstructures that capture the full branching hierarchy. We trained FLORAH-Tree on\nmerger trees extracted from the Very Small MultiDark Planck cosmological N-body\nsimulation. To validate our approach, we compared the generated merger trees\nwith both the original simulation data and with semi-analytic trees produced\nusing the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism. We show that FLORAH-Tree\naccurately reproduces key merger rate statistics across a wide range of mass\nand redshift, outperforming the conventional EPS-based approach. We demonstrate\nits utility by applying the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model (SAM) to generated\ntrees and showing that the resulting galaxy-halo scaling relations, such as the\nstellar-to-halo-mass relation and supermassive black hole mass-halo mass\nrelation, closely match those from applying the SAM to trees extracted directly\nfrom the simulation. FLORAH-Tree provides a computationally efficient method\nfor generating merger trees that maintain the statistical fidelity of N-body\nsimulations.",

In such systems\nobjects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli,\nrepresented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the\npersistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This\nprocess, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes\nwhich change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between\nobjects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show\nthat nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in\nangular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an\nexternal massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to\nthe Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the\nangular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the\nperturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance.\nAngular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will\nremain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any\nexternal influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive\nperturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts,\nincluding galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre,\nglobular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a\ncentral super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young,\nmassive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to\nconstrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the\nnearby gaseous torus.",

While star formation can be traced at 10\nMyr time-scales through H$\\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at\n100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI\nemission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes\nusing fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on\nstudies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of\nthese fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for\nthe HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\\alpha$ tracer.\nWe have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by\nKamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong\ncriteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and\nderive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\\alpha$\nand young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94\nMyr) is deprived of H$\\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to\nstudy simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and\nkinematic evidence is of primordial importance.

However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic\nnoon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point,\nsuggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during\nearlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological\nsurface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation\ncurves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \\approx\n0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \\approx 2.2$. By\ncomparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that\nthe asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$\ngalaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes\nrelevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more\ndisturbance in the galaxy's gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon\ngalaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling -- when\nin reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and\nloss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised\nwhen using cosmic-noon rotation curves, as they might not accurately trace the\ngravitational potential of the galaxy.",

Our evaluation reveals\nseveral striking findings: Even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models like DeepSeek-R1\nexhibit substantial performance degradation under stress testing. Crucially,\nREST demonstrates stronger discriminative power than existing benchmarks,\nrevealing pronounced performance differences among models that exhibit similar,\nnear-ceiling performance under single-question evaluations. Some key insights\nemerge from our analysis: (1) the \"overthinking trap\" is a critical factor\ncontributing to the performance degradation; (2) the models trained with\n\"long2short\" technique preserve more accuracy of their single-problem\nperformance under REST, outperforming standard-trained counterparts. These\nresults establish REST as a cost-efficient, future-proof evaluation paradigm\nthat better reflects real-world reasoning demands while reducing reliance on\ncontinuous human annotation.

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a vibrant\necosystem of diverse architectures, each with unique strengths due to\ndifferences in design, training data, and objectives. However, most\napplications still rely on a single backend model, limiting coverage of\ncapabilities and leading to inefficiencies in performance and token cost when\ntackling complex tasks. We highlight an underexploited opportunity: LLM routing\ndata, produced when hosting platforms route diverse queries to different\nmodels, which can reveal comparative strengths across tasks. To address this,\nwe propose FusionBench, a comprehensive routing benchmark covering 14 tasks\nacross five domains with 20 open-source LLMs (8B to 671B parameters), capturing\n103M tokens and summarizing reusable thought templates from top models.\nBuilding on this, we introduce FusionFactory, a systematic fusion framework\nwith three levels: (1) query-level fusion, tailoring routers for each query\nusing both direct responses and reasoning-augmented outputs; (2) thought-level\nfusion, leveraging abstract templates derived from top-performing LLMs' answers\nto similar queries; and (3) model-level fusion, transferring capabilities\nbetween models via distillation, using top responses or highest judge scores as\ntraining data. Experiments show FusionFactory consistently outperforms the best\nindividual LLM across all 14 benchmarks, with optimal fusion configurations\nvarying by benchmark, demonstrating the value of systematic LLM fusion in\nharnessing complementary strengths and improving overall performance.",

Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and\ncannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in\nthe digital world.

To address these challenges, we propose the\nGraph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and\ngraph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse\ntasks as actions.

Extensive experiments on\nsix tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,\nrecommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,\nand planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches\ndomain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and\ndemonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks.

Beyond directly answering user queries, LLMs can also\nserve as judges, assessing and comparing the quality of responses generated by\nother models. Such an evaluation capability is crucial both for benchmarking\ndifferent LLMs and for improving response quality through response ranking.\nHowever, despite the growing adoption of the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, its\neffectiveness in coding scenarios remains underexplored due to the absence of\ndedicated benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce CodeJudgeBench, a\nbenchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels across three critical coding tasks: code generation, code repair, and\nunit test generation. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 26 LLM-as-a-Judge\nmodels, we find that recent thinking models significantly outperform\nnon-thinking models on our carefully designed code judging tasks. Notably, even\nrelatively small thinking models, such as Qwen3-8B, can outperform specially\ntrained LLM-as-a-Judge models up to 70B in size. Nevertheless, all models still\nexhibit significant randomness in their judgment of coding tasks. For pairwise\njudging tasks, simply changing the order in which responses are presented can\nsubstantially impact accuracy. In addition, when judging code and unit tests\nwritten by different LLMs, LLM-as-a-Judge models also show variance in\nperformance. This sensitivity raises concerns about the reliability and\nconsistency of LLM-as-a-Judge in coding scenarios. Lastly, we study optimal\nprompting strategies for LLM-as-a-Judge. We find that using pair-wise\ncomparison outperforms scalar point-wise judging. Furthermore, retaining\ncomments and reasoning in the full, unprocessed LLM response leads to improved\njudge performance.",

Our analysis incorporates improvements to the data\nprocessing pipeline, particularly in subtracting strong radio sources in the\nprimary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level radio frequency interference,\nyielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess variance compared to a previous\nanalysis of the north celestial pole field.

The primary climate factor driving\nthese extremes is soil moisture variability, which is influenced by\nfluctuations in both precipitation and temperature. The delayed responses of\nGPP to different climate drivers depend on the specific driver and geographical\nregion. Overall, the highest incidence of GPP extremes arises from the combined\ninfluence of water stress, temperature anomalies, and fire-related\ndisturbances.",

    ],
    "abstract": "The Tolman effect is well-known in relativistic cosmology but rarely\ndiscussed outside it. That is surprising because the effect -- that systems\nextended over a varying gravitational potential exhibit temperature gradients\nwhile in thermal equilibrium -- conflicts with ordinary classical\nthermodynamics. In this paper we try to better understand this effect from a\nfoundational perspective. We make five claims. First, as Tolman knew, it was\nEinstein who first discovered the effect, and furthermore, Einstein's\nderivation helps us appreciate how robust it is. Second, the standard\ninterpretation of the effect in terms of 'local temperature' leads to the\nbreakdown of much of classical thermodynamics. Third, one can rescue\nthermodynamics by using Einstein's preferred interpretation in terms of the\n'wahre Temperatur' -- what we'll call global temperature -- but it too has some\ncosts. Fourth, the effect is perhaps best understood in terms of clocks as\nopposed to energy loss. Fifth, inspired by a proposal of Einstein's elsewhere,\nwe sketch an interpretation of the effect in terms of a third novel\ntemperature, which we call the 'wahre-local temperature'. On this view,\ntemperature -- and thermodynamics -- is defined only in relation to local\nclocks. In sum, we view the fragmentation of temperature in thermodynamics as a\nnatural and expected result of the fragmentation of time in general relativity.",

Several quick\nresponse observations suggest the lunar ejecta origin of 2024 PT$_5$, while\nrotation state and albedo, essential properties to investigate its origin, are\nnot well constrained. We performed visible to near-infrared multicolor\nphotometry of 2024 PT$_5$ from data taken using the TriColor CMOS Camera and\nSpectrograph (TriCCS) on the Seimei 3.8 m telescope during 2025 January 4-10.\nThe Seimei/TriCCS observations of 2024 PT$_5$ cover phase angles from 14 deg to\n27 deg, and were obtained in the $g$, $r$, $i$, and $z$ bands in the Pan-STARRS\nsystem. In addition, we analyzed $Y$, $J$, $H$, and $K$ photometry taken with\nthe Multi-Object Spectrograph for Infrared Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck I\n10-m telescope taken on 2025 January 16-17. Our lightcurves show brightness\nvariations over time periods of several tens of minutes. We infer that 2024\nPT$_5$ is in a tumbling state and has a lightcurve amplitude of about 0.3 mag.\nVisible and near-infrared color indices of 2024 PT$_5$, $g-r=0.567\\pm0.044$,\n$r-i=0.155\\pm0.009$, $r-z=0.147\\pm0.066$, $Y-J=0.557\\pm0.046$,\n$J-H=0.672\\pm0.078$, and $H-Ks=0.148\\pm0.098$, indicate that 2024 PT$_5$ is an\nS-complex asteroid, largely consistent with previous observations. Using the\n$H$-$G$ model, we derived an absolute magnitude $H_{V,HG}$ of $27.72\\pm0.09$\nand a slope parameter $G_V$ of $0.223\\pm0.073$ in V-band. A geometric albedo of\n2024 PT$_5$ is derived to be $0.26\\pm0.07$ from the slope of its photometric\nphase curve. This albedo value is typical of the S- and Q-type NEAs.

We introduce Mixture-of-Recursions (MoR), a unified framework\nthat combines the two axes of efficiency inside a single Recursive Transformer.\nMoR reuses a shared stack of layers across recursion steps to achieve parameter\nefficiency, while lightweight routers enable adaptive token-level thinking by\ndynamically assigning different recursion depths to individual tokens. This\nallows MoR to focus quadratic attention computation only among tokens still\nactive at a given recursion depth, further improving memory access efficiency\nby selectively caching only their key-value pairs. Beyond these core\nmechanisms, we also propose a KV sharing variant that reuses KV pairs from the\nfirst recursion, specifically designed to decrease prefill latency and memory\nfootprint. Across model scales ranging from 135M to 1.7B parameters, MoR forms\na new Pareto frontier: at equal training FLOPs and smaller model sizes, it\nsignificantly lowers validation perplexity and improves few-shot accuracy,\nwhile delivering higher throughput compared with vanilla and existing recursive\nbaselines.

Our analysis reveals that energy extraction remains feasible even at\na spin parameter as low as 0.5, significantly below previously reported\nthresholds, and the extracted power can exceed that of the BZ process under\ncertain conditions. Furthermore, the dilatonic scalar charge $b$ and the AdS\nradius $l$ collectively contribute to lowering the spin threshold for energy\nextraction. The energy extraction process in the plunging region was further\nexamined by analyzing the permissible energy extraction region, as well as the\ncorresponding power output and efficiency. One can find that the energy\nextraction is possible even at a spin as low as 0.25. Crucially, parameter $b$\nactively lowers the energy extraction spin threshold, while parameter $l$\nexerts a counteracting effect, impeding such reduction.

These singular points,\ncharacterized by cubic contact of vector field $X$ and quadratic contact of\nvector field $Y$ on the switching manifold, are structurally unstable under\nsmall perturbations of $Z$, giving rise to significant bifurcation phenomena.\n  We analyze the bifurcations of a 3D Filippov system around an invisible\ncusp-fold singularity, providing a detailed characterization of its crossing\ndynamics under certain conditions. We classify the characteristics of the\nsingularity when it emerges generically in one-parameter families (a\ncodimension-one phenomenon), and we show that no crossing limit cycles (CLCs)\nlocally bifurcate from it in this particular scenario. When the vector fields\n$X$ and $Y$ are anti-collinear at the cusp-fold singularity, we provide\nconditions for the generic emergence of this point in two-parameter families (a\ncodimension-two phenomenon). In this case, we show that the unfolding of such a\nsingularity leads to a bifurcating CLC, which degenerates into a fold-regular\npolycycle (self-connection at a fold-regular singularity).\n  Furthermore, we numerically derive the polycycle bifurcation curve and\ncomplete the two-parameter bifurcation set for a boost converter system\npreviously studied in the literature. This allows the identification of\nparameter regions where the boost converter system exhibits a CLC in its phase\nportrait, providing a understanding of its complex dynamics.",

This paper presents a novel PRM-free security\nalignment framework that leverages automated red teaming and adversarial\ntraining to achieve robust security guarantees while maintaining computational\nefficiency. Our approach systematically identifies vulnerabilities through\nsophisticated attack strategies including genetic algorithm optimization,\nmulti-agent simulation, and advanced prompt mutation techniques.

The framework\nincorporates transparent reporting and continuous audit mechanisms that enable\niterative security improvement and regulatory compliance.

For example, two common approaches to\nundergraduate QM instruction are spins-first, which focuses on the postulates\nof QM in spin systems before discussing wavefunctions, and wavefunctions-first,\nwhich focuses on the Schr\\\"odinger equation and its solutions for continuous\nfunctions in various potentials before discussing spin. These different\napproaches, along with the content variability in the textbooks used by\ninstructors, may mean students learn different things in QM classes across the\nUnited States (U.S.). In this paper, we offer a characterization of QM courses\nbased on survey responses from instructors at institutions across the U.S. With\nthe responses of 76 instructors teaching QM courses (or sequences), we present\nresults detailing their teaching methodologies, use of pedagogical resources,\nand coverage of QM topics. We find that the plurality of instructors in our\nsample are using traditional lecture, but many instructors are using\ninteractive lecture or another non-traditional method. Additionally,\ninstructors are using a wide variety of pedagogical tools (e.g., clicker\nquestions). Many instructors in our sample reported teaching single-semester\n(or single-quarter) QM courses; these instructors report similar content\ncoverage to instructors teaching first-semester (or quarter) QM courses, though\ntheir responses showed greater variability. We additionally report a comparison\nof content coverage between instructors using wavefunctions-first versus\nspins-first approaches, finding a large degree of overlap with differences in\ncoverage for a few specific topics.

Building on\nrecent theoretical advances in asymptotic normality and uniform convergence\nrates for higher-order spline HAL estimators (van der Laan, 2023), this work\nfocuses on constructing robust confidence intervals for HAL-based conditional\nmean estimators. To address regularization bias, we propose a targeted HAL with\na debiasing step to remove bias for the conditional mean, and also consider a\nrelaxed HAL estimator to reduce bias. We also introduce both global and local\nundersmoothing strategies to adaptively select the working model, reducing bias\nrelative to variance. Combined with delta-method-based variance estimation, we\nconstruct confidence intervals for conditional means based on HAL. Through\nsimulations, we evaluate combinations of estimation and model selection\nstrategies, showing that our methods substantially reduce bias and yield\nconfidence intervals with coverage rates close to nominal levels across\nscenarios.

We propose LaSDI-IT (Latent Space\nDynamics Identification for Interface Tracking), a data-driven framework that\ncombines low-dimensional latent dynamics learning with explicit interface-aware\nencoding to enable accurate and efficient modeling of physical systems\ninvolving moving material boundaries. At the core of LaSDI-IT is a revised\nauto-encoder architecture that jointly reconstructs the physical field and an\nindicator function representing material regions or phases, allowing the model\nto track complex interface evolution without requiring detailed physical models\nor mesh adaptation. The latent dynamics are learned through linear regression\nin the encoded space and generalized across parameter regimes using Gaussian\nprocess interpolation with greedy sampling. We demonstrate LaSDI-IT on the\nproblem of shock-induced pore collapse in high explosives, a process\ncharacterized by sharp temperature gradients and dynamically deforming pore\ngeometries. The method achieves relative prediction errors below 9% across the\nparameter space, accurately recovers key quantities of interest such as pore\narea and hot spot formation, and matches the performance of dense training with\nonly half the data. This latent dynamics prediction was 106 times faster than\nthe conventional high-fidelity simulation, proving its utility for multi-query\napplications.

The\ndecreasing density causes their amplitude to increase, developing into\nnonlinear waves through steepening and eventually forming shocks. To\ninvestigate the vertical evolution of this wave nonlinearity, we utilized\nmulti-wavelength data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), covering from the photosphere to the lower\ncorona across 20 active regions. The steepening of the wave profile leads to\nthe generation of higher harmonics. We quantify this using a nonlinearity index\n(NI), defined as the ratio of the amplitude of 2nd harmonic to the fundamental\nobtained using wavelet analysis. We find a characteristic pattern: nonlinearity\nincreases from the photosphere through the lower chromosphere, peaking near the\nAIA 1700 \\r{A} formation height, and decreases at higher altitudes, notably in\nthe AIA 304 \\r{A} channel. This trend indicates progressive wave steepening and\nsubsequent energy dissipation before reaching the formation of AIA 304 \\r{A},\nconsistent with shock formation in the lower atmosphere. An additional rise in\nNI is observed at the AIA 131 \\r{A} channel, followed by a decline in AIA 171\n\\r{A}, suggesting a 2nd phase of wave nonlinearity evolution in the lower\ncorona. Based on the NI profile and the formation heights of these channels, we\nconjecture that nonlinear wave processes are most prominent between the AIA\n1700 \\r{A} and AIA 304 \\r{A} formation layers and again between AIA 131 \\r{A}\nand AIA 171 \\r{A}.",

These systems\ntypically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based\ninteraction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to\ndriver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a\nmodular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large\nlanguage models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling\nto enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS\nsupports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing\nnatural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented\nin the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes\nconfirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model\nfine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and\nrevisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased\nlatency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated\ndialogue history.

At low concentrations, the sulfate ion\nis strongly solvated, leading to the stabilization of solvent-separated ion\npairs over contact ion pairs. Minimum energy pathway analysis revealed that\ncoordinating two sodium ions with a sulfate ion is a multistep process whereby\nthe sodium ions coordinate to the sulfate ion sequentially.

However, these works\nfall short in addressing the rising number of attacks which exist on SL. In\nSplitHappens, we expand the combination of FSS and SL to U-shaped SL.

However, existing unlearning\nmethods mainly focus on recovering trigger patterns but fail to restore the\ncorrect semantic labels of poison samples. This limitation prevents them from\nfully eliminating the false correlation between the trigger pattern and the\ntarget label. To address this, we leverage boundary adversarial attack\ntechniques, revealing two key observations. First, poison samples exhibit\nsignificantly greater distances from decision boundaries compared to clean\nsamples, indicating they require larger adversarial perturbations to change\ntheir predictions. Second, while adversarial predicted labels for clean samples\nare uniformly distributed, those for poison samples tend to revert to their\noriginal correct labels. Moreover, the features of poison samples restore to\nclosely resemble those of corresponding clean samples after adding adversarial\nperturbations. Building upon these insights, we propose Backdoor Unlearning via\nadversaRial bouNdary analysis (BURN), a novel defense framework that integrates\nfalse correlation decoupling, progressive data refinement, and model\npurification. In the first phase, BURN employs adversarial boundary analysis to\ndetect poisoned samples based on their abnormal adversarial boundary distances,\nthen restores their correct semantic labels for fine-tuning. In the second\nphase, it employs a feedback mechanism that tracks prediction discrepancies\nbetween the original backdoored model and progressively sanitized models,\nguiding both dataset refinement and model purification.

    "abstract": "The growing reliance on data-driven applications in sectors such as\nhealthcare, finance, and law enforcement underscores the need for secure,\nprivacy-preserving, and scalable mechanisms for data generation and sharing.\nSynthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a promising approach but often\nrelies on centralized or external processing, raising concerns about data\nsovereignty, domain ownership, and compliance with evolving regulatory\nstandards. To overcome these issues, we introduce SynthGuard, a framework\ndesigned to ensure computational governance by enabling data owners to maintain\ncontrol over SDG workflows. SynthGuard supports modular and privacy-preserving\nworkflows, ensuring secure, auditable, and reproducible execution across\ndiverse environments. In this paper, we demonstrate how SynthGuard addresses\nthe complexities at the intersection of domain-specific needs and scalable SDG\nby aligning with requirements for data sovereignty and regulatory compliance.\nDeveloped iteratively with domain expert input, SynthGuard has been validated\nthrough real-world use cases, demonstrating its ability to balance security,\nprivacy, and scalability while ensuring compliance. The evaluation confirms its\neffectiveness in implementing and executing SDG workflows and integrating\nprivacy and utility assessments across various computational environments.",

    "abstract": "Connecting plasma processing parameters to the resultant film microstructure\nremains a fundamental challenge in materials synthesis, one that has largely\nconfined process design to empirical approaches. To bridge this gap, we develop\na predictive analysis of coupling by applying a renormalization group (RG)\nanalysis to an effective Hamiltonian for the stochastic dynamics of the\nplasma-surface interface, derived systematically from microscopic principles.\nThe central result from this formalism is the system's exhibition of asymptotic\nfreedom; the effective dimensionless coupling, $g$, between the plasma and the\ngrowing surface is found to weaken systematically at macroscopic length scales,\na finding that provides a rigorous justification for the success of\ncontinuum-level models in describing large-scale film evolution. The RG\nframework yields a non-perturbative scaling relation for the mean grain area,\n$\\langle A \\rangle \\propto \\exp(\\kappa/g)$, where $g$ itself is defined by\nfundamental parameters such as ion flux ($\\Phi$) and ion collision time\n($\\tau_{\\text{ion}}$). This relation reveals the origin of widely-observed\nempirical power-law scaling, showing it to be an effective behavior limited to\nspecific process regimes. Crucially, the model furnishes sharp, testable\npredictions, including the pressure-independence of grain size within\ncollision-dominated plasmas and a parameter-free criterion, $\\Lambda_c =\n1/(n^2-1)$, for the onset of morphological instability and faceting based on\ncrystal symmetry. This work establishes a quantitative, parameter-sparse engine\nfor predicting and ultimately controlling microstructural outcomes in thin film\nsynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Aircraft aerodynamic design optimization must account for the varying\noperating conditions along the cruise segment as opposed to designing at one\nfixed operating condition, to arrive at more realistic designs. Conventional\napproaches address this by performing a ``multi-point'' optimization that\nassumes a weighted average of the objectives at a set of sub-segments along the\ncruise segment. We argue that since such multi-point approaches are,\ninevitably, biased by the specification of the weights, they can lead to\nsub-optimal designs. Instead, we propose to optimize the aircraft design at\nmultiple sub-segments simultaneously -- that is, via multiobjective\noptimization that leads to a set of Pareto optimal solutions. However, existing\nwork in multiobjective optimization suffers from (i) lack of sample efficiency\n(that is, keeping the number of function evaluations to convergence minimal),\n(ii) scalability with input dimensions and number of objectives, and (iii) the\nability to generate a batch of iterates for synchronous parallel evaluations.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multiobjective Bayesian\noptimization methodology that demonstrates improved sample efficiency and\naccuracy compared to the state of the art. Inspired by Thompson sampling, our\napproach leverages Gaussian process surrogates and Bayesian decision theory to\ngenerate a sequence of iterates according to the probability that they are\nPareto optimal. Our approach, named batch Pareto optimal Thompson sampling\n($q\\texttt{POTS}$), demonstrates superior empirical performance on a variety of\nsynthetic experiments as well as a $24$ dimensional two-objective aerodynamic\ndesign optimization of the NASA common research model. We also provide\nopen-source software of our methodology.",

Perplexity,\nburstiness, lexical diversity, readability, and BLEU/ROUGE scores show that\nLLaDA closely mimics human text in perplexity and burstiness, yielding high\nfalse-negative rates for AR-oriented detectors. LLaMA shows much lower\nperplexity but reduced lexical fidelity. Relying on any single metric fails to\nseparate diffusion outputs from human writing. We highlight the need for\ndiffusion-aware detectors and outline directions such as hybrid models,\ndiffusion-specific stylometric signatures, and robust watermarking.",

    "abstract": "The aging population is growing rapidly, and so is the danger of falls in\nolder adults. A major cause of injury is falling, and detection in time can\ngreatly save medical expenses and recovery time. However, to provide timely\nintervention and avoid unnecessary alarms, detection systems must be effective\nand reliable while addressing privacy concerns regarding the user. In this\nwork, we propose a framework for detecting falls using several complementary\nsystems: a semi-supervised federated learning-based fall detection system\n(SF2D), an indoor localization and navigation system, and a vision-based human\nfall recognition system. A wearable device and an edge device identify a fall\nscenario in the first system. On top of that, the second system uses an indoor\nlocalization technique first to localize the fall location and then navigate a\nrobot to inspect the scenario. A vision-based detection system running on an\nedge device with a mounted camera on a robot is used to recognize fallen\npeople. Each of the systems of this proposed framework achieves different\naccuracy rates. Specifically, the SF2D has a 0.81% failure rate equivalent to\n99.19% accuracy, while the vision-based fallen people detection achieves 96.3%\naccuracy. However, when we combine the accuracy of these two systems with the\naccuracy of the navigation system (95% success rate), our proposed framework\ncreates a highly reliable performance for fall detection, with an overall\naccuracy of 99.99%. Not only is the proposed framework safe for older adults,\nbut it is also a privacy-preserving solution for detecting falls.",

In outdoor scenarios, hourly estimates rely\non cues like brightness, hue, and shadow positioning, while seasonal changes\nand weather inform date estimation. However, these visual cues significantly\ndepend on geographic context, closely linking timestamp prediction to\ngeo-localization. To address this interdependence, we introduce GT-Loc, a novel\nretrieval-based method that jointly predicts the capture time (hour and month)\nand geo-location (GPS coordinates) of an image. Our approach employs separate\nencoders for images, time, and location, aligning their embeddings within a\nshared high-dimensional feature space. Recognizing the cyclical nature of time,\ninstead of conventional contrastive learning with hard positives and negatives,\nwe propose a temporal metric-learning objective providing soft targets by\nmodeling pairwise time differences over a cyclical toroidal surface. We present\nnew benchmarks demonstrating that our joint optimization surpasses previous\ntime prediction methods, even those using the ground-truth geo-location as an\ninput during inference.

These features are then matched through advanced semantic algorithms to\nidentify the best candidates efficiently.

Although existing methods\nintroduce auxiliary information from generative priors or high-quality\nreference images, they still struggle with identity preservation problems,\nmainly due to improper feature introduction on detailed textures. In this\npaper, we focus on effectively incorporating appropriate features from\nhigh-quality reference images, presenting a novel blind facial image\nrestoration method that considers reference selection, transfer, and\nreconstruction (RefSTAR). In terms of selection, we construct a reference\nselection (RefSel) module. For training the RefSel module, we construct a\nRefSel-HQ dataset through a mask generation pipeline, which contains annotating\nmasks for 10,000 ground truth-reference pairs. As for the transfer, due to the\ntrivial solution in vanilla cross-attention operations, a feature fusion\nparadigm is designed to force the features from the reference to be integrated.\nFinally, we propose a reference image reconstruction mechanism that further\nensures the presence of reference image features in the output image. The cycle\nconsistency loss is also redesigned in conjunction with the mask. Extensive\nexperiments on various backbone models demonstrate superior performance,\nshowing better identity preservation ability and reference feature transfer\nquality.

However, research in this area is still fragmented across\ndifferent communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered\nframeworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the\nSemantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies\nin solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda\nfocused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance\nfor the emerging WoA.",

The colorful minor relation enhances the\nclassical minor relation by merging color sets at contracted edges and allowing\nthe removal of colors from vertices. This framework naturally models\nalgorithmic problems involving graphs with (possibly overlapping) annotated\nvertex sets. We develop a structural theory for colorful minors by establishing\nseveral theorems characterizing $\\mathcal{H}$-colorful minor-free graphs, where\n$\\mathcal{H}$ consists either of a clique or a grid with all vertices assigned\nall colors, or of grids with colors segregated and ordered on the outer face.\nLeveraging our structural insights, we provide a complete classification -\nparameterized by the number $q$ of colors - of all colorful graphs that exhibit\nthe Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa property with respect to colorful minors. On the\nalgorithmic side, we provide a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for colorful\nminor testing and a variant of the $k$-disjoint paths problem. Together with\nthe fact that the colorful minor relation forms a well-quasi-order, this\nimplies that every colorful minor-monotone parameter on colorful graphs admits\na fixed-parameter algorithm. Furthermore, we derive two algorithmic\nmeta-theorems (AMTs) whose structural conditions are linked to extensions of\ntreewidth and Hadwiger number on colorful graphs. Our results suggest how known\nAMTs can be extended to incorporate not only the structure of the input graph\nbut also the way the colored vertices are distributed in it.",

    "abstract": "Pansharpening refers to the process of integrating a high resolution\npanchromatic (PAN) image with a lower resolution multispectral (MS) image to\ngenerate a fused product, which is pivotal in remote sensing. Despite the\neffectiveness of CNNs in addressing this challenge, they are inherently\nconstrained by the uniform application of convolutional kernels across all\nspatial positions, overlooking local content variations. To overcome this\nissue, we introduce RAPNet, a new architecture that leverages content-adaptive\nconvolution. At its core, RAPNet employs the Receptive-field Adaptive\nPansharpening Convolution (RAPConv), designed to produce spatially adaptive\nkernels responsive to local feature context, thereby enhancing the precision of\nspatial detail extraction. Additionally, the network integrates the\nPansharpening Dynamic Feature Fusion (PAN-DFF) module, which incorporates an\nattention mechanism to achieve an optimal balance between spatial detail\nenhancement and spectral fidelity. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly\navailable datasets confirm that RAPNet delivers superior performance compared\nto existing approaches, as demonstrated by both quantitative metrics and\nqualitative assessments. Ablation analyses further substantiate the\neffectiveness of the proposed adaptive components.",

The model developed in this work\nuses associative memory via a transparent, explainable Hopfield neural network\nto store signals and detect similar signals which can then be used to classify\nspecies. Training is rapid ($3$\\,ms), as only one representative signal is\nrequired for each target sound within a dataset. The model is fast, taking only\n$5.4$\\,s to pre-process and classify all $10384$ publicly available bat\nrecordings, on a standard Apple MacBook Air. The model is also lightweight with\na small memory footprint of $144.09$\\,MB of RAM usage. Hence, the low\ncomputational demands make the model ideal for use on a variety of standard\npersonal devices with potential for deployment in the field via edge-processing\ndevices. It is also competitively accurate, with up to $86\\%$ precision on the\ndataset used to evaluate the model.

On the other hand MI and TMI show a more intricate\ndependence backreaction tends to strengthen correlations, while increasing\ncharge suppresses entanglement and makes the system more susceptible to\nscrambling. The analysis of the butterfly velocity indicates that both the\npresence of charge and the backreaction suppress the chaotic behavior of the\nsystem by reducing $v_B$.

Often, as is the\ncase of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate\nvanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /\nlocally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time\nLQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT\nand DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like\nconditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these\ngeneralizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects\nof errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from\nadversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a\nsimulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic\ncomputations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from\nlimited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of\nthis issue.

In this work, we introduce\nCoralVQA, the first large-scale VQA dataset for coral reef analysis. It\ncontains 12,805 real-world coral images from 67 coral genera collected from 3\noceans, along with 277,653 question-answer pairs that comprehensively assess\necological and health-related conditions. To construct this dataset, we develop\na semi-automatic data construction pipeline in collaboration with marine\nbiologists to ensure both scalability and professional-grade data quality.\nCoralVQA presents novel challenges and provides a comprehensive benchmark for\nstudying vision-language reasoning in the context of coral reef images. By\nevaluating several state-of-the-art LVLMs, we reveal key limitations and\nopportunities. These insights form a foundation for future LVLM development,\nwith a particular emphasis on supporting coral conservation efforts.",

We present a new corpus that\ncombines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for\nreference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications\n-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to\nexperiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this\ncorpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification\nquestions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We\nfind that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing\nclarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans\nand LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential\nambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce\nmore clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task\nuncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is\npredicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with\ndifferent reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase\nquestion frequency and relevancy.",

One galaxy is classified\nas an AGN based on its optical spectrum, a second is identified as a possible\nX-ray AGN based on the Chandra data, and the third galaxy may host a radio AGN.\nIn optical images, a prominent dust lane crosses the southern galaxy, while\nSpitzer infrared images show a dusty bridge connecting the two brightest\ngalaxies. Chandra maps reveal a massive (2 x 10^7 M(sun)) concentration of hot\ngas between these two galaxies, as well as several other knots of hot gas and\nnon-thermal emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of the hot gas in IC 2431\nis ~ 1 x 10^42 erg/s, which is enhanced by about a factor of four relative to\nthe star formation rate, compared to other star-forming galaxies. In radio\nmaps, a bright jet/ridge of radio continuum emission extends 4 kpc from one\nnucleus. We compare the properties of IC 2431 with those of other interacting\ngalaxy systems, and discuss two different scenarios that may account for the\npeculiarities of IC 2431: ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium\nduring a head-on collision between two galaxies, or an AGN-powered radio jet\nthat has been distorted by an interaction with interstellar gas during a tidal\nencounter between galaxies.",

However, defects during growth and transfer\nto other substrates can compromise the integrity and strength of graphene.\nSurprisingly, the literature suggests that, in certain cases, defects can\nenhance or, at most, not affect the mechanical performance of graphene. Further\nresearch is necessary to explore how defects interact within graphene structure\nand affect its properties, especially in large-area samples. In this study, we\ninvestigate the interaction between two preexisting cracks and their effect on\nthe mechanical properties of graphene using molecular dynamics simulations. The\nbehavior of zigzag and armchair graphene structures with cracks separated by\ndistances ($W_\\text{gap}$) is analyzed under tensile loading. The findings\nreveal that crack coalescence, defined as the formation of a new crack from two\nexisting crack tips, occurs for lower values of the distance between cracks,\n$W_\\text{gap}$, resulting in a decline in the strength of structures. As\n$W_\\text{gap}$ increases, the stress-strain curves shift upward, with the peak\nstress rising in the absence of crack coalescence. The effective stress\nintensity factor formulated in this study exhibits a clear upward trend with\nincreasing $W_\\text{gap}$.

To\naddress this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer\ntime delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first\npart, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and\nuse a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In\nlimiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for\nnonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the\nlinear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation,\nthe characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic\nmethod to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or\npossible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and\nparameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing\nmethod combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires\nonly short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time\ndelays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper\ninsight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the\nbehavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent\ncollective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.",

It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple\nopen-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this,\nwe propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework\nwith high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and\ngeneralization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior\nSelection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select\nthe Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose\nan Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the\ngeneration of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the\nhigh-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight\nmainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating\nfifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,\ne.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)\nacross multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results\nof different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source\nLLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence.

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method\nthat has gained popularity in the machine learning community due to its\nfinite-sample guarantees and ease of use. Its most common variant, dubbed split\nconformal prediction, is also computationally efficient as it boils down to\ncollecting statistics of the model predictions on some calibration data not yet\nseen by the model. Nonetheless, these guarantees only hold if the calibration\nand test data are exchangeable, a condition that is difficult to verify and\noften violated in practice due to so-called distribution shifts. The literature\nis rife with methods to mitigate the loss in coverage in this non-exchangeable\nsetting, but these methods require some prior information on the type of\ndistribution shift to be expected at test time. In this work, we study this\nproblem via a new perspective, through the lens of optimal transport, and show\nthat it is possible to estimate the loss in coverage and mitigate it in case of\ndistribution shift.",

Since generated source code\nis virtually impossible to distinguish from manually written code, their\nreal-world usage and impact on open-source software development remain poorly\nunderstood.

Using this concept as a lens to study\nhow GenAI tools are integrated into open-source software projects, we analyze a\ncurated sample of more than 250,000 GitHub repositories, identifying 1,292 such\nself-admissions across 156 repositories in commit messages, code comments, and\nproject documentation. Using a mixed methods approach, we derive a taxonomy of\n32 tasks, 10 content types, and 11 purposes associated with GenAI usage based\non 284 qualitatively coded mentions. We then analyze 13 documents with policies\nand usage guidelines for GenAI tools and conduct a developer survey to uncover\nthe ethical, legal, and practical concerns behind them. Our findings reveal\nthat developers actively manage how GenAI is used in their projects,\nhighlighting the need for project-level transparency, attribution, and quality\ncontrol practices in the new era of AI-assisted software development.

As we have identified that\nthe inconsistency between the numerically calculated magnetic field and\nmagnetic energy may be responsible for the loss of positivity of scalar\nvariables, we propose a physical consistency condition and implement it in\nHLL-type MHD Riemann solvers, thus alleviating the erroneous magnetic field\nsolutions breaking scalar positivity. In addition, (I) for the HLLC-type\nscheme, we have designed a revised two-state approximation, specifically\nreducing numerical error in magnetic field solutions, and (II) for the\nHLLD-type scheme, we replace the constant total pressure assumption by a\nthree-state assumption for the intermediate thermal energy, which is more\nconsistent with our other assumptions.
