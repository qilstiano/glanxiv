    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning has emerged as a post-training approach to elicit\nagentic RAG behaviors such as search and planning from language models.\nHowever, compact language models (e.g., 0.5B parameters) struggle due to poor\nreasoning ability, resulting in sparse rewards and unstable training. To\novercome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization\n(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from\nteacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy\noptimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG\nCapabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search\ncoordination, and response synthesis. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat DGPO enables compact models to achieve sophisticated agentic search\nbehaviors, even outperforming the larger teacher model in some cases. DGPO\nmakes agentic RAG feasible in computing resource-constrained environments.",

This problem is addressed in the interacting boson model with\nconfiguration mixing that is formulated by using the nuclear energy density\nfunctional theory. It is shown that significant amounts of mixing of normal and\ndeformed intruder configurations are present in the ground and excited $0^+$\nstates in the even-even nuclei that are parent or daughter nuclei of the\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay. An illustrative application to the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\ndecays of $^{76}$Ge, $^{96}$Zr, $^{100}$Mo, $^{116}$Cd, and $^{150}$Nd shows\nthat the inclusion of the configuration mixing reduces the NMEs for most of the\n$0^+_1$ $\\to$ $0^+_1$ $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decays.",

This approximation\nmethod begins by substituting an exponential function into the Laplace\ntransform of the power function, followed by the application of the trapezoidal\nrule to approximate the resulting integral. To ensure computational\nfeasibility, the integral limits are truncated, leading to a finite exponential\nsum representation of the kernel.

In\nthe context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question\narises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential\nprivacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication?\nThis paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to\nsafeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance\nthrough measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach\nachieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations\ndemonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between\ndifferential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off\nbetween security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the\nframework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise\nmodel performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on\ncritical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores\nfor correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable\ntrade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for\nsecure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum\ncomputing applications.",

Multi-walled\nCarbon Nanotube (MWCNT) serves as a promising candidate for Cu interconnects\nthanks to the superior conductivity. Moreover, Carbon Nanotube Field Transistor\n(CNFET) also emerges as a prospective alternative to the conventional CMOS\ndevice because of high power efficiency and large noise margin. The combination\nof MWCNT and CNFET enables the promising CNT-based FPGAs. However, the MWCNT\ninterconnects exhibit significant process variations due to immature\nfabrication process, leading to delay faults. Also, the non-ideal CNFET\nfabrication process may generate a few metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), rendering\ncorrelated faulty blocks. In this article, we propose a ring oscillator (RO)\nbased testing technique to detect delay faults due to the process variation of\nMWCNT interconnects. Furthermore, we propose an effective testing technique for\nthe carry chains in CLBs, and an improved circuit design based on the lookup\ntable (LUT) is applied to speed up the fault testing of CNT-based FPGAs. In\naddition, we propose a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs in CLBs. Finally, we\npropose a redundant spare row sharing architecture to improve the yield of\nCNT-based FPGA further.

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention\nfor adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of\nparameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an\neffective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model\nweights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich\nsemantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in\nstandalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)\nremains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model\ncapacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to\nfine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse\nintervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a\nlightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge\ndevices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to\naggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging\ncan corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me\n(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others\nand partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by\nbalancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense\nreasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x\nhigher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.",

Existing approaches often impose\nsmoothness constraints to control the bias-variance trade-off, and thus prevent\noverfitting. However, such assumptions can hinder interpretability, especially\nwhen only certain regions of an image influence changes in the response. In\nsuch a scenario, interpretability can be better captured by imposing sparsity\nassumptions on the coefficient function. To address this challenge, we propose\nthe Generalized Dantzig Selector, a novel method that jointly enforces sparsity\nand smoothness on the coefficient function. The proposed approach enhances\ninterpretability by accurately identifying regions with no contribution to the\nchanges of response, while preserving stability in estimation.

In this work, we introduce a probing framework\nto systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across\nlayers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories\n(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a\nstandardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different\nlayers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt\nvariations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level\nchanges, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by\nmodifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that\npreserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to\nLLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent\nstage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle\nlayers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers\nprepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall\nstage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,\ninstruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation\nto each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture.

MDPF enables routers to intelligently predict optimal forwarding\ndecisions based on key metrics such as bandwidth, delay, and the number of\nunsatisfied Interests, while DRR ensures fair and adaptive bandwidth allocation\namong competing data flows. The proposed method models each router as a\nlearning agent capable of adjusting its strategies through continuous feedback\nand probabilistic updates.

    "abstract": "Economics has long been a science of static equilibria, in which time is a\nsecond-order rather than first-order concern. Without time, economic modelers\nmay neglect or obscure the role of time-dependent phenomena, e.g.\npath-dependency, and limit their ability to compare agnostically the model\nresults with empirical observations. In this article, I outline a dynamic,\nsignals-based recipe for building microeconomic models from traditional static\nmodels. I demonstrate this recipe using a classic \"desert island\" Robinson\nCrusoe (RC) model of consumption. Starting from a classic static derivation, I\nthen move to a dynamic view, using the utility function as a generator of force\non consumption. Finally, I show that the resulting dynamic model may be\nexpressed in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian terms. I conclude by suggesting a\nrecipe for scientific iteration using these alternate mechanical formulations,\nand the alternative explanations these dynamic models may suggest compared to\nemploying a static approach to modeling.",

    "abstract": "We consider the Schelling-like social competition reflected in \"dynamics of\nopinions\" among groups of agents (\"communities\") in a highly transparent world.\nSpecifically, we investigate a $q$-state Potts spin system with competing two-\nand three-body interactions on a complete graph. Agents interact through\npairwise repulsion (opposing opinions) between different communities and\nthree-body attraction (shared opinions) within the same community. In the\nthermodynamic limit, we identify variants of three key phases: (a) a symmetric\n\"mixed\" phase of $q$ states, in which no single opinion dominates in the\nsociety (interpreted as a \"democracy\"), (b) a symmetric \"mixed\" phase but of\n$q-1$ states, and (c) a \"consensus\" phase, characterized by the emergence of a\ndominant opinion (or \"ideology\"), coexisting with symmetrically distributed\nminority views. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal finite-size effects and\nmetastable switching between configurations. Furthermore, we establish a\ncorrespondence between our social model on a complete graph and the mean-field\n$SU(N)$ quantum spin system with both quadratic and cubic interactions,\nrevealing a \"social-quantum\" duality. This duality provides new perspectives on\nboth stratification of social communication, and quantum many-body phenomena,\noffering a unified framework for understanding emergent collective behavior in\ncomplex systems.",

    "abstract": "Galaxy profile fitting is a ubiquitous technique that provides the backbone\nfor photometric and morphological measurements in modern extragalactic surveys.\nA recent innovation in profile fitting algorithms is to render, or create, the\nmodel profile in Fourier space, which aims to provide faster and more accurate\nresults. However, the most common parameterization, the S\\'ersic profile, has\nno closed form Fourier transform, requiring the use of computationally\nexpensive approximations. In this paper our goal is to develop an emulator to\nmimic the radial Fourier transform of the S\\'ersic profile, for use in profile\nfitting. We first numerically compute the radial Fourier transform and\ndemonstrate that it varies smoothly as a function of the S\\'ersic index and\n$k$, the spatial frequency coordinate. Using this set of numerically calculated\ntransforms as a training set, we use symbolic regression to discover an\nequation which approximates its behavior. This ensures the emulator will be\nbased on computationally efficient and differentiable building blocks. We\nimplement this novel rendering method in the pysersic profile fitter, and\nensure it is accurate by conducting both injection-recovery tests using model\ngalaxy profiles and applying multiple rendering methods to a real sample of\ngalaxies in HSC-SSP imaging. Crucially, the Fourier emulator rendering\ntechnique enables measurements of morphological parameters of galaxies 2.5\ntimes faster than standard methods with minimal loss in accuracy. This\nincreased performance while maintaining accuracy is a step that ensures these\ntools can continue to scale with the ever-increasing flow of incoming data.",

Our\nmethod integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that\nevaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling\nmechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they\nappear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a\npre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral\npairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy\nexperiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored\nphenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the\nlikelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results\ndemonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;\nin combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to\naccelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex\nexperimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Memory allocation, though constituting only a small portion of the executed\ncode, can have a \"butterfly effect\" on overall program performance, leading to\nsignificant and far-reaching impacts. Despite accounting for just approximately\n5% of total instructions, memory allocation can result in up to a 2.7x\nperformance variation depending on the allocator used. This effect arises from\nthe complexity of memory allocation in modern multi-threaded multi-core\nsystems, where allocator metadata becomes intertwined with user data, leading\nto cache pollution or increased cross-thread synchronization overhead.\nOffloading memory allocators to accelerators, e.g., Mallacc and Memento, is a\npotential direction to improve the allocator performance and mitigate cache\npollution. However, these accelerators currently have limited support for\nmulti-threaded applications, and synchronization between cores and accelerators\nremains a significant challenge.\n  We present SpeedMalloc, using a lightweight support-core to process memory\nallocation tasks in multi-threaded applications. The support-core is a\nlightweight programmable processor with efficient cross-core data\nsynchronization and houses all allocator metadata in its own caches. This\ndesign minimizes cache conflicts with user data and eliminates the need for\ncross-core metadata synchronization. In addition, using a general-purpose core\ninstead of domain-specific accelerators makes SpeedMalloc capable of adopting\nnew allocator designs. We compare SpeedMalloc with state-of-the-art software\nand hardware allocators, including Jemalloc, TCMalloc, Mimalloc, Mallacc, and\nMemento. SpeedMalloc achieves 1.75x, 1.18x, 1.15x, 1.23x, and 1.18x speedups on\nmultithreaded workloads over these five allocators, respectively.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the generation of free-surface waves in a liquid\nlayer driven by linear instabilities in Couette-Poiseuille (quadratic) shear\nflows. The base velocity profiles are characterized by a curvature parameter,\nand two-dimensional viscous and inviscid perturbations are analyzed across a\nwide parameter space of curvature, wavenumber, and Reynolds number, for fixed\nFroude and Bond numbers. In the inviscid limit, analytical solutions of the\nRayleigh equation reveal that velocity profiles ranging from Nusselt to linear\nflows remain stable against the rippling instability, with long-wave growth\noccurring only under strong interfacial forcing, whereas weaker forcing\nproduces well-defined stability boundaries. For the viscous problem,\nOrr-Sommerfeld computations and asymptotic analyses reveal that a slight convex\ncurvature of the shear flow suppresses long-wave instabilities, while a slight\nconcave curvature suppresses short-wave instabilities, so even small deviations\nfrom a linear profile produce qualitatively different behaviors. Furthermore,\nwe observe that strongly forced long waves are more unstable at large $Re$ than\nthe inviscid value they latch on to as $Re \\to \\infty$. Growth-rate maps\nhighlight smooth transitions between long-wave and rippling modes and reveal an\nadditional shear instability near the linear profile at high Reynolds numbers.\nBased on energy transfers and eigenfunction structures, five distinct\ninstability types are identified: shear, rippling, long-wave interfacial,\nshort-wave interfacial, and a composite mode that combines features of shear,\nrippling and long-wave interfacial instabilities at large Reynolds numbers.",

Such a material would be\na panacea in the study of Weyl quasi particles allowing direct unambiguous\nobservation of their topological properties. The alluaudite-like\nK$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ compound was recently proposed as such a material.\nHere we use comprehensive experimental work and first principle calculations to\nassess this prediction. We find K$_2$Mn$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_3$ crystallizes in the\n$C2/c$ symmetry with a quasi-1D Mn sublattice, growing as small needle-like\ncrystals. Bulk properties measurements reveal magnetic transitions at $\\approx$\n8 and $\\approx$ 4 K which neutron scattering experiments show correspond to two\ndistinct magnetic orders, first a partially ordered ferrimagnetic\n$\\mathbf{k_1}$= (0, 0, 0) structure at 8 K and a second transition of\n$\\mathbf{k_2}$= (1, 0, 0) at 4 K to a fully ordered state. Below the second\ntransition, both ordering vectors are necessary to describe the complex\nmagnetic structure with modulated spin magnitudes. Both of the best-fit\nmagnetic structures in this work are found to break the symmetry necessary for\nthe generation of the Weyl nodes, though one of the magnetic structures allowed\nby $\\mathbf{k_1}$ does preserve this symmetry. However, the crystals are\noptically transparent and ellipsometry measurements reveal a large band-gap,\nundermining expectations of semi-metallic behavior. Density functional theory\ncalculations predict an insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, in contrast\nto previous reports, and suggest potential frustration on the magnetic\nsublattice.

We study the\ngeneral model of Costly Information Combinatorial Selection (CICS) that was\nrecently introduced by Chawla et al. [2024] and Bowers et al. [2025]. In this\nproblem, a decision maker needs to select a feasible subset of stochastic\nvariables, and can only learn information about their values through a series\nof costly steps, modeled by a Markov decision process. The algorithmic\nobjective is to maximize the total value of the selection minus the cost of\ninformation acquisition. However, determining the optimal algorithm is known to\nbe a computationally challenging problem.\n  To address this challenge, previous approaches have turned to approximation\nalgorithms by considering a restricted class of committing policies that\nsimplify the decision-making aspects of the problem and allow for efficient\noptimization. This motivates the question of bounding the commitment gap,\nmeasuring the worst case ratio in the performance of the optimal committing\npolicy and the overall optimal.\n  In this work, we obtain improved bounds on the commitment gap of CICS through\na reduction to a simpler problem of Bayesian Combinatorial Selection where\ninformation is free. By establishing a close relationship between these\nproblems, we are able to relate the commitment gap of CICS to ex ante\nfree-order prophet inequalities.

Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score\nnormalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on\ntheir local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and\nclassification in the hybrid vision-language framework.

    "abstract": "Context. Low-ionization structures (LISs), found in all morphological types\nof planetary nebulae (PNe), are small-scale features prominent in emission from\nlow-ionization species such as [N ii], [S ii], [O ii] and [O i]. Observational\nand theoretical efforts have aimed to better understand their origin and\nnature. Recently, the detection of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) emission\nassociated with LISs in a few PNe has added a new piece to the puzzle of\nunderstanding these nebular structures. Aims. Although observational studies\nindicate that LISs are characterized by lower electron densities than their\nhost PNe, model predictions suggest higher total densities in these structures.\nThe detection of H$_2$ emission from LISs in more PNe could help reconcile the\nobservations with model predictions. Methods. Observations of five PNe with\nalready known LISs were conducted using the Near InfraRed Imager and\nSpectrometer (NIRI) mounted on the 8 m Gemini North telescope. A narrow band\nfilter, centered on H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\\mu}$m emission line, was used along with\na continuum filter, to ensure continuum subtraction. Results. We present a\ndeep, high-angular resolution near-IR narrowband H$_2$ 1-0 S(1) imaging survey\nof five Galactic PNe with LISs. We nearly double the sample of LISs detected in\nthe H$_2$ 1-0 2.122 ${\\mu}$m emission line as well as the number of host PNe.\nThese findings allows us to prove that the systematically lower electron\ndensity in LISs --relative to the rims and shells of their host nebulae-- is\nlinked to the presence of H2 molecular gas. Additionally, we provide the first\nestimation of the excited H$_2$ molecular mass in LISs, which is found between\n200 and 5000 times lower than the corresponding ionized gas mass.",

In this\npaper, we show how muon- and electron-neutrino fluxes vary as a function of the\nneutrino beam axis angle and how this can be exploited to expand the physics\npotential of SBND. We make use of a model that predicts an angle-dependent\nelectron-neutrino excess signal to illustrate this effect, such as $\\nu_\\mu \\to\n\\nu_e$ oscillations. We present how SBND-PRISM provides a method to add\nrobustness against uncertainties in cross-section modeling and, more generally,\nuncertainties that do not depend on the spatial position of neutrino\ninteraction inside the detector.

In\nparticular, late-time tails and memory effects after the merger are two\nlow-frequency phenomena, not detectable by current instruments, but which can\nbe observed by future detectors. Their low-frequency nature could, in\nprinciple, make them more sensitive to larger-scale structures at galactic\nlength scales. We show that indeed there are transient features, such as\namplitude changes, in both tails and (linear) memory when the merger occurs\nwhile immersed in an astrophysical environment. For realistic galaxies, the\nenvironment's compactness is small enough that the effect is strongly\nsuppressed, but these effects could become relevant for mergers occurring in\nregions with matter overdensities, like the ones recently observed numerically\nfor wave dark matter. On the other hand, the memory (the difference between the\namplitude asymptotically early and late) and asymptotically late decay are\nindependent on the properties of the environment.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by\nbreakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer\npowerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research\npractice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current\nlandscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical\nresearch context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of\nrecent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\\'c et\nal., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and\nevaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of\nself-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy\nand full-proof validity.\n  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI\ninto the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented\nmathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical\nguidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding\nprinciples for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore\nseven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from\ncreativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these\nprinciples translate into concrete practice.\n  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than\nautomation.

While a series of Two One-Sided\nTests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level\nequivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial\ndecision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These\nfindings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM\nwith proper validation checks.

For node classification, we propose a novel optimization\nproblem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)\nin a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate\na synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In\nparticular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the\nsolution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,\nunder milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present\nalgorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments\nthat confirm such a synergy.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but\nface scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To\naddress this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and\nscalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful\ntraining samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a\nheld-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample\nloss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient\nand curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We\ndevelop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees\nfor CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is\nupper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the\nrepresentativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,\nCLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art\nmethods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally\nexpensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across\narchitectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with\n<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,\nincurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias\nreduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional\nstratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,\nefficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.",

    "abstract": "Dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) are excellent targets for indirect dark\nmatter (DM) searches using gamma-ray telescopes because they are thought to\nhave high DM content and a low astrophysical background. The sensitivity of\nthese searches is improved by combining the observations of dSphs made by\ndifferent gamma-ray telescopes. We present the results of a combined search by\nthe most sensitive currently operating gamma-ray telescopes, namely: the\nsatellite-borne Fermi-LAT telescope; the ground-based imaging atmospheric\nCherenkov telescope arrays H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS; and the HAWC water\nCherenkov detector. Individual datasets were analyzed using a common\nstatistical approach. Results were subsequently combined via a global joint\nlikelihood analysis. We obtain constraints on the velocity-weighted cross\nsection $\\langle \\sigma \\mathit{v} \\rangle$ for DM self-annihilation as a\nfunction of the DM particle mass. This five-instrument combination allows the\nderivation of up to 2-3 times more constraining upper limits on $\\langle \\sigma\n\\mathit{v} \\rangle$ than the individual results over a wide mass range spanning\nfrom 5 GeV to 100 TeV. Depending on the DM content modeling, the 95% confidence\nlevel observed limits reach $1.5\\times$10$^{-24}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ and\n$3.2\\times$10$^{-25}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$, respectively, in the $\\tau^+\\tau^-$\nannihilation channel for a DM mass of 2 TeV.",

    "abstract": "We introduce and analyze the ordered Zeckendorf game, a novel combinatorial\ntwo-player game inspired by Zeckendorf's Theorem, which guarantees a unique\ndecomposition of every positive integer as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci\nnumbers. Building on the original Zeckendorf game\\ -- previously studied in the\ncontext of unordered multisets\\ -- we impose a new constraint: all moves must\nrespect the order of summands. The result is a richer and more nuanced\nstrategic landscape that significantly alters game dynamics.\n  Unlike the classical version, where Player 2 has a dominant strategy for all\n$n > 2$, our ordered variant reveals a more balanced and unpredictable\nstructure. In particular, we find that Player 1 wins for nearly all values $n\n\\leq 25$, with a single exception at $n = 18$. This shift in strategic outcomes\nis driven by our game's key features: adjacency constraints that limit\nallowable merges and splits to neighboring terms, and the introduction of a\nswitching move that reorders pairs.\n  We prove that the game always terminates in the Zeckendorf decomposition\\ --\nnow in ascending order\\ -- by constructing a strictly decreasing monovariant.\nWe further establish bounds on game complexity: the shortest possible game has\nlength exactly $n - Z(n)$, where $Z(n)$ is the number of summands in the\nZeckendorf decomposition of $n$, while the longest game exhibits quadratic\ngrowth, with $M(n) \\sim \\frac{n^2}{2}$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n  Empirical simulations suggest that random game trajectories exhibit\nlog-normal convergence in their move distributions. Overall, the ordered\nZeckendorf game enriches the landscape of number-theoretic games, posing new\nalgorithmic challenges and offering fertile ground for future exploration into\nstrategic complexity, probabilistic behavior, and generalizations to other\nrecurrence relations.",

This study\nextends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,\naddressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of\nspatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a\nspatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's\nperspective in spherical scenes.

Our\nresults on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,\ndemonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing\nmethods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes.

They are potential sources of\ncoincident gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation across the entire\nspectrum. However, the internal configuration of their magnetic fields and the\nmechanisms that stabilize them remain open questions. As a step forward in\nunderstanding the timescale for the emergence of magnetic instabilities that\ndisrupt stellar field configurations, we study the impact of stellar rotation\nusing three-dimensional general relativistic numerical simulations of uniformly\nrotating, isolated neutron stars threaded by strong, poloidal, pulsar-like\nmagnetic fields. The initial stellar configurations assume perfect conductivity\nand are stationary and axisymmetric. We explore a range of angular velocities,\nfrom non-rotating stars to those near the mass-shedding limit. We find that the\nstars spontaneously develop differential rotation, which triggers the\nappearance of a strong toroidal magnetic field component. Non-rotating neutron\nstars are unstable to the Tayler and Parker instabilities, which significantly\nchange the magnetic field geometry. These instabilities lead to a rapid\nreduction of the initial magnetic energy by $\\sim 99\\%$ within $\\sim 4$\nAlfv\\'en times of their onset. In contrast, rotation significantly delays the\ndevelopment of these instabilities and, in some cases, mitigates their effects.\nHighly rotating models retain up to $\\sim 30\\%$ of their magnetic energy for at\nleast $\\sim 10$ Alfv\\'en times. Our results suggest that rotation plays a\ncrucial role in stabilizing the magnetic field of neutron stars, regardless of\nits initial configuration.",

    "abstract": "This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to\ncreate multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to\nreduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a\ntwo-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B)\nwith a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven\nstructured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot,\nchain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items\nwere assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five\ndimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate\nhuman scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially\nstrategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly\nimproved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and\ninstructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with\nprompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study\ndemonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance\nmidsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value\nof combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to\nensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a\npractical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items\nfor K-12.",

This trend implies that the comet's active fraction has declined\nby about an order of magnitude since 1991 and may indicate that Hartley 2 is no\nlonger hyperactive by definition.

With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks\ntargeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware\nacross various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to\nextend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep\nlearning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of\nlabeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient\nmalware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage\nthe ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for\nmalware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we\ntranslate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64). This\nallows us to apply a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another\nISA. Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware\ndetection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA.",

However, critical challenges remain in generating\nhigh-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural\nhand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames\nbut suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,\nand scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,\nresulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this\nwork, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates\naudio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into\nhigh-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose\nsequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our\npose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual\nanchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance\nsemantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward\nmechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD\nand HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync.

The discussion then\nturns to operator learning by covering essential components such as data\ngeneration, loss functions, and widely used architectures for representing\nfunction-to-function maps. The core of the chapter centers on the end-to-end\ninverse operator learning paradigm, which aims to directly map observed data to\nthe solution of the inverse problem without requiring explicit knowledge of the\nforward map. It highlights the unique challenge that noise plays in this\ndata-driven inversion setting, presents structure-aware architectures for both\npoint predictions and posterior estimates, and surveys relevant theory for\nlinear and nonlinear inverse problems. The chapter also discusses the\nestimation of priors and regularizers, where operator learning is used more\nselectively within classical inversion algorithms.",

    "abstract": "We study stochastic systems characterized by difference inclusions. Such\nstochastic differential inclusions are defined by set-valued maps involving the\ncurrent state and stochastic input. For such systems, we investigate the\nproblem of proving bounds on the worst-case probability of violating safety\nproperties. Our approach uses the well-known concept of barrier functions from\nthe study of stochastic control systems. However, barrier functions are hard to\nprove in the presence of stochastic inputs and adversarial choices due to the\nset-valued nature of the dynamics.\n  In this paper, we show that under some assumptions on the set-valued map\nincluding upper semi-continuity and convexity combined with a concave barrier\nfunction vastly simplifies the proof of barrier conditions, allowing us to\neffectively substitute each random input in terms of its expectation. We prove\nkey results based on the theory of set-valued maps and provide some interesting\nnumerical examples. The ideas proposed here will contribute to the growing\ninterest in problems of robust control and verification of stochastic systems\nin the presence of uncertain distributions and unmodeled dynamics.",

We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions\ndescribing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time,\nand map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of\nvacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes.

Separately, a\nnumber of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,\nlesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high\naccuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the\npotential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM\nembedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to\npredict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the\nembedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval\ncase study using the SLICE-3D dataset.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel Multi-Order Monte Carlo approach for uncertainty\nquantification in the context of multiscale time-dependent partial differential\nequations. The new framework leverages Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta time\nintegrators to satisfy the asymptotic-preserving property across different\ndiscretization orders of accuracy. In contrast to traditional Multi-Level Monte\nCarlo methods, which require costly hierarchical re-meshing, our method\nconstructs a multi-order hierarchy by varying both spatial and temporal\ndiscretization orders within the Monte Carlo framework. This enables efficient\nvariance reduction while naturally adapting to the multiple scales inherent in\nthe problem. The proposed method is particularly well-suited for hyperbolic\nsystems with stiff relaxation, kinetic equations, and low Mach number flows,\nwhere standard Multi-Level Monte Carlo techniques often encounter computational\nchallenges. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the novel Multi-Order Monte\nCarlo approach achieves substantial reduction of both error and variance while\nmaintaining asymptotic consistency in the asymptotic limit.",

    "abstract": "The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object\n(the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion's\ntidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and\nhas synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist\nconsidering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We\nfill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving\nnonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived\nfrom an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded\nones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation\naddresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M,\nand fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show\nthat as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to\ndevelop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates\nover multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with\neccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold\npericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30%\nhigher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic\nequilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold\nseparation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at\neach pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M\neven with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic\ntides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for\ninteracting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous\nexoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.",

    "abstract": "Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable\nDiffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing\nsignificant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery\nlocalization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly\nannotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image\nmanipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to\nintegrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into\nan image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery\nlocalization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of\nSD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to\ninherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this\nfoundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable\nDiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the\nmulti-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating\nimage forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific\nhighpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the\nlatent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.\nNotably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,\nthereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.\nExperimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in\nperformance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current\nstate-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model\ndemonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document\nforgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were\nentirely unseen during training.",

Despite\nshowcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue\nis the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the\nuser's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer\nthe MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In\ncontrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build\nsynthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary\nmodels, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to\ngauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of\ngenerated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options\n(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf\nMLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we\nrefer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated\nanswers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nfine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward.

    "abstract": "Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) represents a compelling alternative to\ncollisionless dark matter, with diverse phenomenological signals from dwarf\ngalaxy to galaxy cluster scales. We present new constraints on the SIDM cross\nsection from the galaxy cluster MACS J0138-2155, host to the strongly lensed\nsupernovae Requiem and Encore. Our analysis combines strong gravitational\nlensing with spatially resolved stellar kinematics of the central galaxy,\nemploying several methodological advances over previous cluster-scale SIDM\nstudies. The result is a self-consistent measurement of the density profile of\nMACS J0138-2155 across two orders of magnitude in radius. Our lensing and\nkinematics analyses individually yield highly consistent results, and from\ntheir combination we report a 95% confidence upper limit on the SIDM cross\nsection of $\\sigma/m < 0.613$ cm$^2$/g, at an interaction velocity of $\\langle\nv_\\text{pair}\\rangle < 2090$ km/s. This constraint, derived from the most\ndetailed single-system analysis to date, is competitive with previous\ncluster-scale limits while demonstrating the power of combining complementary\ngravitational probes. The methodology developed here advances precision cluster\nlens modeling and will inform future studies of dark matter physics, as well as\ntime-delay cosmography in this unique strong lensing system. Additionally, our\nresults imply SN Requiem will reappear sooner than previously reported, with a\n1$\\sigma$ CL between January 2027 and November 2028 at H$_0 = 67.7$ km s$^{-1}$\nMpc$^{-1}$.",

    "abstract": "We analyze eight spectroscopically confirmed Little Red Dots (LRDs) at\nredshifts $z = 5.1-8.7$ with JWST/NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI data. The LRDs have\nred NIRCam colors, F150W-F444W $>$ 1, but flat NIRCam-MIRI colors, $-0.5 <\n\\mathrm{F444W - F770W} < 0.5$, suggesting weak warm/hot dust components. The\nLRDs have $-1.0 < {F1000W - F1500W} < 1.1$, suggestive of non-uniform rest\nnear-IR properties within the sample. We model the spectral energy\ndistributions (SEDs) of the LRDs using the CIGALE and Prospector codes to\nassess how the differing templates impact the interpretation for LRDs for cases\nof: (1) models with star-forming stellar populations only; (2) active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) dominated models; and (3) composite AGN and star-forming models.\nUsing the Bayesian information criterion, we find that six of the eight LRDs\nfavor AGN models compared to star-forming models, though no model reproduces\nall of the observed properties. Two LRDs with pronounced Balmer-breaks and\nbroad H$\\alpha$ have SEDs that are reproduced with hot, dense-gas ($\\log\nT/\\mathrm{K}=5-5.7$, $\\log n/\\mathrm{cm^{-3}} = 9-11$) models with low dust\nattenuation ($A(V)\\simeq 0.5$ mag). However, these models require an additional\nthermal component (800-1400 K) to account for the MIRI data, and fail to\nreproduce the rest-UV and narrow [OIII] emission. The total bolometric emission\nfrom the dense-gas models, and possibly CIGALE AGN models, appear consistent\nwith literature constraints in the far-IR and radio, and require $\\log\nL_{bol}/L_\\odot<12$. These results suggest that our LRDs cannot be modeled\nentirely with standard templates, but instead require a novel treatment of gas\nconditions, AGN and star-formation.",

In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face\nwhen designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI\nprojects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for\nParticipatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI\nprojects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in\nthe field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment\npractices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of\nequity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI\nresearchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find\nthat these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work,\nresearchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the\nrecruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses,\nwe provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward\nrecruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices\nfor Participatory AI researchers.",

    "abstract": "Aerosols appear to be ubiquitous in exoplanetary atmospheres. However because\nour understanding of the physical processes that govern aerosols is incomplete,\ntheir presence makes the measurement of atmospheric properties, such as\nmolecular abundance ratios, difficult. We show that aerosol particles in\nhighly-irradiated exoplanets experience an additional acceleration due to\nstellar radiation pressure. The strength of this radiative acceleration often\nexceeds the planet's gravity and can approach values of ~10-20x gravity's for\nlow-density planets (typically sub-Saturns) hosting ~0.1--1 micron aerosols.\nSince these highly irradiated, low-density planets are often the best targets\nfor atmospheric characterisation with current instrumentation, radiation\npressure is likely an important process when considering aerosol dynamics. We\nfind that radiation pressure accelerates hazes produced by photochemistry at\nhigh altitudes to faster terminal velocities, causing them to grow more slowly.\nHence, the particles are smaller and have lower mass concentrations in the\npresence of radiation pressure. By simulating haze-like aerosols in a 2D\nequatorial band model, we show that radiation pressure steepens optical slopes\nin transmission spectra, resulting in less muted molecular features in the\nNear-IR and gives rise to a correlation between the strength of radiation\npressure and the molecular feature amplitude. Furthermore, the interaction of\nzonal winds and radiation pressure impacts both the optical slopes and\namplitudes on the individual morning and evening terminators.",

While quantum\nerror correction (QEC) offers a clear path towards fault tolerance, overcoming\nthe scalability issues will take time. Early applications will likely rely on\nQEC combined with quantum error mitigation (QEM). We introduce a QEM scheme\nagainst both compilation errors and logical-gate noise that is circuit-, QEC\ncode-, and compiler-agnostic. The scheme builds on quasi-probability\ndistribution methods and uses information about the circuit's gates'\ncompilations to attain an unbiased estimation of noiseless expectation values\nincurring a constant sample-complexity overhead. Moreover, it features maximal\ncircuit size and QEC code-distance both independent of the target precision, in\ncontrast to strategies based on QEC alone. We formulate the mitigation\nprocedure as a linear program, demonstrate its efficacy through numerical\nsimulations, and illustrate it for estimating the Jones polynomials of knots.\nOur method significantly reduces quantum resource requirements for\nhigh-precision estimations, offering a practical route towards fault-tolerant\nquantum computation with precision-independent overheads.",

Using VLT/MUSE integral field spectroscopic data, we\nspatially resolve the stellar and gas kinematics to examine extraplanar gas\nassociated with ram-pressure stripping. We complement this analysis with\noptical and near-infrared imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope to visualize\nthe galactic structure of each member. The jellyfish galaxies are all\nblue-shifted with respect to the cluster and show velocity gradients of a few\nhundred $\\mathrm{kms}^{-1}$ across their tails.

We examine the water content of accreted material using\nthe oxygen abundances of 51 highly polluted white dwarfs. Within this sample,\nwe present new abundances for three H-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that\nshowed promise for accreting water-rich material. Throughout, we explore the\nimpact of the observed phase and lifetime of accretion disks on the inferred\nelemental abundances of the parent bodies that pollute each white dwarf. Our\nresults indicate that white dwarfs sample a range of dry to water-rich\nmaterial, with median uncertainties in water mass fractions of $\\approx$15\\%.\nAmongst the He-dominated white dwarfs, 35/39 water abundances are consistent\nwith corresponding H abundances. While for any individual white dwarf it may be\nambiguous as to whether or not water is present in the accreted parent body,\nwhen considered as a population the prevalence of water-rich bodies is\nstatistically robust. The population as a whole has a median water mass\nfraction of $\\approx$25\\%, and enforcing chondritic parent body compositions,\nwe find that 31/51 WDs are likely to have non-zero water concentrations. This\nconclusion is different from a similar previous analysis of white dwarf\npollution and we discuss reasons why this might be the case.

High-speed photometry confirms persistent\ndouble-peaked variability consistent with cyclotron beaming, thus indicating\nthe presence of a magnetic WD. Phase-resolved Keck/LRIS spectroscopy reveals\nstrong hydrogen and helium emission lines but no donor features, indicating the\naccretor is a magnetic WD and the donor is hydrogen-rich, but cold and faint.\nThe absence of a detectable donor and the low inferred temperature ($\\lesssim$\n3500 K) disfavor an evolved donor scenario. Instead, the short period and the\nsystem's halo-like kinematics suggest Gaia19bxc may be the first known\nmetal-poor polar. Because metal-poor donors are more compact than\nsolar-metallicity donors of the same mass, they can reach shorter minimum\nperiods.

    "abstract": "It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the\none-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner\ntransformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the\nminimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated\nKramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped\nto the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and\nhigher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the\nparity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary\npolyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the\ngauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged)\nfermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence\nof the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the\ndiscrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying\nthis bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally\ninvariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities\nin spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW\n(self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of\nhigher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization\nframework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other\nknown exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish\nnew connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.",

EMRI scenarios offer a robust framework for\ninterpreting QPEs by characterizing observational signatures associated with\nthe secondary's orbital dynamics. This, in turn, enables extraction of the\nMBH/EMRI physical properties and provides a means to test the EMRI scenario,\ndistinguishing models and addressing the question: what can QPE timings teach\nus about massive black holes and EMRIs? In this study, we employ analytic\nexpressions for Kerr geodesics to efficiently resolve the trajectory of the\nsecondary object and perform GPU-accelerated Bayesian inference to assess the\ninformation content of QPE timings. Using our inference framework, referred to\nas QPE-FIT (Fast Inference with Timing), we explore QPE timing constraints on\nastrophysical parameters, such as EMRI orbital parameters and MBH mass/spin. We\nfind that mild-eccentricity EMRIs ($e\\sim0.1-0.3$) can constrain MBH mass and\nEMRI semimajor axis/eccentricity to the 10% level within tens of orbital\nperiods, while MBH spin is unconstrained for the explored semimajor axes $\\geq\n100R_g$ and monitoring baselines $\\mathcal{O}(10-100\\rm)$ orbits.

The FL* theory predicted hole pockets each of\nfractional area $p/8$ at hole doping $p$, in contrast to the area $p/4$ in a\nspin density wave state or its thermal fluctuation. A recent magnetotransport\nobservation of the Yamaji angle is in good agreement with area $p/8$.\n  We review a theory for the FL* phase of a single-band model using a layer\nconstruction with a pair of ancilla qubits on each site: the Ancilla Layer\nModel (ALM). Its mean field yields hole pockets of area $p/8$, and matches the\ngapped photoemission spectrum in the anti-nodal region of the Brillouin zone.\nFluctuations are described by the SU(2) gauge theory of a background spin\nliquid with critical Dirac spinons. A Monte Carlo study of the thermal SU(2)\ngauge theory transforms the hole pockets into Fermi arcs in photoemission. One\nroute to confinement of FL* upon lowering temperature yields a $d$-wave\nsuperconductor via a Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of $h/(2e)$ vortices, with\nnodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles featuring anisotropic velocities and vortices\nsurrounded by charge order halos. An alternative route produces a\ncharge-ordered metallic state that exhibits quantum oscillations in agreement\nwith experiments.\n  Increasing doping from the FL* phase in the ALM drives a transition to a\nFermi liquid at large doping, passing through an intermediate strange metal\nregime. We formulate a theory of this metal using a critical quantum `charge'\nliquid of mobile electrons in the presence of disorder, via an extension of the\nSachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.\n  At low temperatures, and across optimal and over doping, we address the\nregimes of extended non-Fermi liquid behavior by Griffiths effects near quantum\nphase transitions in disordered metals.",

We\npresent the first exception to this rule: the Love numbers of a black hole\nperturbed by a fermionic field are nonzero. We derive a closed-form expression\nof these fermionic Love numbers for generic spin in the background of a Kerr\nblack hole with arbitrary angular momentum. In contrast, we show that the\nfermionic dissipation numbers vanish for static perturbations, reflecting the\nabsence of superradiance for fermions.

We\npair these observations with uniformly modeled host galaxies to understand how\nbroadband afterglow luminosities are influenced by their environmental\nproperties. We compare the X-ray and optical afterglow luminosities at 3 hr\nwith projected physical and host-normalized galactocentric offsets, host\nstellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), specific SFR, and stellar population\nage. In the radio band, we explore how these environmental properties may\ninfluence afterglow detectability. We find statistical support that X-ray\nafterglows are brighter in galaxies with younger ages, lower masses, and higher\nactive star formation - trends that also scale with ISM density. While we also\nvisualize these differences for optical afterglows, the only statistically\nsignificant trend is that they are brighter in hosts with higher SFR. We\nfurther find that X-ray (radio) afterglows are more luminous (more likely to be\ndetected) at low projected offsets. Overall, this indicates that X-ray\nafterglow luminosity is the most predictable indicator of host environment\namong the three bands. We find the afterglow luminosities of three possible\nmerger-driven long GRBs to be unremarkable compared to the traditional short\nGRB population, strengthening the case that these events arise from mergers.\nFinally we find that the estimated on-axis afterglow luminosity of GW170817 is\nin the faintest ~30%, aligning with its quiescent, old and massive host\nenvironment.",

It is compact ($\\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold\n($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\\sim\n10^{6}$ $M_{\\odot}$.

The non-detection of a luminous component\nreinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI\nCloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas\nin thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make\nCloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud.

Existing approaches\nsuffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly\nin execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness.\nRecent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a\nplanner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which\nprevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the\nscarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework\nthat integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor\n(Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage,\nSpecialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner\nfor each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of\ntask trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all\nsuccessful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated\ndataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner.\nThis equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.\nEvaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark,\nCODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art\namong open-source models.",

This paper tackles the\nlimitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that\nintegrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models.\nThe resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key\ncharacteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into\ntractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines\ndiscrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide\ndiffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and\n(3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure\ntrajectory feasibility.

For low z, opinions differ on\nwhether the uptick in the LGRB RD is due to a distinct class of low-luminosity\nGRBs or perhaps even a different progenitor subclass. To investigate these\nquestions, we utilize data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and\nground-based observatories (redshift).

The comparison shows that the 'no evolution'\ncase can be ruled out. Our study highlights that the beaming angle evolution or\nthe simple power law evolution are also not sufficient to obtain a good match\nbetween the LGRB-RD and SFRD.

    "abstract": "SuperCDMS SNOLAB uses kilogram-scale germanium and silicon detectors to\nsearch for dark matter. Each detector has Transition Edge Sensors (TESs)\npatterned on the top and bottom faces of a large crystal substrate, with the\nTESs electrically grouped into six phonon readout channels per face. Noise\ncorrelations are expected among a detector's readout channels, in part because\nthe channels and their readout electronics are located in close proximity to\none another. Moreover, owing to the large size of the detectors, energy\ndeposits can produce vastly different phonon propagation patterns depending on\ntheir location in the substrate, resulting in a strong position dependence in\nthe readout-channel pulse shapes. Both of these effects can degrade the energy\nresolution and consequently diminish the dark matter search sensitivity of the\nexperiment if not accounted for properly. We present a new algorithm for pulse\nreconstruction, mathematically formulated to take into account correlated noise\nand pulse shape variations. This new algorithm fits N readout channels with a\nsuperposition of M pulse templates simultaneously - hence termed the N$\\times$M\nfilter. We describe a method to derive the pulse templates using principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and to extract energy and position information using a\ngradient boosted decision tree (GBDT). We show that these new N$\\times$M and\nGBDT analysis tools can reduce the impact from correlated noise sources while\nimproving the reconstructed energy resolution for simulated mono-energetic\nevents by more than a factor of three and for the 71Ge K-shell electron-capture\npeak recoils measured in a previous version of SuperCDMS called CDMSlite to $<$\n50 eV from the previously published value of $\\sim$100 eV. These results lay\nthe groundwork for position reconstruction in SuperCDMS with the N$\\times$M\noutputs.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short\naudio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires\ntemporal coherence and compositional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose\nAudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs)\nwith TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory\npossesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It\nemploys LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered\nsub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and\nemotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)\nDecoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser\ncollaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for\nintra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence\npreservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension\nand audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory\neliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy\nbetween components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,\nencompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound\nnarratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both\nsingle-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA\nbaselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.

This prevents direct\nstudies of topology in the presence of disorder, further hindering an extension\nto disordered interacting topological phases.

Prior work\ndemonstrates the vulnerability of RAG systems by misleading them into\ngenerating attacker-chosen outputs through poisoning the knowledge base.\nHowever, this paper uncovers that such attacks could be mitigated by the strong\n\\textit{self-correction ability (SCA)} of modern LLMs, which can reject false\ncontext once properly configured. This SCA poses a significant challenge for\nattackers aiming to manipulate RAG systems.\n  In contrast to previous poisoning methods, which primarily target the\nknowledge base, we introduce \\textsc{DisarmRAG}, a new poisoning paradigm that\ncompromises the retriever itself to suppress the SCA and enforce\nattacker-chosen outputs. This compromisation enables the attacker to\nstraightforwardly embed anti-SCA instructions into the context provided to the\ngenerator, thereby bypassing the SCA. To this end, we present a\ncontrastive-learning-based model editing technique that performs localized and\nstealthy edits, ensuring the retriever returns a malicious instruction only for\nspecific victim queries while preserving benign retrieval behavior. To further\nstrengthen the attack, we design an iterative co-optimization framework that\nautomatically discovers robust instructions capable of bypassing prompt-based\ndefenses. We extensively evaluate DisarmRAG across six LLMs and three QA\nbenchmarks. Our results show near-perfect retrieval of malicious instructions,\nwhich successfully suppress SCA and achieve attack success rates exceeding 90\\%\nunder diverse defensive prompts. Also, the edited retriever remains stealthy\nunder several detection methods, highlighting the urgent need for\nretriever-centric defenses.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases\nand cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for\nsmall, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document\nExperts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor\nsearch with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into\nsemantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query\ntime, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those\nclusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking\nwhile keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks,\nMODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while\nreducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and\nmulti-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter\nclusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small\nand medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.",

    "abstract": "In disaster-stricken and large-scale urban emergency scenarios, ensuring\nreliable communication remains a formidable challenge, as collapsed\ninfrastructure, unpredictable mobility, and severely constrained resources\ndisrupt conventional networks. Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs), though resilient\nthrough their store-carry-forward paradigm, reveal the fundamental weaknesses\nof classical protocols - Epidemic, Spray-and-Wait, and MaxProp - when\nconfronted with sparse encounters, buffer shortages, and volatile connectivity.\nTo address these obstacles, this study proposes ML-MaxProp, a hybrid routing\nprotocol that strengthens MaxProp with supervised machine learning. By\nleveraging contextual features such as encounter frequency, hop count, buffer\noccupancy, message age, and time-to-live (TTL), ML-MaxProp predicts relay\nsuitability in real time, transforming rigid heuristics into adaptive\nintelligence. Extensive simulations in the ONE environment using the Helsinki\nSPMBM mobility model show that ML-MaxProp consistently surpasses baseline\nprotocols, achieving higher delivery probability, lower latency, and reduced\noverhead. Statistical validation further shows that these improvements are both\nsignificant and robust, even under highly resource-constrained and unstable\nconditions. Overall, this work shows that ML-MaxProp is not just an incremental\nrefinement but a lightweight, adaptive, and practical solution to one of the\nhardest challenges in DTNs: sustaining mission-critical communication when\ninfrastructure collapses and every forwarding decision becomes critical.",

We detect 66 net counts of\nX-ray emission in the 0.5-2 keV band extending to at least 30 kpc from the\nbrightest QSO in MQN01. The morphology and spectrum are consistent with thermal\nemission from hot plasma in CIE. Photoionization is negligible, and IC is\ndisfavored. A joint spatial and spectral MCMC analysis provides consistency\nwith a beta-model with a steep density profile and a gas temperature kT~1.8 keV\nand virial halo mass Mvir~3e13 Mo. The inferred hot gas mass is\nMhot(<Rvir)~2.6e12 Mo, which is ~8.3% of Mvir, or ~56% of the theoretical\ncosmological baryon budget of the halo. The hot gas also emits an exceptionally\nhigh Lx, with a measured L2-10~2.3e45 erg/s within the central 30 kpc. This\nsystem is a clear outlier in the Lx-Tx plane, indicating a thermodynamic state\ndistinct from that of evolved lower-redshift hot halos. The cooling time in the\ninner 15-30 kpc is comparable to the local dynamical time, suggesting that the\ngas could become locally unstable in the absence of heating or feedback.\nMoreover, the thermal pressure associated with the detected CGM hot phase is\nlarge enough to confine the cold and dense clumps, which are required to\nreproduce the high Lya emission associated with the inner regions of the MQN01\nstructure. Although limited to a single system, our results provide unique\ninformation on the multi-phase properties of the CGM and a view of the nascent\nthermal hot gas phase observed in local galaxy clusters.",

However, exact conditional simulation from this\npredictive distribution is intractable or inefficient for many spatial process\nmodels. In this paper, we propose neural conditional simulation (NCS), a\ngeneral method for spatial conditional simulation that is based on neural\ndiffusion models. Specifically, using spatial masks, we implement a conditional\nscore-based diffusion model that evolves Gaussian noise into samples from a\npredictive distribution when given a partially observed spatial field and\nspatial process parameters as inputs. The diffusion model relies on a neural\nnetwork that only requires unconditional samples from the spatial process for\ntraining. Once trained, the diffusion model is amortized with respect to the\nobservations in the partially observed field, the number and locations of those\nobservations, and the spatial process parameters, and can therefore be used to\nconditionally simulate from a broad class of predictive distributions without\nretraining the neural network. We assess the NCS-generated simulations against\nsimulations from the true conditional distribution of a Gaussian process model,\nand against Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from a Brown--Resnick\nprocess model for spatial extremes. In the latter case, we show that it is more\nefficient and accurate to conditionally simulate using NCS than classical MCMC\ntechniques implemented in standard software. We conclude that NCS enables\nefficient and accurate conditional simulation from spatial predictive\ndistributions that are challenging to sample from using traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Cross-view geo-localization is a critical task for UAV navigation, event\ndetection, and aerial surveying, as it enables matching between drone-captured\nand satellite imagery. Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into a\njoint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images. However, these\nmethods typically assume perfect alignment of image pairs during training,\nwhich rarely holds true in real-world scenarios. In practice, factors such as\nurban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather\nfrequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where\nonly partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, this\nsource of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in current\nresearch. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the Noisy\nCorrespondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming to\nbridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To this\nend, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), a\nnovel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimated\ndata uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential\nco-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with high\ncorrespondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine feature\nlearning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct from\ntraditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertainty\nand loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providing\nrobust supervision for noisy samples. Comprehensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of individual components in PAUL,which consistently achieves\nsuperior performance over other competitive noisy-correspondence-driven methods\nin various noise ratios.",

In particular,\nOpenM3D is a single-stage detector adapting the 2D-induced voxel features from\nthe ImGeoNet model. To support OV, it is jointly trained with a class-agnostic\n3D localization loss requiring high-quality 3D pseudo boxes and a\nvoxel-semantic alignment loss requiring diverse pre-trained CLIP features.

The structure of this problem allows for computing\nthe gradient with Monte Carlo methods by generating trajectories of TCLs.\nContrary to all previous work, in our MCOT framework, it is possible to choose\nthe sampling law, which considerably speeds up the calculations. This algorithm\nmitigates the need for extensive state-space discretization and significantly\nreduces computational complexity compared to existing methods. Numerical\nexperiments in a water heater case study demonstrate that our MCOT-based method\neffectively coordinates TCLs under various constraints.

We sign the\nperception-correcting term: it is non-negative (non-positive) if the population\nwas ex-ante under-perceived (over-perceived). We then consider the implications\nfor pay gaps between equally-skilled populations that differ in information,\nperceptions, or both, and identify conditions under which improving information\nnarrows pay gaps.",

    "abstract": "When metals are magnetized, emulsions phase separate, or galaxies cluster,\ndomain walls and patterns form and irremediably coarsen over time. Such\ncoarsening is universally driven by diffusive relaxation toward equilibrium.\nHere, we discover an inertial counterpart - wave coarsening - in active elastic\nmedia, where vibrations emerge and spontaneously grow in wavelength, period,\nand amplitude, before a globally synchronized state called a time crystal\nforms. We observe wave coarsening in one- and two-dimensional solids and\ncapture its dynamical scaling. We further arrest the process by breaking\nmomentum conservation and reveal a far-from-equilibrium nonlinear analogue to\nchiral topological edge modes. Our work unveils the crucial role of symmetries\nin the formation of time crystals and opens avenues for the control of\nnonlinear vibrations in active materials.",

Through modifications of the\ntimestamp field, we demonstrate that SCAMPER enables an attacker to accomplish\nsurreptitious communications between devices in the power system to trigger a\nvariety of malicious actions. These timestamp modifications can be performed\nwithout having any impact on the operation of the power system. However, having\nrecognized the potential for this covert channel, we show that SCAMPER can\ninstead be applied for defensive security purposes as an integrated\ncryptographic data integrity mechanism that can facilitate detection of false\ndata injection (FDI) attacks. We perform experimental studies of the proposed\nmethods on two Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testbeds to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed SCAMPER framework for both malicious and\nprotective purposes.",

We use a\nmean-field approximation to self-consistently describe the effect of\nimpurity-gas collisions on impurity motion, while decoherence of the\nimpurities' internal state is computed exactly within a functional determinant\napproach. At equilibrium, we find that the impurities undergo bath-induced\nlocalisation as the impurity-gas interaction strength is increased. We then\nstudy the non-equilibrium dynamics induced by a sudden change of the\nimpurities' internal state, which can be experimentally probed by Ramsey\ninterferometry. Our theoretical approach allows us to investigate the effect of\nimpurity motion on decoherence dynamics, finding strong deviations from the\nuniversal behaviour associated with Anderson's orthogonality catastrophe when\nthe mass imbalance between impurity and gas atoms is small. Finally, we show\nthat mobile impurities can be used as thermometers of their environment and\nthat bath-mediated correlations can be beneficial for thermometric performance\nat low temperatures, even in the presence of non-trivial impurity motion. Our\nresults showcase the interesting open quantum dynamics of mobile impurities\ndephasing in a common environment, and could help provide more precise\ntemperature estimates of ultracold fermionic mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Quantum annealing offers a promising paradigm for solving NP-hard\ncombinatorial optimization problems, but its practical application is severely\nhindered by two challenges: the complex, manual process of translating problem\ndescriptions into the requisite Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization\n(QUBO) format and the scalability limitations of current quantum hardware. To\naddress these obstacles, we propose a novel end-to-end framework, LLM-QUBO,\nthat automates this entire formulation-to-solution pipeline. Our system\nleverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to parse natural language, automatically\ngenerating a structured mathematical representation. To overcome hardware\nlimitations, we integrate a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition\nmethod. This approach partitions the problem, compiling the combinatorial\ncomplex master problem into a compact QUBO format, while delegating linearly\nstructured sub-problems to classical solvers. The correctness of the generated\nQUBO and the scalability of the hybrid approach are validated using classical\nsolvers, establishing a robust performance baseline and demonstrating the\nframework's readiness for quantum hardware. Our primary contribution is a\nsynergistic computing paradigm that bridges classical AI and quantum computing,\naddressing key challenges in the practical application of optimization problem.\nThis automated workflow significantly reduces the barrier to entry, providing a\nviable pathway to transform quantum devices into accessible accelerators for\nlarge-scale, real-world optimization challenges.",

No\nsignificant emission above the LST-1 energy threshold for this observation\n(\\sim 100 GeV) was detected in the direction of SN 2024bch, and we computed an\nintegral upper limit on the photon flux of F_\\gamma(>100 GeV) \\le 3.61 \\times\n10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1} based on six nonconsecutive nights of observations with\nthe LST-1, between 16 and 38 days after the explosion.

Finally, using archival\nimages from the Hubble Space Telescope, we constrained the luminosity of the\nprogenitor star to log(L_{pr}/L_\\odot) \\le 4.82 and its effective temperature\nto T_{pr} \\le 4000 K. Our results suggest that SN 2024bch is a type IIn-L\nsupernova that originated from a progenitor star consistent with a red\nsupergiant.

In particular, when the\nboundary of the set is entirely within the interior of the constraint set, the\nproposed condition reduces to the well-known Nagumo condition, known to be\nnecessary and sufficient for forward invariance in this case. This being said,\nthe proposed condition is only necessary in the general setting.

Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and\nutility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce\nIntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard\nmodel to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query\nrewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.\nSpecifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising\napproximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety\nlabels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip\nthe guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent\nanalysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward\noptimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model\nsignals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance\nperformance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in\nmultiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak\nattack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing\nover-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.",

    "abstract": "Applying robust optimization often requires selecting an appropriate\nuncertainty set both in shape and size, a choice that directly affects the\ntrade-off between average-case and worst-case performances. In practice, this\ncalibration is usually done via trial-and-error: solving the robust\noptimization problem many times with different uncertainty set shapes and\nsizes, and examining their performance trade-off. This process is\ncomputationally expensive and ad hoc. In this work, we take a principled\napproach to study this issue for robust optimization problems with linear\nobjective functions, convex feasible regions, and convex uncertainty sets. We\nintroduce and study what we define as the robust path: a set of robust\nsolutions obtained by varying the uncertainty set's parameters. Our central\ngeometric insight is that a robust path can be characterized as a Bregman\nprojection of a curve (whose geometry is defined by the uncertainty set) onto\nthe feasible region. This leads to a surprising discovery that the robust path\ncan be approximated via the trajectories of standard optimization algorithms,\nsuch as the proximal point method, of the deterministic counterpart problem. We\ngive a sharp approximation error bound and show it depends on the geometry of\nthe feasible region and the uncertainty set. We also illustrate two special\ncases where the approximation error is zero: the feasible region is\npolyhedrally monotone (e.g., a simplex feasible region under an ellipsoidal\nuncertainty set), or the feasible region and the uncertainty set follow a dual\nrelationship. We demonstrate the practical impact of this approach in two\nsettings: portfolio optimization and adversarial deep learning.",

    "abstract": "The ability to research and synthesize knowledge is central to human\nexpertise and progress. An emerging class of systems promises these exciting\ncapabilities through generative research synthesis, performing retrieval over\nthe live web and synthesizing discovered sources into long-form, cited\nsummaries. However, evaluating such systems remains an open challenge: existing\nquestion-answering benchmarks focus on short-form factual responses, while\nexpert-curated datasets risk staleness and data contamination. Both fail to\ncapture the complexity and evolving nature of real research synthesis tasks. In\nthis work, we introduce DeepScholar-bench, a live benchmark and holistic,\nautomated evaluation framework designed to evaluate generative research\nsynthesis. DeepScholar-bench draws queries from recent, high-quality ArXiv\npapers and focuses on a real research synthesis task: generating the related\nwork sections of a paper by retrieving, synthesizing, and citing prior\nresearch. Our evaluation framework holistically assesses performance across\nthree key dimensions, knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and\nverifiability. We also develop DeepScholar-base, a reference pipeline\nimplemented efficiently using the LOTUS API. Using the DeepScholar-bench\nframework, we perform a systematic evaluation of prior open-source systems,\nsearch AI's, OpenAI's DeepResearch, and DeepScholar-base. We find that\nDeepScholar-base establishes a strong baseline, attaining competitive or higher\nperformance than each other method. We also find that DeepScholar-bench remains\nfar from saturated, with no system exceeding a score of $19\\%$ across all\nmetrics. These results underscore the difficulty of DeepScholar-bench, as well\nas its importance for progress towards AI systems capable of generative\nresearch synthesis.

In this work, we present a systematic framework to investigate the\ninfluence of both individual and coupled environmental variables on device\nefficiency and crystallization kinetics. We developed an integrated fabrication\nplatform with precise, independent control over ambient solvent partial\npressure, absolute humidity, and temperature during spin-coating and\nthermal-annealing processes, respectively.

To isolate and quantify these interactions, we\ndeveloped an interpretable machine learning approach that combines knowledge\ndistillation with Shapley interaction analysis. The model revealed the\ncontribution of each interaction varies across different processing conditions.\nOur study highlights the importance of integrated ambient sensing and control\nto achieve repeatable perovskite solar cells, and demonstrates the utility of\ncombining active learning with interpretable machine learning to navigate\ncomplex, high-dimensional processing landscapes.",

Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for\ndownstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor\nattacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend\nbecause end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks\nconsist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or\nstylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in\nthe model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore\nwhether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge\nof the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and\nimplement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)\nlayer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2\nsparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)\nreinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.\nEach method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring\nvalidation accuracy to avoid over-pruning.

This work addresses Incremental Test Time Adaptation of Vision\nLanguage Models, tackling scenarios where unseen classes and unseen domains\ncontinuously appear during testing. Unlike traditional Test Time Adaptation\napproaches, where the test stream comes only from a predefined set of classes,\nour framework allows models to adapt simultaneously to both covariate and label\nshifts, actively incorporating new classes as they emerge. Towards this goal,\nwe establish a new benchmark for ITTA, integrating single image TTA methods for\nVLMs with active labeling techniques that query an oracle for samples\npotentially representing unseen classes during test time. We propose a\nsegmentation assisted active labeling module, termed SegAssist, which is\ntraining free and repurposes the segmentation capabilities of VLMs to refine\nactive sample selection, prioritizing samples likely to belong to unseen\nclasses. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the\npotential of SegAssist to enhance the performance of VLMs in real world\nscenarios, where continuous adaptation to emerging data is essential.\nProject-page:https://manogna-s.github.io/segassist/",

    "abstract": "Understanding how quantum materials relax from metastable states poses a\nfundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. In the layered\ndichalcogenide 1T-TaS$_2$, domain-wall-rich polaronic textures evolve toward a\nuniform ground state through reconfiguration events that exhibit a crossover\nfrom thermally activated to temperature-independent behavior-indicative of\nquantum tunneling. Here, we employ quantum simulation of a two-dimensional\ntransverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with longitudinal bias to uncover the\nmicroscopic processes underlying this relaxation. Using a Schrieffer-Wolff\ntransformation, we map the TFIM to a hardcore boson model, revealing that\nsingle-polaron tunneling events, rather than collective multi-particle\ntransitions, dominate domain wall motion. A scaling analysis of reconfiguration\nrates across varying transverse fields $h_x$ shows collapse when temperature is\nrescaled as $T \\to h_x^n T$ with $n \\approx 1.2$, confirming the dominance of\nfirst- and second-order single-particle processes. This enables us to\nreconstruct a microscopic relaxation pathway consisting of cyclical polaron\nleakage followed by cascades of tunneling events. Our results establish quantum\nsimulation as a powerful tool for inferring real-space mechanisms in strongly\ncorrelated systems and demonstrate a concrete strategy for bridging effective\nspin models with the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum materials.",

Despite their applicability in mesoscopic simulations, these\napproaches are typically derived from top-down principles, leaving a gap in the\nbottom-up derivation of field-theoretical models for targeted molecular\nsystems. This work presents a systematic strategy for constructing statistical\nfield models for molecular liquids from the atomistic level, marking a critical\nstep toward bridging particle-based and field-theoretical modeling techniques.\nBy introducing molecular coarse-grained models as an intermediate step, this\nhierarchical approach reduces the complexity of the\natomistic-to-field-theoretical transformation while preserving important\nmicroscopic structural correlations. We systematically derive field-theoretical\nmodels in reciprocal space for both canonical and grand canonical ensembles\nusing the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.

    "abstract": "Language-driven image segmentation is a fundamental task in vision-language\nunderstanding, requiring models to segment regions of an image corresponding to\nnatural language expressions. Traditional methods approach this as a\ndiscriminative problem, assigning each pixel to foreground or background based\non semantic alignment. Recently, diffusion models have been introduced to this\ndomain, but existing approaches remain image-centric: they either (i) use image\ndiffusion models as visual feature extractors, (ii) synthesize segmentation\ndata via image generation to train discriminative models, or (iii) perform\ndiffusion inversion to extract attention cues from pre-trained image diffusion\nmodels-thereby treating segmentation as an auxiliary process. In this paper, we\npropose GS (Generative Segmentation), a novel framework that formulates\nsegmentation itself as a generative task via label diffusion. Instead of\ngenerating images conditioned on label maps and text, GS reverses the\ngenerative process: it directly generates segmentation masks from noise,\nconditioned on both the input image and the accompanying language description.\nThis paradigm makes label generation the primary modeling target, enabling\nend-to-end training with explicit control over spatial and semantic fidelity.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate GS on Panoptic\nNarrative Grounding (PNG), a representative and challenging benchmark for\nmultimodal segmentation that requires panoptic-level reasoning guided by\nnarrative captions. Experimental results show that GS significantly outperforms\nexisting discriminative and diffusion-based methods, setting a new\nstate-of-the-art for language-driven segmentation.",

Matching our priors to\nestimates of binary parameters from electromagnetic observations, we find log\nBayes factor of 0.22, highlighting that the source can be neither confirmed nor\nruled out. We place upper limits at 95% credibility on the chirp mass $M < 6.05\n\\times 10^{8}\\ M_{\\odot}$, and on the characteristic strain amplitude\n$\\textrm{log}_{10}(h_0)< -14.44$. This partially rules out the parameter space\nsuggested by electromagnetic observations of 3C 66B. We also independently\nreproduce the calculation of the chirp mass with the 3-mm flux monitor data\nfrom the unresolved core of 3C 66B. Based on this, we outline a new methodology\nfor constructing a joint likelihood of electromagnetic and gravitational-wave\ndata from supermassive black hole binaries. Finally, we suggest that firmly\nestablished SMBHB candidates may be treated as standard sirens for\ncomplementary constraints on the universe expansion rate.

Here we address\nthis tradeoff, bringing together the Kuramoto model with concepts from\nevolutionary game theory. We focus on the existence of self-interested\n''cheaters,'' which have been extensively studied in a variety of species. In\nour scenario, cheating individuals take part in the synchronous group display\nbut position themselves (in terms of phase) slightly ahead or behind the pack.\nThis allows them to enjoy both the group benefit of advertisement and the\nindividual benefit of being unique. But a group can only tolerate a limited\nnumber of such individuals while still achieving synchrony. We therefore\nincorporate a from of ''policing'' into our model: if an individual strays too\nfar from the group's synchronous phase, they reveal themselves as dishonest and\nare punished. Our model offers testable predictions regarding natural\npopulation compositions, and will hopefully spur further investigation into not\nonly how, but also why, natural systems synchronize.",

However, the current\nstate-of-the-art learning models do not take into account the student's\naffective states. Multiple studies in educational psychology support the claim\nthat positive or negative emotional states can impact a student's learning\ncapabilities. To bridge this gap, we present MathBuddy, an emotionally aware\nLLM-powered Math Tutor, which dynamically models the student's emotions and\nmaps them to relevant pedagogical strategies, making the tutor-student\nconversation a more empathetic one. The student's emotions are captured from\nthe conversational text as well as from their facial expressions. The student's\nemotions are aggregated from both modalities to confidently prompt our LLM\nTutor for an emotionally-aware response. We have effectively evaluated our\nmodel using automatic evaluation metrics across eight pedagogical dimensions\nand user studies. We report a massive 23 point performance gain using the win\nrate and a 3 point gain at an overall level using DAMR scores which strongly\nsupports our hypothesis of improving LLM-based tutor's pedagogical abilities by\nmodeling students' emotions.",

This discovery\nraises a crucial open question: how can we prune LLMs without sacrificing these\ncritical lie detection capabilities? Our investigation further reveals that\nnaively adjusting layer-wise pruning sparsity based on importance inadvertently\nremoves crucial weights, failing to improve lie detection performance despite\nits reliance on the most crucial LLM layer. To address this issue, we propose\nTruthful Pruning aligned by Layer-wise Outliers (TPLO), which places greater\nemphasis on layers with more activation outliers and stronger discriminative\nfeatures simultaneously. This preserves LLMs' original performance while\nretaining critical features of inner states needed for robust lie detection.\nMoreover, we introduce a prompting rule to enrich the TruthfulQA benchmark for\nbetter calibrating LLM pruning.

In this work, we\nintroduce an Agentic Commonsense and Math benchmark (AgentCoMa), where each\ncompositional task requires a commonsense reasoning step and a math reasoning\nstep. We test it on 61 LLMs of different sizes, model families, and training\nstrategies. We find that LLMs can usually solve both steps in isolation, yet\ntheir accuracy drops by ~30% on average when the two are combined. This is a\nsubstantially greater performance gap than the one we observe in prior\ncompositional benchmarks that combine multiple steps of the same reasoning\ntype. In contrast, non-expert human annotators can solve the compositional\nquestions and the individual steps in AgentCoMa with similarly high accuracy.\nFurthermore, we conduct a series of interpretability studies to better\nunderstand the performance gap, examining neuron patterns, attention maps and\nmembership inference.

In this system, the effective temperature is known to\nbe significantly smaller than the linear motion Unruh effect prediction when\nthe detector's energy gap is small: the effective temperature tends to zero in\nthe small gap limit, linearly in the gap. We show that a positive small gap\ntemperature at long interaction times can be regained via a controlled\nlong-time-small-gap double limit, provided the detector's coupling to the field\nis allowed to change sign. The resulting small gap temperature depends on the\nparameters of the circular motion but not on the details of the detector's\nswitching. The results broaden the energy range for pursuing an experimental\nverification of the circular motion Unruh effect in analogue spacetime\nexperiments.

We compare the\nsimulated effect of the perturbed fields on the pitch angle distributions of\nthe ion losses to Juno-JEDI measurements.

However, their inference remains slower than that of\nautoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and\nthe large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this\nwork, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer\nconvergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by\nhalf steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and\nrandom remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%\nof instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the\nrefinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a\ntraining-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.\nSpecifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to\ngo \"all-in\" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the\nconfidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It\nintegrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible\noverhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of\nLLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the\nnumber of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation\nquality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop\nsampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet\npowerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing\nspeedup techniques.

To this end, we study whether language models\nexhibit contextual robustness, or the capability to adhere to context-dependent\nsafety specifications. For this analysis, we develop a benchmark (PasswordEval)\nthat measures whether language models can correctly determine when a user\nrequest is authorized (i.e., with a correct password). We find that current\nopen- and closed-source models struggle with this seemingly simple task, and\nthat, perhaps surprisingly, reasoning capabilities do not generally improve\nperformance. In fact, we find that reasoning traces frequently leak\nconfidential information, which calls into question whether reasoning traces\nshould be exposed to users in such applications. We also scale the difficulty\nof our evaluation along multiple axes: (i) by adding adversarial user pressure\nthrough various jailbreaking strategies, and (ii) through longer multi-turn\nconversations where password verification is more challenging. Overall, our\nresults suggest that current frontier models are not well-suited to handling\nconfidential information, and that reasoning capabilities may need to be\ntrained in a different manner to make them safer for release in high-stakes\nsettings.",

    "abstract": "In dense metropolitan areas, searching for street parking adds to traffic\ncongestion. Like many other problems, real-time assistants based on mobile\nphones have been proposed, but their effectiveness is understudied. This work\nquantifies how varying levels of user coordination and information availability\nthrough such apps impact search time and the probability of finding street\nparking. Through a data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking ecosystem,\nwe analyze four distinct strategies: uncoordinated search (Unc-Agn),\ncoordinated parking without awareness of non-users (Cord-Agn), an idealized\noracle system that knows the positions of all non-users (Cord-Oracle), and our\nnovel/practical Cord-Approx strategy that estimates non-users' behavior\nprobabilistically. The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of\nhow close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to\nnavigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical\ndistances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a\nHungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity\nsimulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of\nCord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes\nfor non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx\nreduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs,\nand up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users.",

However, simultaneously achieving a large field of view (FOV), high\nresolution, and low side-lobe level (SLL) remains a major challenge.\nTraditional OPAs face inherent limitations: they exhibit grating lobes when\nemitter spacing exceeds half the operating wavelength, while at half-wavelength\nspacing, significant crosstalk issues persist. Previously, we demonstrated a\nsmall-scale OPA that harnesses near-field interference and beamforming via a\ntrapezoidal slab grating and a half-wavelength-pitch waveguide array to achieve\na 180{\\deg} FOV. However, its resolution was limited by the small channel\ncount. In this work, we present a 1000-channel OPA that scales this\narchitecture while addressing key challenges in waveguide crosstalk and control\ncomplexity. By optimizing waveguide routing, we minimize inter-channel coupling\nin the dense waveguide array. Additionally, we propose and demonstrate a\npassive matrix control scheme using 20 row and 50 column pulse-width modulation\n(PWM) signals to arbitrarily control 1000 thermo-optic phase shifters,\nsignificantly simplifying the electronic control and packaging. Our OPA\nachieves grating-lobe-free beam steering across a full 180{\\deg} FOV, with a\nhigh resolution of 0.07{\\deg} * 0.17{\\deg} and a minimum SLL of -18.7 dB at\n0{\\deg}.

Their shape introduces orientation-dependent forces, and their\nfinite size affects how they experience the flow field. While the effects of\nparticle inertia are known to cause preferential sampling, in this study we\nconsider whether preferential sampling can arise due to finite size and shape\nalone by considering inertialess rods using slender-body theory. First, we show\nanalytically that preferential sampling can only occur in this limit given the\npresence of three ingredients: finite particle size, anisotropic particle\nshape, and a nonlinear flow field. Next, to demonstrate this effect, we\nsimulate rods in a steady 2D cellular flow: the Taylor-Green vortex flow. By\nanalyzing the rod trajectories, we find that rods do indeed preferentially\nsample areas of both high and low vorticity, corresponding to the fixed points\nof the flow: the high vorticity cell centers and the low vorticity saddle\npoints in the corners of each cell. This preferential sampling increases with\nincreasing rod length. We also analyze the same data with respect to the flow's\nnonlinearity (i.e. curvature) to find that the rods preferentially sample the\nlinear regions of the flow and undersample the nonlinear regions. Finally, we\nanalyze the nonlinear dynamics of this system, showing that chaotic\ntrajectories appear as the rod length increases, and that these chaotic regions\nin the flow also tend to overlap with higher flow nonlinearity. Overall, we\nshow how finite size and anisotropic shape alone can cause particles to\npreferentially sample a flow field, and that this preferential sampling is\nhighly linked to the flow's nonlinearity.",

It has beneficial applications, such as improving disaster\nresponse, enhancing navigation, and geography education. Recently,\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly demonstrating capabilities as\naccurate image geo-locators. This brings significant privacy risks, including\nthose related to stalking and surveillance, considering the widespread uses of\nAI models and sharing of photos on social media. The precision of these models\nis likely to improve in the future. Despite these risks, there is little work\non systematically evaluating the geolocation precision of Generative VLMs,\ntheir limits and potential for unintended inferences. To bridge this gap, we\nconduct a comprehensive assessment of the geolocation capabilities of 25\nstate-of-the-art VLMs on four benchmark image datasets captured in diverse\nenvironments. Our results offer insight into the internal reasoning of VLMs and\nhighlight their strengths, limitations, and potential societal risks. Our\nfindings indicate that current VLMs perform poorly on generic street-level\nimages yet achieve notably high accuracy (61\\%) on images resembling social\nmedia content, raising significant and urgent privacy concerns.",

For very large plants, like semiconductor fabs, the problem\nbecomes unsolvable on a plant-wide scale in a reasonable amount of time using\nclassical linear optimization. An alternative approach is the use of swarm\nintelligence algorithms. These have been applied to the job-shop problem\nbefore, but often in a centrally calculated way where they are applied to the\nsolution space, but they can be implemented in a bottom-up fashion to avoid\nglobal result computation as well. One of the problems in semiconductor\nproduction is that the production process requires a lot of switching between\nmachines that process lots one after the other and machines that process\nbatches of lots at once, often with long processing times. In this paper, we\naddress this switching problem with the ``boids'' flocking algorithm that was\noriginally used in robotics and movie industry. The flocking behavior is a\nbio-inspired algorithm that uses only local information and interaction based\non simple heuristics. We show that this algorithm addresses these valid\nconsiderations in production plant optimization, as it reacts to the switching\nof machine kinds similar to how a swarm of flocking animals would react to\nobstacles in its course.",

Crucial in the connection relations is\nthe phase acquired by the Floquet solutions by going from a (ir)regular\nsingularity to another. The new 'kink method' is exploited to compute the\nquantum momentum of the Floquet solutions as convergent series, explicitly at\nall orders. Hence, upon integrating it term by term, the acquired phase can be\nderived explicitly as a similar series. Since Heun equation and its confluences\ndescribe ${\\cal N}=2$ SYM theories in the NS background as quantisation of\nSeiberg-Witten differentials and also appear in perturbations of gravity\nsolutions, tests and predictions in both domains can be made. A very\nencouraging test is the matching of the acquired phase with the dual gauge\nperiod, $A_D$, as given by the Nekrasov instanton function. Actually, the\nprocedure can be considered an alternative to instanton computations. On the\ngravity side, results for the wave functions are at leading order compatible\nwith analogous expressions found by studying the Teukolsky (or others, like\nRegge-Wheeler) equation. Besides, the whole construction can represent an\nuseful approach to these equations at all orders, shedding also light on\nnon-perturbative contributions, which should reveal very interesting for the\nconsequences in gravity perturbations.",

It assigns different skill discovery\nalgorithms to each factor based on the desired intrinsic reward function. To\nencourage structured morphology-aware skills, we introduce symmetry-based\ninductive biases tailored to individual factors. We also incorporate a style\nfactor and regularization penalties to promote safe and robust behaviors. We\nevaluate our framework in simulation using a quadrupedal robot and demonstrate\nzero-shot transfer of the learned skills to real hardware. Our results show\nthat factorization and symmetry lead to the discovery of structured\nhuman-interpretable behaviors, while the style factor and penalties enhance\nsafety and diversity. Additionally, we show that the learned skills can be used\nfor downstream tasks and perform on par with oracle policies trained with\nhand-crafted rewards.",

Their unique crystal chemistries and structural anisotropies\nmake them attractive for applications ranging from sensors and flexoelectric\ndevices to drug delivery and catalysis. To unlock their full potential, it is\ncritical to understand their thickness-dependent mechanical properties within\nthe family of 2D silicates. In this study, we investigate the nanomechanical\nand frictional behaviors of two structurally distinct natural silicates:\nlayered Biotite and chain-structured Rhodonite. Using atomic force microscopy\n(AFM), we found that Rhodonite exhibits nearly ten times higher adhesion force\nand modulus response compared to Biotite. Despite this, Biotite demonstrates\nsuperior frictional performance, with ultrathin (5 nm) flakes showing a\nremarkably low coefficient of friction ($\\sim 0.6 \\times 10^{-3}$) versus\nRhodonite ($\\sim 3.6 \\times 10^{-3}$). To further elucidate interlayer\nadhesion, density functional theory (DFT) calculations with Hubbard correction\nwere employed. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and\nselection of 2D silicates for advanced mechanical and tribological\napplications.",

    "abstract": "The design of hydrogels that combine mechanical robustness with dynamic\nreconfigurability remains a fundamental challenge, as increasing crosslink\ndissociation rates compromise network integrity. This limitation is addressed\nthrough the incorporation of an associative crosslink exchange into DNA-based\nsupramolecular hydrogels, enabling the decoupling of network relaxation\nbehavior from crosslink stability. The hydrogels are constructed from\nenzyme-synthesized single-stranded DNA that self-assembles via hybridization\nbetween complementary domains. These crosslinks can reorganize through\ndissociative melting or associative strand displacement reaction, yielding\nnetworks with tunable relaxation timescales spanning over three orders of\nmagnitude. Rheological measurements and thermodynamic modeling confirm that\nassociative exchange facilitates efficient stress dissipation without\ndiminishing rupture strength or thermal stability. In contrast, dissociative\nsystems inherently trade increased dynamics with mechanical weakening. This\ndecoupling is achieved through the implementation of a catalytic reorganization\npathway governed by the composition of the sample, independently of crosslink\nstrength. These findings establish the mechanism of reorganization as a key\ndesign parameter for engineering adaptive soft materials that combine\nresilience and responsiveness.",

This paper presents CASE (Conversational\nAgent for Scam Elucidation), a novel Agentic AI framework that addresses this\nproblem by collecting and managing user scam feedback in a safe and scalable\nmanner. A conversational agent is uniquely designed to proactively interview\npotential victims to elicit intelligence in the form of a detailed\nconversation. The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI\nsystem that extracts information and converts it into structured data for\ndownstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms. Using Google's\nGemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay)\nIndia. By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have\nobserved a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements.

Secondly, the proposed model utilizes wavelet\ntransforms to decompose images into multiple frequency subbands, allowing the\nnetwork to focus on both global and local features while preserving structural\ndetails. By progressively reconstructing high-resolution images through\nhierarchical processing, the network reduces computational complexity without\nsacrificing performance. The multi-level decomposition strategy enables the\nnetwork to capture fine-grained information in lowfrequency components while\nenhancing high-frequency textures. Through extensive experimentation, we\nconfirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our WaveHiT-SR.

The measurements were conducted using the tagged\nneutron method with four LaBr$_3$(Ce) scintillation detectors positioned at\nangles of $25^{\\circ}$, $45^{\\circ}$, $60^{\\circ}$, and $70^{\\circ}$ relative\nto the generator target -- sample center axis. A neutron generator capable of\nproducing $16$ separate beams of tagged neutrons was employed, which, combined\nwith the detector system, enabled the determination of differential\ncross-sections for $64$ distinct angle values in the range of $17^{\\circ}$ to\n$89^{\\circ}$. To simplify data visualization, the angular distributions were\ndivided into $5^{\\circ}$ intervals, with weighted mean values of the angle and\ndifferential cross-section calculated for each interval. Corrections for\nmultiple neutron scattering and attenuation, $\\gamma$-ray attenuation, and\ntotal detection efficiency, computed using GEANT4, were accounted for in the\ncross-section calculations. Additional measurements were performed to validate\nthe correction calculations. The total $\\gamma$-ray emission cross-sections\nwere obtained by approximating the angular distributions with even-order\nLegendre polynomial expansions up to the $6$th degree, followed by integration\nover the full solid angle. The total systematic error for the obtained data was\nestimated as $9$\\,\\%.",

    "abstract": "Humans naturally perform temporal screening by dragging the progress bar and\nfocusing on salient temporal segments, but current Video Large Language Models\n(Video-LLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained temporal semantics due to sparse\nframe sampling and insufficient inter-frame reasoning supervision during their\ntraining. To address this, Inspired by well-established cognitive science\nprinciples, we propose Temporal Visual Screening (TVS), a new task that\nuniversally pre-processes video question answering and instruction tuning data\nby: (1) retaining focus-critical video segments, (2) synchronously\nreconstructing queries to their most direct form while preserving answer\nconsistency, and (3) keeping the invariance and consistency for any possible\nanswer. TVS is formulated as a modular front-end adapter task that can be\nseamlessly integrated into both Video Instruction Tuning (training) and Video\nQuestion Answering (inference) pipelines. TVS optimizes distribution of\nreasoning burden and cognitive load; during training, it aligns queries with\nfocus-critical visual information; at inference, it enables query-aware segment\nfocus and streamlined query representations. In particular, we curate the first\nbenchmark for TVS and propose ReSimplifyIt, a baseline outperforming prior\napproaches on seemingly similar tasks by 0.47 in F-1 score on video trimming\nwhile achieving competitive query rewriting performance. Experiments\ndemonstrate that incorporating TVS yields relative gains of 7.33% (training)\nand 34.6% (inference), demonstrating the effectiveness of temporal information\nscreening for improving video-language understanding.",

To address this\nissue, this paper presents a \\textbf{H}ypothesis-based\nPr\\textbf{E}ference-aware \\textbf{A}na\\textbf{L}ysis Framework (HEAL), a novel\nevaluation paradigm that formulates preference alignment as a re-ranking\nprocess within hypothesis spaces. The framework incorporates two complementary\nmetrics: ranking accuracy for evaluating ordinal consistency and preference\nstrength correlation for assessing continuous alignment. To facilitate this\nframework, we develop UniHypoBench, a unified hypothesis benchmark constructed\nfrom diverse instruction-response pairs. Through extensive experiments based on\nHEAL, with a particular focus on the intrinsic mechanisms of preference\nlearning, we demonstrate that current preference learning methods can\neffectively capture preferences provided by proxy models while simultaneously\nsuppressing negative samples. These findings contribute to preference learning\nresearch through two significant avenues. Theoretically, we introduce\nhypothesis space analysis as an innovative paradigm for understanding\npreference alignment.

Our findings reveal\nthat (1) LLM-Based AI agents develop stereotype-driven biases in their\ninteractions despite beginning without predefined biases; (2) stereotype\neffects intensify with increased interaction rounds and decision-making power,\nparticularly after introducing hierarchical structures; (3) these systems\nexhibit group effects analogous to human social behavior, including halo\neffects, confirmation bias, and role congruity; and (4) these stereotype\npatterns manifest consistently across different LLM architectures.

    "abstract": "The fractal dimension curves of urban form and growth fall into two\ncategories: One can be described by common logistic function, and the other can\nbe described with quadratic logistic function. The approach to estimating the\nparameter of the ordinary logistic model has been developed. However, how to\nestimate the parameter of quadratic logistic model is still a problem. This\npaper is devoted to finding a nonlinear regressive approach for estimating\nparameter values of quadratic logistic model of fractal dimension curves. The\nprocess can be summarized as below. First, differentiating quadratic logistic\nfunction in theory with respect to time yields a growth rate equation of\nfractal dimension. Second, discretizing the growth rate equation yields a\nnonlinear regressive model of fractal dimension curve. Third, applying the\nleast squares method to the nonlinear regressive equation yields the capacity\nparameter value of the quadratic logistic model. Fourth, substituting the\ncapacity parameter value into the quadratic logistic model and changing it into\na quasilinear form, we can estimate the other parameter values by ordinary\nlinear regression analysis. In this way, a practical quadratic logistic model\nof fractal dimension curves can be gained. The approach is applied to\nmultifractal dimension curves of Beijing city to show its effectiveness. The\nmethod can be extended to estimate the parameter values of quadratic logistic\nmodels in many fields besides urban science.",

Our method extracts standardised medical entities from free-text\nreports using an enhanced pipeline built on RadGraph-XL and SapBERT. These\nentities are linked to UMLS concepts (CUIs), enabling a transparent,\ninterpretable set-based representation of each report. We then define a\ntask-adaptive similarity measure based on a modified and weighted version of\nthe Tversky Index that accounts for synonymy, negation, and hierarchical\nrelationships between medical entities.

    "abstract": "The trade-off among accuracy, robustness, and computational cost remains a\nkey challenge in simulating complex flows. Second-order schemes are\ncomputationally efficient but lack the accuracy required for resolving\nintricate flow structures, particularly in turbulence. High-order schemes,\nespecially compact high-order schemes, offer superior accuracy and resolution\nat a relatively modest computational cost. To clarify the practical performance\nof high-order schemes in scale-resolving simulations, this study evaluates two\nrepresentative gas-kinetic schemes: the newly developed fifth-order compact\ngas-kinetic scheme (CGKS-5th) and the conventional second-order gas-kinetic\nscheme (GKS-2nd). Test cases ranging from subsonic to supersonic flows are used\nto quantitatively assess their accuracy and efficiency. The results demonstrate\nthat CGKS-5th achieves comparable resolution to GKS-2nd at roughly an order of\nmagnitude lower computational cost. Under equivalent computational resources,\nCGKS-5th delivers significantly higher accuracy and resolution, particularly in\nturbulent flows involving shocks and small-scale vortices. This study provides\nthe first clear verification of the advantages of high-order compact\ngas-kinetic schemes in simulating viscous flows with discontinuities.\nAdditionally, multi-GPU parallelization using CUDA and MPI is implemented to\nenable large-scale applications.",

However, the association of Moran index with Getis-Ord index is\nnot clear. This paper is devoted to deriving and verify the relationships\nbetween Moran's index and Getis-Ord's indices using mathematical reasoning and\nempirical analysis. Getis-Ord's indices are employed to decompose Moran's\nindex. The results show that there is a strict nonlinear relationship between\nMoran's index and Getis-Ord's indices. Moran's index consists of four\ncomponents: global Getis-Ord's index, sum of local Getis-Ord's indices, number\nof elements, and size correlation function. Thus the mathematical structure of\nMoran's index is revealed. A theoretical discovery is that the characteristics\nof spatial autocorrelation depends on the relationship between the global\nGetis-Ord's index and the sum of local Getis-Ord's indices, as well as the\nnumber of spatial elements. Local Getis-Ord's indices proved to be equivalent\nto the potential indices based on gravity model. A conclusion can be drawn that\nMoran's index is related to gravity model, and thus spatial autocorrelation is\nassociated with spatial interaction. This indicates that weak spatial\ninteraction leads to not significant spatial autocorrelation. The conclusion is\nsupported by observational data. This study not only helps to better understand\nthe basic statistics of spatial analysis, but also contributes to the further\ndevelopment of spatial autocorrelation theory.",

The\nmajority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on\nunipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node\nheterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent\nstudies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing\nschemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node\npairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were\noriginally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not\noptimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in\nSBGs.\n  Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective\nspectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs.\nIn particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive\naccuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically\ngrounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization;\n(ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and\n(iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating\nGegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive\nempirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior\nperformance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign\nprediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets.",

    "abstract": "Generative diffusion models have emerged as a powerful class of models in\nmachine learning, yet a unified theoretical understanding of their operation is\nstill developing. This paper provides an integrated perspective on generative\ndiffusion by connecting their dynamic, information-theoretic, and thermodynamic\nproperties under a unified mathematical framework. We demonstrate that the rate\nof conditional entropy production during generation (i.e. the generative\nbandwidth) is directly governed by the expected divergence of the score\nfunction's vector field. This divergence, in turn, is linked to the branching\nof trajectories and generative bifurcations, which we characterize as\nsymmetry-breaking phase transitions in the energy landscape. This synthesis\noffers a powerful insight: the process of generation is fundamentally driven by\nthe controlled, noise-induced breaking of (approximate) symmetries, where peaks\nin information transfer correspond to critical transitions between possible\noutcomes. The score function acts as a dynamic non-linear filter that regulates\nthe bandwidth of the noise by suppressing fluctuations that are incompatible\nwith the data.",

    "abstract": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy but often\nrely on purely global, gradient-based optimisation, which can lead to\noverfitting, redundant filters, and reduced interpretability. To address these\nlimitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates\nneuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1\nextends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy\nobjective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser\nthat aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding\nconvolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and\n(ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style\nconsolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the\nnetwork. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss,\nexplicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins\nin the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet\nacross five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2,\nDenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other\nmethods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp\n(CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual\nInformation (NMI) increased by up to +0.15. Qualitative visualisations and\nfilter-level analyses further confirm that NM-Hebb produces more structured and\nselective features, yielding tighter and more interpretable class clusters.\nOverall, coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields\nCNNs that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, offering\npractical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments.",

In this study, we construct a mathematical model of\ninformation replication using a discrete Markov model and Gaussian convolution,\nand quantify changes in information at each replication step: Shannon entropy,\ncross-entropy, and the Kullback--Leibler divergence (KLD). The monotonic\ndecrease of KLD exhibits a Lyapunov-like property, which can be interpreted as\na potential analogous to the free energy in the process by which a\nnonequilibrium system converges to a particular steady state. Furthermore, we\nextend this framework to the potential applicability to biological information\nprocesses such as DNA replication, showing that the free energy required for\ndegradation and repair can be expressed in terms of KLD.

A\n(rectangular) reporting data structure stores a point set $P$ of $n$ points,\nsuch that, given a (rectangular) query region $\\Delta$, it returns all points\nin $P \\cap \\Delta$. A variety of data structures support such queries with\ndiffering asymptotic guarantees such as $k$-d trees, range trees, $R$-trees,\nand quadtrees. A common variant of range queries are distance reporting\nqueries, where the input is a query point $q$ and a radius $\\delta$, and the\ngoal is to report all points in $P$ within distance $\\delta$ of $q$. Such\nqueries frequently arise as subroutines in geometric data structure\nconstruction and in Fr\\'echet distance computations. Modern implementations\ntypically reduce distance queries to rectangular range queries using the data\nstructures listed above.\n  We revisit a simple and practical heuristic for distance reporting. The\napproach is straightforward: sort the input point set $P$ along a space-filling\ncurve. Queries then reduce to scanning at most four contiguous ranges along the\nsorted curve. We show extensive experimental evaluation of modern distance and\nrange reporting data structures. In a static scenario, we show that this simple\ntechnique is competitive with all but the most highly optimised range reporting\ndata structures. Notably, these involved structures use space-filling curves\nthemselves to speed up computation. In a dynamic setting, our simpler method\neven becomes the preferred technique.\n  This leads to a perhaps unexpected insight: while modern data structures\ninvest heavily in leveraging space-filling curves for optimising their layout\nand traversal, it is the curve itself, rather than the surrounding machinery,\nthat delivers much of the performance.",

However, mainstream approaches\ngenerally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation\nrules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural\nheterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to\nover-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address\nthese issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network\nframework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity\nGraph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory\nand designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that\nsimultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the\nstability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable\nparameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on\ncomplex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both\nstructure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving\nadaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on\neight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation\nnetwork, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging\nconditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer.\nThis work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the\ndesign of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the\nimportance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation\nlearning.

To address this challenge, we conduct a first-in-class\nevaluation of small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned on labeled data and\npre-trained LLMs with in-context learning on a dataset containing approximately\n500 documents and over 12,000 pages. For SLMs, we consider: (1) a general IUL\nclassifier, (2) subcategory-specific binary classifiers, (3) a multilabel\nclassifier, and (4) a two-stage hierarchical pipeline for general IUL detection\nfollowed by multilabel classification. For LLMs, we consider variations of\nprompts that include subcategory definitions and/or shots. We found that both\nLLama-3 8B and 70B, even with carefully curated shots, are largely outperformed\nby SLMs. While the multilabel classifier performs best on annotated data,\nsupplementing training with unflagged excerpts as negative examples boosts the\nspecific classifiers' AUC by up to 25%, making them most effective models for\nmitigating harmful language in medical curricula.",

To gain a deeper\nunderstanding of its role in ADS testing, we systematically analyzed 91\nrelevant studies and synthesized their findings into six major application\ncategories, primarily centered on scenario-based testing of ADS. We also\nreviewed their effectiveness and compiled a wide range of datasets, simulators,\nADS, metrics, and benchmarks used for evaluation, while identifying 27\nlimitations.

    "abstract": "Lattice Hamiltonians, which can be tuned between different topological\nphases, are known as important tools for understanding physical mechanism\nbehind topological phase transitions. In this paper, we introduce a perturbed\nColor Code Hamiltonian with a rich phase structure which can be well matched to\nthe mechanism of anyon condensation in the Color Code. We consider Color Code\nmodel defined on a three-colorable hexagonal lattice and add Ising interactions\nbetween spins corresponding to edges of the lattice. We show that Ising\ninteractions play the role of physical factor for condensing anyons in the\nColor Code. In particular, corresponding to three different colors of edges in\nthe hexagonal lattice, we consider three different coupling parameters. Then,\nwe are able to condense anyons with different colors by tuning power of Ising\ninteractions in the corresponding edges. In particular, we explicitly show that\ncondensation of one type of anyons in the Color Code leads to a phase\ntransition to the Toric Code state. On the other hand, by condensing two types\nof anyons, we observe a phase transition to a modified version of the Toric\nCode where partial set of anyons in the Toric Code are condensed and we call it\na partially topological phase. Our main method for derivation of the above\nresults is based on a suitable basis transformation on the main Hamiltonian in\nthe sense that our model is mapped onto three decoupled transverse-field Ising\nmodels, corresponding to the three colors. We use the above mapping to analyze\nbehavior of string order parameters as non-local indicators of topological\norder. We introduce three string order parameters that can well characterize\ndifferent phases of the model.

The findings\nreveal that data from the nearest downstream detectors to the crash locations\nprovided a superior fit for pre-crash data compared to the upstream detectors.\nNotably, a noticeable decrease in goodness-of-fit was observed when compared to\nnormal traffic conditions. In pre-crash scenarios, wide-moving jams exhibited a\nfaster propagation from downstream to upstream, distinct from the patterns\nobserved in normal traffic conditions.

    "abstract": "Our goal in this dissertation is to provide tools, programming models, and\nsystem support for PIM architectures (with a focus on DRAM-based solutions), to\nease the adoption of PIM in current and future systems. To this end, we make at\nleast four new major contributions.\n  First, we introduce DAMOV, the first rigorous methodology to characterize\nmemory-related data movement bottlenecks in modern workloads, and the first\ndata movement benchmark suite. Second, we introduce MIMDRAM, a new\nhardware/software co-designed substrate that addresses the major current\nprogrammability and flexibility limitations of the bulk bitwise execution model\nof processing-using-DRAM (PUD) architectures. MIMDRAM enables the allocation\nand control of only the needed computing resources inside DRAM for PUD\ncomputing. Third, we introduce Proteus, the first hardware framework that\naddresses the high execution latency of bulk bitwise PUD operations in\nstate-of-the-art PUD architectures by implementing a data-aware runtime engine\nfor PUD. Proteus reduces the latency of PUD operations in three different ways:\n(i) Proteus concurrently executes independent in-DRAM primitives belong to a\nsingle PUD operation across DRAM arrays. (ii) Proteus dynamically reduces the\nbit-precision (and consequentially the latency and energy consumption) of PUD\noperations by exploiting narrow values (i.e., values with many leading zeros or\nones). (iii) Proteus chooses and uses the most appropriate data representation\nand arithmetic algorithm implementation for a given PUD instruction\ntransparently to the programmer. Fourth, we introduce DaPPA (data-parallel\nprocessing-in-memory architecture), a new programming framework that eases\nprogrammability for general-purpose PNM architectures by allowing the\nprogrammer to write efficient PIM-friendly code without the need to manage\nhardware resources explicitly.",

TrajFusionNet comprises two branches:\na Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM\nbranch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted\npedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch\nenables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian\ntrajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images.\nBy utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves\nthe lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data\npreprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches.

We find\ntentative evidence ($\\sim 3 \\sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the\nrelationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the\nintergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic\nfilaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the\nfilamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\\beta$-model gas profile with\n$\\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity\nof $\\delta = 20.78$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and\nobservational results.

This is the case of space\nTeleCommands (TCs), where coded data are usually preceded by a start sequence,\nand optionally followed by a tail sequence, forming the Communication Link\nTransmission Unit (CLTU). Regarding the choice of schemes for error correction,\nthe Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems recommendations for TC\nsynchronization and coding suggests to use, among others, two Low-Density\nParity-Check (LDPC) codes: one (relatively) long and one short. Adopting the\nlong LDPC code eliminates the need for a tail sequence, as the LDPC decoder\nalways fails when overrunning the end of the CLTU, thus causing the decoding\nand detection process to stop. This, however, is not true when the short LDPC\ncode is adopted, since its decoding might converge on a codeword even when the\ndecoder input is not a noisy codeword. This makes it necessary to use a tail\nsequence that causes the decoder to fail regardless of its input. In this\npaper, we study the features required for such a sequence and propose some\nmethods for its design. Our numerical results, obtained considering various\ndetection approaches for the tail sequence, show that the overall TC rejection\nprobability improves significantly when the proposed tail sequence is employed.\nOur simulations also show that, for moderate values of the Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR), with a properly designed tail sequence it is possible to obtain\nthe same performance in terms of TC rejection probability using decoder-based\ndetection and likelihood ratio test-based detection, with the former approach\nbeing less complex than the latter.",

However, when latent space distributions produced by quantum\nprocessors can be expected to improve performance, and whether these\nimprovements are reproducible, are open questions that we investigate in this\nwork. We prove that, under certain conditions, these \"quantum latent\ndistributions\" enable generative models to produce data distributions that\nclassical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We also provide\nactionable intuitions to identify when such quantum advantages may arise in\nreal-world settings. We perform benchmarking experiments on both a synthetic\nquantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real\nphotonic quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that quantum latent\ndistributions can lead to improved generative performance in GANs compared to a\nrange of classical baselines.

    "abstract": "Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) has effectively enhanced\nlarge language models in complex reasoning by organizing fragmented knowledge\ninto explicitly structured graphs. Prior efforts have been made to improve\neither graph construction or graph retrieval in isolation, yielding suboptimal\nperformance, especially when domain shifts occur. In this paper, we propose a\nvertically unified agentic paradigm, Youtu-GraphRAG, to jointly connect the\nentire framework as an intricate integration. Specifically, (i) a seed graph\nschema is introduced to bound the automatic extraction agent with targeted\nentity types, relations and attribute types, also continuously expanded for\nscalability over unseen domains; (ii) To obtain higher-level knowledge upon the\nschema, we develop novel dually-perceived community detection, fusing\nstructural topology with subgraph semantics for comprehensive knowledge\norganization. This naturally yields a hierarchical knowledge tree that supports\nboth top-down filtering and bottom-up reasoning with community summaries; (iii)\nAn agentic retriever is designed to interpret the same graph schema to\ntransform complex queries into tractable and parallel sub-queries. It\niteratively performs reflection for more advanced reasoning; (iv) To alleviate\nthe knowledge leaking problem in pre-trained LLM, we propose a tailored\nanonymous dataset and a novel 'Anonymity Reversion' task that deeply measures\nthe real performance of the GraphRAG frameworks. Extensive experiments across\nsix challenging benchmarks demonstrate the robustness of Youtu-GraphRAG,\nremarkably moving the Pareto frontier with up to 90.71% saving of token costs\nand 16.62% higher accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines.

To address this, we propose a\nmachine-centric image quality assessment (MIQA) framework that quantifies the\nimpact of image degradations on MVS performance.

Although rankings\nare perhaps the most concise and most straightforward representation of the\nrelative strength among the competitors, beyond this one-dimensional\ncharacterization, it is also possible to capture the relationships between\nathletes in greater detail. Following this approach, our study examines the\nnetworks between athletes in individual sports such as tennis and fencing,\nwhere the nodes are associated with the contestants and the edges are directed\nfrom the winner to the loser. We demonstrate that the connections formed\nthrough matches arrange themselves into a time-evolving hierarchy, with the top\nplayers positioned at its apex. The structure of the resulting networks\nexhibits detectable differences depending on whether they are constructed\npurely from round-robin data or from purely elimination-style tournaments. We\nfind that elimination tournaments lead to networks with a smaller level of\nhierarchy and thus, importantly, to an increased probability of circular\nwin-loss situations (cycles). The position within the hierarchy, along with\nother network metrics, can be used to predict match outcomes.

    "abstract": "Model merging has emerged as an efficient strategy for constructing multitask\nmodels by integrating the strengths of multiple available expert models,\nthereby reducing the need to fine-tune a pre-trained model for all the tasks\nfrom scratch. Existing data-independent methods struggle with performance\nlimitations due to the lack of data-driven guidance. Data-driven approaches\nalso face key challenges: gradient-based methods are computationally expensive,\nlimiting their practicality for merging large expert models, whereas existing\ngradient-free methods often fail to achieve satisfactory results within a\nlimited number of optimization steps. To address these limitations, this paper\nintroduces PSO-Merging, a novel data-driven merging method based on the\nParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this approach, we initialize the particle\nswarm with a pre-trained model, expert models, and sparsified expert models.

The tetraquark states are treated as compact\ndiquark-antidiquark configurations, denoted as $[QQ][\\bar{Q}\\bar{Q}]$, where $Q\n= c$ or $b$. By properly accounting for the Pauli principle, basis wave\nfunctions incorporating flavor, color, and spin are constructed.

Both attack and defense prompts are\niteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language\nprompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and\ndefenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO)\nmodule, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our\nsystem on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks\nand demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines,\nachieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection.\nSpecifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an\nimprovement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate\n(TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and\nthe true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies\nconfirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective\noptimization. We also confirm that this framework is effective in different\nLLMs. Our results highlight the promise of adversarial training as a scalable\nand effective approach for guarding prompt injections.",

While the effect of the Bering Strait on\nAMOC stability has been well studied, it is unknown whether a constructed\nclosure of this Strait can prevent an AMOC collapse under climate change. Here,\nwe show in an Earth system Model of Intermediate Complexity that an artificial\nclosure of the Strait can extend the safe carbon budget of the AMOC, provided\nthat the AMOC is strong enough at the closure time. Specifically, for this\nmodel, an equilibrium AMOC with a reduction below (6.1+/-0.5)% from\npre-industrial has an additional budget up to 500PgC given a sufficiently early\nclosure, while for a weaker AMOC a closure reduces this budget. This indicates\nthat constructing this closure can be a feasible climate intervention strategy\nto prevent an AMOC collapse.",

Recent work has focused on compliance of web\ntrackers with new privacy laws such as Europe's GDPR and California's CCPA.\nDespite the growing body of research documenting widespread lack of compliance\nwith new privacy laws, there is a lack of robust enforcement. Different from\nprior work, we conduct a tech-law analysis to map decades-old U.S. laws about\ninterception of electronic communications--so-called wiretapping--to web\ntracking. Bridging the tech-law gap for older wiretapping laws is important and\ntimely because, in cases where legal harm to privacy is proven, they can\nprovide statutory private right of action, are at the forefront of recent\nprivacy enforcement, and could ultimately lead to a meaningful change in the\nweb tracking landscape.\n  In this paper, we focus on a particularly invasive tracking technique: the\nuse of JavaScript event listeners by third-party trackers for real-time\nkeystroke interception on websites. We use an instrumented web browser to crawl\na sample of the top-million websites to investigate the use of event listeners\nthat aligns with the criteria for wiretapping, according to U.S. wiretapping\nlaw at the federal level and in California. We find evidence that 38.52%\nwebsites installed third-party event listeners to intercept keystrokes, and\nthat at least 3.18% websites transmitted intercepted information to a\nthird-party server, which aligns with the criteria for wiretapping.

In this\nprediction the velocity field is decomposed into a nonvortical (potential) and\nvortical contribution, and so is the associated drag force. In the\nJosephson-Anderson relation the vortical contribution of the drag force follows\nfrom the flux of vorticity traversing the streamlines of the corresponding\npotential flow. The potential component is directly determined by the plate\nacceleration and its added mass. The Josephson-Anderson relation is derived\nfrom the quantum description of superfluids, but remarkably applies to the\nclassical fluid in our experiment. In our experiment a flat plate is\naccelerated through water using a robotic arm. This geometry is simple enough\nto allow analytic potential flow streamlines. The monitored plate position\nshows an oscillatory component of the acceleration, which adds an additional\ntest of the Josephson-Anderson relation. The instantaneous velocity field is\nmeasured using particle image velocimetry. It enables us to evaluate Eq. 3.50\nfrom [1] and compare its prediction to the measured drag force. We find\nexcellent agreement, and, most remarkably find that the added mass contribution\nto the drag force still stands out after the flow has turned vortical.

Such a mathematical problem is commonly\nencountered in various applications of signal processing. We term it as the\nconstant-modulus multi-order complex quadratic programming (CMCQP) in this\npaper. In general, the CMCQP is non-convex and difficult to solve. Its\nobjective function typically relates to metrics such as signal-to-noise ratio,\nCram\\'er-Rao bound, integrated sidelobe level, etc., and constraints normally\ncorrespond to requirements on similarity to desired aspects,\npeak-to-average-power ratio, or constant-modulus property in practical\nscenarios. In order to find efficient solutions to the CMCQP, we first\nreformulate it into an unconstrained optimization problem with respect to phase\nvalues of the studied variable only. Then, we devise a steepest descent/ascent\nmethod with fast determinations on its optimal step sizes. Specifically, we\nconvert the step-size searching problem into a polynomial form that leads to\nclosed-form solutions of high accuracy, wherein the third-order Taylor\nexpansion of the search function is conducted. Our major contributions also lie\nin investigating the effect of the order and specific form of matrices embedded\nin the CMCQP, for which two representative cases are identified. Examples of\nrelated applications associated with the two cases are also provided for\ncompleteness. The proposed methods are summarized into algorithms, whose\nconvergence speeds are verified to be fast by comprehensive simulations and\ncomparisons to existing methods.

However, many studies consider\nattacks with the model in inference mode, where training-time behaviors like\ndropout are disabled and batch normalization relies on fixed statistics. In\nthis work, we systematically analyze how architecture and training behavior\naffect vulnerability, including the first in-depth study of inference-mode\nclients, which we show dramatically simplifies inversion. To assess attack\nfeasibility under more realistic conditions, we turn to clients operating in\nstandard training mode. In this setting, we find that successful attacks are\nonly possible when several architectural conditions are met simultaneously:\nmodels must be shallow and wide, use skip connections, and, critically, employ\npre-activation normalization. We introduce two novel attacks against models in\ntraining-mode with varying attacker knowledge, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance under realistic training conditions. We extend these efforts by\npresenting the first attack on a production-grade object-detection model. Here,\nto enable any visibly identifiable leakage, we revert to the lenient inference\nmode setting and make multiple architectural modifications to increase model\nvulnerability, with the extent of required changes highlighting the strong\ninherent robustness of such architectures. We conclude this work by offering\nthe first comprehensive mapping of settings, clarifying which combinations of\narchitectural choices and operational modes meaningfully impact privacy. Our\nanalysis provides actionable insight into when models are likely vulnerable,\nwhen they appear robust, and where subtle leakage may persist.

However, achieving robust segmentation remains challenging\ndue to the poor quality of ultrasound images and the lack of annotated data.\nSemi-supervised methods alleviate the lack of annotated data but struggle with\nthe unique characteristics of fetal head ultrasound images, making it\nchallenging to generate reliable pseudo-labels and enforce effective\nconsistency regularization constraints. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel semi-supervised framework, ERSR, for fetal head ultrasound segmentation.\nOur framework consists of the dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy, the\nellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement, and the symmetry-based multiple\nconsistency regularization. The dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy uses\nboundary consistency and contour regularity criteria to evaluate and filter\nteacher outputs. The ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement refines these\nfiltered outputs by fitting least-squares ellipses, which strengthens pixels\nnear the center of the fitted ellipse and suppresses noise simultaneously. The\nsymmetry-based multiple consistency regularization enforces multi-level\nconsistency across perturbed images, symmetric regions, and between original\npredictions and pseudo-labels, enabling the model to capture robust and stable\nshape representations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two\nbenchmarks. On the HC18 dataset, it reaches Dice scores of 92.05% and 95.36%\nwith 10% and 20% labeled data, respectively.

    "abstract": "Extensive research has been conducted to explore the capabilities of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in table reasoning. However, the essential task of\ntransforming tables information into reports remains a significant challenge\nfor industrial applications. This task is plagued by two critical issues: 1)\nthe complexity and diversity of tables lead to suboptimal reasoning outcomes;\nand 2) existing table benchmarks lack the capacity to adequately assess the\npractical application of this task. To fill this gap, we propose the\ntable-to-report task and construct a bilingual benchmark named T2R-bench, where\nthe key information flow from the tables to the reports for this task. The\nbenchmark comprises 457 industrial tables, all derived from real-world\nscenarios and encompassing 19 industry domains as well as 4 types of industrial\ntables. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation criteria to fairly measure the\nquality of report generation. The experiments on 25 widely-used LLMs reveal\nthat even state-of-the-art models like Deepseek-R1 only achieves performance\nwith 62.71 overall score, indicating that LLMs still have room for improvement\non T2R-bench.",

    "abstract": "Context. Interplanetary (IP) shock waves offer an unparalleled opportunity to\ndirectly study the elusive mechanisms of particle acceleration that are\npervasive in our Universe. Novel spacecraft missions, orbiting poorly-explored\nregions of the heliosphere, opened a new observational window on particle\nacceleration at IP shocks that is relevant to space and astrophysical plasmas.\nAims. We address shock variability and its effects on the production of\naccelerated particles at different energies. We leveraged three different\nmissions that directly observed a strong IP shock in a range of separations\nthat cannot be achieved with a single mission. We linked spatial shock\nirregularities and evolutionary effects to the observed energetic particle\nresponses in the shock passage at the three different heliospheric vantage\npoints. Methods. We exploited direct observations of magnetic field, plasma,\nand energetic particle fluxes from the Wind and ACE missions at 1 AU and from\nthe Solar Orbiter spacecraft. They are well-aligned radially at 0.8 AU. We\ndevised a new technique based on the cross-correlation of energetic particle\nprofiles to quantitatively address the variability in the characteristics of\nenergetic particles at different points in space and time. Results. We show\nthat ions with different energies respond differently to the shock passage in\nthe range of observer separations 0.02 - 0.2 AU we explored. The shape and\nbehavior of high-energy (> 0.5 MeV) particle profiles vary between the 0.8 and\n1 AU observations, and we suggest that this is caused by shock-evolution, in\nwhich high-energy particles are produced less efficiently at 1 AU than at 0.8.\nFinally, we show that shock and ambient spatial irregularities that are\nobserved throughout the event modulate the energetic particle responses at\ndifferent energies.",

The lowest magnetic flux of the solar\natmosphere is found in the quiet Sun internetwork and is thought to be provided\nby the small-scale dynamo (SSD) process. We aim to understand the chromospheric\nstructure and dynamics in a simulation with purely SSD generated magnetic\nfields. We perform a 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (rMHD) simulation of the\nsolar atmosphere, including the necessary physics to simulate the solar\nchromosphere. No magnetic field is imposed beyond that generated by an SSD\nprocess. We analyse the magnetic field in the chromosphere, and the resulting\nenergy balance. Plasma at chromospheric temperatures reaches high into the\natmosphere, with small, transient regions reaching coronal temperatures. An\naverage Poynting flux of $5\\times10^6~\\mathrm{erg\\;cm}^{-3}$\\;s$^{-1}$ is found\nat the base of the chromosphere. The magnetic field in the chromosphere falls\noff more slowly with height than predicted by a potential field extrapolation\nfrom the radial component of the photospheric field. Starting in the middle\nchromosphere, the magnetic energy density is an order of magnitude larger than\nthe kinetic energy density and, in the upper chromosphere, also larger than the\nthermal energy density. Nonetheless, even in the high chromosphere, the plasma\nbeta in shock fronts and low-field regions can locally reach values above\nunity. The interactions between shocks and the magnetic field are essential to\nunderstanding the dynamics of the internetwork chromosphere.

In addition, it is noticed that the ULPPs in the period versus\nperiod derivative diagram are much below the ``death line\", implying their\ndifferent characteristics from the normal pulsars. Five sources (including\nASKAP J1935+2148) in total eight ULPPs share the rotational energy loss rates\nto be lower than their respective radio emission luminosities, a phenomenon\nthat can be accounted for by the sustainable radio bursts induced through the\nreconnection of locally concentrated magnetic field lines.The diversity and\ncomplexity of ULPP radio emissions should be closely related to the presence of\nmagnetic reconnection rather than rotational powered discharges in the gaps.\nFurthermore, it is suggested that the coherent radio emissions of pulsars may\nhave two origins, one from the rotation-powered electric voltage that accounts\nfor the normal pulsar phenomena and the other from the magnetic\nreconnection-induced continual radio bursts that account for the ULPP\nobservations.",

    "abstract": "In this work we describe the rank-reduced variant of the equation-of-motion\ncoupled cluster theory with complete inclusion of single, double, and triple\nexcitations. The advantage of the proposed formalism in comparison with the\ncanonical theory stems from the application of Tucker decomposition format to\nthe ground- and excited-states triply-excited amplitudes tensors. By exploiting\nthe linear scaling of the dimension of the decomposed amplitudes with respect\nto the system size $N$, one can reduce the computational cost of the method to\nthe level of $N^6$ and storage requirements to $N^4$. While in practice the\nproposed rank-reduced formalism introduces an error, we show that it is several\ntimes smaller than the inherent error of the parent theory with the proposed\ndefault settings for a wide range of problems. Higher level of accuracy can be\nachieved by increasing the value of a single parameter present in this\nformulation, recovering the canonical method in an appropriate limit. We\nillustrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed method by calculations\nfor a group of molecules with excited states of different character -- from\ndominated by single excitations with respect to the reference determinant to\nstates with moderate and large contribution of double and higher excitations.\nWe report calculations of potential energy curves and related spectroscopic\nparameters for the first four singlet excited states of magnesium dimer, as\nwell as the potential energy curve for the excited state of charge-transfer\ncharacter in the NH$_3$-F$_2$ complex as a function of intermolecular\nseparation.",

However,\nthese deformation-based methods often produce blurred renderings and lose fine\nmotion details in highly dynamic regions due to the inherent limitations of a\nsingle, unified model in representing diverse motion patterns. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (MAPo), a novel framework for high-fidelity dynamic scene\nreconstruction. Its core is a dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that\ndistinguishes between high- and low-dynamic 3D Gaussians.

Concurrently, low-dynamic 3DGs\nare treated as static to reduce computational costs. However, this temporal\npartitioning strategy for high-dynamic 3DGs can introduce visual\ndiscontinuities across frames at the partition boundaries. To address this, we\nintroduce a cross-frame consistency loss, which not only ensures visual\ncontinuity but also further enhances rendering quality.

Indeed,\n$\\Omega(n\\log n)$ time is necessary to archive a maximum dislocation of $O(\\log\nn)$ even without comparison errors. Moreover, we prove that no algorithm can\nguarantee a maximum dislocation of $o(\\log n)$ with high probability, nor a\ntotal dislocation of $o(n)$ in expectation.\n  To develop our sorting algorithm, we solve two related sub-problems, which\nmight be of independent interest. More precisely, we show that $O(\\log n)$ time\nsuffices to find a position in which to insert a new element $x$ in an\nalmost-sorted sequence $S$ of $n$ elements having dislocation at most\n$d=\\Omega(\\log n)$, so that the dislocation of $x$ in the resulting sequence is\n$O(d)$ with high probability (which can be equivalently thought as the problem\nof estimating the rank of $x$ in $S$). We also show that the maximum (resp.\ntotal) dislocation of an approximately sorted sequence $S$ of $n$ elements can\nbe lowered to $O(\\log n)$ (resp. $O(n)$) in $O(nd)$ time, w.h.p., where $d$ is\nan upper bound on the maximum dislocation of $S$.",

At the same time several hydrides have been predicted to exhibit\nsuperconductivity around 100 K at ambient pressure but in thermodynamically\nunfavorable phases. In this work we aim at assessing the superconducting\nproperties of thermodynamically stable hydride superconductors at room pressure\nby investigating the GNoME material database, which has been recently released\nand includes thousands of hydrides thermodynamically stable at 0K. To scan this\nlarge material space we have adopted a multi stage approach which combines\nmachine learning for a fast initial evaluation and cutting edge ab initio\nmethods to obtain a reliable estimation of ($T_{\\rm c}$). Ultimately we have\nidentified 22 cubic hydrides with ($T_{\\rm c}$) above 4.2~K and reach a maximum\n($T_{\\rm c}$) of 17 K.

    "abstract": "Most machine learning models are designed to maximize predictive accuracy. In\nthis work, we explore a different goal: building classifiers that are\ninteresting. An ``interesting classifier'' is one that uses unusual or\nunexpected features, even if its accuracy is lower than the best possible\nmodel. For example, predicting room congestion from CO2 levels achieves\nnear-perfect accuracy but is unsurprising. In contrast, predicting room\ncongestion from humidity is less accurate yet more nuanced and intriguing. We\nintroduce EUREKA, a simple framework that selects features according to their\nperceived interestingness. Our method leverages large language models to rank\nfeatures by their interestingness and then builds interpretable classifiers\nusing only the selected interesting features. Across several benchmark\ndatasets, EUREKA consistently identifies features that are non-obvious yet\nstill predictive. For example, in the Occupancy Detection dataset, our method\nfavors humidity over CO2 levels and light intensity, producing classifiers that\nachieve meaningful accuracy while offering insights. In the Twin Papers\ndataset, our method discovers the rule that papers with a colon in the title\nare more likely to be cited in the future.

To address this challenge, we propose Greedy GuILD\nGrafting Trees (G3T*), a novel path planner that grafts invalid edge\nconnections at both ends to re-establish tree-based connectivity, enabling\nrapid path convergence.

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance\nbut still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal\nlearning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is\ntypically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we\nfind that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to\npromote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We\nanalyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem:\noptimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive\nIntra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM\naccounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths\nwithin the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning\nwithout hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time.\nSpecifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters\ninto Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded\nblocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively\nprevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization\nof under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally,\nAIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively\nadjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods\nacross multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across\ndifferent backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.",

We aim to identify and measure the\nproperties of giant members of the open cluster NGC6633, and combine these with\nasteroseismic measurements to derive a precise and self-consistent cluster age.\nImportantly, we wish to constrain the effects of rotational mixing on stellar\nevolution, since assumptions about internal mixing can have a significant\nimpact on stellar age estimates. We identify five giant members of NGC6633\nusing photometry and Gaia data, supplemented by spectroscopic literature\nmeasurements. These are combined with asteroseismic measurements from CoRoT\ndata and compared to stellar-model isochrones. This constrains the interior\nmixing to a low level and enables the most precise, accurate and\nself-consistent age estimate so far for this cluster. Asteroseismology of the\ngiants and the cluster colour-magnitude diagram provide self-consistent masses\nof the giant members and their radii constrain the stellar interior mixing to a\nlow level. The [C/N] ratios and Li abundances also suggest that rotation has\nhad very little influence on the evolution of the stars in NGC 6633. This\nresults in an age estimate of 0.55+0.05-0.10 Gyr for NGC6633. Four giant\nmembers appear to be in the helium-core burning evolutionary phase as also\nexpected from evolutionary timescales.

H4C benefit from the geographical proximity of\ndifferent industries within industrial zones and the surrounding urban and\nrural areas, allowing them to share resources, technology, and infrastructure.\nThey reduce the use of virgin resources through Industrial Symbiosis (IS),\nwhere one company uses waste of another company as resource. Energy management\nis crucial in H4C, as these systems often integrate renewable energy sources,\ninvolve energy-intensive industries, include numerous energy consumers, and may\nrely on energy-based industrial symbiosis exchanges.\n  This study presents a modelling framework for energy management in H4C,\ndeveloped through a systematic literature review of related systems including\nenergy-based IS. The framework provides a guideline for researchers and\npractitioners on which modelling aspects to consider when optimising the energy\nflows within a hub. We argue that effective energy management in H4C requires\ncombining conventional modelling aspects - such as objective functions,\nuncertainty, operational flexibility, and market participation - with\nIS-specific factors like the type of symbiosis, the degree of information\nsharing, and collaboration structures. In H4C with extensive IS, decentralised\nresource and energy exchanges often lead to similarly decentralised information\nflows and decision-making. Yet, our review shows a persistent reliance on\ncentralised model structures, suggesting a path dependency rooted in\ntraditional energy optimisation approaches. This highlights the need for models\nthat better align with the distributed and collaborative nature of H4C systems.",

Scalable, automated monitoring in\nagricultural environments remains an open challenge due to the difficulty of\ndetecting small, fast-moving, and often camouflaged insects. To address this,\nwe present BuzzSet v1.0, a large-scale dataset of high-resolution pollinator\nimages collected under real field conditions. BuzzSet contains 7,856 manually\nverified images with more than 8,000 annotated instances across three classes:\nhoneybees, bumblebees, and unidentified insects. Initial annotations were\nproduced using a YOLOv12 model trained on external data and refined through\nhuman verification with open-source tools. All images were preprocessed into\n256 x 256 tiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide baselines\nusing the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves strong\nclassification accuracy with F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybees and\nbumblebees, with minimal confusion between these categories. The unidentified\nclass remains more difficult due to label ambiguity and fewer samples, yet\nstill contributes insights for robustness evaluation. Overall detection\nperformance (mAP at 0.50 of 0.559) illustrates the challenging nature of the\ndataset and its potential to drive advances in small object detection under\nrealistic ecological conditions.

    "abstract": "Phased execution models are a well-known solution to tackle the\nunpredictability of today's complex COTS multi-core platforms. The semantics of\nthese models dedicate phases for a task's execution and shared memory accesses.\nMemory phases are solely dedicated to load all necessary instructions and data\nto private local memory, and to write back the results of the computation.\nDuring execution phases, only the private local memory is accessed. While\nnon-preemptive execution phases utilize the local memory well, schedulability\nis reduced due to blocking. On the other hand, fully preemptive execution\nphases allow for better schedulability, but require local memory to be large\nenough to hold all tasks involved in preemption simultaneously. Limited\npreemption is a promising approach that provides moderation between\nnon-preemptive and fully preemptive scheduling.\n  In this paper, we propose using preemption thresholds to limit the number of\npreemptions to minimize local memory usage while maintaining schedulability.

It belongs to a chain of clusters that show age\ngradients with distance from the galactic plane. We aim to provide suggestions\nregarding its formation history by examining the stellar and disk populations,\nstellar multiplicity, and interstellar absorption. We made a census of stars\nand disks using Gaia DR3 and infrared data. Interstellar absorption in the\ndirection of each star was derived by comparing SpTy from the literature and\nGaia colors. Stellar multiplicity analysis accounts for both direct observation\nof visual companions (Gaia data and high-contrast imaging) and indirect\ndetection of the presence of companions (eclipsing and spectroscopic binaries,\nand astrometry). The properties of the disks were obtained from the slopes of\nthe spectral energy distributions. As found in previous studies, the CrA\ncomplex can be divided into two regions: a younger region (CrA-Main: 3+/-1Myr)\nand an older one (CrA-North: 6.7+/-0.3Myr), slightly younger than previously\nthought. While CrA-Main still appears bound to the gas, CrA-North is unbound\nand expanding. The stars that belong to CrA-North were in the most compact\nconfiguration 3.72Myr ago. At that time, CrA-Main and CrA-North were much\ncloser to each other than they appear now. The fraction of disk-bearing stars\nis higher in Main than in North, as also expected due to the younger age of\nCrA-Main. We propose a formation history scenario for the CrA-complex. It\nstarted between 15 and 18 Myr ago with SNe explosions in the Upper\nCentaurus-Lupus complex, followed by a quiescent phase with little star\nformation. A star formation episode about 7Myr ago formed CrA-North stars.\nAbout 3.7Myr ago, a second SN explosion south of CrA-North triggered star\nformation in CrA-Main.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models suffer from substantial computational overhead due to their\ninherently iterative inference process. While feature caching offers a\npromising acceleration strategy by reusing intermediate outputs across\ntimesteps, naive reuse often incurs noticeable quality degradation. In this\nwork, we formally analyze the cumulative error introduced by caching and\ndecompose it into two principal components: feature shift error, caused by\ninaccuracies in cached outputs, and step amplification error, which arises from\nerror propagation under fixed timestep schedules. To address these issues, we\npropose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both\nerror types. Our method employs an offline residual profiling stage to identify\nreusable steps, dynamically adjusts integration intervals via a\ntrajectory-aware correction coefficient, and analytically approximates\ncache-induced errors through a closed-form residual linearization model.\nTogether, these components enable accurate and efficient sampling under\naggressive cache reuse. Extensive experiments across standard image and video\ngeneration benchmarks show that ERTACache achieves up to 2x inference speedup\nwhile consistently preserving or even improving visual quality. Notably, on the\nstate-of-the-art Wan2.1 video diffusion model, ERTACache delivers 2x\nacceleration with minimal VBench degradation, effectively maintaining baseline\nfidelity while significantly improving efficiency.

To resolve this challenge, privacy-preserving\ncomputational approaches are required. The present study evaluates the\nfeasibility and effectiveness of Federated Learning, specifically the FedProx\nalgorithm, to predict student performance using microdata from the Brazilian\nBasic Education Assessment System (SAEB). A Deep Neural Network (DNN) model was\ntrained in a federated manner, simulating a scenario with 50 schools, and its\nperformance was rigorously benchmarked against a centralized eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting (XGBoost) model. The analysis, conducted on a universe of over two\nmillion student records, revealed that the centralized model achieved an\naccuracy of 63.96%. Remarkably, the federated model reached a peak accuracy of\n61.23%, demonstrating a marginal performance loss in exchange for a robust\nprivacy guarantee.

Recent advances in hierarchical Bayesian model updating\n(HBMU) enable robust parameter estimation under ill-posed/ill-conditioned\nsettings and in the presence of inherent variability in structural parameters\ndue to environmental and operational conditions. However, most HBMU approaches\noverlook multimodality in structural parameters that often arises when a\nstructure experiences multiple damage states over its service life. This paper\npresents an HBMU framework that employs a Dirichlet process (DP) mixture prior\non structural parameters (DP-HBMU). DP mixtures are nonparametric Bayesian\nmodels that perform clustering without pre-specifying the number of clusters,\nincorporating damage state classification into FE model updating. We formulate\nthe DP-HBMU framework and devise a Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampler that draws\nsamples from the posterior by embedding Metropolis updates for intractable\nconditionals due to the FE simulator. The applicability of DP-HBMU to damage\nlocalization is demonstrated through both numerical and experimental examples.\nWe consider moment-resisting frame structures with beam-end fractures and apply\nthe method to datasets spanning multiple damage states, from an intact state to\nmoderate or severe damage state. The clusters inferred by DP-HBMU align closely\nwith the assumed or observed damage states.

This is especially true during initialization phase, which\ndominates total simulation time because of large displacements involved and\nassociated kinetic energy. We overcome this bottleneck with a novel generative\npipeline based on 3D diffusion models that directly synthesizes arbitrarily\nlarge granular assemblies in their final and physically realistic\nconfigurations. The approach frames the problem as a 3D generative modeling\ntask, consisting of a two-stage pipeline. First a diffusion model is trained to\ngenerate independent 3D voxel grids representing granular media. Second, a 3D\ninpainting model, adapted from 2D inpainting techniques using masked inputs,\nstitches these grids together seamlessly, enabling synthesis of large samples\nwith physically realistic structure. The inpainting model explores several\nmasking strategies for the inputs to the underlying UNets by training the\nnetwork to infer missing portions of voxel grids from a concatenation of noised\ntensors, masks, and masked tensors as input channels. The model also adapts a\n2D repainting technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground\ntruth to provide a strong guidance to the 3D model. This along with weighted\nlosses ensures long-term coherence over generation of masked regions. Both\nmodels are trained on the same binarized 3D occupancy grids extracted from\nsmall-scale DEM simulations, achieving linear scaling of computational time\nwith respect to sample size. Quantitatively, a 1.2 m long ballasted rail track\nsynthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation, was completed under 20\nseconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain\ngeometries for DEM-compatibility as well, enabling physically coherent,\nreal-time, scalable granular media synthesis for industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Line segment detection in images has been studied for several decades.\nExisting line segment detectors can be roughly divided into two categories:\ngeneric line segment detectors and wireframe line segment detectors. Generic\nline segment detectors aim to detect all meaningful line segments in images and\ntraditional approaches usually fall into this category. Recent deep learning\nbased approaches are mostly wireframe line segment detectors. They detect only\nline segments that are geometrically meaningful and have large spatial support.\nDue to the difference in the aim of design, the performance of generic line\nsegment detectors for the task of wireframe line segment detection won't be\nsatisfactory, and vice versa. In this work, we propose a robust framework that\ncan be used for both generic line segment detection and wireframe line segment\ndetection. The proposed method is an improved version of the Pixel Orientation\nEstimation (POE) method. It is thus named as POEv2. POEv2 detects line segments\nfrom edge strength maps, and can be combined with any edge detector. We show in\nour experiments that by combining the proposed POEv2 with an efficient edge\ndetector, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available\ndatasets.",

This motivates the search for bounds depending only on simple\nstructural parameters.\n  More precisely, let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a non-Archimedean\nlocal field $F$ of odd residual characteristic, and let $\\theta$ be a rational\ninvolution with fixed-point subgroup $H = G^\\theta$. For any unramified smooth\ncharacter $\\chi$ of $H$, we show that the multiplicity\n  \\[\n  \\dim \\mathrm{Hom}_G(\\rho, C^\\infty(G/H,\\chi))\n  \\] is uniformly bounded for a broad class of irreducible admissible\nrepresentations $\\rho$ of $G$, conjecturally including all such\nrepresentations.

By incorporating quark\nself-energy corrections into the RG equation, we reproduce the known\nweak-coupling results from the gap equation at the same perturbative order at\n$O(g^0)$. Within the RG approach, the angular momentum structure of the pairing\nchannel becomes more transparent, allowing us to examine the size of the gap\nfor various pairing patterns. We also compare our results with recent lattice\nQCD calculations at finite isospin density. Finally, we argue that the RG\nmethod potentially offers a simpler and more systematic route to higher-order\ncomputations of the gap, which are of order $O(g)$ and thus quantitatively\nimportant.",

As these benchmarks contain 10-25% label noise, additional\nfinetuning using noise-robust losses (such as symmetric cross entropy and\ngeneralised cross entropy) adds another 2.5% in CRIC, and 5.5% in AOKVQA.

Previous works studied tuning, decoding algorithms, or locating and\nediting context-aware neurons to adapt LLMs to be faithful to new contextual\nknowledge. However, they are usually inefficient or ineffective for large\nmodels, not workable for black-box models, or unable to continuously adjust\nLLMs' sensitivity to the knowledge provided in the context. To mitigate these\nproblems, we propose CSKS (Continuously Steering Knowledge Sensitivity), a\nsimple framework that can steer LLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge\ncontinuously at a lightweight cost. Specifically, we tune two small LMs (i.e.\nproxy models) and use the difference in their output distributions to shift the\noriginal distribution of an LLM without modifying the LLM weights. In the\nevaluation process, we not only design synthetic data and fine-grained metrics\nto measure models' sensitivity to contextual knowledge but also use a real\nconflict dataset to validate CSKS's practical efficacy. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves continuous and precise control over\nLLMs' sensitivity to contextual knowledge, enabling both increased sensitivity\nand reduced sensitivity, thereby allowing LLMs to prioritize either contextual\nor parametric knowledge as needed flexibly.

Extension of our analysis to two additional long-period S-stars, S1\nand S9, reveals that while the cosmological precession becomes relatively more\nprominent in such systems, limited orbital coverage introduces significant\nuncertainties in parameter estimation.

Experiments at room temperature showed that up to 30 GPa the\nmetastable coesite structure develops only minor displacive changes (coesite-II\nand coesite-III) while the Si atoms remain 4-coordinated. Beyond 30 GPa,\nreconstructive transformations start, following different pathways from the\ncomplex structure of coesite. Besides amorphization, two different crystalline\noutcomes were observed. One is formation of defective high-pressure octahedral\nphases (Hu et al., 2015) and another one is formation of unusual and complex\ndense phases coesite-IV and coesite-V with Si atoms in 4-fold, 5-fold and\n6-fold coordination (Bykova et al., 2018).

We describe the atomistic\nmechanisms along the transformation pathways. While the pathway to coesite-IV\nis simpler, the transformation to octahedral phases involves two steps: first,\na hcp sublattice of O atoms is formed where Si atoms occupy octahedral\npositions but the octahedra chains do not form a regular pattern. In the second\nstep, the Si atoms order and the chains develop a more regular arrangement. We\npredict that the pathway to coesite-IV is preferred at room temperature, while\nat 600 K the formation of octahedral phases is more likely.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-Newton methods are widely used for solving convex optimization problems\ndue to their ease of implementation, practical efficiency, and strong local\nconvergence guarantees. However, their global convergence is typically\nestablished only under specific line search strategies and the assumption of\nstrong convexity. In this work, we extend the theoretical understanding of\nQuasi-Newton methods by introducing a simple stepsize schedule that guarantees\na global convergence rate of ${O}(1/k)$ for the convex functions. Furthermore,\nwe show that when the inexactness of the Hessian approximation is controlled\nwithin a prescribed relative accuracy, the method attains an accelerated\nconvergence rate of ${O}(1/k^2)$ -- matching the best-known rates of both\nNesterov's accelerated gradient method and cubically regularized Newton\nmethods. We validate our theoretical findings through empirical comparisons,\ndemonstrating clear improvements over standard Quasi-Newton baselines. To\nfurther enhance robustness, we develop an adaptive variant that adjusts to the\nfunction's curvature while retaining the global convergence guarantees of the\nnon-adaptive algorithm.",

To\nstudy this unique behavior of the Purcell enhancement near BIC, we built an\nanalytically model with spectral parameters to analyze the Purcell enhancement\non metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC. Our analytical model predicts the average\nPurcell enhancement by metasurfaces coupled to a luminescent medium, utilizing\nparameters that are formulated through the temporal coupled-mode theory and can\nbe derived from measured spectra such as transmissivity and reflectivity. We\nanalyzed several metasurfaces supporting quasi-BIC numerically and\nexperimentally to study the behavior of the spectral parameters as well as the\nresultant Purcell enhancement. We formulated the interdependence between the\nquality factor and the out-coupling efficiency, and revealed the existence of\noptimal detuning from the BIC.

The foundational principles were validated in a two-part study. An\ninitial study correlated user's implicit attention with explicit preference and\nthe next one correlated mood to attention. A comparative study where 4\ndesigners solved challenging design problems using 4 distinct workflows, from a\nmanual process to an end-to-end automated pipeline, showed the integrated\nEUPHORIA-RETINA workflow was over 4 times more time-efficient than the\nconventional method.

One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of\nthe hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and\ntheoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms\nassociated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive.\nHere, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase\nphotoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events\nleading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The\nprocess begins through the excitation of electrons localized mostly on specific\ntopological defects in water's hydrogen network which is subsequently followed\nby two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen\natom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100\nfemtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving\nrise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated\nexcess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast\ncoupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the\nformation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can\nsurvive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of\nvisible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the\ninterpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured\nover the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical\nand experimental fronts.",

The temperature, luminosity, and location\nof the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc\nvariations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an\nanti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate\nfeature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous\nolivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite.\nThe excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K)\nmolecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the\naccretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are\nmostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (>1500 K) region likely\nwithin the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In\ncomparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays\nmoderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion\nrate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on\nshort timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk\nevolution.",

    "abstract": "An iterative Finite Element method predicated on a linearisation of the weak\nform around a reference configuration is derived for general,\nthree-dimensional, free-surface flows, including systems with moving contact\nlines. The method is a rigorous generalisation of the Total Linearisation\nMethod that was proposed by Kruyt et al. (1988) for two-dimensional flows with\ncontact angles limited to $90^\\circ$. In contrast to existing numerical methods\nfor free-surface-flow problems, the present linearisation produces a weak form\nthat is devoid of displacement degrees of freedom in the bulk, thus nearly\nhalving the size of the linear system when compared to standard linearised\nmethods. A novel preconditioner, whose implementation is made possible by the\nsize reduction, is employed to solve the large resulting monolithic Jacobian\nsystems with the Generalised Minimum Residual Method. The proposed method and\nthe preconditioner are shown to be effective on two numerical examples of\ncapillary flows, namely (i) the cylindrical die swell problem, solved both in\n3D Cartesian coordinates and under the Ansatz of axisymmetry; and (ii) an\nenclosed 2D thermo-capillary problem. For the die swell, numerical results are\nvalidated by existing experimental results and prior simulations, and confirm\nboth the extension to 3D and theoretical convergence rates. For the\nthermo-capillary problem, simulations verify earlier calculations. Additional\nsimulations are also carried out for a new range of contact angles made\npossible by the extension.",

However, 3DGS lacks 3D segmentation ability, which limits its\napplicability in tasks that require scene understanding. The identification and\nisolating of specific object components is crucial. To address this limitation,\nwe propose Label-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (LabelGS), a method that augments\nthe Gaussian representation with object label.LabelGS introduces cross-view\nconsistent semantic masks for 3D Gaussians and employs a novel Occlusion\nAnalysis Model to avoid overfitting occlusion during optimization, Main\nGaussian Labeling model to lift 2D semantic prior to 3D Gaussian and Gaussian\nProjection Filter to avoid Gaussian label conflict. Our approach achieves\neffective decoupling of Gaussian representations and refines the 3DGS\noptimization process through a random region sampling strategy, significantly\nimproving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LabelGS\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, including Feature-3DGS, in the\n3D scene segmentation task.

Using MESA, we model\nthe evolution of the 10 M$_{\\odot}$ accretor through and after a Roche lobe\noverflow phase. In addition to changing the surface composition of the star,\nmass accretion also significantly modifies the internal structure by expanding\nthe convective core and altering chemical stratification near the core-envelope\nboundary. This partial core rejuvenation creates a distinct mean molecular\nweight gradient and leaves a persistent local density modulation. In the late\nstages of mass transfer, changes in density and sound-speed profiles become\napparent and influence stellar oscillations. We analyse the asteroseismic\nproperties of the post-mass transfer models compared to single stars of the\nsame mass and central hydrogen abundance. In the gravity mode regime, the\naltered Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency leads to period spacing patterns with\nlarger amplitudes and phase shifts. For low and intermediate-order pressure\nmodes, we find systematic frequency deviations linked to changes in the\nsound-speed profile. Weight function analyses confirm that these differences\narise primarily from structural modifications near the convective core\nboundary. Furthermore, small frequency separations, sensitive to localised\nsound-speed gradients, reveal periodic variations attributable to the density\ndiscontinuity at the convective core edge. The accretor exhibits a larger\nsound-speed gradient integral and a longer acoustic radius ratio compared to\nthe single star, consistent with its expanded core. Our results demonstrate\nthat mass accretion imprints measurable asteroseismic signatures on both\ngravity and pressure modes. These signatures provide powerful diagnostics for\nidentifying post-interaction stars, for refining stellar age and structure\nestimates in binary systems.",

Generally,\nmeaningful information can be stored in the hidden layers of the trained FNN,\nand the TU implementation is one tractable recipe to extract buried information\nby means of the Topological Data Analysis. We explicate the concept of the TU\nand the numerical procedures. Then, for a concrete demonstration of the\nperformance test, we employ the Neutron Star data used for inference of the\nequation of state (EoS). For the training dataset consisting of the input\n(Neutron Star data) and the output (EoS parameters), we can compare the\ninferred EoSs and the exact answers to classify the data with the label $k$.\nThe subdataset with $k=0$ leads to the normal inference for which the inferred\nEoS approximates the answer well, while the subdataset with $k=1$ ends up with\nthe unsuccessful inference. Once the TU is prepared based on the $k$-labled\nsubdatasets, we introduce the cross-TU to quantify the uncertainty of\ncharacterizing the $k$-labeled data with the label $j$. The anomaly or\nunsuccessful inference is correctly detected if the cross-TU for $j=k=1$ is\nsmaller than that for $j=0$ and $k=1$.

In this work, we\ninvestigate hydrogen diffusion in amorphous IGZO ($a$-IGZO) and $c$-axis\naligned crystalline IGZO (CAAC-IGZO) using machine learning interatomic\npotential molecular dynamics (MLIP-MD) simulations. We construct accurate\nphase-specific MLIPs by fine-tuning SevenNet-0, a universal pretrained MLIP,\nand validate the models against a comprehensive dataset covering\nhydrogen-related configurations and diffusion environments. Hydrogen\ndiffusivity is evaluated over 650--1700 K, revealing enhanced mobility above\n750 K in $a$-IGZO due to the glassy matrix, while diffusion at lower\ntemperatures is constrained by the rigid network. Arrhenius extrapolation of\nthe diffusivity indicates that hydrogen in $a$-IGZO can reach the\nchannel/insulator interface within $10^{4}$ seconds at 300--400 K, likely\ncontributing to negative bias stress-induced device degradation. Trajectory\nanalysis reveals that long-range diffusion in $a$-IGZO is enabled by a\ncombination of hydrogen hopping and flipping mechanisms. In CAAC-IGZO, hydrogen\nexhibits high in-plane diffusivity but severely restricted out-of-plane\ntransport due to a high energy barrier along the $c$-axis. This limited\nvertical diffusion in CAAC-IGZO suggests minimal impact on bias instability.\nThis work bridges the atomic-level hydrogen transport mechanism and\ndevice-level performance in oxide TFTs by leveraging large-scale MLIP-MD\nsimulations.",

Most existing studies\nformulate it as an optimization problem, which requires repeatedly solving the\nforward equations to identify optimal designs. Such methods, however, are\ncomputationally intensive and often susceptible to local minima issues. In\ncontrast, solving the inverse problem theoretically, which can bypass the need\nfor optimizations, is highly efficient yet remains challenging, particularly\nfor cases involving arbitrary boundary conditions (BCs). Here, we develop a\nsystematic theoretical framework, termed inverse elastica, for the direct\ndetermination of the undeformed configuration from a target deformed shape\nalong with prescribed BCs. Building upon the classical elastica, inverse\nelastica is derived by supplementing the geometric equations of undeformed\nconfigurations. The framework shows three key features: reduced nonlinearity,\nsolution multiplicity, and inverse loading. These principles are demonstrated\nthrough two representative models: an analytical solution for a two-dimensional\narc and a numerical continuation study of the inverse loading of a\nthree-dimensional helical spring. Furthermore, we develop a theory-assisted\noptimization strategy for cases in which the constrains of the undeformed\nconfigurations cannot be directly formulated as BCs. Using this strategy, we\nachieve rational inverse design of complex spatial curves and curve-discretized\nsurfaces with varying Gaussian curvatures.

    "abstract": "As Mixed Criticality Systems (MCSs) evolve, they increasingly integrate\nheterogeneous computing platforms, combining general-purpose processors with\nspecialized accelerators such as AI engines, GPUs, and high-speed networking\ninterfaces. This heterogeneity introduces challenges, as these accelerators and\nDMA-capable devices act as independent bus masters, directly accessing memory.\nConsequently, ensuring both security and timing predictability in such\nenvironments becomes critical. To address these concerns, the Input-Output\nMemory Management Unit (IOMMU) plays a key role in mediating and regulating\nmemory access, preventing unauthorized transactions while enforcing isolation\nand access control policies. While prior work has explored IOMMU-related\nside-channel vulnerabilities from a security standpoint, its role in\nperformance interference remains largely unexplored. Moreover, many of the same\narchitectural properties that enable side-channel leakage, such as shared TLBs,\ncaching effects, and translation overheads, can also introduce timing\nunpredictability. In this work, we analyze the contention effects within IOMMU\nstructures using the Xilinx UltraScale+ ZCU104 platform, demonstrating how\ntheir shared nature introduce unpredictable delays. Our findings reveal that\nIOMMU-induced interference primarily affects small memory transactions, where\ntranslation overheads significantly impact execution time. Additionally, we\nhypothesize that contention effects arising from IOTLBs exhibit similar\nbehavior across architectures due to shared caching principles, such as\nprefetching and hierarchical TLB structures. Notably, our experiments show that\nIOMMU interference can delay DMA transactions by up to 1.79x for lower-size\ntransfers on the Arm SMMUv2 implementation.",

In this work, we report remarkable quantum\nlinear magnetoresistance (LMR) in the Weyl semiconductor tellurium at high\ntemperatures of 40-300 K under strong magnetic fields up to 60 T. At high\nfields, the Weyl band features a large energy gap between the lowest and first\nLandau levels, which suppresses thermal excitation and preserves Landau\nquantization at high temperatures. The LMR is observed as long as majority\ncarriers remain in the lowest Landau level without requiring monochromaticity,\nallowing it to persist up to room temperature. The inverse relationship between\nthe LMR slope and temperature provides clear evidence that quantum LMR\noriginates from high-temperature phonon scattering in the quantum limit,\nfirstly demonstrating a theoretical prediction made nearly fifty years ago.\nThis study highlights the key role of electron-phonon interaction and reveals\nan innovative quantum mechanism for achieving high-temperature LMR,\nfundamentally distinct from previous findings.

It is found that the jump direction of electron density\n(from low level to high level) is opposite to that of electron temperature\n(from high level to low level). Electron density increases significantly and\nthe radial profile becomes localized near the axis when the blue-core\ntransition occurs.

The radial profile of electron temperature\nlooks like a ``W\" shape, i.e. minimizing around the edge of blue-core column.\nElectron density increases with background pressure, while electron temperature\npeaks around certain pressure value. High-speed videos show that the plasma\ncolumn oscillates radially and experiences azimuthal instabilities with high\nrate once entered blue-core mode.

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucinations, saying\nthings that are not actually in the image, and language shortcuts, where they\nskip the visual part and just rely on text priors. These issues arise because\nmost post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching\nand supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without\nexplicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often\nlearn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To\nmitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human\nannotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human\nannotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot\nadapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to\nreward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method\nthat improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions\nvia reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two\nstages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted\nto produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the\nquestion without referring back the input image. To validate this\nself-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language\nreasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This\nself-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced\ntraining signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning.\nOur experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning,\nmitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts\nacross diverse vision-language tasks.",

We find that the\ncontributions only show up for the off-diagonal Higgs and $Z$ boson\ninteractions with scalar leptoquarks, which can lead to a new tensor structure\ndifferent from the standard model. In the one-field and two-field models, the\ncontributions vanish exactly; thus, the contributions are possible at least in\nthe three-field models. We exemplify the contributions in the\n$S_1+\\widetilde{R}_2+S_3$ model, which can appear in the presence of scalar\nleptoquark mass splittings and $CP$ violation.

As a result,\ntraining state-of-the-art graph machine learning (GML) models have become\nincreasingly resource-intensive, turning these models and data into invaluable\nIntellectual Property (IP). To address the resource-intensive nature of model\ntraining, graph-based Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (GMLaaS) has emerged as an\nefficient solution by leveraging third-party cloud services for model\ndevelopment and management. However, deploying such models in GMLaaS also\nexposes them to potential threats from attackers. Specifically, while the APIs\nwithin a GMLaaS system provide interfaces for users to query the model and\nreceive outputs, they also allow attackers to exploit and steal model\nfunctionalities or sensitive training data, posing severe threats to the safety\nof these GML models and the underlying graph data. To address these challenges,\nthis survey systematically introduces the first taxonomy of threats and\ndefenses at the level of both GML model and graph-structured data. Such a\ntailored taxonomy facilitates an in-depth understanding of GML IP protection.\nFurthermore, we present a systematic evaluation framework to assess the\neffectiveness of IP protection methods, introduce a curated set of benchmark\ndatasets across various domains, and discuss their application scopes and\nfuture challenges. Finally, we establish an open-sourced versatile library\nnamed PyGIP, which evaluates various attack and defense techniques in GMLaaS\nscenarios and facilitates the implementation of existing benchmark methods.

Despite significant efforts to combat this\nissue due to the severe threat that fake news videos pose to public information\nsecurity, existing methods still fall short in detection accuracy, often due to\nlack of knowledge to verify the news is real or not. However, large Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs) have absorbed extensive real-world knowledge from\nmassive multimodal datasets. Motivated by this, we adapt advanced VLMs for fake\nnews detection in short videos. Upon close examination of news samples, we\nobserve that short video samples can be categorized into four distinct\nscenarios: both video and text are real (for real samples), or both are fake,\nor either the video or text is fake (for fake samples). Inspired by this\ninsight, we design four experts tailored to handle each scenario and integrate\nthem into VLM via Mixture of Experts. Specifically, we develop the Progressive\nMoE Adapter (PMOE) module where detection experts first provide an initial\nanalysis, followed by attribution experts for a comprehensive diagnosis,\nleading to a robust decision. Additionally, we also note the fake news videos\noften show inconsistency between two modalities. Consequently, we further\ndesign the Alignment-driven Event Checking (ADEC) module, which perceives the\nfake news by capturing the inconsistency between different modalities.\nExtensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, FakeSV and FakeTT, verify the\nsuperiority of our model.

Existing methods typically\norganize these intermediate features as 2D bird's-eye-view (BEV)\nrepresentations, which discard critical fine-grained 3D structural cues\nessential for accurate object recognition and localization. To this end, we\nfirst introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for\ncollaborative perception. However, point-cloud data are inherently unordered,\nmassive, and position-sensitive, making it challenging to produce compact and\naligned point-level token sequences that preserve detailed structural\ninformation. Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception\nframework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a\npoint-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence\nmodeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering\nmodule generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and\ntoken-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model\ncaptures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral\ndomains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background\nclutter. Lastly, a neighbor-to-ego alignment module applies a closed-loop\nprocess, combining global agent-level correction with local token-level\nrefinement to mitigate localization noise.

In order to study the implications of fragmentation\nand possibilities for integration, we first document and discuss a variety of\nfragmentation cases in practice such as school choice, medical residency\nmatching, and so forth. Using the real-life dataset of daycare matching markets\nin Japan, we then empirically evaluate the impact of interregional transfer of\nstudents by estimating student utility functions under a variety of\nspecifications and then using them for counterfactual simulation. Our\nsimulation compares a fully integrated market and a partially integrated one\nwith a \"balancedness\" constraint -- for each region, the inflow of students\nfrom the other regions must be equal to the outflow to the other areas. We find\nthat partial integration achieves 39.2 to 59.6% of the increase in the child\nwelfare that can be attained under full integration, which is equivalent to a\n3.3 to 4.9% reduction of travel time. The percentage decrease in the unmatch\nrate is 40.0 to 52.8% under partial integration compared to the case of full\nintegration. The results suggest that even in environments where full\nintegration is not a realistic option, partial integration, i.e., integration\nthat respects the balancedness constraint, has a potential to recover a\nnontrivial portion of the loss from fragmentation.",

We prove the existence\nof a semiorthogonal decomposition of the limit category into quasi-BPS\ncategories, which are categorical versions of BPS invariants on a non-compact\nCalabi-Yau 3-fold.

    "abstract": "Extending recommender systems to federated learning (FL) frameworks to\nprotect the privacy of users or platforms while making recommendations has\nrecently gained widespread attention in academia. This is due to the natural\ncoupling of recommender systems and federated learning architectures: the data\noriginates from distributed clients (mostly mobile devices held by users),\nwhich are highly related to privacy. In a centralized recommender system\n(CenRec), the central server collects clients' data, trains the model, and\nprovides the service. Whereas in federated recommender systems (FedRec), the\nstep of data collecting is omitted, and the step of model training is offloaded\nto each client. The server only aggregates the model and other knowledge, thus\navoiding client privacy leakage. Some surveys of federated recommender systems\ndiscuss and analyze related work from the perspective of designing FL systems.\nHowever, their utility drops by ignoring specific recommendation scenarios'\nunique characteristics and practical challenges. For example, the statistical\nheterogeneity issue in cross-domain FedRec originates from the label drift of\nthe data held by different platforms, which is mainly caused by the recommender\nitself, but not the federated architecture. Therefore, it should focus more on\nsolving specific problems in real-world recommendation scenarios to encourage\nthe deployment FedRec. To this end, this review comprehensively analyzes the\ncoupling of recommender systems and federated learning from the perspective of\nrecommendation researchers and practitioners. We establish a clear link between\nrecommendation scenarios and FL frameworks, systematically analyzing\nscenario-specific approaches, practical challenges, and potential\nopportunities.

Although counterintuitive and challenging to apply in\npractice, this phenomenon enables granular control and rigorous analysis of how\nLLMs integrate external knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we intervene on\nnoise injection and establish a layer-specific functional demarcation within\nthe LLM: shallow layers specialize in local context modeling, intermediate\nlayers focus on integrating long-range external factual knowledge, and deeper\nlayers primarily rely on parametric internal knowledge. Building on this\ninsight, we propose Layer Fused Decoding (LFD), a simple decoding strategy that\ndirectly combines representations from an intermediate layer with final-layer\ndecoding outputs to fully exploit the external factual knowledge.

Existing methods often rely on predicted class\nprobabilities (softmax scores) or data similarity metrics. While softmax-based\napproaches benefit from representing predictions on the standard simplex,\ncompressing logits into probabilities leads to information loss. Meanwhile,\nsimilarity-based methods can be computationally expensive and domain-specific,\nlimiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce ALSA (Anchors\nin Logit Space for Accuracy estimation), a novel framework that preserves\nricher information by operating directly in the logit space. Building on\ntheoretical insights and empirical observations, we demonstrate that the\naggregation and distribution of logits exhibit a strong correlation with the\npredictive performance of the model. To exploit this property, ALSA employs an\nanchor-based modeling strategy: multiple learnable anchors are initialized in\nlogit space, each assigned an influence function that captures subtle\nvariations in the logits. This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate\nperformance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts. Extensive\nexperiments on vision, language, and graph benchmarks demonstrate ALSA's\nsuperiority over both softmax- and similarity-based baselines.

    "abstract": "Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) focuses on training a model\nusing labeled data from a source domain, with the goal of achieving robust\ngeneralization to unseen target domains during inference. A common approach to\nimprove generalization is to augment the source domain with synthetic data\ngenerated by diffusion models (DMs). However, the generated images often\ncontain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training\nsegmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation\nand error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse\nevolution layers (IELs) into the generative process. IELs are designed to\nhighlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies using\nLaplacian-based priors, enabling more effective filtering of undesirable\ngenerative patterns. Based on this mechanism, we introduce IELDM, an enhanced\ndiffusion-based data augmentation framework that can produce higher-quality\nimages. Furthermore, we observe that the defect-suppression capability of IELs\ncan also benefit the segmentation network by suppressing artifact propagation.\nBased on this insight, we embed IELs into the decoder of the DGSS model and\npropose IELFormer to strengthen generalization capability in cross-domain\nscenarios. To further strengthen the model's semantic consistency across\nscales, IELFormer incorporates a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module,\nwhich performs frequency-domain analysis to achieve structured integration of\nmulti-resolution features, thereby improving cross-scale coherence.

This has inspired efforts to leverage digital platforms for\nscalable health promotion to engage at-risk populations. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of a digitally-enabled mental health promotion (DEHP) campaign,\nwe conducted an observational cross-sectional study of a 3-month\n(February-April 2025) nation-wide campaign in Singapore. Campaign materials\nwere developed using a marketing funnel framework and disseminated across\nYouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This included narrative videos and\ninfographics to promote symptom awareness, coping strategies, and/or patient\nnavigation to Singapore's Mindline website, as the intended endpoint for user\nengagement and support. Primary outcomes include anonymised performance\nanalytics (impressions, unique reach, video content view, engagements)\nstratified by demographics, device types, and sector. Secondary outcomes\nmeasured cost-efficiency metrics and traffic to the Mindline website\nrespectively. This campaign generated 3.49 million total impressions and\nreached 1.39 million unique residents, with a Cost per Mille at $26.90, Cost\nper Click at $29.33, and Cost per Action at $6.06. Narrative videos accumulated\nover 630,000 views and 18,768 engagements. Overall, we demonstrate that DEHP\ncampaigns can achieve national engagement for mental health awareness through\nmulti-channel distribution and creative, narrative-driven designs.",

However, the\nimpact of reduced precision on model robustness to real-world input\ndegradations such as noise, blur, and compression artifacts is a significant\nconcern. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the\nrobustness of YOLO models (nano to extra-large scales) across multiple\nprecision formats: FP32, FP16 (TensorRT), Dynamic UINT8 (ONNX), and Static INT8\n(TensorRT). We introduce and evaluate a degradation-aware calibration strategy\nfor Static INT8 PTQ, where the TensorRT calibration process is exposed to a mix\nof clean and synthetically degraded images. Models were benchmarked on the COCO\ndataset under seven distinct degradation conditions (including various types\nand levels of noise, blur, low contrast, and JPEG compression) and a\nmixed-degradation scenario. Results indicate that while Static INT8 TensorRT\nengines offer substantial speedups (~1.5-3.3x) with a moderate accuracy drop\n(~3-7% mAP50-95) on clean data, the proposed degradation-aware calibration did\nnot yield consistent, broad improvements in robustness over standard clean-data\ncalibration across most models and degradations.

    "abstract": "The functionality of Large Language Model (LLM) agents is primarily\ndetermined by two capabilities: action planning and answer summarization. The\nformer, action planning, is the core capability that dictates an agent's\nperformance. However, prevailing training paradigms employ end-to-end,\nmulti-objective optimization that jointly trains both capabilities. This\nparadigm faces two critical challenges: imbalanced optimization objective\nallocation and scarcity of verifiable data, making it difficult to enhance the\nagent's planning capability. To address these challenges, we propose\nReinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards (RLTR), a novel framework that\ndecouples the training process to enable a focused, single-objective\noptimization of the planning module. Crucially, RLTR introduces a reward signal\nbased on tool-use completeness to directly evaluate the quality of tool\ninvocation sequences. This method offers a more direct and reliable training\nsignal than assessing the final response content, thereby obviating the need\nfor verifiable data. Our experiments demonstrate that RLTR achieves an 8%-12%\nimprovement in planning performance compared to end-to-end baselines. Moreover,\nthis enhanced planning capability, in turn, translates to a 5%-6% increase in\nthe final response quality of the overall agent system.",

    "abstract": "There is much discussion of the false outputs that generative AI systems such\nas ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok create. In popular terminology,\nthese have been dubbed AI hallucinations. However, deeming these AI outputs\nhallucinations is controversial, with many claiming this is a metaphorical\nmisnomer. Nevertheless, in this paper, I argue that when viewed through the\nlens of distributed cognition theory, we can better see the dynamic and\ntroubling ways in which inaccurate beliefs, distorted memories and\nself-narratives, and delusional thinking can emerge through human-AI\ninteractions; examples of which are popularly being referred to as cases of AI\npsychosis. In such cases, I suggest we move away from thinking about how an AI\nsystem might hallucinate at us, by generating false outputs, to thinking about\nhow, when we routinely rely on generative AI to help us think, remember, and\nnarrate, we can come to hallucinate with AI. This can happen when AI introduces\nerrors into the distributed cognitive process, but it can also happen when AI\nsustains, affirms, and elaborates on our own delusional thinking and\nself-narratives, such as in the case of Jaswant Singh Chail. I also examine how\nthe conversational style of chatbots can lead them to play a dual-function,\nboth as a cognitive artefact and a quasi-Other with whom we co-construct our\nbeliefs, narratives, and our realities. It is this dual function, I suggest,\nthat makes generative AI an unusual, and particularly seductive, case of\ndistributed cognition.",

The effect arises from the Berry connection\npolarizability dipole of valley electrons and is permissible in both\ninversion-symmetric and inversion-asymmetric materials. We demonstrate that the\nresponse tensor is connected to the intrinsic nonlinear valley Hall\nconductivity through a generalized Mott relation, with the two being directly\nproportional at low temperatures, scaled by the Lorenz number. We elucidate the\nsymmetry constraints governing this effect and develop a theory for its\nnonlocal measurement, revealing a nonlocal second-harmonic signal with a\ndistinct $\\rho^2$ scaling. This signal comprises two scaling terms, with their\nratio corresponding to the square of the thermopower normalized by the Lorenz\nnumber. Key characteristics are demonstrated using a tilted Dirac model and\nfirst-principles calculations on bilayer WTe$_2$. Possible extrinsic\ncontributions and alternative experimental detection methods, e.g., by valley\npumping and by nonreciprocal directional dichroism, are discussed.

Remarkably, the critical\ncurrent density exceeds the benchmark of 10^5 A/cm2, surpassing all previously\nreported as-cast entropy-stabilized superconductors. This high critical current\ndensity is likely attributed to strong flux pinning at the grain boundaries,\nfacilitated by extreme intrinsic lattice distortion.

We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass\nobjects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between\nthe possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from\nmore prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an\nastrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small,\ncurrently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother\nemission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of\ngravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass\nlenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the\nsize of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in\nthe emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\\gamma$-ray emission from dark\nmatter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we\nfind that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly\ngreater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\\gamma$-ray detectors. For\na small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude\nincrease in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events\nremaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would\noccur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a\nfour-order-of-magnitude improvement.

To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a\nunified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning\nability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed\ntest time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of\npolicy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter\nand assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO\nsampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After\nthe basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose\na test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo\nTree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation\nrequired, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by\nan adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as\nverification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning\naccuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on coding problems to verify the\nvalidity of the proposed RL paradigm.

    "abstract": "Compositional Customized Image Generation aims to customize multiple target\nconcepts within generation content, which has gained attention for its wild\napplication. Existing approaches mainly concentrate on the target entity's\nappearance preservation, while neglecting the fine-grained interaction control\namong target entities. To enable the model of such interaction control\ncapability, we focus on human object interaction scenario and propose the task\nof Customized Human Object Interaction Image Generation(CHOI), which\nsimultaneously requires identity preservation for target human object and the\ninteraction semantic control between them. Two primary challenges exist for\nCHOI:(1)simultaneous identity preservation and interaction control demands\nrequire the model to decompose the human object into self-contained identity\nfeatures and pose-oriented interaction features, while the current HOI image\ndatasets fail to provide ideal samples for such feature-decomposed\nlearning.(2)inappropriate spatial configuration between human and object may\nlead to the lack of desired interaction semantics. To tackle it, we first\nprocess a large-scale dataset, where each sample encompasses the same pair of\nhuman object involving different interactive poses. Then we design a two-stage\nmodel Interact-Custom, which firstly explicitly models the spatial\nconfiguration by generating a foreground mask depicting the interaction\nbehavior, then under the guidance of this mask, we generate the target human\nobject interacting while preserving their identities features. Furthermore, if\nthe background image and the union location of where the target human object\nshould appear are provided by users, Interact-Custom also provides the optional\nfunctionality to specify them, offering high content controllability. Extensive\nexperiments on our tailored metrics for CHOI task demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach.",

    "abstract": "Pathological image segmentation faces numerous challenges, particularly due\nto ambiguous semantic boundaries and the high cost of pixel-level annotations.\nAlthough recent semi-supervised methods based on consistency regularization\n(e.g., UniMatch) have made notable progress, they mainly rely on\nperturbation-based consistency within the image modality, making it difficult\nto capture high-level semantic priors, especially in structurally complex\npathology images. To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel\nsegmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a\nmultimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of\nMPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes\nand pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing\nsupervision at both structural and semantic levels. This coarse-to-fine\nsupervisory strategy not only enhances the discriminative capability on\nunlabeled samples but also introduces the text prototype supervision into\nsegmentation for the first time, significantly improving semantic boundary\nmodeling. In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture\n(TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained\nfoundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of\npathology-relevant features.

Given mounting evidence linking prenatal environmental\nexposures to adverse birth outcomes, estimating the impact of Superfund\nremediation is of substantial policy relevance. A widespread approach is to fit\na spatial regression, i.e., a linear regression of the outcome (e.g., birth\nweight) on binary treatment (e.g., indicator for Superfund site remediation)\nand covariates, along with a spatially structured error term to account for\nunmeasured spatial confounding. Despite this common practice, it remains\nunclear to what extent spatial regression models account for unmeasured spatial\nconfounding in finite samples and whether such adjustments can be reformulated\nwithin a design-based framework for causal inference. To fill this knowledge\ngap, we introduce a weighting framework that encompasses three canonical types\nof spatial regression models: random effects, conditional autoregressive, and\nGaussian process models. This framework yields new insights into how spatial\nregression models build causal contrasts between treated and control units.\nSpecifically, we show that: 1) the spatially autocorrelated error term produces\napproximate balance on a hidden set of covariates, thereby adjusting for a\nspecific class of unmeasured confounders; and 2) the error covariance structure\ncan be equivalently expressed as regressors in a linear model.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable success in motion\nforecasting. However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this\nmemory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate\nSyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios\narrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets\nfrom INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM\nsignificantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while\nimproving forecasting accuracy in new ones.

Here, we present a\ncounterfactual reward model that introduces causal inference with multimodal\nrepresentation learning to provide an unsupervised, bias-resilient reward\nsignal. The heart of our contribution is the Counterfactual Trust Score, an\naggregated score consisting of four components: (1) counterfactual shifts that\ndecompose political framing bias from topical bias; (2) reconstruction\nuncertainty during counterfactual perturbations; (3) demonstrable violations of\nfairness rules for each protected attribute; and (4) temporal reward shifts\naligned with dynamic trust measures. We evaluated the framework on a multimodal\nfake versus true news dataset, which exhibits framing bias, class imbalance,\nand distributional drift. Following methodologies similar to unsupervised drift\ndetection from representation-based distances [1] and temporal robustness\nbenchmarking in language models [2], we also inject synthetic bias across\nsequential batches to test robustness.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings,\nwell beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are\nincreasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating\npredictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or\nsupervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised\nlearning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a\ncritical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data\nrepresentation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task\ncan drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply\nchanging variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%\nin certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to\ntask-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and\nsupervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose\nLLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we\ndiscover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable\nnames/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive\nmore attention when output tokens are generated, even though different\npositions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially\nexplains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also\nconsider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained\nspecifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve\nprediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant\nvariations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities,\ncurrently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a\nprincipled data-fitting tool.",

These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under\nvarious stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a\nnovel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned\nbehavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare.

However, their operational lifetimes are strongly\ninfluenced by orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This work presents a\nsimplified analytical model of orbital decay in LEO, incorporating atmospheric\ndensity variations and satellite parameters. Using standard drag force\nequations and density models, we explore how altitude, satellite mass, and\ncross-sectional area affect decay timescales.

While this fabric only plays a supporting role in the\nprocess of computing, for large AI workloads it ultimately determines energy\nconsumption and speed. In this paper, we address this bottleneck by asking: (a)\nWhat computing paradigms are inherent in existing routing, switching, and\ninterconnect systems, and how can they be used to implement a\nprocessing-in-Interconnect (\\pi^2) computing paradigm? and (b) leveraging\ncurrent and future interconnect trends, how will a \\pi^2 system's performance\nscale compared to other neuromorphic architectures? For (a), we show that\noperations required for typical AI workloads can be mapped onto delays,\ncausality, time-outs, packet drop, and broadcast operations -- primitives\nalready implemented in packet-switching and packet-routing hardware. We show\nthat existing buffering and traffic-shaping embedded algorithms can be\nleveraged to implement neuron models and synaptic operations. Additionally, a\nknowledge-distillation framework can train and cross-map well-established\nneural network topologies onto $\\pi^2$ without degrading generalization\nperformance. For (b), analytical modeling shows that, unlike other neuromorphic\nplatforms, the energy scaling of $\\pi^2$ improves with interconnect bandwidth\nand energy efficiency.

However, recent studies have shown that GCN-based\nmodels will cause sensitive information to disseminate widely in the graph\nstructure, amplifying data bias and raising fairness concerns. While various\nfairness methods have been proposed, most of them neglect the impact of biased\ndata on representation learning, which results in limited fairness improvement.\nMoreover, some studies have focused on constructing fair and balanced data\ndistributions through data augmentation, but these methods significantly reduce\nutility due to disruption of user preferences. In this paper, we aim to design\na fair recommendation method from the perspective of data augmentation to\nimprove fairness while preserving recommendation utility. To achieve\nfairness-aware data augmentation with minimal disruption to user preferences,\nwe propose two prior hypotheses. The first hypothesis identifies sensitive\ninteractions by comparing outcomes of performance-oriented and fairness-aware\nrecommendations, while the second one focuses on detecting sensitive features\nby analyzing feature similarities between biased and debiased representations.\nThen, we propose a dual data augmentation framework for fair recommendation,\nwhich includes two data augmentation strategies to generate fair augmented\ngraphs and feature representations. Furthermore, we introduce a debiasing\nlearning method that minimizes the dependence between the learned\nrepresentations and sensitive information to eliminate bias.

Distinguishing between central concentration and dynamically\nunsettled gas as the origin of high $K$ can be achieved by measuring the\nspectral asymmetry ($A_{\\rm F}$), making the $K$-$A_{\\rm F}$ plane a powerful\ndiagnostic tool for identifying galaxies with unsettled HI using integrated\nspectra alone.

Here, we find that an attractive interaction in the charge\nchannel emerges from the Aslamazov-Larkin vertex corrections that describe the\ninterference processes among spin fluctuations. Applying this method to the\nsquare-lattice Hubbard model, we reveal that the cooperation of attractive\ncharge fluctuations and repulsive spin fluctuations yields high-$T_c$ $d$-wave\nsuperconductivity together with enhanced effective mass. These results\nnaturally explain the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors, where\nstrong-coupling $d$-wave superconductivity appears near the charge-order\nquantum critical point. The theory can also be applied to multi-orbital Hubbard\nmodels, like iron-based and nickelate superconductors, suggesting broad\npotential for future applications.",

    "abstract": "Incomplete time series data present significant challenges to accurate\nstatistical analysis, particularly when the underlying data exhibit periodic\nstructures such as seasonal or monthly trends. Traditional imputation methods\noften fail to preserve these temporal dynamics, leading to biased estimates and\nreduced analytical integrity. In this study, we introduce and evaluate a\nstructure-preserving imputation framework that incorporates significant\nperiodic components into the multiple imputation process via the Variable\nBandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VBPBB). We simulate time series data\ncontaining annual and monthly periodicities and introduce varying levels of\nnoise representing low, moderate, and high signal-to-noise scenarios to mimic\nreal world variability. Missing data are introduced under Missing Completely at\nRandom (MCAR) mechanisms across a range of missingness proportions (5% - 70%).\nVBPBB is used to extract dominant periodic components at multiple frequencies,\nwhich are then bootstrapped and included as covariates in the Amelia II\nmultiple imputation model. The performance of this periodicity-enhanced\napproach is compared against standard imputation methods that do not\nincorporate temporal structure. Our results demonstrate that the VBPBB-enhanced\nimputation framework consistently outperforms conventional approaches across\nall tested conditions, with the greatest performance gains observed in\nhigh-noise settings and when multiple periodic components are retained. This\nstudy addresses critical limitations in existing imputation techniques by\noffering a flexible, periodicity-aware solution that preserves temporal\nstructure in incomplete time series. We further explore the methodological\nimplications of incorporating frequency-based components and discuss future\ndirections for advancing robust imputation in temporally correlated data\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Quad-level cell (QLC) flash offers significant benefits in cost and capacity,\nbut its limited reliability leads to frequent read retries, which severely\ndegrade read performance. A common strategy in high-density flash storage is to\nprogram selected blocks in a low-density mode (SLC), sacrificing some capacity\nto achieve higher I/O performance. This hybrid storage architecture has been\nwidely adopted in consumer-grade storage systems. However, existing hybrid\nstorage schemes typically focus on write performance and rely solely on data\ntemperature for migration decisions. This often results in excessive mode\nswitching, causing substantial capacity overhead.\n  In this paper, we present RARO (Reliability-Aware Read performance\nOptimization), a hybrid flash management scheme designed to improve read\nperformance with minimal capacity cost. The key insight behind RARO is that\nmuch of the read slowdown in QLC flash is caused by read retries. RARO triggers\ndata migration only when hot data resides in QLC blocks experiencing a high\nnumber of read retries, significantly reducing unnecessary conversions and\ncapacity loss. Moreover, RARO supports fine-grained multi-mode conversions\n(SLC-TLC-QLC) to further minimize capacity overhead. By leveraging real-time\nread retry statistics and flash characteristics, RARO mitigates over-conversion\nand optimizes I/O performance. Experiments on the FEMU platform demonstrate\nthat RARO significantly improves read performance across diverse workloads,\nwith negligible impact on usable capacity.",

To address above issues, this paper\nproposes a novel scheme to design arrays with increased DOFs by combining\ndifferent forms of FODCA while accounting for mutual coupling. A novel\nfourth-order hierarchical array (FOHA) based on different forms of FODCA is\nconstructed using an arbitrary generator set. The analytical expression between\nthe coupling leakage of the generator and the resulting FOHA is derived. Two\nspecific FOHA configurations are presented with closed-form sensor placements.\nThe arrays not only offer increased DOFs for resolving more sources in\ndirection of-arrival (DOA) estimation but also effectively suppress mutual\ncoupling. Moreover, the redundancy of FODCA is examined, and it is shown that\narrays based on the proposed scheme achieve lower redundancy compared to\nexisting arrays based on FODCA. Meanwhile, the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for signal reconstruction by FOHA are derived. Compared with\nexisting arrays based on FODCA, the proposed arrays provide enhanced DOFs and\nimproved robustness against mutual coupling. Numerical simulations verify that\nFOHAs achieve superior DOA estimation performance compared with other sparse\nlinear arrays.",

In this study, we generate Laguerre-Gaussian beams of differing\n$l$ through mode conversion using microscopic spiral phase plates (SPPs).

While many recommender systems primarily rely on a\nuser's purchase history, recent multi-behavior recommender systems incorporate\nvarious auxiliary user behaviors, such as item clicks and cart additions, to\nenhance recommendations. Despite their overall performance gains, their\neffectiveness varies considerably between visited items (i.e., those a user has\ninteracted with through auxiliary behaviors) and unvisited items (i.e., those\nwith which the user has had no such interactions).

In this study, we divide a reasoning trajectory into individual\nsubtrajectories and develop a \"5+2\" framework to: (1) systematically identify\nsuboptimal subtrajectories within the reasoning trajectory based on five\nhuman-established criteria; (2) assess the independence of the suboptimal\nsubtrajectories identified in (1) from the subsequent content, ensuring that\ntheir elimination does not compromise overall flow and coherence of the\nreasoning process. Additionally, a sampling algorithm, built upon the \"5+2\"\nframework, is employed to select data whose reasoning process is free from\nsuboptimal subtrajectories to the highest degree. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method can reduce the number of suboptimal subtrajectories\nby 25.9\\% during the inference.

Although widely accepted, this framework raises fundamental\nissues in one-dimensional systems, where Bragg diffraction-which requires\nmultidirectional wave interactions-reduces to simple interference, thus failing\nto explain band gap formation. In this paper, we introduce an alternative\ntheory that does not rely on Bragg reflection. Using the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation for Bloch waves, we consider the crystal lattice as a discrete set of\nobservation points. This discreteness introduces a sampling-like constraint\nanalogous to the Nyquist frequency in signal processing. We show that when the\nelectron wavenumber changes under a periodic potential while the lattice\nspacing remains fixed, a band gap naturally emerges as a sampling effect. By\nconstructing an energy diagram that incorporates this effect, we reveal that\nthe band gap originates from both the wavenumber change and the role of the\nlattice as discrete samplers, leading the energy curve to exhibit translational\nand mirror symmetries with respect to the Nyquist wavenumber. This approach\nprovides a novel, physically grounded explanation of band gap formation and can\nbe naturally extended to higher dimensions.",

Unlike traditional AI, GenAI learns data distributions and can\ngenerate realistic samples, making it well suited to close key AmI gaps,\nincluding generating synthetic sensor and channel data in under observed areas,\ntranslating user intent into compact, semantic messages, predicting future\nnetwork conditions for proactive control, and updating digital twins without\ncompromising privacy.\n  This chapter reviews foundational GenAI models, GANs, VAEs, diffusion models,\nand generative transformers, and connects them to practical AmI use cases,\nincluding spectrum sharing, ultra reliable low latency communication,\nintelligent security, and context aware digital twins. We also examine how 6G\nenablers, such as edge and fog computing, IoT device swarms, intelligent\nreflecting surfaces (IRS), and non terrestrial networks, can host or accelerate\ndistributed GenAI. Finally, we outline open challenges in energy efficient on\ndevice training, trustworthy synthetic data, federated generative learning, and\nAmI specific standardization. We show that GenAI is not a peripheral addition,\nbut a foundational element for transforming 6G from a faster network into an\nambient intelligent ecosystem.",

However, close companions to known active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) or quasars (QSOs) can also be multiple images of the object\nitself, strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy, as well as foreground stars in\na chance superposition. Thanks to its large sky coverage, sensitivity, and high\nspatial resolution, Euclid offers a unique opportunity to obtain a large,\nhomogeneous sample of dual/lensed AGN candidates with sub-arcsec projected\nseparations. Here we present a machine learning approach, in particular a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify close companions to known QSOs\ndown to separations of $\\sim\\,$0\".15 comparable to the Euclid VIS point spread\nfunction (PSF). We studied the effectiveness of the CNN in identifying dual AGN\nand demonstrated that it outperforms traditional techniques. Applying our CNN\nto a sample of $\\sim\\,$6000 QSOs from the Q1 Euclid data release, we find a\nfraction of about 0.25% dual AGN candidates with separation $\\sim\\,$0\".4\n(corresponding to $\\sim$3 kpc at z=1). Estimating the foreground contamination\nfrom stellar objects, we find that most of the pair candidates with separation\nhigher than 0\".5 are likely contaminants, while below this limit, contamination\nis expected to be less than 20%. For objects at higher separation (>0\".5, i.e.\n4 kpc at z=1), we performed PSF subtraction and used colour-colour diagrams to\nconstrain their nature. We present a first set of dual/lensed AGN candidates\ndetected in the Q1 Euclid data, providing a starting point for the analysis of\nfuture data releases.",

Overall, closed-source agents\nshow better privacy ability than open-source ones, and Gemini 2.0-flash\nachieves the best, achieving an RA of 67%. We also find that the agents'\nprivacy detection capability is highly related to scenario sensitivity level,\ni.e., the scenario with a higher sensitivity level is typically more\nidentifiable.

This study investigates\ngeopolitical parallax-systematic divergence in news quality and subjectivity\nassessments-by comparing article-level embeddings from Chinese-origin (Qwen,\nBGE, Jina) and Western-origin (Snowflake, Granite) model families. We evaluate\nboth on a human-annotated news quality benchmark spanning fifteen stylistic,\ninformational, and affective dimensions, and on parallel corpora covering\npolitically sensitive topics, including Palestine and reciprocal China-United\nStates coverage. Using logistic regression probes and matched-topic evaluation,\nwe quantify per-metric differences in predicted positive-class probabilities\nbetween model families. Our findings reveal consistent, non-random divergences\naligned with model origin. In Palestine-related coverage, Western models assign\nhigher subjectivity and positive emotion scores, while Chinese models emphasize\nnovelty and descriptiveness. Cross-topic analysis shows asymmetries in\nstructural quality metrics Chinese-on-US scoring notably lower in fluency,\nconciseness, technicality, and overall quality-contrasted by higher negative\nemotion scores. These patterns align with media bias theory and our distinction\nbetween semantic, emotional, and relational subjectivity, and extend LLM bias\nliterature by showing that geopolitical framing effects persist in downstream\nquality assessment tasks. We conclude that LLM-based media evaluation pipelines\nrequire cultural calibration to avoid conflating content differences with\nmodel-induced bias.",

To address these challenges, we introduce MicroLad, a latent diffusion\nframework specifically designed for reconstructing 3D microstructures from 2D\ndata. Trained on 2D images and employing multi-plane denoising diffusion\nsampling in the latent space, the framework reliably generates stable and\ncoherent 3D volumes that remain statistically consistent with the original\ndata. While this reconstruction capability enables dimensionality expansion\n(2D-to-3D) for generating statistically equivalent 3D samples from 2D data,\neffective exploration of microstructure design requires methods to guide the\ngeneration process toward specific objectives. To achieve this, MicroLad\nintegrates score distillation sampling (SDS), which combines a differentiable\nscore loss with microstructural descriptor-matching and property-alignment\nterms. This approach updates encoded 2D slices of the 3D volume in the latent\nspace, enabling robust inverse-controlled 2D-to-3D microstructure generation.\nConsequently, the method facilitates exploration of an expanded 3D\nmicrostructure analysis and design space in terms of both microstructural\ndescriptors and material properties.",

However, the existing\nFlipIt frameworks rely on a small number of heuristics or specialized learning\ntechniques, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new\nattacks. To address these limitations, we introduce PoolFlip, a multi-agent gym\nenvironment that extends the FlipIt game to allow efficient learning for\nattackers and defenders. Furthermore, we propose Flip-PSRO, a multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages population-based training\nto train defender agents equipped to generalize against a range of unknown,\npotentially adaptive opponents. Our empirical results suggest that Flip-PSRO\ndefenders are $2\\times$ more effective than baselines to generalize to a\nheuristic attack not exposed in training.

    "abstract": "Tabular learning transforms raw features into optimized spaces for downstream\ntasks, but its effectiveness deteriorates under distribution shifts between\ntraining and testing data. We formalize this challenge as the Distribution\nShift Tabular Learning (DSTL) problem and propose a novel Shift-Aware Feature\nTransformation (SAFT) framework to address it. SAFT reframes tabular learning\nfrom a discrete search task into a continuous representation-generation\nparadigm, enabling differentiable optimization over transformed feature sets.\nSAFT integrates three mechanisms to ensure robustness: (i) shift-resistant\nrepresentation via embedding decorrelation and sample reweighting, (ii)\nflatness-aware generation through suboptimal embedding averaging, and (iii)\nnormalization-based alignment between training and test distributions.\nExtensive experiments show that SAFT consistently outperforms prior tabular\nlearning methods in terms of robustness, effectiveness, and generalization\nability under diverse real-world distribution shifts.",

    "abstract": "Gas leaks pose serious threats to human health and contribute significantly\nto atmospheric pollution, drawing increasing public concern. However, the lack\nof effective detection methods hampers timely and accurate identification of\ngas leaks. While some vision-based techniques leverage infrared videos for leak\ndetection, the blurry and non-rigid nature of gas clouds often limits their\neffectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called\nJoint Vision-Language Gas leak Segmentation (JVLGS), which integrates the\ncomplementary strengths of visual and textual modalities to enhance gas leak\nrepresentation and segmentation. Recognizing that gas leaks are sporadic and\nmany video frames may contain no leak at all, our method incorporates a\npost-processing step to reduce false positives caused by noise and non-target\nobjects, an issue that affects many existing approaches. Extensive experiments\nconducted across diverse scenarios show that JVLGS significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art gas leak segmentation methods. We evaluate our model under\nboth supervised and few-shot learning settings, and it consistently achieves\nstrong performance in both, whereas competing methods tend to perform well in\nonly one setting or poorly in both.

    "abstract": "Artificial chemistry simulations produce many intriguing emergent behaviors,\nbut they are often difficult to steer or control. This paper proposes a method\nfor steering the dynamics of a classic artificial chemistry model, known as\nAlChemy (Algorithmic Chemistry), which is based on untyped lambda calculus. Our\napproach leverages features that are endogenous to AlChemy without constructing\nan explicit external fitness function or building learning into the dynamics.\nWe demonstrate the approach by synthesizing non-trivial lambda functions, such\nas Church addition and succession, from simple primitives. The results provide\ninsight into the possibility of endogenous selection in diverse systems such as\nautocatalytic chemical networks and software systems.",

In this\npaper, we investigate how well LLMs understand and reason about complex rule\ninteractions in dynamic environments, such as card games. We introduce a\ndataset of card synergies from the game Slay the Spire, where pairs of cards\nare classified based on their positive, negative, or neutral interactions. Our\nevaluation shows that while LLMs excel at identifying non-synergistic pairs,\nthey struggle with detecting positive and, particularly, negative synergies. We\ncategorize common error types, including issues with timing, defining game\nstates, and following game rules. Our findings suggest directions for future\nresearch to improve model performance in predicting the effect of rules and\ntheir interactions.",
