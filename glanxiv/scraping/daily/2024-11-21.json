    "abstract": "In this paper, we developed a novel method of nonparametric relative entropy\n(RlEn) for modelling loss of complexity in intermittent time series. The method\nconsists of two steps. We first fit a nonlinear autoregressive model to each\nintermittent time series, where the corresponding lag order and the loss of\ncomplexity are determined by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and relative\nentropy respectively. Then, change-points in the complexity are detected by a\ncumulative sum (CUSUM) based statistic. Compared to approximate entropy (ApEn),\na popular method in literature, the performance of RlEn was assessed by\nsimulations in terms of (1) ability to localize complexity change-points in\nintermittent time series; (2) ability to faithfully estimate underlying\nnonlinear models. The performance of the proposal was then examined in a real\nanalysis of fatigue-induced changes in the complexity of human motor outputs.\nThe results showed that the proposed method outperformed the ApEn in accurately\ndetecting changes of complexity in intermittent time series segments.",

Despite the widespread use of representational\ncomparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical\nquestion remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While\nsome studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of\ndifferent origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another\napproach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct\nbehaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between\nvarious representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing\ngroup statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for\ncomparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational\nsimilarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical\nCorrelation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and\nnearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel\nAlignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric\nstructure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from\nuntrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as\nlinear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate\nalignment with behavior.

Comparing these maps of\nsyntactically related tokens provides insights into how well the generated\nimage reflects the text prompt. For example, in the prompt, \"a black car and a\nwhite clock\", the cross-attention maps for \"black\" and \"car\" should focus on\noverlapping regions to depict a black car, while \"car\" and \"clock\" should not.\nIncorrect overlapping in the maps generally produces generation flaws such as\nmissing objects and incorrect attribute binding. Our study makes the key\nobservations investigating this issue in the existing text-to-image models:(1)\nthe similarity in text embeddings between different tokens -- used as\nconditioning inputs -- can cause their cross-attention maps to focus on the\nsame image regions; and (2) text embeddings often fail to faithfully capture\nsyntactic relations already within text attention maps. As a result, such\nsyntactic relationships can be overlooked in cross-attention module, leading to\ninaccurate image generation. To address this, we propose a method that directly\ntransfers syntactic relations from the text attention maps to the\ncross-attention module via a test-time optimization. Our approach leverages\nthis inherent yet unexploited information within text attention maps to enhance\nimage-text semantic alignment across diverse prompts, without relying on\nexternal guidance.",

In this process,\nsurgeons first irrigate liquid, typically saline, into the surgical scene for\nrinsing and diluting the contaminant, and then suction the liquid out of the\nsurgical field. While recent advances have shown promising results in the\napplication of reinforcement learning (RL) for automating surgical subtasks,\nfewer studies have explored the automation of fluid-related tasks. In this\nwork, we explore the automation of both steps in the irrigation-suction\nprocedure and train two vision-based RL agents to complete irrigation and\nsuction autonomously. To achieve this, a platform is developed for creating\nsimulated surgical robot learning environments and for training agents, and two\nsimulated learning environments are built for irrigation and suction with\nvisually plausible fluid rendering capabilities. With techniques such as domain\nrandomization (DR) and carefully designed reward functions, two agents are\ntrained in the simulator and transferred to the real world. Individual\nevaluations of both agents show satisfactory real-world results. With an\ninitial amount of around 5 grams of contaminants, the irrigation agent\nultimately achieved an average of 2.21 grams remaining after a manual suction.\nAs a comparison, fully manual operation by a human results in 1.90 grams\nremaining.

Fully autonomous irrigation-suction trials reduce the contaminant in\nthe container from around 5 grams to an average of 2.42 grams, although\nyielding a higher total weight remaining (4.40) due to residual liquid not\nsuctioned.

    "abstract": "While mass transfer in binary systems is a crucial aspect of binary evolution\nmodels, it remains far from understood. HD 352 is a spectroscopic binary\nexhibiting ellipsoidal variability, likely due to a tidally deformed giant\ndonor filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to a faint companion.\nHere, we analyse VLTI/PIONIER interferometric observations of the system,\nobtained between 2010 to 2020. We demonstrate that observations near the\nsystem's quadrature cannot be explained by simple symmetric disk models, but\nare consistent with the shape of a Roche-lobe-filling star. We think that this\nis the first case of tidal deformation of a red giant being observed directly,\nthanks to the interferometric technique. By combining our interferometric\nmodeling results with the analysis of the optical spectrum, multi-frequency\nspectral energy distribution, and published radial velocities and light curves,\nwe constrain the system parameters and show that HD 352 will likely soon enter\nthe common envelope phase, although we cannot reject the hypothesis that it is\nundergoing stable mass transfer against theoretical predictions. This has\nimportant consequences for modeling a large class of binary systems.\nAdditionally, our observations confirm that Roche-lobe-filling giants can be\nresolved with interferometry under favorable conditions. Such observations may\nhelp resolve the mass transfer dichotomy in systems like symbiotic binaries,\nwhere the predominant mass transfer mode remains unclear.",

That may not always be possible. Similar data assimilation\nproblems, involving other dissipative systems, are of considerable interest in\nthe geophysical sciences, and are commonly solved using computationally\nintensive methods based on neural networks informed by machine learning.\nSuccessful solution of ill-posed time-reversed Navier-Stokes equations is\nlimited by uncertainty estimates, based on logarithmic convexity, that place\nlimits on the value of $T > 0$. In computational experiments involving\nsatellite images of hurricanes and other meteorological phenomena, the present\nmethod is shown to produce successful solutions at values of $T > 0$, that are\nseveral orders of magnitude larger than would be expected, based on the\nbest-known uncertainty estimates. However, unsuccessful examples are also\ngiven.

    "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) - the ability to progressively acquire and integrate\nnew concepts - is essential to intelligent systems to adapt to dynamic\nenvironments. However, deep neural networks struggle with catastrophic\nforgetting (CF) when learning tasks sequentially, as training for new tasks\noften overwrites previously learned knowledge. To address this, recent\napproaches constrain updates to orthogonal subspaces using gradient projection,\neffectively preserving important gradient directions for previous tasks. While\neffective in reducing forgetting, these approaches inadvertently hinder forward\nknowledge transfer (FWT), particularly when tasks are highly correlated. In\nthis work, we propose Conceptor-based gradient projection for Deep Continual\nLearning (CODE-CL), a novel method that leverages conceptor matrix\nrepresentations, a form of regularized reconstruction, to adaptively handle\nhighly correlated tasks. CODE-CL mitigates CF by projecting gradients onto\npseudo-orthogonal subspaces of previous task feature spaces while\nsimultaneously promoting FWT. It achieves this by learning a linear combination\nof shared basis directions, allowing efficient balance between stability and\nplasticity and transfer of knowledge between overlapping input feature\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks\nvalidate CODE-CL's efficacy, demonstrating superior performance, reduced\nforgetting, and improved FWT as compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "abstract": "Wall-based active and passive flow control for drag reduction in low Reynolds\nnumber (Re) turbulent flows can lead to three typical phenomena: i) attenuation\nor ii) amplification of the near-wall cycle, and iii) generation of spanwise\nrollers. The present study conducts direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a low\nRe turbulent channel flow and demonstrates that each flow response can be\ngenerated with a wall transpiration at two sets of spatial scales, termed\n\"streak\" and \"roller\" scales. The effect of the transpiration is controlled by\nits relative phase to the background flow, which can be parametrized by the\nwall pressure. Streak scales i) attenuate the near-wall cycle if transpiration\nand wall-pressure are approximately in-phase or ii) amplify it otherwise, and\niii) roller scales energize spanwise rollers when transpiration and wall\npressure are out-of-phase. The dynamics of the wall pressure and transpiration\nare coupled and robust relative phase relations, which are required to trigger\nthe flow responses, can result if the source term of the linear fast or\nnonlinear slow pressure correlates with the wall transpiration over a\nscale-dependent height or if the temporal frequency content of the wall\ntranspiration is approximately sparse. The importance of each condition depends\non the relative magnitude of the pressure components, which is significantly\naltered by the transpiration. The analogy in flow response suggests that\ntranspiration with the two scale families and their phase relations to the wall\npressure represent fundamental building blocks for flows over tailored surfaces\nincluding riblets, porous, and permeable walls.",

Using our soliton-halo model, we investigate\nthe properties of soliton cores found in cosmological simulation, and the key\nparameters characterizing these solitons are reconstructed in a self-consistent\nmanner. Results suggest that (1) the soliton core properties depend critically\non both the self-gravity of the soliton and the external potential of the host\nhalo, and (2) the scatter observed in the core-halo relation cannot be\nexplained solely by the one in the halo's concentration-mass relation, as\npreviously suggested, but also significantly influenced by intrinsic features\nof the soliton core, potentially arising from local dynamics at the halo\ncenter.

In recent years, pre-trained\ntransformer-based models, inspired by natural language processing (NLP), have\nshown remarkable success in SE tasks.

    "abstract": "On May 24th, 2023, the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave\nObservatory (LIGO), joined by the Advanced Virgo and KAGRA detectors, began the\nfourth observing run for a two-year-long dedicated search for gravitational\nwaves. The LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors have achieved an unprecedented\nsensitivity to gravitational waves, with an angle-averaged median range to\nbinary neutron star mergers of 152 Mpc and 160 Mpc, and duty cycles of 65.0%\nand 71.2%, respectively, with a coincident duty cycle of 52.6%. The maximum\nrange achieved by the LIGO Hanford detector is 165 Mpc and the LIGO Livingston\ndetector 177 Mpc, both achieved during the second part of the fourth observing\nrun. For the fourth run, the quantum-limited sensitivity of the detectors was\nincreased significantly due to the higher intracavity power from laser system\nupgrades and replacement of core optics, and from the addition of a 300 m\nfilter cavity to provide the squeezed light with a frequency-dependent\nsqueezing angle, part of the A+ upgrade program. Altogether, the A+ upgrades\nled to reduced detector-wide losses for the squeezed vacuum states of light\nwhich, alongside the filter cavity, enabled broadband quantum noise reduction\nof up to 5.2 dB at the Hanford observatory and 6.1 dB at the Livingston\nobservatory. Improvements to sensors and actuators as well as significant\ncontrols commissioning increased low frequency sensitivity. This paper details\nthese instrumental upgrades, analyzes the noise sources that limit detector\nsensitivity, and describes the commissioning challenges of the fourth observing\nrun.",

A rich and rigorous body\nof work has cemented flour beetles' place in the field of mathematical biology.\nOne of the most interesting results using flour beetles is the induction of\nchaos in a laboratory beetle population, in which the well-established LPA\n(larvae-pupae-adult) model was used to inform the experimental factors which\nwould lead to chaos. However, whether chaos is an intrinsic property of flour\nbeetles remains an open question. Inspired by new experimental data, we extend\nthe LPA model by stratifying the adult population into newly emerged and mature\nadults and considering cannibalism as a function of mature adults. We fit the\nmodel to longitudinal data of larvae, pupae, and adult beetle populations to\ndemonstrate the model's ability to recapitulate the transient dynamics of flour\nbeetles. We present local and global stability results for the trivial and\npositive steady states and explore bifurcations and limit cycles numerically.\nOur results suggest that while chaos is a possibility, it is a rare phenomenon\nwithin realistic ranges of the parameters obtained from our experiment, and is\nlikely induced by environmental changes connected to media changes and\npopulation censusing.",

In the\nhighly specific case where each of the functions $f(x)$ and $g(y)$ is either\naffine or strongly convex, there exist lower bounds on the number of gradient\nevaluations and matrix-vector multiplications required to solve the problem, as\nwell as matching optimal algorithms. A notable aspect of these algorithms is\nthat they are able to attain linear convergence, i.e., the number of iterations\nrequired to solve the problem is proportional to $\\log(1/\\epsilon)$. However,\nthe class of bilinearly-coupled saddle-point problems for which linear\nconvergence is possible is much wider and can involve smooth non-strongly\nconvex functions $f(x)$ and $g(y)$. Therefore, we develop the first lower\ncomplexity bounds and matching optimal linearly converging algorithms for this\nproblem class. Our lower complexity bounds are much more general, but they\ncover and unify the existing results in the literature. On the other hand, our\nalgorithm implements the separation of complexities, which, for the first time,\nenables the simultaneous achievement of both optimal gradient evaluation and\nmatrix-vector multiplication complexities, resulting in the best theoretical\nperformance to date.",

Here we use the exact solution of a\nmicroscopic system coupled to baths to gauge the validity of the Lindblad\ndynamics during a finite time evolution, and show that for a pure decay system,\nLindbladian dynamics generally only holds in the weak and singular coupling\nlimits. We also prove that Lindblad and non-Hermitian dynamics are equivalent\nin the highest particle subspace of such systems with pure decay. Using this\nequivalence, we rule out the possibility of obtaining non-Hermitian dynamics\nfor any other couplings. Furthermore, we argue that exceptional points of the\neffective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian can only occur in the singular coupling\nlimit, never in the weak coupling limit. Physically, this means that\nexceptional points can occur when the intrinsic time evolution of the isolated\nsystem is comparable to the relaxation time scale.",

These techniques are commonly seen in nature, such as\nChukar birds using their wings to run on a nearly vertical wall. In this work,\nwe developed a capture-point-based controller integrated with a quadratic\nprogramming (QP) solver which is used to create a thruster-assisted dynamic\nbipedal walking controller for our state-of-the-art Harpy platform. Harpy is a\nbipedal robot capable of legged-aerial locomotion using its legs and thrusters\nattached to its main frame. While capture point control based on centroidal\nmodels for bipedal systems has been extensively studied, the use of these\nthrusters in determining the capture point for a bipedal robot has not been\nextensively explored. The addition of these external thrust forces can lead to\ninteresting interpretations of locomotion, such as virtual buoyancy studied in\naquatic-legged locomotion. In this work, we derive a thruster-assisted bipedal\nwalking with the capture point controller and implement it in simulation to\nstudy its performance.",

For that to happen, functions such as fully autonomous\nhighway ramp entry must be available, and provide provably safe, and reliably\nrobust behavior to enable full autonomy. We present a systematic study of a\nhighway ramp function that controls the vehicles forward-moving actions to\nminimize collisions with the stream of highway traffic into which a merging\n(ego) vehicle enters. We take a game-theoretic multi-agent (MA) approach to\nthis problem and study the use of controllers based on deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL). The virtual environment of the MA DRL uses self-play with\nsimulated data where merging vehicles safely learn to control longitudinal\nposition during a taper-type merge. The work presented in this paper extends\nexisting work by studying the interaction of more than two vehicles (agents)\nand does so by systematically expanding the road scene with additional traffic\nand ego vehicles. While previous work on the two-vehicle setting established\nthat collision-free controllers are theoretically impossible in fully\ndecentralized, non-coordinated environments, we empirically show that\ncontrollers learned using our approach are nearly ideal when measured against\nidealized optimal controllers.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning\narchitectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of\nthree-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object\nclassification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed\nspatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that\naccounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to\nspatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges,\nincluding real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To\naddress these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines\nPointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and\nenergy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal\nrecognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first\nstage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are\nthen stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage,\nthese features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder\nthat employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and\nclassification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA,\nenhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices.\nPointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with\nsubstantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than\ncomparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural\narchitectures in energy-constrained environments.",

We then provide a step-by-step protocol designed to recover\nconnected two-point functions of the quantum trajectories, which display an\nexponentially decaying profile that is not observable in the unconditional,\ntrajectory averaged, state. With the analytical solution in hand, we analyse\nthe features of this postprocessing stage with the intention of abstracting\naway the properties that make postselection feasible in this model and may help\nin mitigating postselection in more general settings. We also test the protocol\nnumerically in a way that utilizes only experimentally accessible information,\nshowing that various quantum trajectory observables can be recovered with a few\nrepetitions of the numerical experiment, even after including inevitable\ncoarse-graining procedures expected under realistic experimental conditions.\nFurthermore, all the information required to design the postprocessing stage is\nindependently present both in the unconditional dynamics and also in the\nmeasurement record, thus bypassing the need to solve for the conditional\nevolution of the model.

However, much of the prior research\nhas not focused specifically on authentic human-machine dialogue scenarios. It\nalso ignores the important balance between response quality and computational\ncost by forcing all queries to follow the same agent process. To address these\ngaps, we propose a Strategy-Router Search Agent (SRSA), routing different\nqueries to appropriate search strategies and enabling fine-grained serial\nsearches to obtain high-quality results at a relatively low cost. To evaluate\nour work, we introduce a new dataset, Contextual Query Enhancement Dataset\n(CQED), comprising contextual queries to simulate authentic and daily\ninteractions between humans and chatbots. Using LLM-based automatic evaluation\nmetrics, we assessed SRSA's performance in terms of informativeness,\ncompleteness, novelty, and actionability. To conclude, SRSA provides an\napproach that resolves the issue of simple serial searches leading to\ndegenerate answers for lengthy and contextual queries, effectively and\nefficiently parses complex user queries, and generates more comprehensive and\ninformative responses without fine-tuning an LLM.",

This highlights the importance of\npurifying distributed Bell states before performing entanglement swapping. In\nthis work, we introduce an entanglement purification protocol assisted by\ntwo-way classical communication that not only purifies the states but also\nachieves the channel capacities.

We model this interactive motion planning as a generalized\nNash equilibrium problem and formalize how vehicle-to-vehicle intention sharing\nenables solution of the game between multiple CAVs as an optimal control\nproblem for each agent, to arrive at a generalized Nash equilibrium. The method\nis implemented via model predictive control (MPC) and compared with an advanced\nbaseline MPC which utilizes unilateral predictions of other agents' future\nstates. A ROS-based in-the-loop testbed is developed: the method is first\nevaluated in software-in-the-loop and then vehicle-in-the-loop experiments are\nconducted. Experimental results demonstrate energy and travel time benefits of\nthe presented method in interactive lane change maneuvers.",

The lack of transparency and\ninterpretability in video transmission and usage raises public concerns about\nprivacy and ethics, limiting the real-world application of VAD. Recently,\nresearchers have focused on privacy concerns in VAD by conducting systematic\nstudies from various perspectives including data, features, and systems, making\nPrivacy-Preserving Video Anomaly Detection (P2VAD) a hotspot in the AI\ncommunity. However, current research in P2VAD is fragmented, and prior reviews\nhave mostly focused on methods using RGB sequences, overlooking privacy leakage\nand appearance bias considerations. To address this gap, this article is the\nfirst to systematically reviews the progress of P2VAD, defining its scope and\nproviding an intuitive taxonomy. We outline the basic assumptions, learning\nframeworks, and optimization objectives of various approaches, analyzing their\nstrengths, weaknesses, and potential correlations.

Recent\nadvancements in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, offer\npromising alternatives for accelerating these predictions. This study explores\nthe use of a deep operator network (DeepONet), a type of neural operator, as a\nsurrogate model for finite element simulations, aimed at predicting post-burn\ncontraction across multiple wound shapes. A DeepONet was trained on three\ndistinct initial wound shapes, with enhancement made to the architecture by\nincorporating initial wound shape information and applying sine augmentation to\nenforce boundary conditions. The performance of the trained DeepONet was\nevaluated on a test set including finite element simulations based on convex\ncombinations of the three basic wound shapes. The model achieved an $R^2$ score\nof $0.99$, indicating strong predictive accuracy and generalization. Moreover,\nthe model provided reliable predictions over an extended period of up to one\nyear, with speedups of up to 128-fold on CPU and 235-fold on GPU, compared to\nthe numerical model.

Our paper proposes Swift, a novel scale-up graph accelerator\nframework that processes large graphs by leveraging the flexibility of FPGA\ncustom datapath and memory resources, and optimizes utilization of\nhigh-bandwidth 3D memory (HBM). Swift supports up to 8 FPGAs in a node. Swift\nintroduces a decoupled, asynchronous model based on the Gather-Apply-Scatter\n(GAS) scheme. It subgraphs across FPGAs, and each subgraph into intervals based\non source vertex IDs. Processing on these intervals is decoupled and executed\nasynchronously, instead of bulk-synchonous operation, where throughput is\nlimited by the slowest task. This enables simultaneous processing within each\nmulti-FPGA node and optimizes the utilization of communication (PCIe), off-chip\n(HBM), and on-chip BRAM/URAM resources. Swift demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements compared to prior scalable FPGA-based frameworks,\nperforming 12.8 times better than the ForeGraph. Performance against Gunrock on\nNVIDIA A40 GPUs is mixed, because NVlink gives the GPU system a nearly 5X\nbandwidth advantage, but the FPGA system nevertheless achieves 2.6x greater\nenergy efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Many NP-hard graph problems become easy for some classes of graphs. For\nexample, coloring is easy for bipartite graphs, but NP-hard in general. So we\ncan ask question like when does a hard problem become easy? What is the minimum\nsubstructure for which the problem remains hard? We use the notion of boundary\nclasses to study such questions. In this paper, we introduce a method for\ntransforming the boundary class of one NP-hard graph problem into a boundary\nclass for another problem. If {\\Pi} and {\\Gamma} are two NP-hard graph problems\nwhere {\\Pi} is reducible to {\\Gamma}, we transform a boundary class of {\\Pi}\ninto a boundary class of {\\Gamma}. More formally if {\\Pi} is reducible to\n{\\Gamma}, where the reduction satisfies certain conditions, then X is a\nboundary class of {\\Pi} if and only if the image of X under the reduction is a\nboundary class of {\\Gamma}. This gives us a relationship between boundary\nclasses and reducibility among several NP-hard problems. To show the strength\nof our main result, we apply our theorem to obtain some previously unknown\nboundary classes for a few graph problems namely; vertex-cover, clique,\ntraveling-salesperson, bounded-degree-spanning-tree, subgraph-isomorphism and\nclique-cover.",

However, accurate recovery of the 3D true heart wall motion from a\nset of 2D apparent motion cues is challenging, due to incomplete sampling of\nthe true motion and difficulty in information fusion from apparent motion cues\nobserved on multiple imaging planes. To solve these challenges, we introduce a\nnovel class of volumetric neural deformable models ($\\upsilon$NDMs). Our\n$\\upsilon$NDMs represent heart wall geometry and motion through a set of\nlow-dimensional global deformation parameter functions and a diffeomorphic\npoint flow regularized local deformation field. To learn such global and local\ndeformation for 2D apparent motion mapping to 3D true motion, we design a\nhybrid point transformer, which incorporates both point cross-attention and\nself-attention mechanisms. While use of point cross-attention can learn to fuse\n2D apparent motion cues into material point true motion hints, point\nself-attention hierarchically organised as an encoder-decoder structure can\nfurther learn to refine these hints and map them into 3D true motion. We have\nperformed experiments on a large cohort of synthetic 3D regional heart wall\nmotion dataset. The results demonstrated the high accuracy of our method for\nthe recovery of dense 3D true motion from sparse 2D apparent motion cues.\nProject page is at https://github.com/DeepTag/VolumetricNeuralDeformableModels.",

The data may\ncontain valuable insights that can be harnessed to improve cyber security\nmeasures.

Clustering\nfacilitates the identification of hidden patterns and structures in data\nthrough grouping similar data points, which makes it simpler to identify and\naddress threats. Clustering can be defined as a data mining (DM) approach,\nwhich uses similarity calculations for dividing a data set into several\ncategories. Hierarchical, density-based, along with partitioning clustering\nalgorithms are typical. The presented work use K-means algorithm, which is a\npopular clustering technique. Utilizing K-means algorithm, we worked with two\ndifferent types of data: first, we gathered data with the use of XG-boost\nalgorithm following completing the aggregation with K-means algorithm. Data was\ngathered utilizing Kali Linux environment, cicflowmeter traffic, and Putty\nSoftware tools with the use of diverse and simple attacks. The concept could\nassist in identifying new attack types, which are distinct from the known\nattacks, and labeling them based on the characteristics they will exhibit, as\nthe dynamic nature regarding cyber threats means that new attack types often\nemerge, for which labeled data might not yet exist. The model counted the\nattacks and assigned numbers to each one of them.

We test this theory against\nERA5 reanalysis data, finding that it captures both seasonal and interannual\nvariations in the Hadley cell zonal winds and poleward extent fairly well. For\nthe seasonal cycle of the NH cell poleward edge only, this requires empirically\nlagging the prediction by one month, for reasons unclear to us. In all cases,\nthe bulk Rossby number value that yields the most accurate zonal wind fields is\napproximately equal to the actual, diagnosed cell-mean value. Variations in\nthese cell-mean Rossby numbers, in turn, predominantly drive variations in each\ncell's poleward extent. All other terms matter much less -- including the\nsubtropical static stability, which, by increasing under global warming, is\ngenerally considered the predominant driver of future Hadley cell expansion.\nThese results argue for developing a predictive theory for the cell-mean Rossby\nnumber and for diagnosing its role in climate model projections of future\nHadley cell expansion.",

However, effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications\nremains challenging, as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and\nexpertise-demanding prompt engineering, while full model fine-tuning is costly.\nThis is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images,\ntypically suffer from limited annotated datasets, unintuitive image contrasts,\nand nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques, such as Context\nOptimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues, but still fall short in\ngeneralizability. Meanwhile, explorations in prompt learning for biomedical\nimage analysis are still highly limited. In this work, we propose BiomedCoOp, a\nnovel prompt learning framework that enables efficient adaptation of BiomedCLIP\nfor accurate and highly generalizable few-shot biomedical image classification.\nOur approach achieves effective prompt context learning by leveraging semantic\nconsistency with average prompt ensembles from Large Language Models (LLMs) and\nknowledge distillation with a statistics-based prompt selection strategy. We\nconducted comprehensive validation of our proposed framework on 11 medical\ndatasets across 9 modalities and 10 organs against existing state-of-the-art\nmethods, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and\ngeneralizability.

While task-specific LoRAs are\noften available, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property can\nrestrict access to training data, limiting the acquisition of a multi-task\nmodel through gradient-based training. In response, LoRA merging presents an\neffective solution by combining multiple LoRAs into a unified adapter while\nmaintaining data privacy. Prior works on LoRA merging primarily frame it as an\noptimization problem, yet these approaches face several limitations, including\nthe rough assumption about input features utilized in optimization, massive\nsample requirements, and the unbalanced optimization objective.

To address these, we propose\na novel optimization-based method, named IterIS: 1) We formulate LoRA merging\nas an advanced optimization problem to mitigate the rough assumption.\nAdditionally, we employ an iterative inference-solving framework in our\nalgorithm. It can progressively refine the optimization objective for improved\nperformance. 2) We introduce an efficient regularization term to reduce the\nneed for massive sample requirements (requiring only 1-5% of the unlabeled\nsamples compared to prior methods). 3) We utilize adaptive weights in the\noptimization objective to mitigate potential unbalances in LoRA merging\nprocess.

A first-fit coloring heuristic is one that attributes to each vertex\nin a sequence the lowest-index color not used for its preceding neighbors. A\nconnected vertex sequence is one in which each element, except for the first\none, is connected to at least one element preceding it. The connected Grundy\ncoloring problem consists of obtaining a connected Grundy coloring maximizing\nthe number of colors.

Finally, we show that\nthe redder $\\beta$ values at $z > 9.5$ may require rapid build-up of dust\nreservoirs in the very early Universe or a significant contribution from the\nnebular continuum emission to the observed UV spectra, with the nebular\ncontinuum fraction depending on the gas temperatures and densities. Our\nmodeling shows that in the absence of dust, nebular emission at $T > 15,000$ K\ncan reproduce the range of $\\beta$ that we see in our sample.

We investigate the role of N$_2$H$^+$ and key\ndeuterated molecules as tracers of the different stages of the high-mass star\nformation, and test whether their abundance ratios can serve as reliable\nevolutionary indicators. We conducted APEX observations of o-H$_2$D$^+$\n(1$_{10}$-1$_{11}$), N$_2$H$^+$ (4-3), and N$_2$d$^+$ (3-2) in 40 high-mass\nclumps at different evolutionary stages, selected from the ATLASGAL survey.\nMolecular column densities ($N$) and abundances ($X$), were derived through\nspectral line modelling, both under local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and\nnon-LTE conditions. The $N$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) show the smallest deviation from LTE\nresults when derived under non-LTE assumptions. In contrast, N$_2$D$^+$ shows\nthe largest discrepancy between the $N$ derived from LTE and non-LTE.

Therefore, the validity of the recently\nproposed $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$)/$X$(N$_2$D$^+$) ratio as a reliable evolutionary\nindicator was not observed for this sample.

This is arguably the largest family of quivers in the literature with\nknown 3d mirror pairs. Using brane lockings and magnetic quivers, we show how\nthis family can be vastly expanded by replacing any number of the unitary gauge\ngroups with special unitary gauge groups and finding the mirror pairs. In the\nsecond part, we argue that in the landscape of 3d mirror pairs, most Lagrangian\n(quiver gauge theories) will not have 3d mirror duals that are also Lagrangian\n(quiver gauge theories). For unitary quiver gauge theories, we conjecture that\nany quiver with an exceptional affine Dynkin diagram as a subquiver cannot have\na Lagrangian (quiver gauge theory) mirror.",

    "abstract": "The Penrose process, a process that transfers energy from a black hole to\ninfinity, together with the BSW mechanism, which uses collisions of ingoing\nparticles at the event horizon of a black hole to locally produce large amounts\nof energy, is studied in a combined description for a $d$ dimensional extremal\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole spacetime with negative, zero, or positive\ncosmological constant, i.e., for an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS), flat,\nor de Sitter (dS) spacetime. In an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole\nbackground, in the vicinity of the horizon, several types of radial collisions\nbetween electrically charged particles can be considered. The most interesting\none is between a critical particle, with its electric charge adjusted in a\nspecific way, and a usual particle, as it gives a divergent center of mass\nframe energy locally, this being a favorable but not sufficient condition to\nextract energy from the black hole. To understand whether energy can be\nextracted in such a collisional Penrose process, we investigate in detail a\ncollision between ingoing particles 1 and 2, from which particles 3 and 4\nemerge, with the possibility that particle 3 can carry energy far out from the\nblack hole horizon. One finds that the mass, energy, electric charge, and\ninitial direction of motion of particle 3 can have different values, depending\non the collision internal process, but these values lie within some range.\nMoreover, the energy of particle 3 can be arbitrarily high but not infinite,\ncharacterizing a super-Penrose process. It is also shown that particle 4 has\nnegative energy, living in its own electric ergosphere before being engulfed by\nthe event horizon. For zero cosmological constant the results do not depend on\nthe number of dimensions, but they do for nonzero cosmological constant, which\nalso introduces differences in the lower bound for the energy extracted.",

The world-volume couplings involve Abelian 1-form\ngauge fields in the bulk and possibly field strengths intrinsic to the brane.\nIn many cases these couplings are the D-brane Chern-Simons terms present in\nstring theory, while in other cases they are the interactions of axion domain\nwalls with $U(1)$ fields. Our arguments use the same logic and assumptions as\nthe recent Festina Lente proposal (thus utilizing the properties of Nariai de\nSitter black holes) and generalize it to extended objects, thereby providing a\nbottom-up set of constraints independent of any particular UV completion. We\ncompare these bounds to the properties of (wrapped) D-branes in Type II string\ntheory in the weak coupling limit, under the assumption that these properties\nare not modified significantly in de Sitter constructions. We find that all\nconstraints are satisfied by D-branes, providing further evidence for the\nFestina Lente conjecture. For the particular case of 2-branes with Chern-Simons\ninteractions we obtain a bound, which however can be evaded if the theory\ncontains a light axion.

In this model,\nup to $t$ data entries are adversarially manipulated after each query is\nanswered. Ben-Eliezer, Kelman, Meir, and Raskhodnikova (ITCS 2024) showed an\nasymptotically optimal linearity tester that is resilient to $t$ manipulations\nper query, but their approach fails if $t$ is too large. We extend this result,\nshowing an optimal tester for almost any possible value of $t$. First, we\nsimplify their result when $t$ is small, and for larger values of $t$ we\ninstead use sample-based testers, as defined by Goldreich and Ron (ACM\nTransactions on Computation Theory 2016). A key observation is that\nsample-based testing is resilient to online manipulations, but still achieves\noptimal query complexity for linearity when $t$ is large. We complement our\nresult by showing that when $t$ is \\emph{very} large, any reasonable property,\nand in particular linearity, cannot be tested at all.\n  Second, we consider linearity over the reals with proximity parameter\n$\\varepsilon$. Fleming and Yoshida (ITCS 2020) gave a tester using\n$O(1/\\varepsilon\\ \\cdot log(1/\\varepsilon))$ queries. We simplify their\nalgorithms and modify the analysis accordingly, showing an optimal tester that\nonly uses $O(1/\\varepsilon)$ queries. This modification works for the\nlow-degree testers presented in Arora, Bhattacharyya, Fleming, Kelman, and\nYoshida (SODA 2023) as well, resulting in optimal testers for degree-$d$\npolynomials, for any constant degree $d$.",

In fact, this is the root cause of the\nscalability issue w.r.t. the input resolution for vision transformers. To\naddress this important problem, we propose in this work to use MSHAs and Convs\nin parallel \\textbf{at different granularity levels} instead. Specifically, in\neach layer, we use two different ways to represent an image: a fine-grained\nregular grid and a coarse-grained set of semantic slots. We apply different\noperations to these two representations: Convs to the grid for local features,\nand MHSAs to the slots for global features. A pair of fully differentiable soft\nclustering and dispatching modules is introduced to bridge the grid and set\nrepresentations, thus enabling local-global fusion. Through extensive\nexperiments on various vision tasks, we empirically verify the potential of the\nproposed integration scheme, named \\textit{GLMix}: by offloading the burden of\nfine-grained features to light-weight Convs, it is sufficient to use MHSAs in a\nfew (e.g., 64) semantic slots to match the performance of recent\nstate-of-the-art backbones, while being more efficient. Our visualization\nresults also demonstrate that the soft clustering module produces a meaningful\nsemantic grouping effect with only IN1k classification supervision, which may\ninduce better interpretability and inspire new weakly-supervised semantic\nsegmentation approaches.

However, operation\nunder external magnetic fields reduces magnon diffusion length, attenuates the\nvoltage amplitude at measurement terminals, and complicates the architecture of\nmagnonic devices. Here, we explore the low-field and field-free regime of\ndiffusive magnon transport in YIG films. We demonstrate that the field-induced\nsuppression of magnon diffusion length can be fully inhibited only at the\nzero-field limit.

Risk-aware path planning is one of the most effective methods\nto guarantee the safety of UAVs.

Solving CSP problems is NP-hard,\npresenting significant computational challenges. Although traditional methods\ncan accurately solve CSP problems, they tend to be very slow. Previously, we\nintroduced an additional safety dimension to the traditional A* algorithm,\nknown as ASD A*, to effectively handle Constrained Shortest Path (CSP)\nproblems.

In many practical applications of virtual aging, e.g. VFX\nin movies and TV shows, access to a personal photo collection of the user\ndepicting aging in a small time interval (20$\\sim$40 years) is often available.\nHowever, naive attempts to personalize global aging techniques on personal\nphoto collections often fail.

For exploring multidimensional search\nspaces, minimizing preliminary experiments is essen-tial, as numerous materials\nlibraries are required to adequately cover the space, making it crucial to\nfabricate only those libraries that are absolutely necessary. This can be\nachieved by Monte Carlo particle simulations to model the deposition profile,\ne.g. by SIMTRA, which is an established package mainly designed for single\ncathode simulations. A strong enhance-ment of its capabilities is the\ndevelopment of a Python-based wrapper, designed to simulate multi-cathode\nsputter processes through parallel Monte Carlo simulations. By modeling a\nsputter chamber and determining the relationship between deposition power and\nrate for an exemplary quaternary system Ni-Pd-Pt-Ru, we achieve a match between\nsimulated and measured compositions, with a mean Euclidean distance of 3.5%.\nThe object-oriented design of the package allows easy customization and enables\nthe definition of complex sputter sys-tems. Due to parallelization, simulating\nmultiple cathodes results in no additional simulation time.

    "abstract": "With the growing interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and the\nincreasing availability of quantum computers through cloud providers,\naddressing the potential security risks associated with QML has become an\nurgent priority. One key concern in the QML domain is the threat of data\npoisoning attacks in the current quantum cloud setting. Adversarial access to\ntraining data could severely compromise the integrity and availability of QML\nmodels. Classical data poisoning techniques require significant knowledge and\ntraining to generate poisoned data, and lack noise resilience, making them\nineffective for QML models in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.\nIn this work, we first propose a simple yet effective technique to measure\nintra-class encoder state similarity (ESS) by analyzing the outputs of encoding\ncircuits. Leveraging this approach, we introduce a \\underline{Qu}antum\n\\underline{I}ndiscriminate \\underline{D}ata Poisoning attack, QUID. Through\nextensive experiments conducted in both noiseless and noisy environments (e.g.,\nIBM\\_Brisbane's noise), across various architectures and datasets, QUID\nachieves up to $92\\%$ accuracy degradation in model performance compared to\nbaseline models and up to $75\\%$ accuracy degradation compared to random\nlabel-flipping. We also tested QUID against state-of-the-art classical\ndefenses, with accuracy degradation still exceeding $50\\%$, demonstrating its\neffectiveness.

In this letter, we explain these principles,\ntaking the example of the number of particles lying on a large interval in\none-dimensional interacting systems. These are based on simple hydrodynamic\narguments from the theory of ballistically transported fluctuations, and in\nparticular the Euler-scale transport of long-range correlations. Using these\nprinciples, we obtain the full counting statistics (FCS) in terms of\nthermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities, whose validity depends on the\nstructure of hydrodynamic modes and on the fluctuations in the initial state.\nIn fermionic-statistics interacting integrable models with a continuum of\nhydrodynamic modes, such as the Lieb-Liniger model for cold atomic gases, the\nformula reproduces previous conjectures, but is in fact not exact: it gives the\ncorrect cumulants up to, including, order 5, while long-range correlations\nmodify higher cumulants.

    "abstract": "The increasing integration of modern IT technologies into OT technologies and\nindustrial systems is expanding the vulnerability surface of legacy\ninfrastructures, which often rely on outdated protocols and\nresource-constrained devices. Recent security incidents in safety-critical\nindustries exposed how the lack of proper message authentication enables\nattackers to inject malicious commands or alter system behavior, revealing\nfundamental security weaknesses in existing architectures. These shortcomings\nhave thus prompted new regulations that emphasize the pressing need to\nstrengthen cybersecurity, particularly in legacy systems. Authentication is\nwidely recognized as a fundamental security measure that enhances system\nresilience. However, its adoption in legacy industrial environments is limited\ndue to practical challenges like backward compatibility, message format\nchanges, and hardware replacement or upgrades costs. In this paper, we\nintroduce ACRIC, a message authentication solution to secure legacy industrial\ncommunications explicitly tailored to overcome those challenges all at once.\nACRIC uniquely leverages cryptographic computations applied to the CRC field -\nalready present in most industrial communication protocols - ensuring robust\nmessage integrity protection and authentication without requiring additional\nhardware or modifications to existing message formats. ACRIC's backward\ncompatibility and protocol-agnostic nature enable coexistence with non-secured\ndevices, thus facilitating gradual security upgrades in legacy infrastructures.\nFormal security assessment and experimental evaluation on an industrial-grade\ntestbed demonstrate that ACRIC provides robust security guarantees with minimal\ncomputational overhead (~ 4 us).

    "abstract": "We analyze 99 photometrically selected Little Red Dots (LRDs) at z ~ 4-8 in\nthe GOODS fields, leveraging ultra-deep JADES NIRCam short-wavelength (SW)\ndata. We examine the morphology of 30 LRDs; the remaining 69 are predominantly\ncompact, i.e. are strongly dominated by sources < 400 pc in diameter and lack\nextended components even in stacked SW band images. Among the LRDs selected for\nmorphological analysis, 50% show at least two distinct, associated sources or\ngalaxy components, while the others appear as single sources with highly\nasymmetric structures. We find median stellar masses of log10(M*/Msun) =\n9.07(-0.08)(+0.11) for pure stellar models with Av ~ 1.16(+0.11)(-0.21) mag,\nand log10(M*/Msun) = 9.67(+0.17)(-0.27) for models including AGNs, where Av ~\n2.74(+0.55)(-0.71) mag, consistent with recent results showing LRDs tend to\nhave high stellar masses and dust content when fitted with AGN models. NIRSpec\nspectra are available for 15 sources, 6 of which fall within the morphological\nanalysis sample and show multiple components. Among these 15, broad H-alpha\nemission is detected in 40%, with full-width half-maximum (FWHM) ranging from\n1200 to 2900 km/s. One source exhibits broad H-beta emission with FWHM = 2000\n+/- 500 km/s. Analysis of line ratios probing the interstellar medium (ISM)\nreveals a composite nature, indicating AGN activity combined with stellar\nprocesses. These findings suggest LRDs have a mixed nature, with AGN signatures\nin some cases linked to disturbed morphologies observed at rest-frame UV\nwavelengths.",

The primary goal is to optimize\nmotion execution time by leveraging the redundancy of both arms, specifically\nin tasks where only the relative pose of the robots is constrained, such as\ndual-arm scanning of unknown objects. Unlike traditional inverse kinematics\nmethods that use surrogate metrics such as joint configuration distance, our\nmethod incorporates direct motion execution time and implicit collisions into\nthe optimization process, thereby finding target joints that allow subsequent\ntrajectory generation to get more efficient and collision-free motion. A neural\nnetwork based execution time approximator is employed to predict time-efficient\njoint configurations while accounting for potential collisions. Through\nexperimental evaluation on a system composed of a UR5 and a KUKA iiwa robot, we\ndemonstrate significant reductions in execution time. The proposed method\noutperforms conventional approaches, showing improved motion efficiency without\nsacrificing positioning accuracy. These results highlight the potential of\nETA-IK to improve the performance of dual-arm systems in applications, where\nefficiency and safety are paramount.",

In the simplest case where one uses only the\nWeyl-connection Ricci scalar as a Lagrangian, the theory recovers general\nrelativity. However, by upgrading the Weyl field to a dynamical field with a\ngeneral potential and/or general couplings constructed from its trace, leads to\nnew modified gravity theories, where the extra degrees of freedom arise from\nthe Weyl field. Additionally, since the Weyl-connection Ricci scalar differs\nfrom the Levi-Civita Ricci scalar by terms up to first derivatives of the Weyl\nfield, the resulting field equations for both the metric and the Weyl field are\nof second order, and thus the theory is free from Ostrogradsky ghosts. Finally,\nwe construct the most general theory, namely the $f(\\tilde{R},\\cal{A})$\ngravity, which is also ghost free. Applying the above classes of theories at a\ncosmological framework we obtain an effective dark energy sector of geometrical\norigin. In the simplest class of theories we are able to obtain an effective\ncosmological constant, and thus we recover $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm, nevertheless\nin more general cases we acquire a dynamical dark energy.

In this work, we\npresent the first comprehensive analytical study of the marked power spectrum's\nsensitivity to primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) of the non-local type. We\nextend previous effective field theory frameworks to incorporate PNG,\ndeveloping a complete theoretical model that we validate against the Quijote\nsimulation suite. Through a systematic Fisher analysis, we compare the\nconstraining power of the marked power spectrum against traditional approaches\ncombining the power spectrum and bispectrum (P+B). We explore different choices\nof mark parameters to evaluate their impact on parameter constraints,\nparticularly focusing on equilateral and orthogonal PNG as well as neutrino\nmasses. Our analysis shows that while marking up underdense regions yields\noptimal constraints in the low shot-noise regime, the marked power spectrum's\nperformance for discrete tracers with BOSS-like number densities does not\nsurpass that of P+B analysis at mildly non-linear scales ($k \\lesssim 0.25\n\\,h/\\text{Mpc}$). However, the marked approach offers several practical\nadvantages, including simpler estimation procedures and potentially more\nmanageable systematic effects.

This paper proposes using formal methods to model\nAD systems and demonstrates how model checking (MC) can be used in RL for AD.\nMost studies combining MC and RL focus on safety, such as safety shields.\nHowever, this paper shows different facets where MC can strengthen RL. First,\nan MC-based model pre-analysis can reveal bugs with respect to sensor accuracy\nand learning step size. This step serves as a preparation of RL, which saves\ntime if bugs exist and deepens users' understanding of the target system.\nSecond, reward automata can benefit the design of reward functions and greatly\nimprove learning performance especially when the learning objectives are\nmultiple.

It refers to a class of control algorithms that use an explicit model\nof the system to obtain the control action by minimizing a cost function. At\neach time step, MPC solves an optimization problem that minimizes the future\ndeviation of the outputs which are calculated from the model. The solution of\nthe optimization problem is a sequence of control inputs, the first input is\napplied to the system, and the optimization process is repeated at subsequent\ntime steps. In the context of MPC, convergence and stability are fundamental\nissues. A common approach to obtain MPC stability is by setting the prediction\nhorizon as infinite. For stable open-loop systems, the infinite horizon can be\nreduced to a finite horizon MPC with a terminal weight computed through the\nsolution of a Lyapunov equation. This paper presents a rigorous analysis of\nconvergence and stability of the extended nominally stable MPC developed by\nOdloak [Odloak, D.

The robots must move synchronously, but sometimes get out\nof synchronisation, giving rise to unsatisfactory weld qualities in problem\nareas, such as around corners. These mistakes are costly, since time is lost\nboth in the robotic welding and in manual repairs needed to improve the weld.\nVerification of the synchronisation properties has shown that they are\nfulfilled as long as assumptions of correctness made about parts outside the\nscope of the model hold, indicating limitations in the hardware. These results\nhave indicated the source of the problem, and motivated a re-calibration of the\nreal-life system. This has drastically improved the welding results, and is a\ndemonstration of how formal methods can be useful in an industrial setting.",

For even $q$, this\nbound was established in a sequence of prior works. For $q=3$, the above bound\nwas achieved in a recent work of Alrabiah, Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar using\nan argument that crucially exploits known exponential lower bounds for\n$2$-LDCs. Their strategy hits an inherent bottleneck for $q \\geq 5$.\n  Our key insight is identifying a general sufficient condition on the\nhypergraph of local decoding sets called $t$-approximate strong regularity.\nThis condition demands that 1) the number of hyperedges containing any given\nsubset of vertices of size $t$ (i.e., its co-degree) be equal to the same but\narbitrary value $d_t$ up to a multiplicative constant slack, and 2) all other\nco-degrees be upper-bounded relative to $d_t$. This condition significantly\ngeneralizes related proposals in prior works that demand absolute upper bounds\non all co-degrees.\n  We give an argument based on spectral bounds on Kikuchi Matrices that lower\nbounds the blocklength of any LDC whose local decoding sets satisfy\n$t$-approximate strong regularity for any $t \\leq q$. Crucially, unlike prior\nworks, our argument works despite having no non-trivial absolute upper bound on\nthe co-degrees of any set of vertices. To apply our argument to arbitrary\n$q$-LDCs, we give a new, greedy, approximate strong regularity decomposition\nthat shows that arbitrary, dense enough hypergraphs can be partitioned (up to a\nsmall error) into approximately strongly regular pieces satisfying the required\nrelative bounds on the co-degrees.",

As increasing attention\nand resources are being devoted to training SatML models with global data, it\nis important to understand when improvements in global models will make it\neasier to train or fine-tune models that are accurate in specific regions. To\nexplore this question, we contrast local and global training paradigms for\nSatML through a case study of tree canopy height (TCH) mapping in the Karingani\nGame Reserve, Mozambique. We find that recent advances in global TCH mapping do\nnot necessarily translate to better local modeling abilities in our study\nregion.

To make long-tailed object detection easy,\nDINO-X extends its input options to support text prompt, visual prompt, and\ncustomized prompt. With such flexible prompt options, we develop a universal\nobject prompt to support prompt-free open-world detection, making it possible\nto detect anything in an image without requiring users to provide any prompt.\nTo enhance the model's core grounding capability, we have constructed a\nlarge-scale dataset with over 100 million high-quality grounding samples,\nreferred to as Grounding-100M, for advancing the model's open-vocabulary\ndetection performance. Pre-training on such a large-scale grounding dataset\nleads to a foundational object-level representation, which enables DINO-X to\nintegrate multiple perception heads to simultaneously support multiple object\nperception and understanding tasks, including detection, segmentation, pose\nestimation, object captioning, object-based QA, etc. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the superior performance of DINO-X.

This paper considers the problem of adaptively selecting the\ntreatment allocation probability in order to improve estimation of the ATE. The\nmajority of prior work on adaptive ATE estimation focus on asymptotic\nguarantees, and in turn overlooks important practical considerations such as\nthe difficulty of learning the optimal treatment allocation as well as\nhyper-parameter selection. Existing non-asymptotic methods are limited by poor\nempirical performance and exponential scaling of the Neyman regret with respect\nto problem parameters. In order to address these gaps, we propose and analyze\nthe Clipped Second Moment Tracking (ClipSMT) algorithm, a variant of an\nexisting algorithm with strong asymptotic optimality guarantees, and provide\nfinite sample bounds on its Neyman regret. Our analysis shows that ClipSMT\nachieves exponential improvements in Neyman regret on two fronts: improving the\ndependence on $T$ from $O(\\sqrt{T})$ to $O(\\log T)$, as well as reducing the\nexponential dependence on problem parameters to a polynomial dependence.\nFinally, we conclude with simulations which show the marked improvement of\nClipSMT over existing approaches.",

The ensemble of relativistically\nbroadened emission frequencies from the disk elements forms the spectrum viewed\nby an observer. Over the past decades, the broadened spectra of accreting\nsystems have been used to constrain the spin of the black hole, the observer's\ninclination, and the astrophysical model parameters of the system. These\ninferences are usually made under the assumption that the accretion disk\nconsists of particles orbiting around the black hole on stable circular orbits\nin the equatorial plane. Under this Standard disk model, in this work, we\nrevisit line profile morphology, i.e., its extent, kinks, and fall-off. We\nprovide a unified analytical explanation for these line profile morphological\nfeatures, which encode the black hole spin, viewing inclination, and locations\nof the disk's inner and outer edges. We then show that these features, however,\nare model-dependent, by parametrically relaxing some of the astrophysical\nassumptions. In particular, we explore how allowing the disk particles to\ndeviate from stable circular orbits rapidly degenerates the characteristic\nfeatures of the line profile under the Standard disk model.

To ensure a robust sample for statistical analysis,\nwe define a final unbiased sample of 206 galaxies by applying thresholds for\nsignal-to-noise ratio, peak separation, and Lya luminosity. Our analysis\nreveals that between 32% and 51% of the galaxies exhibit double-peaked\nprofiles.

A large\namount of these double-peaked profiles shows blue-dominated spectra, suggesting\nunique gas dynamics and inflow characteristics in some high-redshift galaxies.\nAmong the double-peaked galaxies, 4% are spurious detections.

Our results suggest that the Lya double-peak fraction may trace the\nevolution of IGM attenuation, but faintest galaxies are needed to be observed\nat high redshift. In addition, it is crucial to obtain secure systemic\nredshifts for LAEs to better constrain the nature of the double-peaks.",

We compared the results of meta-analyses that pooled different types\nof effect estimates with those that pooled only treatment policy or\nhypothetical estimates.

While linear systems can be effectively controlled using methods like\nModel Predictive Control (MPC), the control of nonlinear systems remains\ncomplex. One promising solution is the Koopman Operator, which approximates\nnonlinear dynamics with a linear model, enabling the use of proven linear\ncontrol techniques. However, achieving accurate linearization through\ndata-driven methods is difficult due to issues like approximation error, domain\nshifts, and the limitations of fixed linear state-space representations. These\nchallenges restrict the scalability of Koopman-based approaches. This paper\naddresses these challenges by proposing a continual learning algorithm designed\nto iteratively refine Koopman dynamics for high-dimensional legged robots. The\nkey idea is to progressively expand the dataset and latent space dimension,\nenabling the learned Koopman dynamics to converge towards accurate\napproximations of the true system dynamics. Theoretical analysis shows that the\nlinear approximation error of our method converges monotonically. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves high control performance on robots\nlike Unitree G1/H1/A1/Go2 and ANYmal D, across various terrains using simple\nlinear MPC controllers.

To address this need, we\nleverage the periodic nature of these flows to accurately capture their\ntime-dependence using spectral discretization. Owing to the reduced size of the\ndiscrete problem, the resulting approach, known as the harmonic balance method,\nsignificantly lowers the solution cost when compared against the conventional\ntime marching methods. This study describes a stabilized finite element\nimplementation of the harmonic balanced method that targets the simulation of\nphysically-stable time-periodic flows. That stabilized method is based on the\nGalerkin/least-squares formulation that permits stable solution in\nconvection-dominant flows and convenient use of the same interpolation\nfunctions for velocity and pressure. We test this solver against its equivalent\ntime marching method using three common physiological cases where blood flow is\nmodeled in a Glenn operation, a cerebral artery, and a left main coronary\nartery. Using the conventional time marching solver, simulating these cases\ntakes more than ten hours. That cost is reduced by up to two orders of\nmagnitude when the proposed harmonic balance solver is utilized, where a\nsolution is produced in approximately 30 minutes.

We\nfind coherent structures of molecular gas associated with the galaxies and\nintra-group medium, which follow the distribution of warm H$_{2}$ previously\nseen with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). CO is associated with a ridge\nof shocked gas that crosses the galaxy group, and with a spiral arm of the\nintruding galaxy NGC7318b, which interacts with the intra-group medium along\nthe ridge. Although the ridge contains widespread shocks, turbulent gas, and\nwarm H$_{2}$, the CO lines are narrower than elsewhere in Stephan's Quintet\n(FWHM~25-65 km/s), indicative of settled cold gas. At a distinctly different\nvelocity, CO is found in the active galaxy NGC7319 and Northern star-forming\nregion SQ-A. A bridge of turbulent molecular gas connects NGC7319 with the\nridge, covering a gap of ~700 km/s between these structures. The gas excitation\nranges from $L'_{\\rm CO(2-1)}$/$L'_{\\rm CO(1-0)}$ ~ 0.3 in the bridge and SQ-A,\nto ~0.5 along the ridge, to near unity in the center of NGC7319. We also detect\neither a molecular outflow or turbulent molecular gas associated with the radio\nsource in NGC7319. These ACA data are part of a program with the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and JWST to study molecular gas physics\nfrom the largest to the smallest scales across the intra-group medium of\nStephan's Quintet.",

Finding ways to overcome or extend\ndecoherence times is a challenging task. Already at the level of a single\ntwo-level atom, its reduced dynamics with respect to a larger environment can\nbe very complex. Structured environments, for instance, can lead to various\nregimes other than memoryless Markovian spontaneous emission. Here, we consider\nan atom coupled to an array of coupled cavities in the presence of on-site\ncorrelated disorder. The correlation is long-ranged and associated with the\ntrace of a fractional Brownian motion following a power-law spectrum. With the\ncavity modes playing the role of the environment, we study the dynamics of the\nspontaneous emission. We observe a change from non-Markovian to Markovian decay\nin the presence of disorder by tuning the correlation parameter. This is\nassociated with a localization-delocalization transition involving the field\nmodes. Two dissipative models that effectively reproduce the behavior of the\nnon-Markovianity are discussed. The dissipation dynamics of the atom can thus\nbe used to extract information about the phase of the environment.

In the era of\ncode-generating large language models (LLMs), the ability for students to\nreason about code and identify errors is increasingly important. However,\nstudents frequently resort to trial-and-error methods to resolve bugs without\nfully understanding the underlying issues. Developing the ability to identify\nand hypothesize the cause of bugs is crucial but can be time-consuming to teach\neffectively through traditional means. This paper introduces BugSpotter, an\ninnovative tool that leverages an LLM to generate buggy code from a problem\ndescription and verify the synthesized bugs via a test suite. Students interact\nwith BugSpotter by designing failing test cases, where the buggy code's output\ndiffers from the expected result as defined by the problem specification. This\nnot only provides opportunities for students to enhance their debugging skills,\nbut also to practice reading and understanding problem specifications. We\ndeployed BugSpotter in a large classroom setting and compared the debugging\nexercises it generated to exercises hand-crafted by an instructor for the same\nproblems. We found that the LLM-generated exercises produced by BugSpotter\nvaried in difficulty and were well-matched to the problem specifications.\nImportantly, the LLM-generated exercises were comparable to those manually\ncreated by instructors with respect to student performance, suggesting that\nBugSpotter could be an effective and efficient aid for learning debugging.",

In this paper, we aim to learn\nthe trajectory prediction model by using broad out-of-domain data to improve\nits performance and generalization ability. Trajectory model is designed to\npredict any-point trajectories in the current frame given an instruction and\ncan provide detailed control guidance for robotic policy learning. To handle\nthe diverse out-of-domain data distribution, we propose a sparsely-gated MoE\n(\\textbf{Top-1} gating strategy) architecture for trajectory model, coined as\n\\textbf{Tra-MoE}. The sparse activation design enables good balance between\nparameter cooperation and specialization, effectively benefiting from\nlarge-scale out-of-domain data while maintaining constant FLOPs per token. In\naddition, we further introduce an adaptive policy conditioning technique by\nlearning 2D mask representations for predicted trajectories, which is\nexplicitly aligned with image observations to guide action prediction more\nflexibly. We perform extensive experiments on both simulation and real-world\nscenarios to verify the effectiveness of Tra-MoE and adaptive policy\nconditioning technique. We also conduct a comprehensive empirical study to\ntrain Tra-MoE, demonstrating that our Tra-MoE consistently exhibits superior\nperformance compared to the dense baseline model, even when the latter is\nscaled to match Tra-MoE's parameter count.",

By contrast, nonmuscle-type cells display a higher\ndegree of structural variability, with sarcomeres of varying lengths that\ncontribute not only to force generation but also to adaptive remodeling upon\nenvironmental cues.

    "abstract": "The dramatic increase in the number of smart services and their diversity\nposes a significant challenge in Internet of Things (IoT) networks:\nheterogeneity. This causes significant quality of service (QoS) degradation in\nIoT networks. In addition, the constraints of IoT devices in terms of\ncomputational capability and energy resources add extra complexity to this.\nHowever, the current studies remain insufficient to solve this problem due to\nthe lack of cognitive action recommendations. Therefore, we propose a\nQ-learning-based Cognitive Service Management framework called Q-CSM. In this\nframework, we first design an IoT Agent Manager to handle the heterogeneity in\ndata formats. After that, we design a Q-learning-based recommendation engine to\noptimize the devices' lifetime according to the predicted QoS behaviour of the\nchanging IoT network scenarios. We apply the proposed cognitive management to a\nsmart city scenario consisting of three specific services: wind turbines, solar\npanels, and transportation systems. We note that our proposed cognitive method\nachieves 38.7% faster response time to the dynamical IoT changes in topology.\nFurthermore, the proposed framework achieves 19.8% longer lifetime on average\nfor constrained IoT devices thanks to its Q-learning-based cognitive decision\ncapability. In addition, we explore the most successive learning rate value in\nthe Q-learning run through the exploration and exploitation phases.",

Unlike methods that\nreconstruct from videos, multi-view images, or predefined 3D templates,\nsingle-view reconstruction faces significant challenges due to inherent\nambiguities and occlusions. These challenges are further amplified by the\ndiverse nature of hand poses and the vast variety of object shapes and sizes.\nOur key insight is that current foundational models for segmentation,\ninpainting, and 3D reconstruction robustly generalize to in-the-wild images,\nwhich could provide strong visual and geometric priors for reconstructing\nhand-object interactions. Specifically, given a single image, we first design a\nnovel pipeline to estimate the underlying hand pose and object shape using\noff-the-shelf large models. Furthermore, with the initial reconstruction, we\nemploy a prior-guided optimization scheme, which optimizes hand pose to comply\nwith 3D physical constraints and the 2D input image content. We perform\nexperiments across several datasets and show that our method consistently\noutperforms baselines and faithfully reconstructs a diverse set of hand-object\ninteractions.

    "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive results in\nvarious vision-language tasks. However, despite showing promising performance,\nLVLMs suffer from hallucinations caused by language bias, leading to diminished\nfocus on images and ineffective visual comprehension. We identify two primary\nreasons for this bias: 1. Different scales of training data between the\npretraining stage of LLM and multimodal alignment stage. 2. The learned\ninference bias due to short-term dependency of text data. Therefore, we propose\nLACING, a systemic framework designed to address the language bias of LVLMs\nwith muLtimodal duAl-attention meChanIsm (MDA) aNd soft-image Guidance (IFG).\nSpecifically, MDA introduces a parallel dual-attention mechanism that enhances\nthe integration of visual inputs across the model. IFG introduces a learnable\nsoft visual prompt during training and inference to replace visual inputs,\ndesigned to compel LVLMs to prioritize text inputs. Then, IFG further proposes\na novel decoding strategy using the soft visual prompt to mitigate the model's\nover-reliance on adjacent text inputs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our method effectively debiases LVLMs from their language bias, enhancing\nvisual comprehension and reducing hallucinations without requiring additional\ntraining resources or data.

    "abstract": "A code $C \\colon \\{0,1\\}^k \\to \\{0,1\\}^n$ is a $q$-query locally decodable\ncode ($q$-LDC) if one can recover any chosen bit $b_i$ of the message $b \\in\n\\{0,1\\}^k$ with good confidence by querying a corrupted string $\\tilde{x}$ of\nthe codeword $x = C(b)$ in at most $q$ coordinates. For $2$ queries, the\nHadamard code is a $2$-LDC of length $n = 2^k$, and this code is in fact\nessentially optimal. For $q \\geq 3$, there is a large gap in our understanding:\nthe best constructions achieve $n = \\exp(k^{o(1)})$, while prior to the recent\nwork of [AGKM23], the best lower bounds were $n \\geq\n\\tilde{\\Omega}(k^{\\frac{q}{q-2}})$ for $q$ even and $n \\geq\n\\tilde{\\Omega}(k^{\\frac{q+1}{q-1}})$ for $q$ odd.\n  The recent work of [AGKM23] used techniques from semirandom XOR refutation to\nprove a lower bound of $n \\geq \\tilde{\\Omega}(k^3)$ for $q = 3$, thus achieving\nthe \"$k^{\\frac{q}{q-2}}$ bound\" for an odd value of $q$. However, their proof\ndoes not extend to any odd $q \\geq 5$. In this paper, we prove a $q$-LDC lower\nbound of $n \\geq \\tilde{\\Omega}(k^{\\frac{q}{q-2}})$ for any odd $q$. Our key\ntechnical idea is the use of an imbalanced bipartite Kikuchi graph, which gives\na simpler method to analyze spectral refutations of odd arity XOR without using\nthe standard \"Cauchy-Schwarz trick\", a trick that typically produces random\nmatrices with nontrivially correlated entries and makes the analysis for odd\narity XOR significantly more complicated than even arity XOR.",

The SSS\nRX J0513.9-6951 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibits cyclic variations\nbetween optical low and high states, which are anti-correlated with its X-ray\nflux. This behaviour is believed to result from the periodic expansion and\ncontraction of the WD due to variations in the accretion rate in the system. We\nanalyse eight high-resolution XMM and six grating Chandra spectra of RX\nJ0513.9-6951 with our grid of model atmosphere spectra of hot WDs computed\nunder the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Our aim is to test a\ncontraction model of the source variability by tracking the evolution of the WD\nproperties. The used grid of hot WD model atmospheres spans a wide range of\neffective temperatures ($T_{\\rm eff}=100-1000\\,\\rm kK$ in steps of $25\\,\\rm\nkK$) and eight values of surface gravity $\\log g$. The LMC chemical composition\nwas assumed. The obtained fitting parameters ($T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, and\nbolometric luminosity $L$) evolve on the $T_{\\rm eff}- \\log g$ and $T_{\\rm\neff}- L$ planes. This evolution follows the model tracks of WDs with masses of\n$1.05-1.15\\,M_{\\odot}$ and thermonuclear burning on the surface. The analysis\nhas showed that the optical brightness of the system is lower when the WD is\nlarger, more luminous, and more effectively illuminates the accretion disc.\nThese results contradict the contraction model, which predicts the opposite\nbehaviour of the source. We use a model, that assumes that the far UV/soft\nX-ray flux is reprocessed into the optical band due to multiple scattering in\nthe cloud system above the accretion disc. More significant illumination can\nlead to rarefying of the cloud slab, thereby reducing the reprocessing\nefficiency and making the source fainter in the optical band.",

    "abstract": "A considerable number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars exhibit UV\nexcess and/or X-ray emission that indicates a binary companion. AGB stars are\nso bright that they easily outshine their companions. This almost prevents\ntheir identification. Y Gem has been known for some decades to be an AGB star\nthat is bright in the far-UV and X-rays, but it is unclear whether its\ncompanion is a main-sequence star or a white dwarf (WD) in a symbiotic system\n(SySt). Our goal is to uncover the true nature of Y Gem, which will help us to\nstudy the possible misidentified population of SySts. Multiwavelength IR,\noptical, UV, and X-ray observations were analyzed to investigate the properties\nof the stellar components and the accretion process in Y Gem. In particular, an\noptical spectrum of Y Gem is presented here for the first time, while X-ray\ndata are interpreted by means of reflection models produced by an accretion\ndisk and material in its vicinity. The optical spectrum exhibits the typical\nsawtooth-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to narrow\nrecombination and forbidden emission lines. The emission lines and the analysis\nof the extinction-corrected UV spectrum suggest a hot component with\n$T_\\mathrm{eff}\\approx$60,000 K, $L$=140 L$_{\\odot}$, and $R$=0.11 R$_{\\odot}$\nthat very likely is an accreting WD. The late component is found to be an 1.1\nM$_\\odot$ AGB star with $T_\\mathrm{eff}$=3350 K and $R$=240 R$_\\odot$. Using\nIR, optical, UV, and X-ray data, we found that Y Gem is an S-type SySt whose\ncompact component is accreting at an estimated mass-accretion rate of\n$\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{acc}=2.3\\times10^{-7}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. At this accretion\nrate, the accreting WD has reached the stable and steady burning phase in which\nno recurrent events are expected.",

Unlike in computer vision, where these perturbations are designed\nto be imperceptible to the human eye, the generation of adversarial examples in\npredictive process monitoring poses unique challenges. Minor changes to the\nactivity sequences can create improbable or even impossible scenarios to occur\ndue to underlying constraints such as regulatory rules or process constraints.\nTo address this, we focus on generating realistic adversarial examples tailored\nto the business process context, in contrast to the imperceptible, pixel-level\nchanges commonly seen in computer vision adversarial attacks. This paper\nintroduces two novel latent space attacks, which generate adversaries by adding\nnoise to the latent space representation of the input data, rather than\ndirectly modifying the input attributes. These latent space methods are\ndomain-agnostic and do not rely on process-specific knowledge, as we restrict\nthe generation of adversarial examples to the learned class-specific data\ndistributions by directly perturbing the latent space representation of the\nbusiness process executions. We evaluate these two latent space methods with\nsix other adversarial attacking methods on eleven real-life event logs and four\npredictive models. The first three attacking methods directly permute the\nactivities of the historically observed business process executions. The fourth\nmethod constrains the adversarial examples to lie within the same data\ndistribution as the original instances, by projecting the adversarial examples\nto the original data distribution.",

Using sparse autoencoders as an\ninterpretability tool, we discover that a key part of these mechanisms is\nentity recognition, where the model detects if an entity is one it can recall\nfacts about. Sparse autoencoders uncover meaningful directions in the\nrepresentation space, these detect whether the model recognizes an entity, e.g.\ndetecting it doesn't know about an athlete or a movie. This suggests that\nmodels can have self-knowledge: internal representations about their own\ncapabilities. These directions are causally relevant: capable of steering the\nmodel to refuse to answer questions about known entities, or to hallucinate\nattributes of unknown entities when it would otherwise refuse. We demonstrate\nthat despite the sparse autoencoders being trained on the base model, these\ndirections have a causal effect on the chat model's refusal behavior,\nsuggesting that chat finetuning has repurposed this existing mechanism.\nFurthermore, we provide an initial exploration into the mechanistic role of\nthese directions in the model, finding that they disrupt the attention of\ndownstream heads that typically move entity attributes to the final token.",

    "abstract": "Traditional autonomous driving methods adopt a modular design, decomposing\ntasks into sub-tasks. In contrast, end-to-end autonomous driving directly\noutputs actions from raw sensor data, avoiding error accumulation. However,\ntraining an end-to-end model requires a comprehensive dataset; otherwise, the\nmodel exhibits poor generalization capabilities. Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) have been applied to enhance the generalization capabilities of\nend-to-end driving models. Most studies explore LLMs in an open-loop manner,\nwhere the output actions are compared to those of experts without direct\nfeedback from the real world, while others examine closed-loop results only in\nsimulations. This paper proposes an efficient architecture that integrates\nmultimodal LLMs into end-to-end driving models operating in closed-loop\nsettings in real-world environments. In our architecture, the LLM periodically\nprocesses raw sensor data to generate high-level driving instructions,\neffectively guiding the end-to-end model, even at a slower rate than the raw\nsensor data. This architecture relaxes the trade-off between the latency and\ninference quality of the LLM. It also allows us to choose from a wide variety\nof LLMs to improve high-level driving instructions and minimize fine-tuning\ncosts. Consequently, our architecture reduces data collection requirements\nbecause the LLMs do not directly output actions; we only need to train a simple\nimitation learning model to output actions. In our experiments, the training\ndata for the end-to-end model in a real-world environment consists of only\nsimple obstacle configurations with one traffic cone, while the test\nenvironment is more complex and contains multiple obstacles placed in various\npositions. Experiments show that the proposed architecture enhances the\ngeneralization capabilities of the end-to-end model even without fine-tuning\nthe LLM.",

We aim to extent\nthe BE99 method by including more emission lines in the blue and near-infrared\npart of the spectrum ($\\lambda$ = 3500-11000A), and considering higher hydrogen\nionisation fractions ($x_e > 0.3$). In addition, we investigate how a\nnon-equilibrium state of the gas and the presence of extinction influence the\nBE99 technique. We find that plenty additional emission line ratios can in\nprinciple be exploited as extended curves (or stripes) in the ($x_e,\nT_e$)-diagram. If the BE99 equilibrium is reached and extinction is corrected\nfor, all stripes overlap in one location in the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram indicating\nthe existing gas parameters. The application to the Par Lup 3-4 outflow shows\nthat the classical BE99 lines together with the [NI]5198+5200 lines do not meet\nin one locationin the ($x_e, T_e$)-diagram. This indicates that the gas\nparameters derived from the classical BE99 method are not fully consistent with\nother observed line ratios. A multi-line approach is necessary to determine the\ngas parameters. From our analysis we derive $n_e \\sim$ 45 000 cm^-3 - 53000\ncm^-3 , $T_e$ = 7600K - 8000K, and $x_e \\sim$ 0.027 - 0.036 for the Par Lup 3-4\noutflow.

Backdoor attacks, in\nparticular, pose a serious threat by implanting hidden triggers in victim\nmodels, which adversaries can later exploit to induce malicious behaviors\nduring inference. However, current understanding is limited to single-target\nattacks, where adversaries must define a fixed malicious behavior (target)\nbefore training, making inference-time adaptability impossible. Given the large\noutput space of object detection (including object existence prediction,\nbounding box estimation, and classification), the feasibility of flexible,\ninference-time model control remains unexplored. This paper introduces\nAnywhereDoor, a multi-target backdoor attack for object detection. Once\nimplanted, AnywhereDoor allows adversaries to make objects disappear, fabricate\nnew ones, or mislabel them, either across all object classes or specific ones,\noffering an unprecedented degree of control. This flexibility is enabled by\nthree key innovations: (i) objective disentanglement to scale the number of\nsupported targets; (ii) trigger mosaicking to ensure robustness even against\nregion-based detectors; and (iii) strategic batching to address object-level\ndata imbalances that hinder manipulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat AnywhereDoor grants attackers a high degree of control, improving attack\nsuccess rates by 26% compared to adaptations of existing methods for such\nflexible control.",

    "abstract": "Gaining insights from realistic dynamical models of biochemical systems can\nbe challenging given their large number of state variables. Model reduction\ntechniques can mitigate this by decreasing complexity by mapping the model onto\na lower-dimensional state space. Exact constrained lumping identifies\nreductions as linear combinations of the original state variables in systems of\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations, preserving specific user-defined\noutput variables without error. However, exact reductions can be too stringent\nin practice, as model parameters are often uncertain or imprecise -- a\nparticularly relevant problem for biochemical systems. We propose approximate\nconstrained lumping. It allows for a relaxation of exactness within a given\ntolerance parameter $\\varepsilon$, while still working in polynomial time. We\nprove that the accuracy, i.e., the difference between the output variables in\nthe original and reduced model, is in the order of $\\varepsilon$. Furthermore,\nwe provide a heuristic algorithm to find the smallest $\\varepsilon$ for a given\nmaximum allowable size of the lumped system. Our method is applied to several\nmodels from the literature, resulting in coarser aggregations than exact\nlumping while still capturing the dynamics of the original system accurately.",

    "abstract": "Recent ALMA observations discovered consequent amounts (i.e., up to a few\n$10^{-1}\\; \\rm M_\\oplus$) of CO gas in debris disks that were expected to be\ngas-free. This gas is in general estimated to be mostly composed of CO, C, and\nO (i.e., $\\rm H_2$-poor), unlike the gas present in protoplanetary disks ($\\rm\nH_2$-rich). At this stage, the majority of planet formation already occurred,\nand giant planets might be evolving in these disks. While planets have been\ndirectly observed in debris disks (e.g., $\\beta$ Pictoris), their direct\nobservations are challenging due to the weak luminosity of the planets. In this\npaper, with the help of hydrodynamical simulations (with FARGO3D) coupled with\na radiative transfer code (RADMC-3D) and an observing tool (CASA), we show that\nplanet-gas interactions can produce observable substructures in this late\ndebris disk stage. While it is tricky to observe gaps in the CO emission of\nprotoplanetary disks, the unique properties of the gaseous debris disks allow\nus to observe planetary gaps in the gas. Depending on the total mass of the\ngaseous debris disk, kinks can also be observed. We derive a simple criterion\nto estimate in which conditions gaps would be observable and apply it to the\nknown gaseous debris disk surrounding HD138813. In our framework, we find that\nplanets as small as $0.5 \\; \\rm M_J$ can produce observable gaps and\ninvestigate under which conditions (i.e., gas and planets characteristics) the\nsubstructure become observable with ALMA. The first observations of planet-gas\ninteractions in debris disks can lead to a new way to indirectly detect\nexoplanets, reaching a population that could not be probed before, such as\ngiant planets that are too cold to be detected by direct imaging.",

Both methods\nproduce consistent extinction maps in the regions of the four studied clusters.\nHowever, the Q-method yields a much smaller color scatter in the CMD. For four\nclusters in particular (S235~North-West, S235~A-B-C, S235~Central, and\nS235~East1+East2), we were able to compute individual membership probabilities,\nthe cluster distances, the cluster masses, and their average proper motions.

    "abstract": "Examining reflected light from exoplanets aids in our understanding of the\nscattering properties of their atmospheres and will be a primary task of future\nflagship space- and ground-based telescopes. We introduce an enhanced\ncapability of Planetary Intensity Code for Atmospheric Scattering Observations\n(PICASO), an open-source radiative transfer model used for exoplanet and brown\ndwarf atmospheres, to produce reflected light phase curves from\nthree-dimensional atmospheric models. Since PICASO is coupled to the cloud code\nVirga, we produce phase curves for different cloud condensate species and\nvarying sedimentation efficiencies (fsed) and apply this new functionality to\nKepler-7b, a hot Jupiter with phase curve measurements dominated by reflected\nstarlight. We model three different cloud scenarios for Kepler-7b: MgSiO3\nclouds only, Mg2SiO4 clouds only, and Mg2SiO4, Al2O3, and TiO2 clouds. All our\nVirga models reproduce the cloudy region west of the substellar point expected\nfrom previous studies, as well as clouds at high latitudes and near the eastern\nlimb, which are primarily composed of magnesium silicates. Al2O3 and TiO2\nclouds dominate near the substellar point. We then compare our modeled\nreflected light phase curves to Kepler observations and find that models with\nall three cloud condensate species and low sedimentation efficiencies (0.03 -\n0.1) match best, though our reflected light phase curves show intensities\napproximately one-third of those observed by Kepler. We conclude that a better\nunderstanding of zonal transport, cloud radiative feedback, and particle\nscattering properties is needed to further explain the differences between the\nmodeled and observed reflected light fluxes.",

However, this rapid expansion of network\ntopologies makes the management of 6G wireless networks more complex and leads\nto performance degradation. Even though state-of-the-art applications on\nnetwork services are providing promising results, they also risk disrupting the\nnetwork's performance. To overcome this, the services have to leverage what-if\nimplementations covering a variety of scenarios. At this point, traditional\nsimulations fall short of encompassing the dynamism and complexity of a\nphysical network. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Generative\nAI-based Digital Twins. For this, we derive an optimization formula to\ndifferentiate different network scenarios by considering the specific key\nperformance indicators (KPIs) for wireless networks. Then, we fed this formula\nto the generative AI with the historical twins and real-time twins to start\ngenerating the desired topologies. To evaluate the performance, we implement\nnetwork and smart-city-oriented services, namely massive connectivity, tiny\ninstant communication, right-time synchronization, and truck path routes. The\nsimulation results reveal that our approach can achieve 38% more stable network\nthroughput in high device density scenarios.

The first-principles calculations show that\nmetal-Ge and metal-Si contacts should possess a similar FLP strength if they\nadopt an identical interface bonding configuration: the reconstructed bonding\nconfiguration renders Si and Ge having pinning factors of 0.16 and 0.11,\nrespectively, and the ideal non-reconstructed bonding configuration gives them\npinning factors of 0.05 and 0, respectively. We illustrate that Si favors the\nreconstructed bonding configuration, and Ge favors the ideal non-reconstructed\nbonding configuration after metal deposition. The self-passivation of the\ndangling bonds substantially reduces the interface gap states to give a much\nweaker FLP in the metal-Si contacts than in the metal-Ge contacts. We also\ndemonstrate that the full passivation of the interface dangling bonds can\nfurther increase the pinning factor to 0.5 by further reducing the interface\ngap states. These findings shed new light on alleviating the Femi level pinning\nto lower the contact resistance for Si and emerging materials towards advanced\nsemiconductor technology.",

We\nintroduce a two-stage system: YOLOv10-X to localise and classify species\n(mammals and birds) within images, and a Phi-3.5-vision-instruct model to read\nYOLOv10-X binding box labels to identify species, overcoming its limitation\nwith hard to classify objects in images. Additionally, Phi-3.5 detects broader\nvariables, such as vegetation type, and time of day, providing rich ecological\nand environmental context to YOLO's species detection output. When combined,\nthis output is processed by the model's natural language system to answer\ncomplex queries, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is employed to enrich\nresponses with external information, like species weight and IUCN status\n(information that cannot be obtained through direct visual analysis). This\ninformation is used to automatically generate structured reports, providing\nbiodiversity stakeholders with deeper insights into, for example, species\nabundance, distribution, animal behaviour, and habitat selection. Our approach\ndelivers contextually rich narratives that aid in wildlife management\ndecisions.

However, there is debate on the extent to\nwhich they are performing general abstract reasoning versus employing\nnon-robust processes, e.g., that overly rely on similarity to pre-training\ndata. Here we investigate the robustness of analogy-making abilities previously\nclaimed for LLMs on three of four domains studied by Webb, Holyoak, and Lu\n(2023): letter-string analogies, digit matrices, and story analogies. For each\ndomain we test humans and GPT models on robustness to variants of the original\nanalogy problems that test the same abstract reasoning abilities but are likely\ndissimilar from tasks in the pre-training data. The performance of a system\nthat uses robust abstract reasoning should not decline substantially on these\nvariants.\n  On simple letter-string analogies, we find that while the performance of\nhumans remains high for two types of variants we tested, the GPT models'\nperformance declines sharply. This pattern is less pronounced as the complexity\nof these problems is increased, as both humans and GPT models perform poorly on\nboth the original and variant problems requiring more complex analogies. On\ndigit-matrix problems, we find a similar pattern but only on one out of the two\ntypes of variants we tested. On story-based analogy problems, we find that,\nunlike humans, the performance of GPT models are susceptible to answer-order\neffects, and that GPT models also may be more sensitive than humans to\nparaphrasing.\n  This work provides evidence that LLMs often lack the robustness of zero-shot\nhuman analogy-making, exhibiting brittleness on most of the variations we\ntested.

We find that energy\ninjected from the supernovae of the first stars is enough to expel a majority\nof gas and injected metals beyond the virial radius of halos with mass $M_*\n\\lesssim 10^7$ M$_\\odot$, regardless of the number of supernovae. This prevents\nself-enrichment and results in a non-monotonic increase in metallicity at early\ntimes. Most minihalos ($M \\gtrsim 10^5 \\, \\rm M_\\odot$) do not retain\nsignificant fractions of the yields produced within their virial radii until\nthey have grown to halo masses of $M \\gtrsim 10^7 \\, \\rm M_\\odot$. The loss of\nmetals to regions well beyond the virial radius delays the onset of enriched\nstar formation and extends the period that Population III star formation can\npersist. We also explore the contributions of different nucleosynthetic\nchannels to 10 individual elements. On the timescale of the simulation (lowest\nredshift $z=14.3$), enrichment is dominated by core-collapse supernovae for all\nelements, but with a significant contribution from asymptotic giant branch\nwinds to the s-process elements, which are normally thought to only be\nimportant at late times. In this work, we establish important mechanisms for\nearly chemical enrichment which allows us to apply Aeos in later epochs to\ntrace the evolution of enrichment during the complete transition from\nPopulation III to Population II stars.",

Such abnormalities, typically deemed unacceptable, pose considerable\nchallenges in the detection and repair of them within human photos.

Specifically, in continual learning scenarios, storing network\nparameters at each step to retain knowledge poses challenges. This is\ncompounded by the crucial need to mitigate catastrophic forgetting,\nparticularly given the limited access to past datasets, which complicates\nmaintaining correspondence between network parameters and datasets across all\nsessions. Current methods using Variational Inference with KL divergence risk\ncatastrophic forgetting during uncertain node updates and coupled disruptions\nin certain nodes. To address these challenges, we propose the following\nstrategies. To reduce the storage of the dense layer parameters, we propose a\nparameter distribution learning method that significantly reduces the storage\nrequirements. In the continual learning framework employing variational\ninference, our study introduces a regularization term that specifically targets\nthe dynamics and population of the mean and variance of the parameters. This\nterm aims to retain the benefits of KL divergence while addressing related\nchallenges. To ensure proper correspondence between network parameters and the\ndata, our method introduces an importance-weighted Evidence Lower Bound term to\ncapture data and parameter correlations. This enables storage of common and\ndistinctive parameter hyperspace bases. The proposed method partitions the\nparameter space into common and distinctive subspaces, with conditions for\neffective backward and forward knowledge transfer, elucidating the\nnetwork-parameter dataset correspondence.

We replicate previous analyses and find additional\nnew evidence for a performance gap between agglutinative and fusional\nlanguages, where fusional languages, such as English, tend to have better\nlanguage modeling performance than morphologically more complex languages like\nTurkish. We then propose and test three possible causes for this performance\ngap: morphological alignment of tokenizers, tokenization quality, and\ndisparities in dataset sizes and measurement. To test the morphological\nalignment hypothesis, we present MorphScore, a tokenizer evaluation metric, and\nsupporting datasets for 22 languages. We find some evidence that tokenization\nquality explains the performance gap, but none for the role of morphological\nalignment. Instead we find that the performance gap is most reduced when\ntraining datasets are of equivalent size across language types, but only when\nscaled according to the so-called \"byte-premium\" -- the different encoding\nefficiencies of different languages and orthographies. These results suggest\nthat no language is harder or easier for a language model to learn on the basis\nof its morphological typology.

    "abstract": "Humans possess a finely tuned sense of uncertainty that helps anticipate\npotential errors, vital for adaptive behavior and survival. However, the\nunderlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. This study applies moment neural\nnetworks (MNNs) to explore the neural mechanism of uncertainty quantification\nin working memory (WM). The MNN captures nonlinear coupling of the first two\nmoments in spiking neural networks (SNNs), identifying firing covariance as a\nkey indicator of uncertainty in encoded information. Trained on a WM task, the\nmodel demonstrates coding precision and uncertainty quantification comparable\nto human performance. Analysis reveals a link between the probabilistic and\nsampling-based coding for uncertainty representation. Transferring the MNN's\nweights to an SNN replicates these results. Furthermore, the study provides\ntestable predictions demonstrating how noise and heterogeneity enhance WM\nperformance, highlighting their beneficial role rather than being mere\nbiological byproducts. These findings offer insights into how the brain\neffectively manages uncertainty with exceptional accuracy.",

One important\nnoise source in LISA will be tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling.

The current plan is to\nsubtract this noise in-flight in post-processing as part of a noise\nminimization strategy. It is crucial to distinguish TTL coupling well from the\nGW signals in the same readout to ensure that the noise will be properly\nmodeled. Furthermore, it is important that the subtraction of TTL noise will\nnot degrade the GW signals.

At the same time,\nemerging research has also shown that time-varying warming patterns are\nnecessary to explain the time evolution of effective climate sensitivity in\ncoupled models, a mechanism that is known as the pattern effect and that\nseemingly challenges the pattern scaling understanding. Here we present a\nsimple theory based on local energy balance arguments to reconcile this\napparent contradiction. Specifically, we show that the pattern invariance is an\ninherent feature of exponential forcing, linear feedbacks, a constant forcing\npattern and diffusive dynamics. These conditions are approximately met in most\nCMIP6 Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), except in the Arctic where nonlinear\nfeedbacks are important and in regions where aerosols considerably alter the\nforcing pattern. In idealized experiments where concentrations of CO2 are\nabruptly increased, such as those used to study the pattern effect, the warming\npattern can change considerably over time because of spatially inhomogeneous\nocean heat uptake, even in the absence of nonlinear feedbacks. Our results\nillustrate why typical future projections are amenable to pattern scaling, and\nprovide a plausible explanation of why more complicated approaches, such as\nnonlinear emulators, have only shown marginal improvements in accuracy over\nsimple linear calculations.",

Analysis of the variations of RFs along\nthe backazimuth and slowness is the key in determining the geometry and\nanisotropic properties of the crustal structures. However, the deconvolution\nintroduces pseudorandom nuisance effects, due to unknown earthquake source\nsignatures and seismic noise, which obstruct the precise extraction of\nbackazimuth and slowness dependent crustal effects. Our goal is to obtain RFs\nwith minimal nuisance effects, while preserving the crustal effects. In this\nstudy, we introduced a new method for reducing nuisance effects in RFs. This\nmethod generates virtual RFs through a deep generative model, namely symmetric\nvariational autoencoders (SymVAE). Our autoencoder efficiently learns to\ndisentangle coherent crustal effects and nuisance effects within its latent\nspace, given a set of RFs derived from a cluster of nearby earthquakes. This\ndisentanglement enables generation of virtual RFs which exhibits minimal\nnuisance effects while preserving the coherent crustal effects. We tested\nSymVAE using synthetic RFs with ambient seismic noise. We also tested using\ndense seismic networks in two distinct geological settings: the Cascadia\nsubduction zone and southern California. We compared our method with linear and\nphase-weighted averaging. In both synthetic and real RFs, the generated virtual\nRFs demonstrate enhanced information related to crustal structures.

    "abstract": "One of the most well-known problems in transportation and logistics is the\nCapacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). It involves optimizing a set of\ntruck routes to service a set of customers, subject to limits on truck\ncapacity, to reduce travel costs. The biggest challenge faced whilst attempting\nto solve the issue is that the time complexity of the issue grows exponentially\nwith the number of customers and trucks, rendering it virtually intractable to\ntraditional computers and algorithms. In this paper, we propose a method to\ncircumvent this limitation, employing quantum computers to aid classical\ncomputers in solving problems faster while reducing complexity. To obtain our\nresults, we employ two algorithms: Hybrid Two Step (H2S) and Hybrid Three Step\n(H3S). Both algorithms involve two phases: clustering and routing. It has been\nobserved that both algorithms produce promising results, both in terms of\nsolution time and solution cost.",

The close scores of queries in\nthe lower-level decoders make it challenging for the dominant query to\ndistinguish itself rapidly, which ultimately impairs the model's accuracy and\nconvergence efficiency. This phenomenon is referred to as inter-query\ncompetition. To address this challenge, we put forth a series of plug-and-play\ncompetition-oriented designs, collectively designated as the CompetitorFormer,\nwith the aim of reducing competition and facilitating a dominant query.\nExperiments showed that integrating our designs with state-of-the-art\nframeworks consistently resulted in significant performance improvements in 3D\ninstance segmentation across a range of datasets.",

    "abstract": "We explore the potential implications of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity in\nunifying the dark sector of the Universe. Through dimensional reduction in KK\ngravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D\nspacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D\nperspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states,\nincluding KK gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the\nmassless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). The key idea in the\npresent paper is the analogy with superconductivity theory. By assuming a\nminimal coupling between an additional complex scalar field and the gauge\nfield, a \"mass\" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to\nlong-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity\nthrough Yukawa-type corrections. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the\nspin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1\ngraviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's\nconstant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated\neffect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its\nshort range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the\ndominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's\nemergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is\nequivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the\nimpact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and\nshow that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to\ntest this theory through future GW observatories.",

Existing 3D OCF approaches struggle to\npredict plausible spatial details for movable objects and suffer from slow\ninference speeds due to neglecting the bias and uneven distribution of changing\noccupancy states in both space and time. In this paper, we propose a novel\nspatiotemporal decoupling vision-based paradigm to explicitly tackle the bias\nand achieve both effective and efficient 3D OCF. To tackle spatial bias in\nempty areas, we introduce a novel spatial representation that decouples the\nconventional dense 3D format into 2D bird's-eye view (BEV) occupancy with\ncorresponding height values, enabling 3D OCF derived only from 2D predictions\nthus enhancing efficiency. To reduce temporal bias on static voxels, we design\ntemporal decoupling to improve end-to-end OCF by temporally associating\ninstances via predicted flows. We develop an efficient multi-head network\nEfficientOCF to achieve 3D OCF with our devised spatiotemporally decoupled\nrepresentation. A new metric, conditional IoU (C-IoU), is also introduced to\nprovide a robust 3D OCF performance assessment, especially in datasets with\nmissing or incomplete annotations.

In this paper, we\nformalize a class of BTs we call Stateful Behavior Trees (SBTs) that have\nauxiliary variables and operate in an environment that can change over time.\nSBTs have access to persistent shared memory (often known as a blackboard) that\nkeeps track of these auxiliary variables. We demonstrate that SBTs are\nequivalent in computational power to Turing Machines when the blackboard can\nstore mathematical (i.e., unbounded) integers. We further identify syntactic\nassumptions where SBTs have computational power equivalent to finite state\nautomata, specifically where the auxiliary variables are of finitary types. We\npresent a domain specific language (DSL) for writing SBTs and adapt the tool\nBehaVerify for use with this DSL. This new DSL in BehaVerify supports\ninterfacing with popular BT libraries in Python, and also provides generation\nof Haskell code and nuXmv models, the latter of which is used for model\nchecking temporal logic specifications for the SBTs. We include examples and\nscalability results where BehaVerify outperforms another verification tool by a\nfactor of 100.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) represent a significant advancement\ntoward achieving superior multimodal capabilities by enabling powerful Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to understand visual input. Typically, LVLMs utilize\nvisual encoders, such as CLIP, to transform images into visual tokens, which\nare then aligned with textual tokens through projection layers before being\ninput into the LLM for inference. Although existing LVLMs have achieved\nsignificant success, their inference efficiency is still limited by the\nsubstantial number of visual tokens and the potential redundancy among them. To\nmitigate this issue, we propose Focal Pruning (FoPru), a training-free method\nthat prunes visual tokens based on the attention-based token significance\nderived from the vision encoder. Specifically, we introduce two alternative\npruning strategies: 1) the rank strategy, which leverages all token\nsignificance scores to retain more critical tokens in a global view; 2) the row\nstrategy, which focuses on preserving continuous key information in images from\na local perspective. Finally, the selected tokens are reordered to maintain\ntheir original positional relationships. Extensive experiments across various\nLVLMs and multimodal datasets demonstrate that our method can prune a large\nnumber of redundant tokens while maintaining high accuracy, leading to\nsignificant improvements in inference efficiency.",

The existence and stability of the localized states is studied in the\nplane of the relevant control parameters, viz., the amplitude of the driving\nterm and the detuning of its frequency from the parametric resonance. With the\nhelp of systematically performed simulations of the LLG equation, existence and\nstability areas are identified in the parameter plane for several species of\nthe localized states: stationary single- and two-soliton modes, single and\ndouble breathers, drifting double breathers with spontaneously broken inner\nsymmetry, and multi-soliton complexes. Multistability occurs in this system.\nThe breathers emit radiation waves (which explains their drift caused by the\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, as it breaks the balance between the recoil from\nthe waves emitted to left and right), while the multi-soliton complexes exhibit\ncycles of periodic transitions between three-, five-, and seven-soliton\nconfigurations.

Existing 3-D point cloud\ndenoising methods typically fail to reliably fit the underlying continuous\nsurface, resulting in a degradation of reconstruction performance. This paper\nintroduces fine-granularity dynamic graph convolutional networks called GD-GCN,\na novel approach to denoising in 3-D point clouds. The GD-GCN employs\nmicro-step temporal graph convolution (MST-GConv) to perform feature learning\nin a gradual manner. Compared with the conventional GCN, which commonly uses\ndiscrete integer-step graph convolution, this modification introduces a more\nadaptable and nuanced approach to feature learning within graph convolution\nnetworks. It more accurately depicts the process of fitting the point cloud\nwith noise to the underlying surface by and the learning process for MST-GConv\nacts like a changing system and is managed through a type of neural network\nknown as neural Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). This means it can adapt\nand improve over time. GD-GCN approximates the Riemannian metric, calculating\ndistances between points along a low-dimensional manifold. This capability\nallows it to understand the local geometric structure and effectively capture\ndiverse relationships between points from different geometric regions through\ngeometric graph construction based on Riemannian distances. Additionally,\nGD-GCN incorporates robust graph spectral filters based on the Bernstein\npolynomial approximation, which modulate eigenvalues for complex and arbitrary\nspectral responses, providing theoretical guarantees for BIBO stability.\nSymmetric channel mixing matrices further enhance filter flexibility by\nenabling channel-level scaling and shifting in the spectral domain.",

However, existing models primarily\noperate in a binary setting, and the anomaly scores they produce are usually\nbased on the deviation of data points from normal data, which may not\naccurately reflect practical severity. In this paper, we address this gap by\nmaking three key contributions. First, we propose a novel setting, Multilevel\nAD (MAD), in which the anomaly score represents the severity of anomalies in\nreal-world applications, and we highlight its diverse applications across\nvarious domains. Second, we introduce a novel benchmark, MAD-Bench, that\nevaluates models not only on their ability to detect anomalies, but also on how\neffectively their anomaly scores reflect severity. This benchmark incorporates\nmultiple types of baselines and real-world applications involving severity.\nFinally, we conduct a comprehensive performance analysis on MAD-Bench. We\nevaluate models on their ability to assign severity-aligned scores, investigate\nthe correspondence between their performance on binary and multilevel\ndetection, and study their robustness.

    "abstract": "Photorealistic 3D reconstruction of unstructured real-world scenes remains\nchallenging due to complex illumination variations and transient occlusions.\nExisting methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) struggle with inefficient light decoupling and\nstructure-agnostic occlusion handling. To address these limitations, we propose\nNexusSplats, an approach tailored for efficient and high-fidelity 3D scene\nreconstruction under complex lighting and occlusion conditions. In particular,\nNexusSplats leverages a hierarchical light decoupling strategy that performs\ncentralized appearance learning, efficiently and effectively decoupling varying\nlighting conditions. Furthermore, a structure-aware occlusion handling\nmechanism is developed, establishing a nexus between 3D and 2D structures for\nfine-grained occlusion handling. Experimental results demonstrate that\nNexusSplats achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and reduces the number\nof total parameters by 65.4\\%, leading to 2.7$\\times$ faster reconstruction.",

The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is an ideal galaxy for\nstudying individual massive stars and quantifying their feedback contribution\nto the environment.

Deformation occurred by dislocation slip\nactivity in single crystal nickel whereas extensive grain boundary sliding was\nobserved in nanocrystalline nickel, with a shift towards more inhomogeneous,\nlocalized deformation above 1 s-1. The strain rate sensitivity exponent was\nfound to change at higher strain rates for both single crystal and\nnanocrystalline nickel, while the overall strain rate sensitivity was observed\nto be of the same value for both. With increasing high strain rate micropillar\ncompression tests being reported, the issue of adiabatic heating in\nmicropillars becomes important. We report crystal plasticity based finite\nelement modeling to estimate the adiabatic heating, spatially resolved within\nthe pillar, at the highest tested strain rates. The simulations predicted a\nsignificant temperature rise of up to 200 K in nanocrystalline Ni at the grain\nboundaries, and 20 K in single crystalline Ni due to strain localization.\nTransmission Kikuchi Diffraction analysis of nanocrystalline nickel pillar post\ncompression at 10^3 s-1 did not show any grain growth.",

In particular, its intersystem crossing from\nthe first singlet excited state to triplet states has been extensively studied,\nbut experimental or theoretical studies on the preceding internal conversion\nwithin the singlet manifold are very rare. This relaxation mechanism is\nparticularly important because direct population transfer of the first singlet\nexcited state from the ground state is inefficient due to its low oscillator\nstrength. In this work, we aim to fill this gap by employing mixed quantum\nclassical and full quantum dynamics simulations and time-resolved photoelectron\nspectroscopy for gas-phase benzophenone and meta-methyl benzophenone. Our\nresults show that nonadiabatic relaxation via conical intersections leads to a\nlinear increase in the population of the first singlet excited state. This\npopulation transfer due to conical intersections can be directly detected by a\nbifurcation of the photoelectron signal. In addition, we are able to clarify\nthe role of the third singlet excited state degenerate to the second excited\nstate - a topic that remains largely unexplored in the existing literature on\nbenzophenone.",

However, starting from the establishment\nof this prominent concept, the importance of these epigenetic phenomena in\ncancer rarely led to questioning the causal role of genetic alterations. Only\nin the last 10 years, the accumulation of problematic data, better experimental\ntechnologies, and some ambitious models pushed the idea that epigenetics could\nbe at least as important as genetics in early oncogenesis. Until this year, a\ndirect demonstration of epigenetic oncogenesis was still lacking. Now Parreno,\nCavalli and colleagues, using a refined experimental model in the fruit fly\nDrosophila melanogaster, enforced the initiation of tumours solely by imposing\na transient loss of Polycomb repression, leading to a purely epigenetic\noncogenesis phenomenon. Despite a few caveats that we discuss, this pioneering\nwork represents a major breakpoint in cancer research that leads us to consider\nthe theoretical and conceptual implications on oncogenesis and to search for\nlinks between this artificial experimental model and naturally occurring\nprocesses, while revisiting cancer theories that were previously proposed as\nalternatives to the oncogene-centered paradigm.",

In this thesis, we study various experimental schemes for the direct\ndetection of ULDM, both on ground and in space. More precisely, we propose a\ntheoretical modeling of current and futuristic experiments, and we derive an\nestimation of their respective sensitivity. We mainly concentrate on three\ndistinct phenomenologies. The first one is the coupling between a DM U(1)\nfield, known as the dark photon (DP), and electromagnetism, which induces a\nsmall electric field oscillating at the DP Compton frequency. We study how to\ndetect this electric field using atoms inside a cavity and through dish\nantennas. The second main phenomenology considered in this thesis is the\noscillation of rest mass and transition frequencies of atoms and test masses.\nThese oscillations could be produced by the non-universal coupling of standard\nmatter with a scalar ULDM candidate (dilaton or axion-like particle). We study\nhow to detect such couplings in classical tests of the universality of free\nfall (UFF), atom interferometry and using LISA. Finally, we study the effect of\nvacuum birefringence and dichroism induced by the coupling between axions and\nphotons, and how it could be detected with optical cavities, fibers, and LISA.",

The former allow to\nrenormalize the theory for a range of scales which spans several orders of\nmagnitude with a moderate computational cost. Shifted boundary conditions\nremove the need for the zero temperature subtraction in the Equation of State.\nAs a consequence, the simulated lattices do not have to accommodate two very\ndifferent scales, the pion mass and the temperature, at the very same spacing.\nEffective field theory arguments guarantee that finite volume effects can be\nkept under control safely. With this strategy the first computation of the\nhadronic screening spectrum has been carried out over more than two orders of\nmagnitude in the temperature, from $T\\sim 1$ GeV up to $\\sim 160$ GeV. This\nstudy is complemented with the first quantitative computation of the baryonic\nscreening mass at next-to-leading order in the three-dimensional effective\ntheory describing QCD at high temperatures. Both for the mesonic and the\nbaryonic screening masses, the known leading behaviour in the coupling constant\nis found to be not sufficient to explain the non-perturbative data over the\nentire range of temperatures.

Yet it remains challenging to preserve the ID information\nespecially when the degradation is heavy. Current reference-guided face\nrestoration approaches either require face alignment or personalized\ntest-tuning, which are unfaithful or time-consuming. In this paper, we propose\na tuning-free method named RestorerID that incorporates ID preservation during\nface restoration. RestorerID is a diffusion model-based method that restores\nlow-quality images with varying levels of degradation by using a single\nreference image. To achieve this, we propose a unified framework to combine the\nID injection with the base blind face restoration model. In addition, we design\na novel Face ID Rebalancing Adapter (FIR-Adapter) to tackle the problems of\ncontent unconsistency and contours misalignment that are caused by information\nconflicts between the low-quality input and reference image. Furthermore, by\nemploying an Adaptive ID-Scale Adjusting strategy, RestorerID can produce\nsuperior restored images across various levels of degradation. Experimental\nresults on the Celeb-Ref dataset and real-world scenarios demonstrate that\nRestorerID effectively delivers high-quality face restoration with ID\npreservation, achieving a superior performance compared to the test-tuning\napproaches and other reference-guided ones.

In this work, we propose a Deep\nReinforcement Learning (DRL)-based protection system that learns to\ndifferentiate any stealthy load alterations from normal grid operations and\nadaptively adjusts activation thresholds of the protection schemes. We train\nthis adaptive protection scheme against an optimal and stealthy load alteration\nattack model that manipulates the power demands of HVACs at the most unstable\ngrid buses to induce blackouts.

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in decentralized networked systems is to coordinate\nactions of different agents so that they reach a state of agreement. In such\napplications, it is additionally desirable that the actions at various nodes\nmay not be anticipated by malicious eavesdroppers. Motivated by this, we\ninvestigate the problem of secure multi-terminal strong coordination aided by a\nmultiple-access wiretap channel. In this setup, independent and identically\ndistributed copies of correlated sources are observed by two transmitters who\nencode the channel inputs to the MAC-WT. The legitimate receiver observing the\nchannel output and side information correlated with the sources must produce\napproximately i.i.d. copies of an output variable jointly distributed with the\nsources. Furthermore, we demand that an external eavesdropper learns\nessentially nothin g about the sources and the simulated output sequence by\nobserving its own MAC-WT output. This setting is aided by the presence of\nindependent pairwise shared randomness between each encoder and the legitimate\ndecoder, that is unavailable to the eavesdropper. We derive an achievable rate\nregion based on a combination of coordination coding and wiretap coding, along\nwith an outer bound. The inner bound is shown to be tight and a complete\ncharacterization is derived for the special case when the sources are\nconditionally independent given the decoder side information and the legitimate\nchannel is composed of deterministic links. Further, we also analyze a more\ngeneral scenario with possible encoder cooperation, where one of the encoders\ncan non-causally crib from the other encoders input, for which an achievable\nrate region is proposed. We then explicitly compute the rate regions for an\nexample both with and without cribbing between the encoders, and demonstrate\nthat cribbing strictly improves upon the achievable rate region.",

    "abstract": "Underground hydrogen storage in saline aquifers is a potential solution for\nseasonal renewable energy storage. Among potential storage sites, facilities\nused for underground natural gas storage have advantages, including\nwell-characterized cyclical injection-withdrawal behavior and partially\nreusable infrastructure. However, the differences between hydrogen-brine and\nnatural gas-brine flow, particularly through fractures in the reservoir and the\nsealing caprock, remain unclear due to the complexity of two-phase flow.\nTherefore, we investigate fracture relative permeability for hydrogen versus\nmethane (natural gas) and nitrogen (commonly used in laboratories).\nSteady-state relative permeability experiments were conducted at 10 MPa on\nfractured carbonate rock from the Loenhout natural gas storage in Belgium,\nwhere gas flows through {\\textmu}m-to-mm scale fractures. Our results reveal\nthat the hydrogen exhibits similar relative permeability curves to methane, but\nboth are significantly lower than those measured for nitrogen. This implies\nthat nitrogen cannot reliably serve as a proxy for hydrogen at typical\nreservoir pressures. The low relative permeabilities for hydrogen and methane\nindicate strong fluid phase interference, which traditional relative\npermeability models fail to capture. This is supported by our observation of\nperiodic pressure fluctuations associated with intermittent fluid connectivity\nfor hydrogen and methane. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the\nfundamental flow properties of fractured rocks are complex but relatively\nsimilar for hydrogen and natural gas. This is an important insight for\npredictive modeling of the conversion of Loenhout and similar natural gas\nstorage facilities, which is crucial to evaluate their hydrogen storage\nefficiency and integrity.",

First, we leverage GPT-4 to analyze the successful cases of\nRuozhiba questions from the perspective of education, psychology, and cognitive\nscience, deriving a set of explanatory rules.

The super-hydrophobic surface is modeled\nas an alternating distribution of slip and no-slip conditions along the\ncylinder's surface. The smallest unit of this alternating pattern is referred\nto as a monomer. The study takes into account the Reynolds number and two\ncritical dimensionless parameters: the gas fraction (GF) and the ratio l/a. GF\nindicates the proportion of the slip length relative to the total length of the\nmonomer, while l/a denotes the ratio of the monomer length (l) to the\ncylinder's radius (a). The ranges considered for the Reynolds number, GF, and\nl/a are from 0.2 to 180, 0.1 to 0.99, and $\\pi$/80 to $\\pi$/5, respectively. A\ndimensionless number, the Knudsen number (Kn), is introduced to measure the\nratio between the equivalent slip length ($\\lambda$) and the cylinder's\ndiameter (D). By equating the integral wall friction resistance on the cylinder\nsurface, a quantitative relationship between the equivalent Kn and the\nparameters (Re, GF, l/a) is established. A meticulous comparison of flow\nparameters between the equivalent slip length model and the slip-no-slip\nscenario reveals that the slip length model is an effective approximation for\nthe slip-no-slip alternating model.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the knowledge boundary of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge bases, whose\nconstruction is often time-consuming and laborious. If an adversary extracts\nthe knowledge base verbatim, it not only severely infringes the owner's\nintellectual property but also enables the adversary to replicate the\napplication's functionality for unfair competition. Previous works on knowledge\nbase extraction are limited either by low extraction coverage (usually less\nthan 4%) in query-based attacks or by impractical assumptions of white-box\naccess in embedding-based optimization methods. In this work, we propose\nCopyBreakRAG, an agent-based black-box attack that reasons from feedback and\nadaptively generates new adversarial queries for progressive extraction. By\nbalancing exploration and exploitation through curiosity-driven queries and\nfeedback-guided query refinement, our method overcomes the limitations of prior\napproaches and achieves significantly higher extraction coverage in realistic\nblack-box settings. Experimental results show that CopyBreakRAG outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art black-box approach by 45% on average in terms of chunk\nextraction ratio from applications built with mainstream RAG frameworks, and\nextracts over 70% of the data from the knowledge base in applications on\ncommercial platforms including OpenAI's GPTs and ByteDance's Coze when\nessential protection is in place.",

Nevertheless, existing attention mechanisms\nin Transformers have limitations in local feature representation. To address\nthis issue, we propose Global and Local Attention-based Transformer\n(GLAFormer), which incorporates a global and local attention module (GLAM) to\ncombine high-frequency and low-frequency signals. Furthermore, we introduce a\ncross-gating mechanism, called cross-gated feed-forward network (CGFN), to\nemphasize salient features and suppress noise interference. Specifically, the\nGLAM splits attention heads into global and local attention components to\ncapture comprehensive spatial-spectral features. The global attention component\nemploys global attention on downsampled feature maps to capture low-frequency\ninformation, while the local attention component focuses on high-frequency\ndetails using non-overlapping window-based local attention. The CGFN enhances\nthe feature representation via convolutions and cross-gating mechanism in\nparallel paths. The proposed GLAFormer is evaluated on three HSI datasets. The\nresults demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art HSI change detection\nmethods. The source code of GLAFormer is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/summitgao/GLAFormer}.",

    "abstract": "In the dorsal horn, projection neurons play a crucial role in pain processing\nby transmitting sensory stimuli to supraspinal centers during nociception.\nFollowing exposure to intense noxious stimuli, a sensitization process occurs\nthat alters the functional state of the dorsal horn. Notably, projection\nneurons can undergo a switch in firing pattern -- from tonic firing to plateau\npotentials with sustained afterdischarges. For afterdischarges to occur\nfollowing this switch, the neuron must exhibit bistability, defined as the\nability to exhibit resting and spiking states at the same input current\ndepending on the prior context. In many cases, neuronal bistability arises\nthrough the activity of voltage-gated calcium channels. However, computational\nstudies have shown a trade-off between bistability and the plausibility of\nresting states when calcium channels are counterbalanced by voltage-gated\npotassium channels. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of\nrobust bistability, plateau potentials, and sustained afterdischarges through\ncalcium channels remain poorly understood. In this study, we used a\nconductance-based model to investigate how L-type calcium (CaL) channels can\ngive rise to bistability when combined with either M-type potassium (KM)\nchannels or inward-rectifying potassium (Kir) channels. Unlike KM channels, Kir\nchannels enhance bistability. When combined with CaL channels, KM and Kir\nchannels promote distinct forms of bistability, differing in both robustness\nand functional implications. An analysis of their inward and outward current\nproperties revealed that these differences stem from their distinct\nsteady-state current profiles. Altogether, the complementarity between CaL and\nKir channels provides a robust mechanism for central sensitization in the\ndorsal horn.",

Furthermore,\nWARLearn is invaluable in scenarios where data distributions undergo\nsignificant shifts over time, enabling models to remain updated and accurate.\nOur experimental findings reveal a remarkable performance, with a mean average\nprecision (mAP) of 52.6% on unseen real-world foggy dataset (RTTS). Similarly,\nin low light conditions, our framework achieves a mAP of 55.7% on unseen\nreal-world low light dataset (ExDark). Notably, WARLearn surpasses the\nperformance of state-of-the-art frameworks including FeatEnHancer, Image\nAdaptive YOLO, DENet, C2PNet, PairLIE and ZeroDCE, by a substantial margin in\nadverse weather, improving the baseline performance in both foggy and low light\nconditions.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning\nrepresentations of graph data showing state of the art results in various\ntasks. Nevertheless, the superiority of these methods is usually supported by\neither evaluating their performance on small subset of benchmark datasets or by\nreasoning about their expressive power in terms of certain graph isomorphism\ntests. In this paper we critically analyse both these aspects through a\ntransductive setting for the task of node classification. First, we delve\ndeeper into the case of multi-label node classification which offers a more\nrealistic scenario and has been ignored in most of the related works. Through\nanalysing the training dynamics for GNN methods we highlight the failure of\nGNNs to learn over multi-label graph datasets even for the case of abundant\ntraining data. Second, we show that specifically for transductive node\nclassification, even the most expressive GNN may fail to learn in absence of\nnode attributes and without using explicit label information as input. To\novercome this deficit, we propose a straightforward approach, referred to as\nGNN-MultiFix, that integrates the feature, label, and positional information of\na node. GNN-MultiFix demonstrates significant improvement across all the\nmulti-label datasets. We release our code at\nhttps://anonymous.4open.science/r/Graph-MultiFix-4121.",

Adopting a\nYukawa form for the electrostatic potential, we discuss two possible scenarios\nthat differ primarily in their assumptions about entropy evolution. The first,\nout-of-equilibrium scenario assumes that thermal corrections to the potential\nsuch as Debye screening prevent positronium from appearing until the\ntemperature drops below a threshold. Once the threshold is reached, entropy\ngenerated in the QED sector from the equilibration process, if instantaneous,\nleads to a variation in $N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm SM}$ of at most $|\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}|\n\\sim 10^{-4}$, comparable to other uncertainties in the current benchmark value\nfor $N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm SM}$. A more gradual formation could however yield a\nlarger change. The second, equilibrium scenario assumes the QED sector to stay\nin equilibrium at all times. In this case, we show that cancellations between\nthe first, $s$-wave bound- and scattering-states contributions ensure that it\nis possible to evolve the system across the bound-state formation threshold\nwithout generating entropy in the QED sector. The corresponding change in\n$N_{\\rm eff}^{\\rm SM}$ then closely matches the $\\mathcal{O}(e^2)$ perturbative\nresult derived in previous works and the $\\mathcal{O}(e^4)$ contribution is\ncapped at $|\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}| \\lesssim 10^{-6}$.

However, designing a FM that is suitable for a given\napplication problem is a significant challenge. In light of this, this study\nproposes an Enhanced Quantum Neural Network (EQNN), which includes an Enhanced\nFeature Map (EFM) designed in this research. This EFM effectively maps input\nvariables to a value range more suitable for quantum computing, serving as the\ninput to the variational model to improve accuracy. In the experimental\nenvironment, this study uses mobile data usage prediction as a case study,\nrecommending appropriate rate plans based on users' mobile data usage.

    "abstract": "In recent years, it has been rather fashionable to talk about geometric\ntrinity of gravity. The main idea is that one can formally present the gravity\nequations in different terms, those of either torsion or nonmetricity instead\nof curvature. It starts from a very erroneous claim that the Levi-Civita\nconnection, and therefore the (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry itself, are nothing\nbut an arbitrary choice. The point is that, as long as we admit the need of\nhaving a metric for describing gravity, the standard approach does not involve\nany additional independent geometric structures on top of that. At the same\ntime, any other metric-affine model does go for genuinely new stuff. In\nparticular, the celebrated teleparallel framework introduces a notion of yet\nanother parallel transport which is flat. It gives us curious new ways of\nmodifying gravity, even though very often quite problematic. However, in\nGR-equivalent models, we only get a new language for describing the same\nphysics, in terms of absolutely unobservable and unpredictable geometrical\ninventions.

CKTSO is a parallel solver and can be run\non a multi-core, shared-memory computer. The algorithms of CKTSO are designed\nby considering the features of matrices involved in SPICE simulations. CKTSO is\nsuperior to existing similar solvers mainly in the following three aspects.\nFirst, the matrix ordering step of CKTSO combines different types of ordering\nalgorithms such that it can generally obtain the fewest fill-ins for a wide\nrange of circuit matrices. Second, CKTSO provides a parallel fast LU\nfactorization algorithm with pivot check, which behaves good performance,\nscalability, and numerical stability. Third, CKTSO provides a\nstructure-adaptive hybrid parallel triangular solving algorithm, which can\nadapt to various circuit matrices. Experiments including both benchmark tests\nand SPICE simulations demonstrate the superior performance of CKTSO. The\nlibraries of CKTSO are available at https://github.com/chenxm1986/cktso.",

By leveraging deep feature learning through AGOP, RFM\nachieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in predicting molecular properties, as\ndemonstrated through solubility prediction across nine benchmark datasets. To\ncapture a wide array of structural information, we employ diverse molecular\nrepresentations, including MACCS keys, Morgan fingerprints, and a custom\nmulti-scale hybrid fingerprint (HF) derived from global descriptors and SMILES\nlocal fragmentation techniques. Notably, the HF offers significant advantages\nover MACCS and Morgan fingerprints in revealing structural determinants of\nmolecular properties. The feature importance analysis in RFM provides robust\nlocal and global explanations, effectively identifying structural features that\ndrive molecular behavior and offering valuable insights for drug development.\nAdditionally, RFM demonstrates strong redundancy-filtering abilities, as model\nperformance remains stable even after removing redundant features within custom\nfingerprints. Importantly, RFM introduces the deep feature learning\ncapabilities of the average gradient outer product (AGOP) matrix into\nultra-fast kernel machine learning, to imbue kernel machines with interpretable\ndeep feature learning capabilities. We extend this approach beyond the Laplace\nKernel to the Matern, Rational Quadratic, and Gaussian kernels, to find that\nthe Matern and Laplace kernels deliver the best performance, thus reinforcing\nthe flexibility and effectiveness of AGOP in RFM.

It is believed to be small by the virtue of low photon momentum\ncompared to the typical momenta of the charge carriers. Here, we show that\nphoton drag becomes particularly strong at the junctions between metals and 2d\nmaterials, wherein highly non-uniform local EM fields are generated upon\ndiffraction. To this end, we combine an exact theory of diffraction at\n'metal-2d material' junctions with microscopic transport theory of photon drag,\nand derive the functional dependences of the respective photovoltage on the\nparameters of EM field and 2d system. The voltage responsivity appears\ninversely proportional to the electromagnetic frequency $\\omega$, the sheet\ndensity of charge, and a dimensionless momentum transfer coefficient $\\alpha$\nwhich depends only on 2d conductivity in units of light speed $\\eta = 2\\pi\n\\sigma/c$ and light polarization. For $p$-polarized incident light, the\nmomentum transfer coefficient appears finite even for vanishingly small 2d\nconductivity $\\eta$, which is a consequence of dynamic lightning rod effect.\nFor $s$-polarized incident light, the momentum transfer coefficient scales as\n$\\eta \\ln \\eta^{-1}$, which stems from long-range dipole radiation of a linear\njunction. A simple estimate shows that the ratio of thermoelectric and photon\ndrag photovoltages at the junction for $p$-polarization is roughly\n$\\omega\\tau_\\varepsilon$, where $\\tau_\\varepsilon$ is the energy relaxation\ntime, while for $s$-polarization the photon drag always dominates over the\nthermoelectric effect.",

We analyze the closed QB scenario by analytically\nevaluating ergotropy across different spin-spin couplings, anisotropies in spin\ninteractions, Zeeman field strengths, charging field intensities, $\\Gamma$\ninteractions, and temperature. Our results indicate that the ergotropy is\nhighly dependent on spin-spin coupling and anisotropy. Under variable\nparameters, an increase in the spin-spin coupling strength displays quenches\nand exhibits non-equilibrium trends in ergotropy. After a quench, ergotropy may\nexperience a sharp increase or drop, suggesting optimal operational conditions\nfor QB performance. In the open QB scenario, we examine spin chains of sizes $2\n\\leq N \\leq 8$ under the influence of dephasing, focusing on the evolution of\nergotropy. We study two charging schemes: parallel charging, where spins are\nnon-interacting, and collective charging, involving spin-spin coupling. In the\nformer, increased Zeeman field strength enhances both the peak ergotropy and\ncharging rate, although without any quantum advantage or super-extensive\nscaling. In the latter, increasing spin-spin coupling might not achieve\nsuper-extensive scaling without introducing anisotropy in the spin-spin\ninteraction. Our results suggest that optimal QB performance and a quantum\nadvantage in scaling can be achieved by leveraging anisotropic spin-spin\ncouplings and non-zero $\\Gamma$ interactions, allowing for faster charging and\nhigher ergotropy under super-extensive scaling conditions up to $\\alpha=1.24$\nfor the given size of the spin chain.",

The presence of dark\nmatter influences the orbital evolution of the secondary compact object through\ndynamic friction, which leads to a phase shift in the gravitational waveform\ncompared to the vacuum case. Our analysis shows that the proposed Indian\nspace-based detector GWSat, operating in the deciHz frequency band, provides\nthe most stringent constraints on the dark matter spike parameters, as IMRIs\nspend a significant portion of their inspiral phase within its sensitivity\nrange. While third-generation ground-based detectors such as the Einstein\nTelescope and Cosmic Explorer offer additional constraints, their contribution\nis somewhat limited, particularly for higher-mass systems where the signal\nduration in their frequency bands is shorter.

    "abstract": "We explore the connections between clusters and least common ancestors (LCAs)\nin directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), focusing on the interplay between so-called\n$I$-lca-relevant DAGs and DAGs with the $I$-lca-property. Here, $I$ denotes a\nset of integers. In $I$-lca-relevant DAGs, each vertex is the unique LCA for\nsome subset $A$ of leaves of size $|A|\\in I$, whereas in a DAG with the\n$I$-lca-property there exists a unique LCA for every subset $A$ of leaves\nsatisfying $|A|\\in I$. We elaborate on the difference between these two\nproperties and establish their close relationship to pre-$I$-ary and $I$-ary\nset systems. This, in turn, generalizes results established for (pre-)binary\nand $k$-ary set systems. Moreover, we build upon recently established results\nthat use a simple operator $\\ominus$, enabling the transformation of arbitrary\nDAGs into $I$-lca-relevant DAGs. This process reduces unnecessary complexity\nwhile preserving key structural properties of the original DAG. The set $C_G$\nconsists of all clusters in a DAG $G$, where clusters correspond to the\ndescendant leaves of vertices. While in some cases $C_H = C_G$ when\ntransforming $G$ into an $I$-lca-relevant DAG $H$, it often happens that\ncertain clusters in $C_G$ do not appear as clusters in $H$. To understand this\nphenomenon in detail, we characterize the subset of clusters in $C_G$ that\nremain in $H$ for DAGs $G$ with the $I$-lca-property. Furthermore, we show that\nthe set $W$ of vertices required to transform $G$ into $H = G \\ominus W$ is\nuniquely determined for such DAGs. This, in turn, allows us to show that the\n``shortcut-free'' version of the transformed DAG $H$ is always a tree or a\ngalled-tree whenever $C_G$ represents the clustering system of a tree or\ngalled-tree and $G$ has the $I$-lca-property.

Further analysis\ndemonstrates the robustness of DRPruning towards various domains and\ndistribution shifts. Furthermore, DRPruning can determine optimal reference\nlosses and data ratios automatically, suggesting potential for broader\napplications.

In this paper, we propose a learning-based resource\nallocation scheme in an ultra-dense UAV communication network, where the GUs'\nservice demands are time-varying with unknown distributions. We formulate the\nnon-cooperative game among multiple co-channel UAVs as a stochastic game, where\neach UAV jointly optimizes its trajectory, user association, and downlink power\ncontrol to maximize the expectation of its locally cumulative energy efficiency\nunder the interference and energy constraints. To cope with the scalability\nissue in a large-scale network, we further formulate the problem as a\nmean-field game (MFG), which simplifies the interactions among the UAVs into a\ntwo-player game between a representative UAV and a mean-field. We prove the\nexistence and uniqueness of the equilibrium for the MFG, and propose a\nmodel-free mean-field reinforcement learning algorithm named maximum entropy\nmean-field deep Q network (ME-MFDQN) to solve the mean-field equilibrium in\nboth fully and partially observable scenarios. The simulation results reveal\nthat the proposed algorithm improves the energy efficiency compared with the\nbenchmark algorithms.

A prominent example of ambiguous line shape is the set of\npentaquark signals observed by LHCb in 2019.

In this work, we leverage the model-selection\ncapability of deep neural networks to analyze and identify the nature of\n$P_{c\\bar{c}}(4457)^+$. We trained a set of deep neural networks using line\nshapes with enhancements produced by triangle singularities and those produced\nby nearby poles.

The\ntraining line shapes for the pole-based classifications are generated using\nuniformized independent $S$-matrix poles configured to appear close to the\nrelevant threshold. We found that, despite the presence of experimental\nuncertainties, the triangle mechanism is ruled out by the experimental data.\nThe results also suggest that the data favor the pole-shadow pair\ninterpretation for the $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4457)^+$, which corresponds to a\ncharacteristic pole structure involving a resonance in a two-channel scattering\nsystem.

Our\nanalysis reveals several empirical relations within the clusters, including the\n${\\rm log \\,}\\Delta t_{sc}-{\\rm log \\,}\\Delta t_{rw}$, ${\\rm log \\,}\\Delta\nt_{sc}-{\\rm log \\,}T_B$, and $r - \\gamma$ correlations, where ${\\Delta t_{sc},\n\\Delta t_{rw}, T_B, r, \\gamma}$ represent scattering time, rest-frame width,\nbrightness temperature, spectral running, and spectral index, respectively. The\nChow test results reveal that while some repeaters and non-repeaters share\nsimilar empirical relationships, the overall distinctions between the two\ngroups remain significant, reinforcing the classification of FRBs into\nrepeaters and non-repeaters. These findings provide new insights into the\nphysical properties and emission mechanisms of FRBs. This study demonstrates\nthe effectiveness of unsupervised learning in classifying FRBs and identifying\npotential repeaters, paving the way for more precise investigations into their\norigins and applications in cosmology. Future improvements in observational\ndata and machine learning methodologies are expected to further enhance our\nunderstanding of FRBs.",

To address this, a deep learning-based medical image captioning\nsystem was developed, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks with a\nBidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit network.

Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach\nover baseline methods, with the proposed model achieving superior performance\nin generating accurate and informative captions, as indicated by higher BLEU\nand ROUGE scores.

    "abstract": "Computing a Euclidean minimum spanning tree of a set of points is a seminal\nproblem in computational geometry and geometric graph theory. We combine it\nwith another classical problem in graph drawing, namely computing a monotone\ngeometric representation of a given graph. More formally, given a finite set\n$S$ of points in the plane and a finite set $\\cal D$ of directions, a geometric\nspanning tree $T$ with vertex set $S$ is ${\\cal D}$-monotone if, for every pair\n$\\{u,v\\}$ of vertices of $T$, there exists a direction $d \\in \\cal D$ for which\nthe unique path from $u$ to $v$ in $T$ is monotone with respect to $d$. We\nprovide a characterization of ${\\cal D}$-monotone spanning trees. Based on it,\nwe show that a ${\\cal D}$-monotone spanning tree of minimum length can be\ncomputed in polynomial time if the number $k=|{\\cal D}|$ of directions is\nfixed, both when (i) the set ${\\cal D}$ of directions is prescribed and when\n(ii) the objective is to find a minimum-length ${\\cal D}$-monotone spanning\ntree over all sets ${\\cal D}$ of $k$ directions. For $k = 2$, we describe\nalgorithms that are much faster than those for the general case. Furthermore,\nin contrast to the classical Euclidean minimum spanning tree, whose vertex\ndegree is at most six, we show that for every even integer $k$, there exists a\npoint set $S_k$ and a set $\\cal D$ of $k$ directions such that any\nminimum-length $\\cal D$-monotone spanning tree of $S_k$ has maximum vertex\ndegree $2k$.",

Experiments conducted on six\nheterogeneous graph datasets show that despite lacking structural dependencies,\nHG2Ms can still achieve competitive or even better performance than HGNNs and\nsignificantly outperform vanilla MLPs.

    "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis (CD) aims to reveal students' proficiency in specific\nknowledge concepts. With the increasing adoption of intelligent education\napplications, accurately assessing students' knowledge mastery has become an\nurgent challenge. Although existing cognitive diagnosis frameworks enhance\ndiagnostic accuracy by analyzing students' explicit response records, they\nprimarily focus on individual knowledge state, failing to adequately reflect\nthe relative ability performance of students within hierarchies. To address\nthis, we propose the Hierarchy Constraint-Aware Cognitive Diagnosis Framework\n(HCD), designed to more accurately represent student ability performance within\nreal educational contexts. Specifically, the framework introduces a hierarchy\nmapping layer to identify students' levels. It then employs a hierarchy\nconvolution-enhanced attention layer for in-depth analysis of knowledge\nconcepts performance among students at the same level, uncovering nuanced\ndifferences. A hierarchy inter-sampling attention layer captures performance\ndifferences across hierarchies, offering a comprehensive understanding of the\nrelationships among students' knowledge state. Finally, through personalized\ndiagnostic enhancement, the framework integrates hierarchy constraint\nperception features with existing models, improving the representation of both\nindividual and group characteristics. This approach enables precise inference\nof students' knowledge state. Research shows that this framework not only\nreasonably constrains changes in students' knowledge states to align with real\neducational settings, but also supports the scientific rigor and fairness of\neducational assessments, thereby advancing the field of cognitive diagnosis.",

This scenario raises questions about the practical utility of ML in\nuncovering new and significant material classes for industrial applications.\nHere, we propose a data-driven framework aimed at accelerating the discovery of\nnew transparent conducting materials (TCMs), an important category of\nsemiconductors with a wide range of applications. To mitigate the shortage of\navailable data, we create and validate unique experimental databases,\ncomprising several examples of existing TCMs. We assess state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nML models for property prediction from the stoichiometry alone. We propose a\nbespoke evaluation scheme to provide empirical evidence on the ability of ML to\nuncover new, previously unseen materials of interest. We test our approach on a\nlist of 55 compositions containing typical elements of known TCMs. Although our\nstudy indicates that ML tends to identify new TCMs compositionally similar to\nthose in the training data, we empirically demonstrate that it can highlight\nmaterial candidates that may have been previously overlooked, offering a\nsystematic approach to identify materials that are likely to display TCMs\ncharacteristics.",

The control is distributed and acts on a small\nsubset of the domain. The main goal is to compute numerically a control that\ndrives a numerical approximation of the state from prescribed initial data\nexactly to zero. We introduce a methodology for solving numerical\ncontrollability problems that is new in some sense. The main idea is to apply\nclassical Lagrangian and Augmented Lagrangian techniques to suitable\nconstrained extremal formulations that involve unbounded weights in time that\nmake global Carleman inequalities possible.

    "abstract": "Simultaneous Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces\n(STAR-RISs) are being explored for the next generation of sixth-generation (6G)\nnetworks. A promising configuration for their deployment is within cell-free\nmassive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, despite the\nadvantages that STAR-RISs could bring, challenges such as electromagnetic\ninterference (EMI) and phase errors may lead to significant performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we investigate the impact of EMI and phase errors\non STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems and propose techniques to\nmitigate these effects. We introduce a novel projected gradient descent (GD)\nalgorithm for STAR-RIS coefficient matrix design by minimizing the local\nchannel estimation normalised mean square error. We also derive the closed-form\nexpressions of the uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) to analyze\nsystem performance with EMI and phase errors, in which fractional power control\nmethods are applied for performance improvement. The results reveal that the\nprojected GD algorithm can effectively tackle EMI and phase errors to improve\nestimation accuracy and compensate for performance degradation with nearly\n$10\\%\\sim20\\%$ SE improvement. Moreover, increasing access points (APs),\nantennas per AP, and STAR-RIS elements can also improve SE performance.\nApplying STAR-RIS in the proposed system achieves a larger $25\\%$-likely SE\nthan conventional RISs. However, the advantages of employing more STAR-RIS\nelements are reduced when EMI is severe.",

    "abstract": "When malware employs an unseen zero-day exploit, traditional security\nmeasures such as vulnerability scanners and antivirus software can fail to\ndetect them. This is because these tools rely on known patches and signatures,\nwhich do not exist for new zero-day attacks. Furthermore, existing machine\nlearning methods, which are trained on specific and occasionally outdated\nmalware samples, may struggle to adapt to features in new malware. To address\nthis issue, there is a need for a more robust machine learning model that can\nidentify relationships between malware samples without being trained on a\nparticular malware feature set. This is particularly crucial in the field of\ncybersecurity, where the number of malware samples is limited and obfuscation\ntechniques are widely used. Current approaches using stacked autoencoders aim\nto remove the noise introduced by obfuscation techniques through reconstruction\nof the input. However, this approach ignores the semantic relationships between\nfeatures across different malware samples. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a novel Siamese Neural Network (SNN) that uses relation-aware\nembeddings to calculate more accurate similarity probabilities based on\nsemantic details of different malware samples. In addition, by using entropy\nimages as inputs, our model can extract better structural information and\nsubtle differences in malware signatures, even in the presence of obfuscation\ntechniques. Evaluations on two large malware sample sets using the N-shot and\nN-way methods show that our proposed model is highly effective in predicting\npreviously unseen malware, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic shear surveys serve as a powerful tool for mapping the underlying\nmatter density field, including non-visible dark matter. A key challenge in\ncosmic shear surveys is the accurate reconstruction of lensing convergence\n($\\kappa$) maps from shear catalogs impacted by survey boundaries and masks,\nwhich seminal Kaiser-Squires (KS) method are not designed to handle. To\novercome these limitations, we previously proposed the Accurate Kappa\nReconstruction Algorithm (AKRA), a prior-free maximum likelihood map-making\nmethod. Initially designed for flat sky scenarios with periodic boundary\nconditions, AKRA has proven successful in recovering high-precision $\\kappa$\nmaps from masked shear catalogs. In this work, we upgrade AKRA to AKRA 2.0 by\nintegrating the tools designed for spherical geometry. This upgrade employs\nspin-weighted spherical harmonic transforms to reconstruct the convergence\nfield over the full sky. To optimize computational efficiency, we implement a\nscale-splitting strategy that segregates the analysis into two parts:\nlarge-scale analysis on the sphere (referred to as AKRA-sphere) and small-scale\nanalysis on the flat sky (referred to as AKRA-flat); the results from both\nanalyses are then combined to produce final reconstructed $\\kappa$ map. We\ntested AKRA 2.0 using simulated shear catalogs with various masks,\ndemonstrating that the reconstructed $\\kappa$ map by AKRA 2.0 maintains high\naccuracy. For the reconstructed $\\kappa$ map in unmasked regions, the\nreconstructed convergence power spectrum $C_\\kappa^{\\rm{rec}}$ and the\ncorrelation coefficient with the true $\\kappa$ map $r_\\ell$ achieve accuracies\nof $(1-C_\\ell^{\\rm{rec}}/C_\\ell^{\\rm{true}}) \\lesssim 1\\%$ and $(1-r_\\ell)\n\\lesssim 1\\%$, respectively. Our algorithm is capable of straightforwardly\nhandling further issues such as inhomogeneous shape measurement noise, which we\nwill address in subsequent analysis.",

It\nbegins with an introduction to the mathematics and intuition behind effective\nfield theory (EFT) corrections to General Relativity (GR) pitched at the level\nof a first year postgraduate course. Chapter 3 contains a similarly accessible\ndiscussion of the laws of black hole mechanics, their derivation in GR, and why\nthey are a particularly interesting setting in which to apply EFT.\n  The novel research is contained in Chapters 2 and 4-7. The first of these\nstudies the well-posedness of gravitational EFTs. Specifically, we show that a\n\"modified harmonic\" gauge produces a strongly hyperbolic formulation of the\nleading order Einstein-Maxwell EFT so long as the higher derivative terms are\nsmall. The latter Chapters are concerned with proving the validity of the laws\nof black hole mechanics in EFTs of gravity and broad classes of matter fields.\nWe demonstrate that the zeroth law can be proved for EFTs of gravity,\nelectromagnetism and a charged or uncharged scalar field. We find we must\nmodify the statements of the first and second laws by generalizing the formula\nof black hole entropy from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy used in GR. For\nstationary black holes, the Wald entropy is a sufficient definition to satisfy\nthe first law in EFT. For dynamical black holes we show that with further\ncorrections we can prove a non-perturbative second law. We discuss the gauge\ndependence of this definition of dynamical black hole entropy and provide\nexplicit constructions for specific EFTs.",

    "abstract": "One of the theoretical motivations behind the belief that black holes as\ndescribed by general relativity exist in nature is that it is hard to find\nmatter configurations that mimic their properties, especially their\ncompactness. One of the classic results that goes in this direction is the\nsocalled Buchdahl limit: a bound for the maximum compactness that spherically\nsymmetric isotropic fluid spheres in hydrostatic equilibrium can possibly\nachieve with an outward-decreasing energy density. However, physically\nrealistic situations could violate both isotropy and the monotonicity of the\ndensity profile. Notably, Bondi already showed that if the density profile is\nallowed to be arbitrary (but remains non-negative), a less restrictive\ncompactness bound emerges. Furthermore, if negative energy densities are\npermitted, configurations can approach the black hole compactness limit\narbitrarily closely. In this work we introduce a set of simple bilayered and\nthin-shell toy models designed to illustrate the effect of relaxing separately\nthe assumptions of Buchdahl's theorem. Within these models we highlight the\nexistence of two special examples that we have called AdS stars and Einstein\nStatic stars. We also discuss how these toy models may represent some of the\nmain features of realistic systems, and how they could be extended to find more\nrefined models.",

This work addresses this\nthreat by introducing a simple, training-free, yet effective approach for\ndetecting AI-generated speech and attributing it to its source model.\nSpecifically, we tackle three key tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an\nopen-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether a given audio sample\nwas generated by a specific target neural speech synthesis system (with access\nonly to data from that system); (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world\nsetting, where the objective is to identify the generating system from a known\npool of candidates; and last but not least (3) detection of synthetic versus\nreal speech. Our approach leverages standardized average residuals-the\ndifference between an input audio signal and its filtered version using either\na low-pass filter or the EnCodec audio autoencoder. We demonstrate that these\nresiduals consistently capture artifacts introduced by diverse speech synthesis\nsystems, serving as distinctive, model-agnostic fingerprints for attribution.\nAcross extensive experiments, our approach achieves AUROC scores exceeding 99%\nin most scenarios, evaluated on augmented benchmark datasets that pair real\nspeech with synthetic audio generated by multiple synthesis systems.

A comprehensive analysis of the experimental data was performed\nin the framework of the simple three-band Eliashberg model under the assumption\nthat the superconducting coupling mechanism is mediated by antiferromagnetic\nspin fluctuations. The results of independent experiments support the choice of\nmodel parameters. Based on calculations of the temperature dependences of\nsuperconducting gaps, we may conclude that the obtained results are compatible\nwith the scenario, in which Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ is a multiband\nsuperconductor with s$_\\pm $-wave pairing symmetry.",

The first model\ninvolves one-sided preferences, where a set of indivisible items is allocated\namong a group of agents (commonly studied in fair division). The second model\ndeals with two-sided preferences, where a set of workers and firms, each having\nnumerical valuations for the other side, are matched with each other (commonly\nstudied in matching-under-preferences literature). We study these models under\ncapacity constraints, which restrict the number of items (respectively,\nworkers) that an agent (respectively, a firm) can receive.\n  We develop constant-factor approximation algorithms for both problems under a\nbroad class of valuations. Specifically, our main results are the following:\n(a) For any $\\epsilon > 0$, a $(6+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the\none-sided problem when agents have submodular valuations, and (b) a\n$1.33$-approximation algorithm for the two-sided problem when the firms have\nsubadditive valuations. The former result provides the first constant-factor\napproximation algorithm for Nash welfare in the one-sided problem with\nsubmodular valuations and capacities, while the latter result improves upon an\nexisting $\\sqrt{OPT}$-approximation algorithm for additive valuations. Our\nresult for the two-sided setting also establishes a computational separation\nbetween the Nash and utilitarian welfare objectives.

Currently, the best methods typically employ an indirect\nstrategy, which identifies 2D and 3D correspondences, and then solves with the\nPerspective-n-Points method. Yet, this approach cannot be trained end-to-end.\nDirect methods, on the other hand, suffer from lower accuracy due to challenges\nsuch as varying object sizes and occlusions. To address these issues, we\npropose SEMPose, an end-to-end multi-object pose estimation network.

Additionally, it\nemploys an iterative refinement head structure, progressively regressing\nrotation and translation separately to enhance estimation accuracy. During\ntraining, we alleviate the impact of occlusion by selecting positive samples\nfrom visible parts. Experimental results demonstrate that SEMPose can perform\ninference at 32 FPS without requiring inputs other than the RGB image. It can\naccurately estimate the poses of multiple objects in real time, with inference\ntime unaffected by the number of target objects.

In practice,\nWSIs usually come from different hospitals or laboratories, which can be seen\nas different domains, and thus may have significant differences in imaging\nequipment, processing procedures, and sample sources. These differences\ngenerally result in large gaps in distribution between different WSI domains,\nand thus the survival analysis models trained on one domain may fail to\ntransfer to another. To address this issue, we propose a Dual-branch Encoder\nand Two-level Alignment (DETA) framework to explore both feature and\ncategory-level alignment between different WSI domains. Specifically, we first\nformulate the concerned problem as graph domain adaptation (GDA) by virtue the\ngraph representation of WSIs. Then we construct a dual-branch graph encoder,\nincluding the message passing branch and the shortest path branch, to\nexplicitly and implicitly extract semantic information from the\ngraph-represented WSIs. To realize GDA, we propose a two-level alignment\napproach: at the category level, we develop a coupling technique by virtue of\nthe dual-branch structure, leading to reduced divergence between the category\ndistributions of the two domains; at the feature level, we introduce an\nadversarial perturbation strategy to better augment source domain feature,\nresulting in improved alignment in feature distribution. To the best of our\nknowledge, our work is the first attempt to alleviate the domain shift issue\nfor WSI data analysis.

The\nconfiguration in which the energy conversion element is located upstream of the\nelement which passively drives the evaporative flow has rarely been studied.\nHowever, this configuration offers the possibility of increasing the harvested\nenergy simply by increasing the evaporation surface area and/or the hydraulic\nresistance of the energy conversion element. In this work, we investigate this\nconfiguration with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) chips playing the role of {\\it\nartificial leaves} driving a pervaporation-induced flow through a polystyrene\ncolloid plug in a submillimetre tube for the energy conversion. With an\nappropriate design of the venation of the PDMS leaves, we report the first\nexperimental evidence of electrokinetic energy conversion from\npervaporation-induced flows, which increases with the pervaporation area. We\nalso provide new insights by demonstrating that this increase is limited by\ncavitation within the PDMS leaves, which occurs systematically as soon as the\nwater pressure inside the leaf reaches $P_\\text{leaf} \\simeq 0$~bar. Whatever\nthe cavitation threshold, this phenomenon imposes an intrinsic limit on this\nconfiguration, underlining the need for innovative strategies to improve the\nharvesting of electrokinetic energy by evaporation.",

    "abstract": "In the pursuit of designing safer and more efficient energy-absorbing\nstructures, engineers must tackle the challenge of improving crush performance\nwhile balancing multiple conflicting objectives, such as maximising energy\nabsorption and minimising peak impact forces. Accurately simulating real-world\nconditions necessitates the use of complex material models to replicate the\nnon-linear behaviour of materials under impact, which comes at a significant\ncomputational cost. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a\nmulti-objective Bayesian optimisation framework specifically developed to\noptimise spinodoid structures for crush energy absorption. Spinodoid\nstructures, characterised by their scalable, non-periodic topologies and\nefficient stress distribution, offer a promising direction for advanced\nstructural design. However, optimising design parameters to enhance crush\nperformance is far from straightforward, particularly under realistic\nconditions. Conventional optimisation methods, although effective, often\nrequire a large number of costly simulations to identify suitable solutions,\nmaking the process both time-consuming and resource intensive. In this context,\nmulti-objective Bayesian optimisation provides a clear advantage by\nintelligently navigating the design space, learning from each evaluation to\nreduce the number of simulations required, and efficiently addressing the\ncomplexities of non-linear material behaviour. By integrating finite element\nanalysis with Bayesian optimisation, the framework developed in this study\ntackles the dual challenge of improving energy absorption and reducing peak\nforce, particularly in scenarios where plastic deformation plays a critical\nrole. The use of scalarisation and hypervolume-based techniques enables the\nidentification of Pareto-optimal solutions, balancing these conflicting\nobjectives.",

    "abstract": "Context. Dusty debris discs around main sequence stars are observed to vary\nwidely in terms of their vertical thickness. Their vertical structure may be\naffected by damping in inelastic collisions. Although kinetic models have often\nbeen used to study the collisional evolution of debris discs, these models have\nnot yet been used to study the evolution of their vertical structure. Aims. We\nextend an existing implementation of a kinetic model of collisional evolution\nto include the evolution of orbital inclinations and we use this model to study\nthe effects of collisional damping in pre-stirred discs. Methods. We evolved\nthe number of particles of different masses, eccentricities, and inclinations\nusing the kinetic model and used Monte Carlo simulations to calculate collision\nrates between particles in the disc. We considered all relevant collisional\noutcomes including fragmentation, cratering, and growth. Results. Collisional\ndamping is inefficient if particles can be destroyed by projectiles that are of\nmuch lower mass. If that is the case, catastrophic disruptions shape the\ndistributions of eccentricities and inclinations, and their average values\nevolve slowly and at the same rate for all particle sizes. Conclusions. The\ncritical projectile-to-target mass ratio (Yc) and the collisional timescale\njointly determine the level of collisional damping in debris discs. If Yc is\nmuch smaller than unity, a debris disc retains the inclination distribution\nthat it is born with for much longer than the collisional timescale of the\nlargest bodies in the disc. Such a disc should exhibit a vertical thickness\nthat is independent of wavelength even in the absence of other physical\nprocesses. Collisional damping is efficient if Yc is of order unity or larger.\nFor millimetre-sized dust grains and common material strength assumptions, this\nrequires collision velocities of lower than ~40 m/s.

Recent works have observed redundancy within transformer\nblocks and developed compression methods by structured pruning of less\nimportant blocks. However, such direct removal often leads to irreversible\nperformance degradation. In this paper, we propose FuseGPT, a novel methodology\ndesigned to recycle pruned transformer blocks, thereby recovering the model's\nperformance. Firstly, we introduce a new importance detection metric, Macro\nInfluence (MI), which evaluates the long-term impact of each transformer block\nby quantifying the information loss incurred upon its removal. Next, we propose\ngroup-level layer fusion, which leverages the parameters from layers of less\nimportant blocks and integrates them into the corresponding layers of\nneighboring blocks. This fusion process is not a one-time operation but is\nrefined through iterative parameter updates by lightweight group-level\nfine-tuning. Specifically, the injected parameters are frozen but are weighted\nwith learnable rank decomposition matrices to reduce the computational overhead\nduring fine-tuning. Our approach not only works well for large language models\nbut also for large multimodal models.

Using the PPP model, coupled cluster\nmethodologies, CCSDTQ and CCSDT(Q), are then used to benchmark CCSDT and\nCCSD(T) methodologies for non-covalent interactions in large one- and\ntwo-dimensional molecular systems up to the dibenzocoronene dimer. We show that\nCCSD(T) demonstrates no signs of overestimating the interaction energy for\nthese systems. Furthermore, by examining the Hartree-Fock HOMO-LUMO gap of\nthese large molecules, the perturbative treatment of the triples contribution\nin CCSD(T) is not expected to cause problems for accurately capturing the\ninteraction energy for system sizes up to at least circumcoronene.",

    "abstract": "Backscatter communication (BC) becomes a promising energy-efficient solution\nfor future wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\nenable flexible data collection from remote backscatter devices (BDs), yet\nconventional UAVs rely on omni-directional fixed-position antennas (FPAs),\nlimiting channel gain and prolonging data collection time. To address this\nissue, we consider equipping a UAV with a directional movable antenna (MA) with\nhigh directivity and flexibility. The MA enhances channel gain by precisely\naiming its main lobe at each BD, focusing transmission power for efficient\ncommunication. Our goal is to minimize the total data collection time by\njointly optimizing the UAV's trajectory and the MA's orientation. We develop a\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based strategy using the azimuth angle and\ndistance between the UAV and each BD to simplify the agent's observation space.\nTo ensure stability during training, we adopt Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm\nthat balances exploration with reward maximization for efficient and reliable\nlearning. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MA-equipped UAV with\nSAC outperforms both FPA-equipped UAVs and other RL methods, achieving\nsignificant reductions in both data collection time and energy consumption.",

    "abstract": "The afterglow of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been extensively discussed in\nthe context of shocks generated during an interaction of relativistic outflows\nwith their ambient medium. This process leads to the formation of both a\nforward and a reverse shock. While the emission from the forward shock,\nobserved off-axis, has been well-studied as a potential electromagnetic\ncounterpart to a gravitational wave-detected merger, the contribution of the\nreverse shock is commonly overlooked. In this paper, we investigate the\ncontribution of the reverse shock to the GRB afterglows observed off-axis. In\nour analysis, we consider jets with different angular profiles, including\ntwo-component jets, power-law structured jets, Gaussian jets and 'mixed jets'\nfeaturing a Poynting-flux-dominated core surrounded by a baryonic wing. We\napply our model to GRB 170817A/GW170817 and employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) method to obtain model parameters. Our findings suggest that the reverse\nshock emission can significantly contribute to the early afterglow.

    "abstract": "Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a\nlong-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality\nof the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law\n(SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law\nwith respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \\propto Q^{\\delta}$\nwith $\\delta \\approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\\delta$\nshould be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend\nthat $\\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries,\nimplying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision\nmeasurements of $\\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks,\nwhich has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic\ndatasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual\naccounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL\nby a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo\nStock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic\ndataset, we show that the exponent $\\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within\nstatistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader\nlevel. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the\nnonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the\nFarmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models. Our work provides exceptionally\nhigh-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and\ncould prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an\nimportant topic even among practitioners.",

    "abstract": "Run-and-Tumble Particles (RTPs) are a key model of active matter. They are\ncharacterized by alternating phases of linear travel and random direction\nreshuffling. By this dynamic behavior, they break time reversibility and energy\nconservation at the microscopic level. It leads to complex out-of-equilibrium\nphenomena such as collective motion, pattern formation, and motility-induced\nphase separation (MIPS). In this work, we study two fundamental dynamical\nmodels of a pair of RTPs with jamming interactions and provide a rigorous link\nbetween their discrete- and continuous-space descriptions. We demonstrate that\nas the lattice spacing vanishes, the discrete models converge to a continuous\nRTP model on the torus, described by a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process\n(PDMP). This establishes that the invariant measures of the discrete models\nconverge to that of the continuous model, which reveals finite mass at jamming\nconfigurations and exponential decay away from them. This indicates effective\nattraction, which is consistent with MIPS. Furthermore, we quantitatively\nexplore the convergence towards the invariant measure. Such convergence study\nis critical for understanding and characterizing how MIPS emerges over time.\nBecause RTP systems are non-reversible, usual methods may fail or are limited\nto qualitative results. Instead, we adopt a coupling approach to obtain more\naccurate, non-asymptotic bounds on mixing times. The findings thus provide\ndeeper theoretical insights into the mixing times of these RTP systems,\nrevealing the presence of both persistent and diffusive regimes.",

To\naddress this problem, we will propose a new zero-shot low-light enhancement\nmethod to compensate for the lack of light and structural information in the\ndiffusion sampling process by effectively combining the wavelet and Fourier\nfrequency domains to construct rich a priori information. The key to the\ninspiration comes from the similarity between the wavelet and Fourier frequency\ndomains: both light and structure information are closely related to specific\nfrequency domain regions, respectively. Therefore, by transferring the\ndiffusion process to the wavelet low-frequency domain and combining the wavelet\nand Fourier frequency domains by continuously decomposing them in the inverse\nprocess, the constructed rich illumination prior is utilised to guide the image\ngeneration enhancement process.

Due to the fact that fuzzy\nrelational equations are special cases of bipolar FREs, the proposed system can\nalso be viewed as a generalization of traditional FREs, in which the fuzzy\ncomposition can be defined by a continuous t-norm. In order to determine the\nfeasibility of the proposed system, some necessary and sufficient conditions\nare presented for studying continuous bipolar FREs. This is followed by a\ncomplete analysis of the set of feasible solutions to the problem. Contrary to\nFREs and bipolar FREs defined by continuous Archimedean t-norms, the feasible\nsolutions set of generalized bipolar FREs consists of a finite number of\ncompact sets that are not necessarily connected. Further, five techniques have\nbeen outlined in an attempt to simplify the current problem, and then an\nalgorithm has been presented to find the feasible region of the problem. Next,\nwe present a class of optimization models subject to continuous bipolar FRE\nconstraints, in which the objective function incorporates a wide range of\n(non)linear functions, such as maximum functions, geometric mean functions,\nlog-sum-exp functions, maximum eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, support\nfunctions for sets, etc. Considering that the problem has a finite number of\nlocal optimal solutions, the global optimal solution can always be obtained by\nchoosing the point with the minimum objective value among these local optimal\nsolutions.

EF is a simple, modular, and\neffective strategy for both full-order models (FOMs) and reduced-order models\n(ROMs). It is well-known, however, that when the filter radius is too large, EF\ncan be overdiffusive and yield inaccurate results. To alleviate this, EF is\nusually supplemented with a relaxation step. The relaxation parameter, however,\nis very sensitive with respect to the model parameters. In this paper, we\npropose a novel strategy to alleviate the EF overdiffusivity for a large filter\nradius. Specifically, we leverage the variational multiscale (VMS) framework to\nseparate the large resolved scales from the small resolved scales in the\nevolved velocity, and we use the filtered small scales to correct the large\nscales. Furthermore, in the new VMS-EF strategy, we use two different ways to\ndecompose the evolved velocity: the VMS Evolve-Filter-Filter-Correct (VMS-EFFC)\nand the VMS Evolve-Postprocess-Filter-Correct (VMS-EPFC) algorithms. The new\nVMS-based algorithms yield significantly more accurate results than the\nstandard EF in both the FOM and the ROM simulations of a flow past a cylinder\nat Reynolds number Re = 1000.",

However, their passive nature, non-diagonal\nreflection matrix, and the large number of coupled reflecting elements\ncomplicate the channel state information (CSI) estimation process. The\nchallenge further escalates in scenarios with fast-varying channels. In this\npaper, we address this challenge by proposing novel joint channel estimation\nand prediction strategies with low overhead and high accuracy for two different\nRIS architectures in a BD-RIS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output system\nunder correlated fast-fading environments with channel aging. The channel\nestimation procedure utilizes the Tucker2 decomposition with bilinear\nalternative least squares, which is exploited to decompose the cascade channels\nof the BD-RIS-assisted system into effective channels of reduced dimension. The\nchannel prediction framework is based on a convolutional neural network\ncombined with an autoregressive predictor. The estimated/predicted CSI is then\nutilized to optimize the RIS phase shifts aiming at the maximization of the\ndownlink sum rate. Insightful simulation results demonstrate that our proposed\napproach is robust to channel aging, and exhibits a high estimation accuracy.\nMoreover, our scheme can deliver a high average downlink sum rate,\noutperforming other state-of-the-art channel estimation methods.

We implement a hierarchical double-loop learning process to\nenhance learning efficiency by decoupling the action space.

While prior work has advanced CVIT\nthrough the development of new benchmarks and approaches to mitigate\ncatastrophic forgetting, these efforts largely follow traditional continual\nlearning paradigms, neglecting the unique challenges specific to CVIT.

    "abstract": "Owing to its repeater-like rate-loss scaling, twin-field quantum key\ndistribution (TF-QKD) has repeatedly exhibited in laboratory its superiority\nfor secure communication over record fiber lengths. Field trials pose a new set\nof challenges however, which must be addressed before the technology's roll-out\ninto real-world. Here, we verify in field the viability of using independent\noptical frequency combs -- installed at sites separated by a straight-line\ndistance of 300~km -- to achieve a versatile TF-QKD setup that has no need for\noptical frequency dissemination and thus enables an open and network-friendly\nfiber configuration. Over 546 and 603 km symmetric links, we record a\nfinite-size secure key rate (SKR) of 0.53~bit/s and an asymptotic SKR of 0.12\nbit/s, respectively. Of practical importance, the setup is demonstrated to\nsupport 44~km fiber asymmetry in the 452 km link. Our work marks an important\nstep towards incorporation of long-haul fiber links into large quantum\nnetworks.",

With advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large\nlanguage models (LLMs), now it is possible to perform in-silico simulations to\ntest various hypotheses around this topic. Here, I simulate two somewhat\nsimilar worlds using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework of the\nAI-Economist and generative agent-based model (GABM) framework of the\nConcordia. In the extended versions of the AI-Economist and Concordia, the\nagents are able to build houses, trade houses, and trade house building skill.\nMoreover, along the individualistic-collectivists axis, there are a set of\nthree governing systems: Full-Libertarian, Semi-Libertarian/Utilitarian, and\nFull-Utilitarian. Additionally, in the extended AI-Economist, the\nSemi-Libertarian/Utilitarian system is further divided to a set of three\ngoverning institutions along the discriminative axis: Inclusive, Arbitrary, and\nExtractive. Building on these, I am able to show that among governing systems\nand institutions of the extended AI-Economist, under the\nSemi-Libertarian/Utilitarian and Inclusive government, the ratios of building\nhouses to trading houses and trading house building skill are higher than the\nrest. Furthermore, I am able to show that in the extended Concordia when the\ncentral government care about equality in the society, the Full-Utilitarian\nsystem generates agents building more houses and trading more house building\nskill. In contrast, these economic activities are higher under the\nFull-Libertarian system when the central government cares about productivity in\nthe society.

    "abstract": "The digitization of complex technical systems, such as Piping and\nInstrumentation Diagrams (P&IDs), is crucial for efficient maintenance and\noperation of complex systems in hydraulic and process engineering. Previous\napproaches often rely on separate modules that analyze diagram elements\nindividually, neglecting the diagram's overall structure. We address this\nlimitation by proposing a novel approach that utilizes the Relationformer, a\nstate-of-the-art deep learning architecture, to extract graphs from P&IDs. Our\nmethod leverages the ability of the Relationformer to simultaneously detect\nobjects and their relationships in images, making it suitable for the task of\ngraph extraction from engineering diagrams. We apply our proposed approach to\nboth real-world and synthetically created P&ID datasets, and evaluate its\neffectiveness by comparing it with a modular digitization approach based on\nrecent literature. We present PID2Graph, the first publicly accessible P&ID\ndataset featuring comprehensive labels for the graph structure, including\nsymbols, nodes and their connections that is used for evaluation. To understand\nthe effect of patching and stitching of both of the approaches, we compare\nvalues before and after merging the patches. For the real-world data, the\nRelationformer achieves convincing results, outperforming the modular\ndigitization approach for edge detection by more than 25%. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive framework for assessing the performance of P&ID digitization\nmethods and opens up new avenues for research in this area using transformer\narchitectures.

We address the above challenges by\nproposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with\nmultiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and\ndetailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among\nobjects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality\nbenchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with\ngenerated question-answer pairs.

MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations\nand employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual\noutputs.

    ],
    "abstract": "Internal gravity waves (hereafter IGWs) are one of the mechanisms that can\nplay a key role to redistribute efficiently angular momentum in stars along\ntheir evolution. The study of IGWs is thus of major importance since\nspace-based asteroseismology reveals a transport of angular momentum in stars,\nwhich is stronger by two orders of magnitude than the one predicted by stellar\nmodels ignoring their action or those of magnetic fields. IGWs trigger angular\nmomentum transport when they are damped by heat or viscous diffusion, when they\nmeet a critical layer or when they break. Theoretical prescriptions have been\nderived for the transport of angular momentum induced by IGWs because of their\nradiative and viscous dampings and of the critical layers they encounter along\ntheir propagation. However, none has been proposed for the transport triggered\nby their nonlinear breaking. In this work, we aim to derive such a physical and\nrobust prescription, which can be implemented in stellar structure and\nevolution codes. We adapt an analytical saturation model, which has been\ndeveloped for IGWs nonlinear convective breaking in the Earth atmosphere and\nhas been successfully compared to in-situ measurements in the stratosphere, to\nthe case of deep spherical stellar interiors. In a first step, we neglect the\nmodification of IGWs by the Coriolis acceleration and the Lorentz force, which\nare discussed and taken into account in a second step. We derive a complete\nsemi-analytical prescription for the transport of angular momentum by IGWs,\nwhich takes into account both their radiative damping and their potential\nnonlinear breaking because of their convective and vertical shear\ninstabilities. This allows us to bring the physical prescription for the\ninteractions between IGWs and the differential rotation to the same level of\nrealism that the one used in global circulation models for the atmosphere.",

This leads to a robust data-driven\npredictive control framework, solved in a tube-based control manner.

First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that\nexponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less\nstrict assumption, $d_I < d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any\ntwo sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster.

In our simulations, we also\nidentify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true\nclusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential\nclustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also\nexponentially consistent.

However, the application of\nQGANs to complex unsupervised image-to-image (I2I) translation remains\nunexplored. Moreover, classical neural networks often suffer from large\nparameter spaces, posing challenges for GAN-based I2I methods. Inspired by the\nfact that unsupervised I2I translation is essentially an approximate reversible\nproblem, we propose a lightweight invertible hybrid quantum-classical\nunsupervised I2I translation model - iHQGAN, by harnessing the invertibility of\nquantum computing. Specifically, iHQGAN employs two mutually approximately\nreversible quantum generators with shared parameters, effectively reducing the\nparameter scale.

Qualitative and quantitative assessments indicate that iHQGAN\neffectively performs unsupervised I2I translation with excellent generalization\nand can outperform classical methods that use low-complexity CNN-based\ngenerators. Additionally, iHQGAN, as with classical reversible methods, reduces\nthe parameter scale of classical irreversible methods via a reversible\nmechanism.

    "abstract": "In affective computing, the task of Emotion Recognition in Conversations\n(ERC) has emerged as a focal area of research. The primary objective of this\ntask is to predict emotional states within conversations by analyzing\nmultimodal data including text, audio, and video. While existing studies have\nprogressed in extracting and fusing representations from multimodal data, they\noften overlook the temporal dynamics in the data during conversations. To\naddress this challenge, we have developed the SpikEmo framework, which is based\non spiking neurons and employs a Semantic & Dynamic Two-stage Modeling approach\nto more precisely capture the complex temporal features of multimodal emotional\ndata. Additionally, to tackle the class imbalance and emotional semantic\nsimilarity problems in the ERC tasks, we have devised an innovative combination\nof loss functions that significantly enhances the model's performance when\ndealing with ERC data characterized by long-tail distributions. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on multiple ERC benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nSpikEmo significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in ERC\ntasks.

    "abstract": "Evolutionary partial differential equations play a crucial role in many areas\nof science and engineering. Spatial discretization of these equations leads to\na system of ordinary differential equations which can then be solved by\nnumerical time integration. Such a system is often of very high dimension,\nmaking the simulation very time consuming. One way to reduce the computational\ncost is to approximate the large system by a low-dimensional model using a\nmodel reduction approach. This master thesis deals with structure-preserving\nmodel reduction of Hamiltonian systems by using machine learning techniques. We\ndiscuss a nonlinear approach based on the construction of an encoder-decoder\npair that minimizes the approximation error and satisfies symplectic\nconstraints to guarantee the preservation of the structure inherent in\nHamiltonian systems. More specifically, we study an autoencoder network that\nlearns a symplectic encoder-decoder pair. Symplecticity poses some additional\ndifficulties, as we need to ensure this structure in each network layer. Since\nthese symplectic constraints are described by the (symplectic) Stiefel\nmanifold, we use manifold optimization techniques to ensure the symplecticity\nof the encoder and decoder. A particular challenge is to adapt the ADAM\noptimizer to the manifold structure. We present a modified ADAM optimizer that\nworks directly on the Stiefel manifold and compare it to the existing approach\nbased on homogeneous spaces. In addition, we propose several modifications to\nthe network and training setup that significantly improve the performance and\naccuracy of the autoencoder. Finally, we numerically validate the modified\noptimizer and different learning configurations on two Hamiltonian systems, the\n1D wave equation and the sine-Gordon equation, and demonstrate the improved\naccuracy and computational efficiency of the presented learning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "How are LLM-based agents used in the future? While many of the existing work\non agents has focused on improving the performance of a specific family of\nobjective and challenging tasks, in this work, we take a different perspective\nby thinking about full delegation: agents take over humans' routine\ndecision-making processes and are trusted by humans to find solutions that fit\npeople's personalized needs and are adaptive to ever-changing context. In order\nto achieve such a goal, the behavior of the agents, i.e., agentic behaviors,\nshould be evaluated not only on their achievements (i.e., outcome evaluation),\nbut also how they achieved that (i.e., procedure evaluation). For this, we\npropose APEC Agent Constitution, a list of criteria that an agent should follow\nfor good agentic behaviors, including Accuracy, Proactivity, Efficiency and\nCredibility. To verify whether APEC aligns with human preferences, we develop\nAPEC-Travel, a travel planning agent that proactively extracts hidden\npersonalized needs via multi-round dialog with travelers. APEC-Travel is\nconstructed purely from synthetic data generated by Llama3.1-405B-Instruct with\na diverse set of travelers' persona to simulate rich distribution of dialogs.\nIteratively fine-tuned to follow APEC Agent Constitution, APEC-Travel surpasses\nbaselines by 20.7% on rule-based metrics and 9.1% on LLM-as-a-Judge scores\nacross the constitution axes.",

    "abstract": "The urgent need to promptly detect cardiac disorders from 12-lead\nElectrocardiograms using limited computations is motivated by the heart's fast\nand complex electrical activity and restricted computational power of portable\ndevices. Timely and precise diagnoses are crucial since delays might\nsignificantly impact patient health outcomes. This research presents a novel\ndeep-learning architecture that aims to diagnose heart abnormalities quickly\nand accurately. We devised a new activation function called aSoftMax, designed\nto improve the visibility of ECG deflections. The proposed activation function\nis used with Convolutional Neural Network architecture to includes kernel\nweight sharing across the ECG's various leads. This innovative method\nthoroughly generalizes the global 12-lead ECG features and minimizes the\nmodel's complexity by decreasing the trainable parameters. aSoftMax, combined\nwith enhanced CNN architecture yielded AmpliNetECG12, we obtain exceptional\naccuracy of 84% in diagnosing cardiac disorders. AmpliNetECG12 shows\noutstanding prediction ability when used with the CPSC2018 dataset for\narrhythmia classification. The model attains an F1-score of 80.71% and a\nROC-AUC score of 96.00%, with 280,000 trainable parameters which signifies the\nlightweight yet efficient nature of AmpliNetECG12. The stochastic\ncharacteristics of aSoftMax, a fundamental element of AmpliNetECG12, improve\nprediction accuracy and also increasse the model's interpretability.

Correlated metals, such as those present in Kondo lattices, rely on\nthe screening of local moments by a sea of non-magnetic conduction electrons.\nHere, we report on a unique topological Kondo lattice compound, CeCo2P2, where\nthe Kondo effect - whose existence under the magnetic Co phase is protected by\nPT symmetry - coexists with antiferromagnetic order emerging from the flat\nbands associated with the Co atoms. Remarkably, this is the only known Kondo\nlattice compound where magnetic order occurs in non-heavy electrons, and\npuzzlingly, at a temperature significantly higher than that of the Kondo\neffect. Furthermore, at low temperatures, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in\nconjunction with a glide-mirror-z symmetry, results in a nodal line protected\nby bulk topology near the Fermi energy. These unusual properties, arising from\nthe interplay between itinerant and correlated electrons from different\nconstituent elements, lead to novel quantum phases beyond the celebrated\ntopological Kondo insulators and Weyl Kondo semimetals.

By introducing a novel treatment of the boundary condition and\nassigning appropriate slip velocities to the boundary particles, the\nSPD-squirmer model is able to accurately represent a range of microswimmer\ntypes including pushers, neutral swimmers, and pullers. We systematically\nvalidate the steady-state velocity of the squirmer, the resulting flow field,\nits hydrodynamic interactions with the surrounding environment, and the mutual\ncollision of two squirmers. In the presence of Brownian motion, the model is\nalso able to correctly calculate the velocity and angular velocity\nautocorrelation functions at the mesoscale.

    "abstract": "Graph-based recommender systems have achieved remarkable effectiveness by\nmodeling high-order interactions between users and items. However, such\napproaches are significantly undermined by popularity bias, which distorts the\ninteraction graph's structure, referred to as topology bias. This leads to\noverrepresentation of popular items, thereby reinforcing biases and fairness\nissues through the user-system feedback loop. Despite attempts to study this\neffect, most prior work focuses on the embedding or gradient level bias,\noverlooking how topology bias fundamentally distorts the message passing\nprocess itself. We bridge this gap by providing an empirical and theoretical\nanalysis from a Dirichlet energy perspective, revealing that graph message\npassing inherently amplifies topology bias and consistently benefits highly\nconnected nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Test-time Simplicial\nPropagation (TSP), which extends message passing to higher-order simplicial\ncomplexes. By incorporating richer structures beyond pairwise connections, TSP\nmitigates harmful topology bias and substantially improves the representation\nand recommendation of long-tail items during inference. Extensive experiments\nacross five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in\nmitigating topology bias and enhancing recommendation quality.",

Located in the Southern Hemisphere, the\ndetector is uniquely positioned to disentangle modulating seasonal effects.\nSABRE South uses seven ultra-high purity NaI(Tl) crystals (with a total target\nmass of either 35 kg or 50 kg), hermetically sealed in copper enclosures that\nare suspended within a liquid scintillator active veto. High quantum efficiency\nand low background Hamamatsu R11065 photomultiplier tubes are directly coupled\nto both ends of the crystal, and enclosed with the crystal in an oxygen free\ncopper enclosure. The active veto system consists of 11.6 kL of linear\nalkylbenzene (LAB) doped with a mixture of fluorophores and contained in a\nsteel vessel, which is instrumented with at least 18 Hamamatsu R5912\nphotomultipliers. The active veto tags key radiogenic backgrounds intrinsic to\nthe crystals, such as ${^{40}}$K, and is expected to suppress the total\nbackground by 27% in the 1-6 keV region of interest. In addition to the liquid\nscintillator veto, a muon veto is positioned above the detector shielding. This\nmuon veto consists of eight EJ-200 scintillator modules, with Hamamatsu R13089\nphotomultipliers coupled to both ends. With an expected total background of\n0.72 cpd/kg/keV, SABRE South can test the DAMA/LIBRA signal with 5$\\sigma$\ndiscovery or 3$\\sigma$ exclusion after two years of data taking.",

Next, we\nprogressively generate edges by sampling nodes through a degree mixing\ndistribution, adjusting the tolerance towards exotic structures via two\nthresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees for hierarchical generation and\nverify the effectiveness of our method under 12 datasets of three categories.\nExperimental results show that our method fits the ground truth distribution\nbetter than various generation strategies and other distribution observations.",

    "abstract": "An important aspect of deploying face recognition (FR) algorithms in\nreal-world applications is their ability to learn new face identities from a\ncontinuous data stream. However, the online training of existing deep neural\nnetwork-based FR algorithms, which are pre-trained offline on large-scale\nstationary datasets, encounter two major challenges: (I) catastrophic\nforgetting of previously learned identities, and (II) the need to store past\ndata for complete retraining from scratch, leading to significant storage\nconstraints and privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce CLFace, a\ncontinual learning framework designed to preserve and incrementally extend the\nlearned knowledge. CLFace eliminates the classification layer, resulting in a\nresource-efficient FR model that remains fixed throughout lifelong learning and\nprovides label-free supervision to a student model, making it suitable for\nopen-set face recognition during incremental steps. We introduce an objective\nfunction that employs feature-level distillation to reduce drift between\nfeature maps of the student and teacher models across multiple stages.\nAdditionally, it incorporates a geometry-preserving distillation scheme to\nmaintain the orientation of the teacher model's feature embedding. Furthermore,\na contrastive knowledge distillation is incorporated to continually enhance the\ndiscriminative power of the feature representation by matching similarities\nbetween new identities.

As a motivation, consider recommendation systems that use\nonline algorithms to learn optimal product recommendations based on user and\nproduct attributes. It is well known that the sequence of recommendations\naffects user preferences. However, typical learning algorithms treat the user\nattributes as static and disregard the impact of their recommendations on user\npreferences. Our interest is to analyze the effect of this mismatch between the\nmodel assumption of a static environment, and the reality of an evolving\nenvironment affected by the recommendations. To perform this analysis, we first\nintroduce a model for a generic coupled evolution of the parameters that are\nbeing learned, and the environment that is affected by it. We then frame a\nlinear bandit recommendation system (RS) into this generic model where the\nusers are characterized by a state variable that evolves based on the sequence\nof recommendations. The learning algorithm of the RS does not explicitly\naccount for this evolution and assumes that the users are static. A dynamical\nsystem model that captures the coupled evolution of the population state and\nthe learning algorithm is described, and its equilibrium behavior is analyzed.\nWe show that when the recommendation algorithm is able to learn the population\npreferences in the presence of this mismatch, the algorithm induces similarity\nin the preferences of the user population. In particular, we present results on\nhow different properties of the recommendation algorithm, namely the user\nattribute space and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, effect the\npopulation preferences when they are learned by the algorithm.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel training matrix design for spatial modulation\n(SM) systems, by introducing a new class of two-dimensional (2D) arrays called\nsparse zero correlation zone (SZCZ) arrays. An SZCZ array is characterized by a\nmajority of zero entries and exhibits the zero periodic auto- and\ncross-correlation zone properties across any two rows. With these unique\nproperties, we show that SZCZ arrays can be effectively used as training\nmatrices for SM systems. Additionally, direct constructions of SZCZ arrays with\nlarge ZCZ widths and controllable sparsity levels based on 2D restricted\ngeneralized Boolean functions (RGBFs) are proposed. Compared with existing\ntraining schemes, the proposed SZCZ-based training matrices have larger ZCZ\nwidths, thereby offering greater tolerance for delay spread in multipath\nchannels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SZCZ-based training\ndesign exhibits superior channel estimation performance over\nfrequency-selective fading channels compared to existing alternatives.",

Recently, mask propagation DL methods were\ndeveloped to reduce the annotation burden on 3D medical images. For example,\nSli2Vol~\\cite{yeung2021sli2vol} proposed a self-supervised framework (SSF) to\nlearn correspondences by matching neighboring slices via slice reconstruction\nin the training stage; the learned correspondences were then used to propagate\na labeled slice to other slices in the test stage. But, these methods are still\nprone to error accumulation due to the inter-slice propagation of\nreconstruction errors. Also, they do not handle discontinuities well, which can\noccur between consecutive slices in 3D images, as they emphasize exploiting\nobject continuity. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a new\nSSF, called \\proposed, {for segmenting any anatomical structures in 3D medical\nimages using only a single annotated slice per training and testing volume.}\nSpecifically, in the training stage, we first propagate an annotated 2D slice\nof a training volume to the other slices, generating pseudo-labels (PLs).

    "abstract": "Modern recommender systems often create information cocoons, restricting\nusers' exposure to diverse content. A key challenge lies in balancing content\nexploration and exploitation while allowing users to adjust their\nrecommendation preferences. Intuitively, this balance can be modeled as a\ntree-structured representation, where depth search facilitates exploitation and\nbreadth search enables exploration. However, existing approaches face two\nfundamental limitations: Euclidean methods struggle to capture hierarchical\nstructures, while hyperbolic methods, despite their superior hierarchical\nmodeling, lack semantic understanding of user and item profiles and fail to\nprovide a principled mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation. To\naddress these challenges, we propose HERec, a hyperbolic graph-LLM framework\nthat effectively balances exploration and exploitation in recommender systems.\nOur framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a semantic-enhanced\nhierarchical mechanism that aligns rich textual descriptions processed by large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with collaborative information directly in hyperbolic\nspace, allowing for more nuanced updates that respect the underlying\nhierarchical structure in user-item profiles; (2) an automatic hierarchical\nrepresentation by optimizing Dasgupta's cost, which discovers hierarchical\nstructures without requiring predefined hyperparameters, enabling\nuser-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that HERec consistently outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic\nbaselines, achieving up to 5.49% improvement in utility metrics and 11.39%\nincrease in diversity metrics, effectively mitigating information cocoons.

In the proposed asynchronous FL approach, we\npartition devices into multiple TDMA groups, enabling simultaneous local\ncomputation and communication across different groups. This enhances time\nefficiency at the expense of staleness of local updates. We derive the\nrelationship between the staleness of local updates and the size of the TDMA\ngroup in a training round. Moreover, our convergence analysis shows that\nalthough outdated local updates hinder appropriate global model updates,\nasynchronous FL over the TDMA channel converges even in the presence of data\nheterogeneity. Notably, the analysis identifies the impact of outdated local\nupdates on convergence rate.\n  Based on observations from our convergence rate, we refine asynchronous FL\nstrategy by introducing an intentional delay in local training.\n  This refinement accelerates the convergence by reducing the staleness of\nlocal updates.\n  Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that asynchronous FL with the\nintentional delay can rapidly reduce global loss by lowering the staleness of\nlocal updates in resource-limited wireless communication networks.",

To reduce redundancy in latent points, we propose a\nsparse priors guided method that achieves high reconstruction quality,\nespecially at high compression ratios. This is accomplished by a dual-density\nscheme separately processing the latent points (intended for reconstruction)\nand the decoupled sparse priors (intended for storage). Our approach features\nan efficient dual-density data flow that relaxes size constraints on latent\npoints, and hybridizes a progressive conditional diffusion model to encapsulate\nessential details for reconstruction within the conditions, which are decoupled\nhierarchically to intra-point and inter-point priors. Specifically, our method\nencodes the original point cloud into latent points and decoupled sparse priors\nthrough separate encoders. Latent points serve as intermediates, while sparse\npriors act as adaptive conditions. We then employ a progressive attention-based\nconditional denoiser to generate latent points conditioned on the decoupled\npriors, allowing the denoiser to dynamically attend to geometric and semantic\ncues from the priors at each encoding and decoding layer. Additionally, we\nintegrate the local distribution into the arithmetic encoder and decoder to\nenhance local context modeling of the sparse points.

    "abstract": "Automating complex industrial robots requires precise nonlinear control and\nefficient energy management. This paper introduces a data-driven nonlinear\nmodel predictive control (NMPC) framework to optimize control under multiple\nobjectives. To enhance the prediction accuracy of the dynamic model, we design\na single-shot multi-step prediction (SSMP) model based on long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) and multilayer perceptrons (MLP), which can directly obtain the\npredictive horizon without iterative repetition and reduce computational\npressure. Moreover, we combine offline and online models to address\ndisturbances stemming from environmental interactions, similar to the\nsuperposition of the robot's free and forced responses. The online model learns\nthe system's variations from the prediction mismatches of the offline model and\nupdates its weights in real time. The proposed hybrid predictive model\nsimplifies the relationship between inputs and outputs into matrix\nmultiplication, which can quickly obtain the derivative. Therefore, the\nsolution for the control signal sequence employs a gradient descent method with\nan adaptive learning rate, allowing the NMPC cost function to be formulated as\na convex function incorporating critical states. The learning rate is\ndynamically adjusted based on state errors to counteract the inherent\nprediction inaccuracies of neural networks. The controller outputs the average\nvalue of the control signal sequence instead of the first value.

To address\nthis challenge, based on the Kalman filter theory we propose the Kalman\nPrediction Uncertainty (KPU) to quantify uncertainty of the model's prediction.\nWith KPU we design the Active Learning by KPU (ALKPU) method, which can\nefficiently select representative configurations that should be labelled during\nmodel training.

The representation space of speaker embedding is\njointly learned within the whole diarization network without using an extra\nspeaker embedding model.

Next, the\nspeaker-embedding buffer is updated according to the predictions of the\nrepresentation module. Assuming that up to one new speaker may appear in a\nsmall block shift, our model iteratively predicts the results of each block and\nextracts target embeddings for the subsequent blocks until the signal ends.\nFinally, the last speaker-embedding buffer can re-score the entire audio,\nachieving highly accurate diarization performance as an offline system.\nExperimental results show that ...",

The condition for developability\nof a polyhedral surface onto a plane is formulated using the area of discrete\nGauss map formed by unit normal vectors at the faces adjacent to each vertex.\nThe objective function of the lower-level optimization problem is the sum of\nsquare errors for developability at all interior vertices. The contribution of\nlarge error to the objective function is underestimated by filtering with\nhyperbolic tangent function so that the internal boundary between the surface\npatches can naturally emerge as a result of optimization.

One widely used method is based on the photopatterning of thin\nlayers of azo-dye molecules, such as Brilliant Yellow (BY), that serve as an\naligning substrate for a liquid crystal. In this study, we examine how\nphotopatterning conditions, such as BY layer thickness (b), light intensity\n(I), irradiation dose, and age affect the alignment quality and the strength of\nthe azimuthal surface anchoring. The azimuthal surface anchoring coefficient,\nW, is determined by analyzing the splitting of integer disclinations into\nhalf-integer disclinations at pre patterned substrates. The strongest anchoring\nis achieved for b in the range of 5-8 nm. W increases with the dose, and within\nthe same dose, W increases with I. Aging of a non-irradiated BY coating above\n15 days reduces W. Our study also demonstrates that sealed photopatterned cells\nfilled with a conventional nematic preserve their alignment quality for up to\nfour weeks, after which time W decreases. This work suggests the optimization\npathways for photoalignment of nematic liquid crystals.",

The primary aim of the paper is to construct the\nspatiotemporal tube (STT) using a sampling-based approach and thereby devise a\nclosed-form approximation-free control strategy to ensure that system\ntrajectory reaches the target set while avoiding time-dependent unsafe sets.\nThe proposed scheme utilizes a novel method involving STTs to provide\ncontrollers that guarantee both system safety and reachability. In our\nsampling-based framework, we translate the requirements of STTs into a Robust\noptimization program (ROP). To address the infeasibility of ROP caused by\ninfinite constraints, we utilize the sampling-based Scenario optimization\nprogram (SOP). Subsequently, we solve the SOP to generate the tube and\nclosed-form controller for an unknown system, ensuring the temporal\nreach-avoid-stay specification.

This is critical as\nclinicians increasingly seek to quantify skin-tone, a characteristic which has\nbeen shown to impact the accuracy of pulse oximetry readings, particularly for\ndark skin tones, and hence, disproportionately affect patient outcomes. Aim:\nThis study presents a smartphone-based imaging technique for determining\nindividual typology angle (ITA) and compares these results to those obtained\nusing an industry-standard tristimulus colorimeter, particularly for the\nfinger, a common site for pulse oximetry measurements. Approach: We employ a\nsmartphone-based imaging method to extract ITA values from four volunteers with\ndiverse skin-tones. The study provides recommendations for minimizing errors\ncaused by ambient light scattering, which can affect skin-tone readings.\nResults: The smartphone-based ITA (SITA) measurements with camera flash\ndisabled and minimal ambient lighting correlates well with the\nindustry-standard colorimeter without the need for auxiliary adapters and\ncomplex calibration. The method presented enables wide-field ITA mapping for\nskin-tone quantification that is accessible to clinicians. Conclusions: Our\nfindings demonstrate that smartphone-based imaging provides an effective\nalternative for assessing skin-tone in clinical settings.

However, recent\nstudies have brought to light instances of bias inherent within these LLMs,\npresenting a critical issue that demands attention. In our research, we delve\ndeeper into the intricate challenge of harmonising accuracy and fairness in the\nenhancement of LLMs. While improving accuracy can indeed enhance overall LLM\nperformance, it often occurs at the expense of fairness. Overemphasising\noptimisation of one metric invariably leads to a significant degradation of the\nother. This underscores the necessity of taking into account multiple\nconsiderations during the design and optimisation phases of LLMs. Therefore, we\nadvocate for reformulating the LLM training process as a multi-objective\nlearning task. Our investigation reveals that multi-objective evolutionary\nlearning (MOEL) methodologies offer promising avenues for tackling this\nchallenge. Our MOEL framework enables the simultaneous optimisation of both\naccuracy and fairness metrics, resulting in a Pareto-optimal set of LLMs. In\nsummary, our study sheds valuable lights on the delicate equilibrium between\naccuracy and fairness within LLMs, which is increasingly significant for their\nreal-world applications.

    "abstract": "When using multiple imputation (MI) for missing data, maintaining\ncompatibility between the imputation model and substantive analysis is\nimportant for avoiding bias. For example, some causal inference methods\nincorporate an outcome model with exposure-confounder interactions that must be\nreflected in the imputation model. Two approaches for compatible imputation\nwith multivariable missingness have been proposed: Substantive-Model-Compatible\nFully Conditional Specification (SMCFCS) and a stacked-imputation-based\napproach (SMC-stack). If the imputation model is correctly specified, both\napproaches are guaranteed to be unbiased under the \"missing at random\"\nassumption. However, this assumption is violated when the outcome causes its\nown missingness, which is common in practice. In such settings, sensitivity\nanalyses are needed to assess the impact of alternative assumptions on results.\nAn appealing solution for sensitivity analysis is delta-adjustment using MI,\nspecifically \"not-at-random\" (NAR)FCS. However, the issue of imputation model\ncompatibility has not been considered in sensitivity analysis, with a naive\nimplementation of NARFCS being susceptible to bias. To address this gap, we\npropose two approaches for compatible sensitivity analysis when the outcome\ncauses its own missingness. The proposed approaches, NAR-SMCFCS and\nNAR-SMC-stack, extend SMCFCS and SMC-stack, respectively, with delta-adjustment\nfor the outcome. We evaluate these approaches using a simulation study that is\nmotivated by a case study, to which the methods were also applied. The\nsimulation results confirmed that a naive implementation of NARFCS produced\nbias in effect estimates, while NAR-SMCFCS and NAR-SMC-stack were approximately\nunbiased. The proposed compatible approaches provide promising avenues for\nconducting sensitivity analysis to missingness assumptions in causal inference.",

By\nleveraging cause-effect analysis, we can discern heterophilic edges based on\nasymmetric node dependency. The learned causal structure offers more accurate\nrelationships among nodes. To reduce the computational complexity, we introduce\nintervention-based causal inference in graph learning.

This paper explores the application of unsupervised learning models\nin cross-border AML systems, focusing on rule optimization through contrastive\nlearning techniques. Five deep learning models, ranging from basic\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) to hybrid CNNGRU architectures, were\ndesigned and tested to assess their performance in detecting abnormal\ntransactions. The results demonstrate that as model complexity increases, so\ndoes the system's detection accuracy and responsiveness.

These findings highlight the\npotential of unsupervised learning models to significantly improve the\nintelligence, flexibility, and real-time capabilities of AML systems.

Caching techniques, which leverage data reuse to reduce\ncomputation, offer opportunities to optimize the performance of LLM inference\nengines. On the one hand, the low-level key-value (KV) cache working at the\ntoken level is widely adopted, albeit it incurs significant overhead as request\nvolume grows. On the other hand, instruction-level caching, which stores full\ninstruction-response pairs, is expected to play an increasingly crucial role.\nHowever, the high variability in the content and length of instructions make it\nrare for identical instructions to recur within a short time window, presenting\nchallenges for effective caching instruction-response pairs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose InstCache, a predictive caching mechanism for LLM serving\nsystems. Leveraging the capability of LLMs, we can effectively reorder the\nrepresentation space of instruction texts and develop a sufficient level of\nspatial locality. Such spatial locality enables us to predict potential\ninstructions located in a compact region in the space, resulting in an\neffective caching system at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that\nInstCache achieves a 2.3x higher hit rate compared to the upper bound of\ntraditional caching mechanisms on WildChat dataset and reduces the time per\noutput token of vLLM by up to 42.0% and 50.0% on LMSys and Moss datasets,\nrespectively.",

    "abstract": "In the study of theta series and partition functions, Andrews and Merca, Guo\nand Zeng independently conjectured that a truncated Jacobi triple product\nseries has nonnegative coefficients. This conjecture was proved analytically by\nMao and combinatorially by Yee. In 2021, Merca proposed a stronger version of\nthe conjecture, that is, for positive integers $1\\leq S<R$ with $k\\geq 1$, the\ncoefficient of $q^n$ in\n  the theta series\n  \\[\n  \\frac{(-1)^{k} \\sum_{j=k}^{\\infty}(-1)^j q^{R j(j+1) / 2}\\left(q^{-Sj}-q^{(\nj+1) S}\\right)}{\\left(q^S, q^{R-S}; q^R\\right)_{\\infty}}\n  \\]\n  is nonnegative. Recently, some very special cases of this conjecture have\nbeen proved and studied. For any given $R, S$ and $k$, we take $s=S/(S,R),\nr=R/(S,R)$ which are coprime, equivalently. In this paper, we confirm Merca's\nstronger conjecture for sufficiently large $n$. Furthermore, for given $r, s$\nand $k$, we provide a systematic method to determine an integer $N(r, s, k)$\nsuch that Merca's stronger conjecture holds for $ n\\geq N(r,s,k) $. More\nprecisely, we decompose the infinite product in the denominator of the above\ntheta series into two parts, one of which can be interpreted as the generating\nfunction of partitions with certain restricted parts and the other is a\nnonmodular infinite product.\n  We derive the general upper and lower bounds for the coefficients of these\ntwo parts by using the partition theoretical method and the circle method,\nrespectively. Further multiplying the partition part by the numerator of the\ntheta series and considering the convolution with the nonmodular infinite\nproduct, we obtain the constant $N(r,s,k)$ and confirm Merca's stronger\nconjecture when $n\\geq N(r,s,k)$. Moreover, we also show that when $k$ is\nsufficiently large, this conjecture holds directly for any $n\\geq 0$.",

This issue impedes\nthe feasibility of identifying the forward map, theoretically the inverse of\nthe measurement operator, for field reconstruction purposes. While data-driven\nmethods are available, their generalizability across different flow conditions\n(\\textit{e.g.,} different Reynold numbers) remains questioned.

CrossNet is a\nspeech separation network specifically optimized for challenging noisy and\nreverberant environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks such\nas speaker separation under these conditions. Additionally, to enhance the\nnetwork's ability to capture and utilize auxiliary features of the target\nspeaker, we integrate a Cross-Attention mechanism into the global multi-head\nself-attention (GMHSA) module within each CrossNet block. This facilitates more\neffective integration of target speaker features with mixed speech features.\nExperimental results show that our method performs superior separation on the\nWSJ0-2mix and WHAMR! datasets, demonstrating strong robustness and stability.",

    "abstract": "Advertising click-through rate (CTR) prediction aims to forecast the\nprobability that a user will click on an advertisement in a given context, thus\nproviding enterprises with decision support for product ranking and ad\nplacement. However, CTR prediction faces challenges such as data sparsity and\nclass imbalance, which adversely affect model training effectiveness. Moreover,\nmost current CTR prediction models fail to fully explore the associations among\nuser history, interests, and target advertisements from multiple perspectives,\nneglecting important information at different levels. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes an improved CTR prediction model based on the xDeepFM\narchitecture. By integrating a multi-head attention mechanism, the model can\nsimultaneously focus on different aspects of feature interactions, enhancing\nits ability to learn intricate patterns without significantly increasing\ncomputational complexity. Furthermore, replacing the linear model with a\nFactorization Machine (FM) model improves the handling of high-dimensional\nsparse data by flexibly capturing both first-order and second-order feature\ninteractions. Experimental results on the Criteo dataset demonstrate that the\nproposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing significant\nimprovements in both AUC and Logloss metrics. This enhancement facilitates\nbetter mining of implicit relationships between features and improves the\naccuracy of advertising CTR prediction.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel spatial interaction model to explore the\ndecision-making processes of a resource allocator and local agents, with\ncentral and local governments serving as empirical representations. The model\ncaptures two key features: (i) resource allocations from the allocator to local\nagents and the resulting strategic interactions, and (ii) local agents'\nmultiple activities and their interactions. We develop a network game for the\nmicro-foundations of these processes. In this game, local agents engage in\nmultiple activities, while the allocator distributes resources by monitoring\nthe externalities arising from their interactions. The game's unique Nash\nequilibrium establishes our econometric framework. To estimate the agent payoff\nparameters, we employ the quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimation method and\nexamine the asymptotic properties of the QML estimator to ensure robust\nstatistical inference. Empirically, we study interactions among U.S. states in\npublic welfare and housing and community development expenditures, focusing on\nhow federal grants influence these expenditures and the interdependencies among\nstate governments. Our findings reveal significant spillovers across the\nstates' two expenditures. Additionally, we detect positive effects of federal\ngrants on both types of expenditures, inducing a responsive grant scheme based\non states' decisions. Last, we compare state expenditures and social welfare\nthrough counterfactual simulations under two scenarios: (i) responsive\nintervention by monitoring states' decisions and (ii) autonomous transfers. We\nfind that responsive intervention enhances social welfare by leading to an\nincrease in the states' two expenditures. However, due to the heavy reliance on\nautonomous transfers, the magnitude of these improvements remains relatively\nsmall compared to the share of federal grants in total state revenues.",

The advancement of deep neural network models has increased the\ndemand for container-based distributed model training and inference, where\nfrequent data transmission among nodes has emerged as a significant performance\nbottleneck. However, traditional container scheduling simulators often overlook\nthe influence of network modeling on the efficiency of container scheduling,\nprimarily concentrating on modeling computational resources. In this paper, we\nfocus on a container scheduling simulator based on collaboration between\ncomputing and networking within data centers. We propose a new container\nscheduling simulator for data centers, named DCSim. The simulator consists of\nseveral modules: a data center module, a network simulation module, a container\nscheduling module, a discrete event-driven module, and a data collection and\nanalysis module. Together, these modules provide heterogeneous computing power\nmodeling and dynamic network simulation capabilities. We design a discrete\nevent model using SimPy to represent various aspects of container processing,\nincluding container requests, scheduling, execution, pauses, communication,\nmigration, and termination within data centers. Among these, lightweight\nvirtualization technology based on Mininet is employed to construct a\nsoftware-defined network.

    "abstract": "Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often exhibit atypical facial\nexpressions. However, the specific objective facial features that underlie this\nsubjective perception remain unclear. In this paper, we introduce a novel\ndataset, Hugging Rain Man (HRM), which includes facial action units (AUs)\nmanually annotated by FACS experts for both children with ASD and typical\ndevelopment (TD). The dataset comprises a rich collection of posed and\nspontaneous facial expressions, totaling approximately 130,000 frames, along\nwith 22 AUs, 10 Action Descriptors (ADs), and atypicality ratings. A\nstatistical analysis of static images from the HRM reveals significant\ndifferences between the ASD and TD groups across multiple AUs and ADs when\ndisplaying the same emotional expressions, confirming that participants with\nASD tend to demonstrate more irregular and diverse expression patterns.\nSubsequently, a temporal regression method was presented to analyze atypicality\nof dynamic sequences, thereby bridging the gap between subjective perception\nand objective facial characteristics. Furthermore, baseline results for AU\ndetection are provided for future research reference. This work not only\ncontributes to our understanding of the unique facial expression\ncharacteristics associated with ASD but also provides potential tools for ASD\nearly screening.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we model the minimum achievable throughput within a\ntransmission block of restricted duration and aim to maximize it in movable\nantenna (MA)-enabled multiuser downlink communications. Particularly, we\naccount for the antenna moving delay caused by mechanical movement, which has\nnot been fully considered in previous studies, and reveal the trade-off between\nthe delay and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at users. To this end, we\nfirst consider a single-user setup to analyze the necessity of antenna\nmovement. By quantizing the virtual angles of arrival, we derive the requisite\nregion size for antenna moving, design the initial MA position, and elucidate\nthe relationship between quantization resolution and moving region size.\nFurthermore, an efficient algorithm is developed to optimize MA position via\nsuccessive convex approximation, which is subsequently extended to the general\nmultiuser setup. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms\noutperform fixed-position antenna schemes and existing ones without\nconsideration of movement delay. Additionally, our algorithms exhibit excellent\nadaptability and stability across various transmission block durations and\nmoving region sizes, and are robust to different antenna moving speeds. This\nallows the hardware cost of MA-aided systems to be reduced by employing low\nrotational speed motors.",

When applied on a word-by-word basis, the mechanism either\noutputs the original word, or completely dissimilar words, and very rarely\noutputs semantically similar words. We investigate this observation in detail,\nand tie it to the fact that the distance of the nearest neighbor of a word in\nany word embedding model (which are high-dimensional) is much larger than the\nrelative difference in distances to any of its two consecutive neighbors. We\nalso show that the dot product of the multidimensional Laplace noise vector\nwith any word embedding plays a crucial role in designating the nearest\nneighbor.

What social and spatial conditions enabled their emergence? Are these\nprocesses universal or context-dependent? Moreover, what distinguishes cities\nfrom other human settlements? This paper investigates the drivers behind the\ncreation of cities through a hybrid approach that integrates urban theory, the\nbiological concept of morphospace (the space of all possible configurations),\nand archaeological evidence. It explores the transition from sedentary\nhunter-gatherer communities to urban societies, highlighting fundamental forces\nconverging to produce increasingly complex divisions of labour as a central\ndriver of urbanization. Morphogenesis is conceptualized as a trajectory through\nmorphospace, governed by structure-seeking selection processes that balance\ndensity, permeability, and information as critical dimensions. The study\nhighlights the non-ergodic nature of urban morphogenesis, where configurations\nare progressively selected based on their fitness to support the diversifying\ninteractions between mutually dependent agents. The morphospace framework\neffectively distinguishes between theoretical spatial configurations, non-urban\nand proto-urban settlements, and contemporary cities. This analysis supports\nthe proposition that cities emerge and evolve as solutions balancing density,\npermeability, and informational organization, enabling them to support\nincreasingly complex societal functions.",

Aiming to reduce shoulder physical loads, passive\nshoulder exoskeletons are increasingly prevalent in the industry due to their\nlightweight, affordability, and effectiveness. However, they can only\naccommodate a specific task and cannot effectively balance between compactness\nand sufficient range of motion. Method: We proposed a novel passive\noccupational shoulder exoskeleton to handle various overhead tasks with\ndifferent arm elevation angles and ensured a sufficient ROM while compactness.\nBy formulating kinematic models and simulations, an ergonomic shoulder\nstructure was developed. Then, we presented a torque generator equipped with an\nadjustable peak assistive torque angle to switch between low and high\nassistance phases through a passive clutch mechanism. Ten healthy participants\nwere recruited to validate its functionality by performing the screwing task.\nResults: Measured range of motion results demonstrated that the exoskeleton can\nensure a sufficient ROM in both sagittal (164{\\deg}) and horizontal (158{\\deg})\nflexion/extension movements. The experimental results of the screwing task\nshowed that the exoskeleton could reduce muscle activation (up to 49.6%),\nperceived effort and frustration, and provide an improved user experience\n(scored 79.7 out of 100). Conclusion: These results indicate that the proposed\nexoskeleton can guarantee natural movements and provide efficient assistance\nduring overhead work, and thus have the potential to reduce the risk of\nmusculoskeletal disorders. Significance: The proposed exoskeleton provides\ninsights into multi-task adaptability and efficient assistance, highlighting\nthe potential for expanding the application of exoskeletons.",

As you know, RIS is very suitable for a special wireless\nscenario with wireless link between BS and users being completely blocked,\ni.e., no link. In this paper, we extend its applications to a general scenario,\ni.e., rank-deficient channel, particularly some extremely low-rank ones such as\nno link, and line-of-sight (LoS, rank-one). Actually, there are several\npotential important low-rank applications like low-altitude, satellite, UAV,\nmarine, and deep-space communications.

By\nusing a distributed RISs placement, the DoF of channel from BS to user in LoS\nchannel may be even boosted from a low-rank like 0/1 to full-rank. This will\nachieve an extremely rate improvement via spatial parallel multiple-stream\ntransmission from BS to user.

Compared to text-based interaction, edge ASR-LLM allows accessible\nand natural audio interactions. Unfortunately, existing ASR-LLM models are\nmainly trained in high-performance computing environments and produce\nsubstantial model weights, making them difficult to deploy on edge devices.\nMore importantly, to better serve users' personalized needs, the ASR-LLM must\nbe able to learn from each distinct user, given that audio input often contains\nhighly personalized characteristics that necessitate personalized on-device\ntraining.

This poses a critical question that which data points are\nmost beneficial to label given a budget constraint. In this paper, we focus on\nthe estimation of the optimal individualized threshold in a\nmeasurement-constrained M-estimation framework. Our goal is to estimate a\nhigh-dimensional parameter $\\theta$ in a linear threshold $\\theta^T Z$ for a\ncontinuous variable $X$ such that the discrepancy between whether $X$ exceeds\nthe threshold $\\theta^T Z$ and a binary outcome $Y$ is minimized.

The theoretical properties of our estimator demonstrate a phase\ntransition phenomenon with respect to $\\beta\\geq 1$, the smoothness of the\nconditional density of $X$ given $Y$ and $Z$. For $\\beta>(1+\\sqrt{3})/2$, we\nshow that the two-step algorithm yields an estimator with the parametric\nconvergence rate $O_p((s \\log d /N)^{1/2})$ in $l_2$ norm. The rate of our\nestimator is strictly faster than the minimax optimal rate with $N$ i.i.d.\nsamples drawn from the population. For the other two scenarios $1<\\beta\\leq\n(1+\\sqrt{3})/2$ and $\\beta=1$, the estimator from the two-step algorithm is\nsub-optimal. The former requires to run $K>2$ steps to attain the same\nparametric rate, whereas in the latter case only a near parametric rate can be\nobtained. Furthermore, we formulate a minimax framework for the\nmeasurement-constrained M-estimation problem and prove that our estimator is\nminimax rate optimal up to a logarithmic factor.

The signature of\ncriticality given by the VG is confirmed for collective activation phenomena,\nas in the case of homogeneous networks. Similarly, for a localized activation\ndriven by a densely connected set of hubs, identified by a maximum k-core\ndecomposition, critical times series were also successfully identified by the\nVG method. However, in the case of activation driven by sparsely distributed\nhubs, the time series criticality is blurred, being observable only for huge\nsystems. In the case of strong structural localization induced by the presence\nof rare regions, an assortative VG degree correlation, typical of off-critical\nseries, is observed. We conclude that while macroscopic times series remain\ngood proxies for the analysis of criticality for collective or maximum k-core\nactivation, systems under spatial localization can postpone the signatures of\nor, in case of extreme localization, lead to false negatives for criticality of\ntime series.",

    "abstract": "Understanding of the formation and evolution of the Solar System requires\nunderstanding key and common materials found on and in planetary bodies.\nMineral mixing and its implications on planetary body formation is a topic of\nhigh interest to the planetary science community. Previous work establishes a\ncase for the use of Optical PhotoThermal InfraRed (O-PTIR) in planetary science\nand introduces and demonstrates the technique's capability to study planetary\nmaterials. In this paper, we performed a measurement campaign on granular\nmaterials relevant to planetary science, such as minerals found in lunar and\nmartian soils. These laboratory measurements serve to start a database of\nO-PTIR measurements. We also present FTIR absorption measurements of the\nmaterials we observed in O-PTIR for comparison purposes. We find that the\nO-PTIR technique suffers from granular orientation effects similar to other IR\ntechniques, but in most cases, is is directly comparable to commonly used\nabsorption spectroscopy techniques. We conclude that O-PTIR would be an\nexcellent tool for the purpose of planetary material identification during\nin-situ investigations on regolith and bedrock surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) of 3D point clouds is crucial for mitigating\ndiscrepancies between training and testing samples in real-world scenarios,\nparticularly when handling corrupted point clouds. LiDAR data, for instance,\ncan be affected by sensor failures or environmental factors, causing domain\ngaps. Adapting models to these distribution shifts online is crucial, as\ntraining for every possible variation is impractical. Existing methods often\nfocus on fine-tuning pre-trained models based on self-supervised learning or\npseudo-labeling, which can lead to forgetting valuable source domain knowledge\nover time and reduce generalization on future tests. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel 3D test-time adaptation method, termed 3DD-TTA, which stands\nfor 3D Denoising Diffusion Test-Time Adaptation. This method uses a diffusion\nstrategy that adapts input point cloud samples to the source domain while\nkeeping the source model parameters intact. The approach uses a Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) to encode the corrupted point cloud into a shape latent and\nlatent points. These latent points are corrupted with Gaussian noise and\nsubjected to a denoising diffusion process. During this process, both the shape\nlatent and latent points are updated to preserve fidelity, guiding the\ndenoising toward generating consistent samples that align more closely with the\nsource domain. We conduct extensive experiments on the ShapeNet dataset and\ninvestigate its generalizability on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "The traveling salesman problem is a widely studied classical combinatorial\nproblem for which there are several integer linear formulations. In this work,\nwe consider the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ), Desrochers-Laporte (DL) and Single\nCommodity Flow (SCF) formulations. We argue that the choice of some parameters\nof these formulations is arbitrary and, therefore, there are families of\nformulations of which each of MTZ, DL, and SCF is a particular case. We analyze\nthese families for different choices of the parameters, noting that in general\nthe formulations involved are not comparable to each other and there is no one\nthat dominates the rest. Then we define and study the closure of each family,\nthat is, the set obtained by considering all the associated formulations\nsimultaneously. In particular, we give an explicit integer linear formulation\nfor the closure of each of the families we have defined and then show how they\ncompare to each other.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing\n(NLP), excelling in tasks like text generation and summarization. However,\ntheir increasing adoption in mission-critical applications raises concerns\nabout hardware-based threats, particularly bit-flip attacks (BFAs). BFAs,\nenabled by fault injection methods such as Rowhammer, target model parameters\nin memory, compromising both integrity and performance. Identifying critical\nparameters for BFAs in the vast parameter space of LLMs poses significant\nchallenges. While prior research suggests transformer-based architectures are\ninherently more robust to BFAs compared to traditional deep neural networks, we\nchallenge this assumption. For the first time, we demonstrate that as few as\nthree bit-flips can cause catastrophic performance degradation in an LLM with\nbillions of parameters. Current BFA techniques are inadequate for exploiting\nthis vulnerability due to the difficulty of efficiently identifying critical\nparameters within the immense parameter space. To address this, we propose\nAttentionBreaker, a novel framework tailored for LLMs that enables efficient\ntraversal of the parameter space to identify critical parameters. Additionally,\nwe introduce GenBFA, an evolutionary optimization strategy designed to refine\nthe search further, isolating the most critical bits for an efficient and\neffective attack. Empirical results reveal the profound vulnerability of LLMs\nto AttentionBreaker. For example, merely three bit-flips (4.129 x 10^-9% of\ntotal parameters) in the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct 8-bit quantized (W8) model result\nin a complete performance collapse: accuracy on MMLU tasks drops from 67.3% to\n0%, and Wikitext perplexity skyrockets from 12.6 to 4.72 x 10^5. These findings\nunderscore the effectiveness of AttentionBreaker in uncovering and exploiting\ncritical vulnerabilities within LLM architectures.",
