Utilizing line and point\ngeometric elements to define waterway boundaries, the framework enables to\nconstruct a dynamic width characterization function to quantify spatial safety\nalong intricate waterways. An iterative method is developed to calculate this\nfunction, enabling an abstracted spatial property representation of the\nwaterways. Based on this, we introduce a navigational safety index that\nbalances global navigational safety and local risk to determine the safest\nroute. To accommodate ship kinematic constraints, path modifications are\napplied using a dynamic window approach. A case study in a simulated Port of\nHamburg environment shows that GARSA effectively identifies safe routes and\navoids the risk of entering narrow waterways in an autonomous manner, thereby\nprioritizing safety in route decision-making for MASS in confined waters.",

Although it has been studied for more\nthan 60 years, several questions about the material properties remain open,\nincluding light-induced degradation and the Fermi level dependence on the\nmobility of hydrogen. Here we study the origin of these phenomenon using\nelectronic structure based calculations. First, we use density functional\ntheory (DFT) and the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to examine defect\ngeneration via Si-H bond breaking in p-type, intrinsic, and n-type a-Si:H. We\nfind that the energy barrier controlling this defect generation, shows the same\nasymmetric reduction of $\\sim 0.3$ eV for p-type and $\\sim 0.1$ eV for n-type,\nobserved in experimental studies. We then develop a model based on the local\nCoulomb interactions at the transition state, which provides compelling\nevidence that the asymmetry results from the emergence of a high energy donor\nstate created by the interstitial H. Finally, we repeat our Si-H bond breaking\nanalysis, combining NEB with constrained density functional perturbation theory\n(c-DFPT) to simulate defect generation dynamics in illuminated a-Si:H.

In this study, we employ the GW\napproximation and HSE06 hybrid functional to investigate the correlation\neffects on the electronic band structure of two-dimensional (2D) cold metallic\nmaterials, specifically focusing on MX_2 and MA_2Z_4 (M=Nb, Ta; X=S, Se, Te;\nA=Si, Ge; Z= N, P) compounds in 1H structure. These materials exhibit a unique\nband structure with an isolated metallic band around the Fermi energy, denoted\nas W_m, as well as two energy gaps: the internal gap E^I_g below the Fermi\nlevel and the external gap E^E_g above the Fermi level. These three electronic\nstructure parameters play a decisive role in determining the current-voltage\n(I-V) characteristics of tunnel diodes, the nature of the NDR effect, and the\ntransfer characteristics and SS value of FETs. Our calculations reveal that\nboth GW and HSE06 methods yield consistent electronic structure properties for\nall studied compounds. We observed a consistent increase in both internal and\nexternal band gaps, as well as metallic bandwidths, across all pn-type cold\nmetal systems. Notably, the internal band gap E^I_g exhibits the most\nsubstantial enhancement, highlighting the sensitivity of these materials to\ncorrelation effects. In contrast, the changes in the metallic bandwidth W_m and\nexternal band gap E^E_g are relatively modest. These findings offer valuable\ninsights for designing and optimizing cold metal-based devices.

    "abstract": "Recent cosmological analyses measuring distances of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe\nIa) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) have all given similar hints at\ntime-evolving dark energy. To examine whether underestimated SN Ia systematics\nmight be driving these results, Efstathiou (2024) compared overlapping SN\nevents between Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR (20% SNe are in common), and reported\nevidence for a $\\sim$0.04 mag offset between the low and high-redshift distance\nmeasurements of this subsample of events. If these offsets are arbitrarily\nsubtracted from the entire DES-SN5YR sample, the preference for evolving dark\nenergy is reduced. In this paper, we reproduce this offset and show that it has\ntwo sources. First, 43% of the offset is due to DES-SN5YR improvements in the\nmodelling of supernova intrinsic scatter and host galaxy properties. These are\nscientifically-motivated modelling updates implemented in DES-SN5YR and their\nassociated uncertainties are captured within the DES-SN5YR systematic error\nbudget. Even if the less accurate scatter model and host properties from\nPantheon+ are used instead, the DES-SN5YR evidence for evolving dark energy is\nonly reduced from 3.9$\\sigma$ to 3.3$\\sigma$. Second, 38% of the offset is due\nto a misleading comparison because different selection functions characterize\nthe DES subsets included in Pantheon+ and DES-SN5YR and therefore individual SN\ndistance measurements are expected to be different because of different bias\ncorrections. In conclusion, we confirm the validity of the published DES-SN5YR\nresults.",

There is growing interest in training\ntransformers on resource-constrained edge devices due to considerations such as\nprivacy, domain adaptation, and on-device scientific machine learning. However,\nthe significant computational and memory demands required for transformer\ntraining often exceed the capabilities of an edge device. Leveraging low-rank\ntensor compression, this paper presents the first on-FPGA accelerator for\nend-to-end transformer training. On the algorithm side, we present a\nbi-directional contraction flow for tensorized transformer training,\nsignificantly reducing the computational FLOPS and intra-layer memory costs\ncompared to existing tensor operations. On the hardware side, we store all\nhighly compressed model parameters and gradient information on chip, creating\nan on-chip-memory-only framework for each stage in training. This reduces\noff-chip communication and minimizes latency and energy costs. Additionally, we\nimplement custom computing kernels for each training stage and employ\nintra-layer parallelism and pipe-lining to further enhance run-time and memory\nefficiency. Through experiments on transformer models within $36.7$ to $93.5$\nMB using FP-32 data formats on the ATIS dataset, our tensorized FPGA\naccelerator could conduct single-batch end-to-end training on the AMD Alevo U50\nFPGA, with a memory budget of less than $6$-MB BRAM and $22.5$-MB URAM.\nCompared to uncompressed training on the NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, our on-FPGA\ntraining achieves a memory reduction of $30\\times$ to $51\\times$. Our FPGA\naccelerator also achieves up to $3.6\\times$ less energy cost per epoch compared\nwith tensor Transformer training on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU.",

The derivative of $f$ at $t=1$ recovers a sum of\nShannon entropies, which justifies seeing magnitude as a partition function.\nFollowing Leinster and Schulman, we also express the magnitude function of\n$\\mathcal M$ as an Euler characteristic of magnitude homology and provide an\nexplicit description of the zeroeth and first magnitude homology groups.",

Effective data extraction\nfrom these documents is crucial to supporting downstream analytical tasks.\nCurrent data extraction tools often struggle with complex document layouts,\nincur high latency and/or cost on large datasets, and often require significant\nhuman effort, when extracting tables or values given user-specified fields from\ndocuments. The key insight of our tool, TWIX, is to predict the underlying\ntemplate used to create such documents, modeling the visual and structural\ncommonalities across documents. Data extraction based on this predicted\ntemplate provides a more principled, accurate, and efficient solution at a low\ncost. Comprehensive evaluations on 34 diverse real-world datasets show that\nuncovering the template is crucial for data extraction from templatized\ndocuments. TWIX achieves over 90% precision and recall on average,\noutperforming tools from industry: Textract and Azure Document Intelligence,\nand vision-based LLMs like GPT-4-Vision, by over 25% in precision and recall.\nTWIX scales easily to large datasets and is 734X faster and 5836X cheaper than\nvision-based LLMs for extracting data from a large document collection with 817\npages.",

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce PPD, a multi-reward optimization objective that aligns diffusion\nmodels with personalized preferences. With PPD, a diffusion model learns the\nindividual preferences of a population of users in a few-shot way, enabling\ngeneralization to unseen users. Specifically, our approach (1) leverages a\nvision-language model (VLM) to extract personal preference embeddings from a\nsmall set of pairwise preference examples, and then (2) incorporates the\nembeddings into diffusion models through cross attention. Conditioning on user\nembeddings, the text-to-image models are fine-tuned with the DPO objective,\nsimultaneously optimizing for alignment with the preferences of multiple users.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that our method effectively optimizes for\nmultiple reward functions and can interpolate between them during inference. In\nreal-world user scenarios, with as few as four preference examples from a new\nuser, our approach achieves an average win rate of 76\\% over Stable Cascade,\ngenerating images that more accurately reflect specific user preferences.",

However, prior\ntheoretical work on SCI systems focuses solely on independently and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian masks, which do not permit such optimization.

The\nDNN is partitioned in SL, with most layers residing on the server and a few\ninitial layers and inputs on the client side. This configuration allows\nresource-constrained clients to participate in training and inference. However,\nthe distributed architecture exposes SL to backdoor attacks, where malicious\nclients can manipulate local datasets to alter the DNN's behavior. Existing\ndefenses from other distributed frameworks like Federated Learning are not\napplicable, and there is a lack of effective backdoor defenses specifically\ndesigned for SL.\n  We present SafeSplit, the first defense against client-side backdoor attacks\nin Split Learning (SL). SafeSplit enables the server to detect and filter out\nmalicious client behavior by employing circular backward analysis after a\nclient's training is completed, iteratively reverting to a trained checkpoint\nwhere the model under examination is found to be benign. It uses a two-fold\nanalysis to identify client-induced changes and detect poisoned models.

Such needs\ncall for a data structure that can efficiently and accurately support range\nqueries of Tucker decomposition and stream updates. Unfortunately, existing\nmethods do not support either range queries or stream updates. This challenging\nproblem has remained open for years prior to our work. To solve this\nchallenging problem, we propose TUCKET, a data structure that can efficiently\nand accurately handle both range queries and stream updates. Our key idea is to\ndesign a new data structure that we call a stream segment tree by generalizing\nthe segment tree, a data structure that was originally invented for\ncomputational geometry. For a range query of length $L$, our TUCKET can find\n$O(\\log L)$ nodes (called the hit set) from the tree and efficiently stitch\ntheir preprocessed decompositions to answer the range query. We also propose an\nalgorithm to optimally prune the hit set via an approximation of subtensor\ndecomposition. For the $T$-th stream update, our TUCKET modifies only amortized\n$O(1)$ nodes and only $O(\\log T)$ nodes in the worst case. Extensive evaluation\ndemonstrates that our TUCKET consistently achieves the highest efficiency and\naccuracy across four large-scale datasets.

Although both\npolymorphs exhibit a complete photonic bandgap, the cubic diamond exhibits it\nat lower frequencies than the hexagonal counterpart, positioning him as a\npromising candidate for photonic applications.Herein, we demonstrate that the\n1:1 mixture of identical patchy particles cannot selectively form the cubic\ndiamond polymorph due to the frustrations present in the system that are\nmanifested in the primary adsorption layer and propagate as the film grows. We\nprovide a plausible} explanation why the binary system under confinement,\nresembling interactions between the complementary DNA bases cannot yield the\nselectivity in the formation of cubic diamond crystals which is based on the\nsimilarities to the antiferromagnetic systems.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years,\nyet it continues to struggle with a fundamental aspect of cognition present in\nall animals: common sense. Current AI systems, including those designed for\ncomplex tasks like autonomous driving, problem-solving challenges such as the\nAbstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), and conversational benchmarks like the\nTuring Test, often lack the ability to adapt to new situations without\nextensive prior knowledge. This manuscript argues that integrating common sense\ninto AI systems is essential for achieving true autonomy and unlocking the full\nsocietal and commercial value of AI.\n  We propose a shift in the order of knowledge acquisition emphasizing the\nimportance of developing AI systems that start from minimal prior knowledge and\nare capable of contextual learning, adaptive reasoning, and embodiment -- even\nwithin abstract domains. Additionally, we highlight the need to rethink the AI\nsoftware stack to address this foundational challenge. Without common sense, AI\nsystems may never reach true autonomy, instead exhibiting asymptotic\nperformance that approaches theoretical ideals like AIXI but remains\nunattainable in practice due to infinite resource and computation requirements.\n  While scaling AI models and passing benchmarks like the Turing Test have\nbrought significant advancements in applications that do not require autonomy,\nthese approaches alone are insufficient to achieve autonomous AI with common\nsense. By redefining existing benchmarks and challenges to enforce constraints\nthat require genuine common sense, and by broadening our understanding of\nembodiment to include both physical and abstract domains, we can encourage the\ndevelopment of AI systems better equipped to handle the complexities of\nreal-world and abstract environments.",

This is limited by our\ncurrent understanding of the strong nuclear force, as quantified by the strong\ncoupling, $\\alpha_s$, between quarks and gluons. Relating $\\alpha_s$ to\nexperiments poses a major challenge as the strong interactions lead to the\nconfinement of quarks and gluons inside hadronic bound states. At high\nenergies, however, the strong interactions become weaker (\"asymptotic freedom\")\nand thus amenable to an expansion in powers of the coupling. Attempts to relate\nboth regimes usually rely on modeling of the bound state problem in one way or\nanother. Using large scale numerical simulations of a first principles\nformulation of Quantum Chromodynamics on a space-time lattice, we have carried\nout a model-independent determination of $\\alpha_s$ with unprecedented\nprecision. The uncertainty, about half that of all other results combined,\noriginates predominantly from the statistical Monte Carlo evaluation and has a\nclear probabilistic interpretation. The result for $\\alpha_s$ describes a\nvariety of physical phenomena over a wide range of energy scales. If used as\ninput information, it will enable significantly improved analyses of many high\nenergy experiments, by removing an important source of theoretical uncertainty.\nThis will increase the likelihood to uncover small effects of yet unknown\nphysics, and enable stringent precision tests of the Standard Model.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic approach for relational exploration in\ncultural heritage knowledge graphs, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nexplanation generation and a novel mathematical framework to quantify the\ninterestingness of relationships. We demonstrate the importance of\ninterestingness measure using a quantitative analysis, by highlighting its\nimpact on the overall performance of our proposed system, particularly in terms\nof precision, recall, and F1-score. Using the Wikidata Cultural Heritage Linked\nOpen Data (WCH-LOD) dataset, our approach yields a precision of 0.70, recall of\n0.68, and an F1-score of 0.69, representing an improvement compared to\ngraph-based (precision: 0.28, recall: 0.25, F1-score: 0.26) and knowledge-based\nbaselines (precision: 0.45, recall: 0.42, F1-score: 0.43). Furthermore, our\nLLM-powered explanations exhibit better quality, reflected in BLEU (0.52),\nROUGE-L (0.58), and METEOR (0.63) scores, all higher than the baseline\napproaches. We show a strong correlation (0.65) between interestingness measure\nand the quality of generated explanations, validating its effectiveness. The\nfindings highlight the importance of LLMs and a mathematical formalization for\ninterestingness in enhancing the effectiveness of relational exploration in\ncultural heritage knowledge graphs, with results that are measurable and\ntestable. We further show that the system enables more effective exploration\ncompared to purely knowledge-based and graph-based methods.",

The\ngeneralized theory is founded on matrix-induced orthogonality of the left and\nright eigenvectors of a generalized eigenvalue problem involving the system\nmatrix and relaxation operator. This framework establishes a rigorous lower\nbound on the spectral radius of the two-grid error-propagation operator,\nenabling precise predictions of the convergence rate for symmetric indefinite\nproblems, such as those arising from saddle-point systems. We apply this theory\nto the recently developed monolithic smooth aggregation AMG (SA-AMG) solver for\nStokes, constructed using evolution-based strength of connection, standard\naggregation, and smoothed prolongation. The performance of these solvers is\nevaluated using additive and multiplicative Vanka relaxation strategies.\nAdditive Vanka relaxation constructs patches algebraically on each level,\nresulting in a nonsymmetric relaxation operator due to the partition of unity\nbeing applied on one side of the block-diagonal matrix. Although symmetry can\nbe restored by eliminating the partition of unity, this compromises\nconvergence. Alternatively, multiplicative Vanka relaxation updates velocity\nand pressure sequentially within each patch, propagating updates\nmultiplicatively across the domain and effectively addressing velocity-pressure\ncoupling, ensuring a symmetric relaxation. We demonstrate that the generalized\noptimal AMG theory consistently provides accurate lower bounds on the\nconvergence rate for SA-AMG applied to Stokes equations. These findings suggest\npotential avenues for further enhancement in AMG solver design for saddle-point\nsystems.",

Although variants, such as the size modified PB and\nnonlocal modified PB models, have been developed to account for ionic size\neffects and nonlocal dielectric correlations, no existing PB variants\nsimultaneously incorporate both, due to significant modeling and computational\nchallenges. To address this gap, in this paper, a nonlocal size modified PB\n(NSMPB) model is introduced and solved using a finite element method for a\nprotein with a three-dimensional molecular structure and an ionic solution\ncontaining multiple ion species. In particular, a novel solution decomposition\nis proposed to overcome the difficulties caused by the increased nonlinearity,\nnonlocality, and solution singularities of the model. It is then applied to the\ndevelopment of the NSMPB finite element solver, which includes an efficient\nmodified Newton iterative method, an effective damping parameter selection\nstrategy, and good selections of initial iterations. Moreover, the construction\nof the modified Newton iterative method is mathematically justified.\nFurthermore, an NSMPB finite element package is developed by integrating a mesh\ngeneration tool, a protein data bank file retrieval program, and the PDB2PQR\npackage to simplify and accelerate its usage and application. Finally,\nnumerical experiments are conducted on an ionic solution with four species,\nproteins with up to 11439 atoms, and irregular interface-fitted tetrahedral box\nmeshes with up to 1188840 vertices. The numerical results confirm the fast\nconvergence and strong robustness of the modified Newton iterative method,\ndemonstrate the high performance of the package, and highlight the crucial\nroles played by the damping parameter and initial iteration selections in\nenhancing the method's convergence.

In the initial stages, both models exhibit commendable\ncompatibility with observed features of structure formation, aligning with the\nestablished $\\Lambda$CDM model. The derived Jeans' wavenumbers for each model\nsupport their viability. However, as the cosmic timeline progresses into the\nlate universe, a discernible disparity surfaces. Utilizing the Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo method, we reconstruct the deceleration parameter $(q)$ and\nidentify Deceleration - Acceleration redshift transition values. For $f(R)$\ngravity, our results align closely with previous studies, emphasizing its\nsuperior ability to elucidate the recent cosmic acceleration. In contrast,\nRastall gravity exhibits distinct redshift transition values. Our rigorous\nanalysis underscores the prowess of $f(R)$ gravity in capturing the observed\ncosmic acceleration, positioning it as a compelling alternative to the\nconventional $\\Lambda$CDM model. The discernible shifts observed in the peaks\nof the CMB power spectrum and evolution of deceleration parameter (q) for both\n$f(R)$ gravity and Rastall gravity models in the Early and Late universe, in\nrelation to the $\\Lambda $CDM model, provide compelling evidence supporting the\nproposition that these alternative gravity models can account for the\nanisotropy of the universe without invoking the need for dark energy.",

Recently, astronomers\nhave found that about 6% of massive white dwarfs seem to have \"paused\" their\ncooling for up to ~10 Gyr. The leading explanation for this cooling delay is\nthe distillation of neutron-rich isotopes such as $^{22}$Ne in the white\ndwarf's interior, which releases a considerable amount of gravitational energy\nas the star's internal structure rearranges. Here, we consider the impact of\n$^{22}$Ne distillation on the evolution of white dwarf habitable zones. We find\nthat $^{22}$Ne distillation in the white dwarf host dramatically increases the\ntime that a planet can continuously reside within the habitable zone (giving\nmore time for life to arise) and that long-lasting habitable zones are located\nfarther from the star (decreasing the impact of tidal forces).

However, these\nmeasurements are dominated by the effects of switching the detector on and off,\nrather than by the detection of Hawking radiation particles. We demonstrate\nthat a freely-falling Unruh-DeWitt detector cannot directly measure Hawking\nradiation near the horizon because the time required for thermalization is\nlonger than the time spent near the horizon.

The method the\nsystem uses to capture this data is based on a new cognitive science framework\ncalled co-creative sense-making (CCSM). The CCSM is based on the cognitive\ntheory of enaction, which describes how meaning emerges through interaction\nwith the environment and other people in that environment in a process of\nsense-making. The CCSM quantifies elements of interaction dynamics to identify\nsense-making patterns and interaction trends.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in chart understanding tasks. However, interpreting charts with\ntextual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully\ncapture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts\ninto code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all\ncritical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in\nchart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to\nchart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart\ndetails in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training\ndata. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{ChartCoder}, the first\ndedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language\nbackbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we\nintroduce \\textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset\nfor chart-to-code generation, and propose the \\textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)}\nmethod, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step\ngeneration. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters,\nsurpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving\nsuperior chart restoration and code excitability.

Various model\nparallelism strategies are used in multi-gpu training and inference to\npartition computation across multiple devices, reducing memory load and\ncomputation time. However, using model parallelism necessitates communication\nof information between GPUs, which has been a major bottleneck and limits the\ngains obtained by scaling up the number of devices. We introduce Ladder\nResidual, a simple architectural modification applicable to all residual-based\nmodels that enables straightforward overlapping that effectively hides the\nlatency of communication. Our insight is that in addition to systems\noptimization, one can also redesign the model architecture to decouple\ncommunication from computation. While Ladder Residual can allow\ncommunication-computation decoupling in conventional parallelism patterns, we\nfocus on Tensor Parallelism in this paper, which is particularly bottlenecked\nby its heavy communication. For a Transformer model with 70B parameters,\napplying Ladder Residual to all its layers can achieve 29% end-to-end wall\nclock speed up at inference time with TP sharding over 8 devices. We refer the\nresulting Transformer model as the Ladder Transformer. We train a 1B and 3B\nLadder Transformer from scratch and observe comparable performance to a\nstandard dense transformer baseline. We also show that it is possible to\nconvert parts of the Llama-3.1 8B model to our Ladder Residual architecture\nwith minimal accuracy degradation by only retraining for 3B tokens.

This paper thoroughly\ninvestigates potential mission scenarios to the first Saturn Trojan, 2019\nUO$_{14}$, to determine the necessary launch window and spacecraft\nspecifications. First, by assuming a ballistic flight using chemical engines,\noptimal sequences of events, including (powered) gravity-assist maneuvers and\ndeep-space maneuvers, are identified through a meta-heuristic global trajectory\noptimization algorithm. The analysis indicates that flyby exploration is\nfeasible with a launch window around 2034 and a $\\Delta V$ ranging from 92 m/s\nto 1041 m/s within an 11-year mission duration, while a rendezvous can be\nachieved with a departure around 2035 and a $\\Delta V$ of 2-3 km/s.\nSpecifically, the itinerary via Saturn requires a $\\Delta V$ of 2 km/s and a\nflight time of 24.6 years, while the route via Jupiter results in a $\\Delta V$\nof 3 km/s and a flight time of 13.4 years. Given that the orbital motion of\nouter solar system objects is relatively slow, low-thrust propulsion, which\ngradually accelerates the spacecraft, proves to be effective. Consequently,\nlow-thrust trajectories to 2019 UO$_{14}$ were examined. The results\ndemonstrate that a rendezvous can be accomplished with nearly the same\ndeparture epoch, time of flight, and $\\Delta V$ as in the ballistic flight,\nsuggesting that low-thrust propulsion is highly compatible with the rendezvous\nscenario, as it significantly reduces the propellant mass fraction.",

    "abstract": "Prospective students face the challenging task of selecting a university\nprogram that will shape their academic and professional careers. For\ndecision-makers and support services, it is often time-consuming and extremely\ndifficult to match personal interests with suitable programs due to the vast\nand complex catalogue information available. This paper presents the first\ninformation system that provides students with efficient recommendations based\non both program content and personal preferences. BERTopic, a powerful topic\nmodeling algorithm, is used that leverages text embedding techniques to\ngenerate topic representations. It enables us to mine interest topics from all\ncourse descriptions, representing the full body of knowledge taught at the\ninstitution. Underpinned by the student's individual choice of topics, a\nshortlist of the most relevant programs is computed through statistical\nbacktracking in the knowledge map, a novel characterization of the\nprogram-course relationship. This approach can be applied to a wide range of\neducational settings, including professional and vocational training. A case\nstudy at a post-secondary school with 80 programs and over 5,000 courses shows\nthat the system provides immediate and effective decision support. The\npresented interest topics are meaningful, leading to positive effects such as\nserendipity, personalization, and fairness, as revealed by a qualitative study\ninvolving 65 students. Over 98% of users indicated that the recommendations\naligned with their interests, and about 94% stated they would use the tool in\nthe future. Quantitative analysis shows the system can be configured to ensure\nfairness, achieving 98% program coverage while maintaining a personalization\nscore of 0.77. These findings suggest that this real-time, user-centered,\ndata-driven system could improve the program selection process.",

    "abstract": "The layer Hall effect is an intriguing phenomenon observed in magnetic\ntopological layered materials, where the Hall response arises from the opposite\ndeflection of electrons on top and bottom layers. To realize layer Hall effect,\nspace-time $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is typically broken by applying an external\nelectric field. In this work, we propose a new mechanism to realize the layer\nHall effect by introducing inequivalent exchange fields on both surfaces of a\ntopological insulator thin film, in the absence of an electric field. This\napproach yields a distinct Hall response compared to the conventional\nelectric-field-induced layer Hall effect, particularly with respect to the\nFermi level. Taking the topological insulator Sb$_2$Te$_3$ as a concrete\nexample, we demonstrate the feasibility of inducing the layer Hall effect only\nby coupling the top and bottom surfaces of Sb$_2$Te$_3$ with different magnetic\ninsulators. Notably, we show that both built-in electric-field-induced and\ninequivalent exchange-fields-induced layer Hall effects can be achieved by\ntuning the stacking order between Sb$_2$Te$_3$ and the magnetic layers. Given\nthe well-established experimental techniques for fabricating topological\ninsulator thin films, our work offers a viable pathway for realizing layer Hall\neffect without external electric field.",

At zero energy\ndensity, we show that RG trajectories consistently flow toward the ergodic\nphase, and are characterized by an unconventional scaling of the fractal\ndimension near the ergodic fixed point.

    "abstract": "Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is one of the crucial factors that affect the\nchiral symmetry of matter by causing the spatial symmetry breaking of the\nsystem. We find that Raman-induced SOC can induce a chiral supersolid phase\nwith a helical antiskyrmion lattice in balanced Rydberg-dressed two-component\nBose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a harmonic trap by modulating the Raman\ncoupling strength. This is in stark contrast to the mirror symmetric supersolid\nphase containing skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice pair for the case of Rashba SOC.\nTwo ground-state phase diagrams are presented as a function of the Rydberg\ninteraction strength and the SOC strength, as well as that of the Rydberg\ninteraction strength and the Raman coupling strength, respectively. It is shown\nthat the interplay among Raman-induced SOC, Rydberg interactions, and nonlinear\ncontact interactions favors rich ground-state structures, including\nhalf-quantum vortex phase, stripe supersolid phase, toroidal stripe phase with\na central Anderson-Toulouse coreless vortex, checkerboard supersolid phase,\nmirror symmetric supersolid phase, chiral supersolid phase and standing-wave\nsupersolid phase. In addition, the effects of rotation and in-plane quadrupole\nmagnetic field on the ground state of the system are analyzed. In these two\ncases, the chiral supersolid phase is broken and the ground state tends to form\na miscible phase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the initial state is a\nchiral supersolid phase the rotating harmonic trapped system sustains\ndissipative continuous time crystal by studying the rotational dynamic\nbehaviors of the system.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) may produce outputs that are unfaithful\nto reality, also known as visual hallucinations (VH), which significantly\nimpedes their real-world usage. To alleviate VH, various decoding strategies\nhave been proposed to enhance visual information. However, many of these\nmethods may require secondary decoding and rollback, which significantly\nreduces inference speed. In this work, we propose an efficient plug-and-play\ndecoding algorithm via Visual-Aware Sparsification (VASparse) from the\nperspective of token sparsity for mitigating VH. VASparse is inspired by\nempirical observations: (1) the sparse activation of attention in LVLMs, and\n(2) visual-agnostic tokens sparsification exacerbates VH. Based on these\ninsights, we propose a novel token sparsification strategy that balances\nefficiency and trustworthiness. Specifically, VASparse implements a\nvisual-aware token selection strategy during decoding to reduce redundant\ntokens while preserving visual context effectively. Additionally, we\ninnovatively introduce a sparse-based visual contrastive decoding method to\nrecalibrate the distribution of hallucinated outputs without the time overhead\nassociated with secondary decoding. Subsequently, VASparse recalibrates\nattention scores to penalize attention sinking of LVLMs towards text tokens.\nExtensive experiments across four popular benchmarks confirm the effectiveness\nof VASparse in mitigating VH across different LVLM families without requiring\nadditional training or post-processing. Impressively, VASparse achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance for mitigating VH while maintaining competitive\ndecoding speed.

Studies observing the CGM in\nabsorption using multiple or extended background objects suggest a high degree\nof variation on relatively small ($\\lesssim 1$ kpc) spatial scales. Similarly,\nhigh-resolution simulations generally exhibit small-scale substructure in the\ngas around galaxies.

The\ndistribution of clumps peaks at $\\sim 10^5$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ and $10^{4}$ K,\nconsistent with relatively condensed, cool gas with a slight preference for\ninflow-like velocities. Many clumps show internal temperature and density\nvariations, and thus internally varying ionization levels for key diagnostic\nions such as HI, MgII, and OVI. The average metallicity in clumps is about a\nfactor 1.5--2$\\times$ lower in metallicity than nearby gas, suggesting that the\nmetals are not well-mixed between structured and diffuse CGM, which may have\nimplications for observational metallicity estimations of dense CGM clouds.

    "abstract": "Fusing multi-modality inputs from different sensors is an effective way to\nimprove the performance of 3D object detection. However, current methods\noverlook two important conflicts: point-pixel misalignment and sub-task\nsuppression. The former means a pixel feature from the opaque object is\nprojected to multiple point features of the same ray in the world space, and\nthe latter means the classification prediction and bounding box regression may\ncause mutual suppression. In this paper, we propose a novel method named\nConflict Resolution Network (CoreNet) to address the aforementioned issues.\nSpecifically, we first propose a dual-stream transformation module to tackle\npoint-pixel misalignment. It consists of ray-based and point-based 2D-to-BEV\ntransformations. Both of them achieve approximately unique mapping from the\nimage space to the world space. Moreover, we introduce a task-specific\npredictor to tackle sub-task suppression. It uses the dual-branch structure\nwhich adopts class-specific query and Bbox-specific query to corresponding\nsub-tasks. Each task-specific query is constructed of task-specific feature and\ngeneral feature, which allows the heads to adaptively select information of\ninterest based on different sub-tasks. Experiments on the large-scale nuScenes\ndataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CoreNet, by achieving\n75.6\\% NDS and 73.3\\% mAP on the nuScenes test set without test-time\naugmentation and model ensemble techniques.

Due to the biodiversity of species in grassland\necosystems, it is not appropriate to consider overly simplified models of\ncompetition between grasses and trees.

Most models study the\nevolution of the prevalence of particular lineages over time and require a\nprior classification of sequences into lineages. Such process is prone to\ninduce delays and bias. More recently, few authors studied the evolution of the\nprevalence of mutations over time with alternative clustering approaches,\navoiding specific lineage classification. Most of the aforementioned methods\nare however either non parametric or unsuited to pooled data characterizing,\nfor instance, wastewater samples. In this context, we propose an alternative\nunsupervised method for clustering mutations according to their frequency\ntrajectory over time and estimating group fitness from time series of pooled\nmutation prevalence data. Our model is a mixture of observed count data and\nlatent group assignment and we use the expectation-maximization algorithm for\nmodel selection and parameter estimation. The application of our method to time\nseries of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data collected from wastewater treatment plants\nin France from October 2020 to April 2021 shows its ability to agnostically\ngroup mutations according to their probability of belonging to B.1.160, Alpha,\nBeta, B.1.177 variants with selection coefficient estimates per group in\ncoherence with the viral dynamics in France reported by Nextstrain.

Mainstream LLIE\nmethods typically learn an end-to-end mapping based on pairs of low-light and\nnormal-light images. However, normal-light images under varying illumination\nconditions serve as reference images, making it difficult to define a\n``perfect'' reference image This leads to the challenge of reconciling\nmetric-oriented and visual-friendly results. Recently, many cross-modal studies\nhave found that side information from other related modalities can guide visual\nrepresentation learning. Based on this, we introduce a Natural Language\nSupervision (NLS) strategy, which learns feature maps from text corresponding\nto images, offering a general and flexible interface for describing an image\nunder different illumination.\n  However, image distributions conditioned on textual descriptions are highly\nmultimodal, which makes training difficult. To address this issue, we design a\nTextual Guidance Conditioning Mechanism (TCM) that incorporates the connections\nbetween image regions and sentence words, enhancing the ability to capture\nfine-grained cross-modal cues for images and text. This strategy not only\nutilizes a wider range of supervised sources, but also provides a new paradigm\nfor LLIE based on visual and textual feature alignment. In order to effectively\nidentify and merge features from various levels of image and textual\ninformation, we design an Information Fusion Attention (IFA) module to enhance\ndifferent regions at different levels.

In\nthis paper, we develop a new framework to model the dynamic causal graph where\nthe causal relations are allowed to be time-varying.

In this paper, we\nargue that the static FR strategy, predominantly adopted in prior literature\nfor evaluating AFR efficacy, cannot faithfully characterize the actual\ncapabilities of determined trackers who aim to track a specific target\nidentity. In particular, we introduce DynTracker, a dynamic FR strategy where\nthe model's gallery database is iteratively updated with newly recognized\ntarget identity images. Surprisingly, such a simple approach renders all the\nexisting AFR protections ineffective. To mitigate the privacy threats posed by\nDynTracker, we advocate for explicitly promoting diversity in the AFR-protected\nimages. We hypothesize that the lack of diversity is the primary cause of the\nfailure of existing AFR methods. Specifically, we develop DivTrackee, a novel\nmethod for crafting diverse AFR protections that builds upon a text-guided\nimage generation framework and diversity-promoting adversarial losses. Through\ncomprehensive experiments on various image benchmarks and feature extractors,\nwe demonstrate DynTracker's strength in breaking existing AFR methods and the\nsuperiority of DivTrackee in preventing user facial images from being\nidentified by dynamic FR strategies.

This survey\ncomprehensively reviews UAV-ISAC systems, highlighting foundational concepts,\nkey advancements, and future research directions. We explore recent\nadvancements in UAV-based ISAC systems from various perspectives and\nobjectives, including advanced channel estimation (CE), beam tracking, and\nsystem throughput optimization under joint sensing and communication S\\&C\nconstraints. Additionally, we examine weighted sum rate (WSR) and sensing\ntrade-offs, delay and age of information (AoI) minimization, energy efficiency\n(EE), and security enhancement. These applications highlight the potential of\nUAV-based ISAC systems to improve spectrum utilization, enhance communication\nreliability, reduce latency, and optimize energy consumption across diverse\ndomains, including smart cities, disaster relief, and defense operations. The\nsurvey also features summary tables for comparative analysis of existing\nmethodologies, emphasizing performance, limitations, and effectiveness in\naddressing various challenges. By synthesizing recent advancements and\nidentifying open research challenges, this survey aims to be a valuable\nresource for developing efficient, adaptive, and secure UAV-based ISAC systems.",

However, these\ndevices are quite new in the HPC space, and thus, have been scarcely explored\noutside some specific scientific domain, such as machine learning or biological\nsequence alignment. The objective of this thesis is to characterize the\nFPGA-based solution for accelerating particle-mesh algorithms, in which the\nforce applied to each particle is computed based on the fields deposited in a\nfinite mesh (or grid). Our starting point is a 2D kinetic PIC plasma simulator\ncalled ZPIC that has the same core algorithm and functionalities as OSIRIS. To\ncreate an efficient hardware design, the program keeps the particles strictly\nsorted by tiles (a group of cells) and uses the local memory as an explicitly\nmanaged cache. We also create multiple copies of the local current buffer to\nsolve dependencies during the deposition phase. The resulting pipeline was\nreplicated multiple times to explore data parallelism and increase its\nthroughput. We then compare our hardware solution against similar\nimplementations on GPU and multicore CPUs, showing promising results in term of\npower efficiency and performance.\n  Keywords: FPGA, OpenCL, Kinetic Plasma Simulation.",

    "abstract": "We examine computationally the two-dimensional flow of elastoviscoplastic\n(EVP) fluids around a cylinder symmetrically placed between two plates parallel\nto its axis. The Saramito-Herschel-Bulkley fluid model is solved via the\nfinite-volume method using the OpenFOAM software. As in viscoplastic materials,\nunyielded regions arise around the plane of symmetry well ahead or behind the\ncylinder, as two small islands located above and below the cylinder and as\npolar caps at the two stagnation points on the cylinder. Most interestingly,\nunder certain conditions, an elongated yielded area around the midplane is\npredicted downstream of the cylinder, sandwiched between two unyielded areas.\nThis surprising result appears, for example, with Carbopol 0.1% when\nconsidering a blockage ratio of 0.5 (the ratio of the cylinder's diameter to\nthe channel's width) and above a critical elastic modulus (G>30 Pa). An\napproximate semi-analytical solution in the region mentioned above, reveals\nthat it is caused by the intense variation of the stress magnitude there, which\nmay approach the yield stress asymptotically either from above or below,\ndepending on material elasticity. The drag coefficient on the cylinder\nincreases with yield stress and blockage ratio but decreases with material\nelasticity. The unyielded regions expand as the yield stress increases. They\nalso expand when material elasticity increases because this allows the material\nto elastically deform more before yielding. Furthermore, by decreasing the\nelastic modulus or increasing the yield stress beyond a critical value, the\nyield surface may exhibit damped oscillations, or irregular shapes even without\na plane of symmetry, all under creeping flow conditions.",

However, incompleteness in views and labels is a common\nchallenge, often resulting from data collection oversights and uncertainties in\nmanual annotation. Furthermore, the task of learning robust multi-view\nrepresentations that are both view-consistent and view-specific from diverse\nviews still a challenge problem in MvMLC. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel framework for incomplete multi-view multi-label classification (iMvMLC).\nOur method factorizes multi-view representations into two independent sets of\nfactors: view-consistent and view-specific, and we correspondingly design a\ngraph disentangling loss to fully reduce redundancy between these\nrepresentations. Additionally, our framework innovatively decomposes consistent\nrepresentation learning into three key sub-objectives: (i) how to extract\nview-shared information across different views, (ii) how to eliminate\nintra-view redundancy in consistent representations, and (iii) how to preserve\ntask-relevant information. To this end, we design a robust task-relevant\nconsistency learning module that collaboratively learns high-quality consistent\nrepresentations, leveraging a masked cross-view prediction (MCP) strategy and\ninformation theory. Notably, all modules in our framework are developed to\nfunction effectively under conditions of incomplete views and labels, making\nour method adaptable to various multi-view and multi-label datasets. Extensive\nexperiments on five datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other\nleading approaches.",

Recently, concerns about the Dirac\ndensity's validity have arisen due to the Zitterbewegung phenomenon,\ncharacterized by a peculiar fast-oscillating solution of the coordinate\noperator that disrupts the classical relation among velocity, momentum, and\nenergy. To explore this, we applied Newton and Wigner's method to define proper\nposition operators and their eigenstates in both representations, identifying\n'localized states' orthogonal to their spatially displaced counterparts. Our\nanalysis shows that both densities could represent the probability of locating\na particle within a few Compton wavelengths. However, a critical analysis of\nLorentz transformation properties reveals that only the Dirac density meets all\nessential physical criteria for a relativistic probability density. These\ncriteria include covariance of the position eigenstate, adherence to a\ncontinuity equation, and Lorentz invariance of the probability of finding a\nparticle.

    "abstract": "Observational studies enable causal inferences when randomized controlled\ntrials (RCTs) are not feasible. However, integrating sensitive medical data\nacross multiple institutions introduces significant privacy challenges. The\ndata collaboration quasi-experiment (DC-QE) framework addresses these concerns\nby sharing \"intermediate representations\" -- dimensionality-reduced data\nderived from raw data -- instead of the raw data. While the DC-QE can estimate\ntreatment effects, its application to medical data remains unexplored. This\nstudy applied the DC-QE framework to medical data from a single institution to\nsimulate distributed data environments under independent and identically\ndistributed (IID) and non-IID conditions. We propose a novel method for\ngenerating intermediate representations within the DC-QE framework.\nExperimental results demonstrated that DC-QE consistently outperformed\nindividual analyses across various accuracy metrics, closely approximating the\nperformance of centralized analysis. The proposed method further improved\nperformance, particularly under non-IID conditions. These outcomes highlight\nthe potential of the DC-QE framework as a robust approach for\nprivacy-preserving causal inferences in healthcare. Broader adoption of this\nframework and increased use of intermediate representations could grant\nresearchers access to larger, more diverse datasets while safeguarding patient\nconfidentiality. This approach may ultimately aid in identifying previously\nunrecognized causal relationships, support drug repurposing efforts, and\nenhance therapeutic interventions for rare diseases.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, two model-free optimal output tracking frameworks based on\npolicy iteration for discrete-time multi-agent systems are proposed. First, we\nestablish a framework of stabilizing policy iteration that can start from any\ninitial feedback control policy, relaxing the dependence of traditional policy\niteration on the initial stabilizing control policy. Then, another efficient\nand equivalent $Q$-learning policy iteration framework is developed, which is\nshown to require only less system data to get the same results as the\nstabilizing policy iteration. Both frameworks obtain stabilizing control policy\nby iterating the stabilizing virtual closed-loop system step-by-step to the\nactual closed-loop system. Multiple explicit schemes for the iteration\nstep-size/coefficient are designed and their stability during the above\niterations is analyzed. By using the generated closed-loop stabilizing control\npolicy and two frameworks, the optimal feedback control gain is obtained. The\napproximate solution of the regulator equations is found by model-free\niteration, which leads to the optimal feedforward gain. Finally, the\ncooperative optimal output tracking is realized by a distributed\nfeedforward-feedback controller. The proposed algorithms are validated by\nsimulation.",

In this context, it is important to understand which factors can lead\nto such effects and for which systems, so that one can act proactively and\ntimely to prevent them. We built and studied a mathematical model that captures\nthe natural interactions between three species, in which two species are\npredators of the third, but such that one of the predators also consumes the\nother (to which we refer as Owls, Snakes and Mice).

Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder\nthe creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and\nreduced generalizability.

Traditional self-supervised\nlearning predominantly relies on the \"same instance, similar representation\"\nassumption and extensive datasets.

Recent studies demonstrate that GR, TEGR,\nand STEGR are dynamically equivalent, raising questions about the fundamental\nstructure of spacetime, the under-determination of these theories, and whether\nempirical distinctions among them are possible. The aim of this work is to show\nthat they are equivalent in many features but not exactly in everything. In\nparticular, their relationship with the Equivalence Principle (EP) is\ndifferent. The EP is a deeply theory-laden assumption, which is assumed as\nfundamental in constructing GR, with significant implications for our\nunderstanding of spacetime. However, it introduces unresolved conceptual\nissues, including its impact on the nature of the metric and connection, its\nmeaning at the quantum level, tensions with other fundamental interactions and\nnew physics, and its role in dark matter and dark energy problems. In contrast,\nTEGR and STEGR recover the EP, in particular in its strong formulation, but do\nnot rely on it as a foundational principle. The fact that GR, TEGR, and STEGR\nare equivalent in non-trivial predictions, but the EP is not necessary for TEGR\nand STEGR, suggests that it may not be a fundamental feature but an emergent\none, potentially marking differences in the empirical content of the three\ntheories.

Exploring quantum systems under the gravitational influence\nof black holes has emerged as a pivotal area of research. Among the frontier\nworks in quantum information processing is the utilization of quantum states as\nquantum channels. A fundamental quantum information protocol is teleportation,\nin which two parties, Alice and Bob, share entangled states. In this protocol,\nthe sender, Alice, who holds an unknown qubit, utilizes local operations and\nclassical communication (LOCC) to recreate the qubit at the recipient's (Bob's)\nend. Notably, during the execution of this protocol, Alice loses the unknown\nqubit on her side. The teleportation protocol, originally proposed by Bennett\net al. \\cite{bennett1993}, has been extensively studied with various states and\nunder different physical setups. Researchers have explored both modifications\nto the protocol itself and the viability of various quantum states as\nteleportation channels. In this paper, we investigate whether bipartite mixed\nstates derived from two inequivalent classes of tripartite pure states,\nsubjected to the gravitational influence of two different black hole models,\ncan still serve as efficient quantum channels for teleportation. We emphasize\nthe teleportation fidelity of these states, a critical factor for determining\ntheir efficacy as quantum channels. Specifically, the fidelity must exceed the\nclassical limit of $\\frac{2}{3}$ to be considered effective \\cite{pop1994}. We\nconjecture that, even under the gravitational influence of black holes, the\nquantum characteristics of the given states are preserved, enabling them to\nfunction effectively as quantum channels for teleportation.",

    "abstract": "A study is presented of $B^+ \\to K^0_{\\rm S} K^- \\pi^+ K^-$ and $B^+ \\to\nK^0_{\\rm S} K^+ \\pi^- K^+$ decays based on the analysis of proton-proton\ncollision data collected with the LHCb detector at centre-of-mass energies of\n7, 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9 fb^{-1}$. The\n$K^0_{\\rm S} K \\pi$ invariant-mass distributions of both $B^+$ decay modes\nshow, in the $m(K^0_{\\rm S} K \\pi)<1.85$ GeV mass region, large activity which\nis resolved using an amplitude analysis. A simple model, were $J^{PC}$\namplitudes are described by multiple Breit--Wigner functions with appropriate\nangular distributions provides a good description of the experimental data. In\nthis approach a complex mixture of $J^{PC}=0^{-+}, 1^{++}$ and $1^{+-}$\namplitudes is observed that is dominated by $\\eta(1405)$, $\\eta(1470)$,\n$\\eta(1760)$, $f_1(1285)$, $f_1(1420)$ and $h_1(1405)$ resonances. The\n$K^0_{\\rm S} K \\pi$ Dalitz plots are dominated by asymmetric crossing $K^*\n\\bar{K}$ bands which are different for the two $B^+$ decay modes.

The prevailing approach to\naddress these issues involves collecting human feedback on generated images,\ntraining reward models to estimate human feedback, and then fine-tuning T2I\nmodels based on the reward models to align them with human preferences.\nHowever, while existing reward fine-tuning methods can produce images with\nhigher rewards, they may change model behavior in unexpected ways. For example,\nfine-tuning for one quality aspect (e.g., safety) may degrade other aspects\n(e.g., prompt alignment), or may lead to reward hacking (e.g., finding a way to\nincrease rewards without having the intended effect). In this paper, we propose\nFocus-N-Fix, a region-aware fine-tuning method that trains models to correct\nonly previously problematic image regions. The resulting fine-tuned model\ngenerates images with the same high-level structure as the original model but\nshows significant improvements in regions where the original model was\ndeficient in safety (over-sexualization and violence), plausibility, or other\ncriteria.

In the octonion spaces, the field\nstrength and quaternion operator are able to combine together to become one\ncomposite operator, making an important contribution to the field equations.\nSimilarly, the field potential can also form some composite operators with the\nquaternion operator, and they have a certain impact on the field equations.\nFurthermore, other physical quantities can also be combined with the quaternion\noperator to form several composite operators. In these composite operators,\nmultiple physical quantities can also have a certain impact on the field\nequations.

    "abstract": "Conversational speech synthesis (CSS) aims to take the current dialogue (CD)\nhistory as a reference to synthesize expressive speech that aligns with the\nconversational style. Unlike CD, stored dialogue (SD) contains preserved\ndialogue fragments from earlier stages of user-agent interaction, which include\nstyle expression knowledge relevant to scenarios similar to those in CD. Note\nthat this knowledge plays a significant role in enabling the agent to\nsynthesize expressive conversational speech that generates empathetic feedback.\nHowever, prior research has overlooked this aspect. To address this issue, we\npropose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Dialogue Knowledge Aggregation scheme for\nexpressive CSS, termed RADKA-CSS, which includes three main components: 1) To\neffectively retrieve dialogues from SD that are similar to CD in terms of both\nsemantic and style. First, we build a stored dialogue semantic-style database\n(SDSSD) which includes the text and audio samples. Then, we design a\nmulti-attribute retrieval scheme to match the dialogue semantic and style\nvectors of the CD with the stored dialogue semantic and style vectors in the\nSDSSD, retrieving the most similar dialogues. 2) To effectively utilize the\nstyle knowledge from CD and SD, we propose adopting the multi-granularity graph\nstructure to encode the dialogue and introducing a multi-source style knowledge\naggregation mechanism. 3) Finally, the aggregated style knowledge are fed into\nthe speech synthesizer to help the agent synthesize expressive speech that\naligns with the conversational style. We conducted a comprehensive and in-depth\nexperiment based on the DailyTalk dataset, which is a benchmarking dataset for\nthe CSS task.\n  Both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that RADKA-CSS\noutperforms baseline models in expressiveness rendering.

The primary goal is to develop an\nefficient, machine-learning (ML)-based method that overcomes the limitations of\ntraditional permeability estimation techniques, which often rely on\ntime-consuming experiments or computationally expensive fluid dynamics\nsimulations. The novelty of this work lies in leveraging Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN) to predict pore-fluid flow behavior under deformation and\nanisotropic flow conditions. Particularly, the described approach employs\nbinarized CT images of porous micro-structure as inputs to predict the\nsymmetric second-order permeability tensor, a critical parameter in continuum\nporous media flow modeling. The methodology comprises four key steps: (1)\nconstructing a dataset of CT images from Bentheim sandstone at different\nvolumetric strain levels; (2) performing pore-scale simulations of single-phase\nflow using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) to generate permeability data;\n(3) training the CNN model with the processed CT images as inputs and\npermeability tensors as outputs; and (4) exploring techniques to improve model\ngeneralization, including data augmentation and alternative CNN architectures.\nExamples are provided to demonstrate the CNN's capability to accurately predict\nthe permeability tensor, a crucial parameter in various disciplines such as\ngeotechnical engineering, hydrology, and material science.

    "abstract": "The Open Network (TON), designed to support Telegram's extensive user base of\nhundreds of millions, has garnered considerable attention since its launch in\n2022. FunC is the most popular programming language for writing smart contracts\non TON. It is distinguished by a unique syntax compared to other smart contract\nlanguages. Despite growing interest, research on the practical defects of TON\nsmart contracts is still in its early stages. In this paper, we summarize eight\nsmart contract defects identified from TON's official blogs and audit reports,\neach with detailed definitions and code examples. Furthermore, we propose a\nstatic analysis framework called TONScanner to facilitate the detection of\nthese defects. Specifically, TONScanner reuses FunC compiler's frontend code to\ntransform the FunC source code into FunC intermediate representation (IR) in\nthe form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Based on this IR, TONScanner\nconstructs a control flow graph (CFG), then transforms it into a static single\nassignment (SSA) form to simplify further analysis. TONScanner also integrates\nData Dependency, Call Graph, Taint Analysis, and Cell Construct, which are\nspecifically tailored for TON blockchain's unique data structures. These\ncomponents finally facilitate the identification of the eight defects. We\nevaluate the effectiveness of TONScanner by applying it to 1,640 smart\ncontracts and find a total of 14,995 defects. Through random sampling and\nmanual labeling, we find that TONScanner achieves an overall precision of\n97.49%. The results reveal that current TON contracts contain numerous defects,\nindicating that developers are prone to making errors.

    "abstract": "The equation of state is fundamental in describing matter under the extreme\nconditions characteristic of neutron stars and is central to advancing our\nunderstanding of dense matter physics. A critical challenge, however, lies in\naccurately modelling first-order phase transitions while ensuring thermodynamic\nconsistency and aligning with astrophysical observations. This study explores\ntwo frameworks for constructing EoSs with first-order phase transitions: the\npolytropic interpolation method and the randomized speed-of-sound interpolation\napproach. It is found that the mass-radius relation and pressure vs. energy\ndensity relation are blind towards the thermodynamic consistency check. The\npolytropic interpolation method can exhibit discontinuities in the chemical\npotential for first-order phase transition, raising concerns regarding\npotential causality violations and thermodynamic inconsistencies. In contrast,\nthe speed of sound interpolation approach ensures continuity in the chemical\npotential, offering a more thermodynamically consistent and reliable framework.\nMoreover, the sound speed method effectively captures the softer segment of the\nmass-radius spectrum, a capability not achieved by the consistent\npiecewise-polytropic approach due to its monotonic stiffness constraints. The\nspeed of sound definition involving number density and chemical potential\nreveals the thermodynamic inconsistency, making it a more consistent and robust\ndefinition. These findings underscore the importance of thermodynamic\nconsistency in EoS construction and highlight the advantages of the randomized\nspeed-of-sound method for modelling phase transitions in dense matter.",

Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), with\ntheir capability to adaptively reconfigure the radio environment, have shown\nsignificant potential in enhancing communication quality and enabling advanced\ncooperative sensing. This paper investigates a multi-RIS-assisted ISAC system\nand introduces a novel multi-perspective observation framework that leverages\nthe diversity of multiple observation paths, each exhibiting distinct spatial,\ndelay, and Doppler characteristics for both target and clutter. The proposed\nframework integrates symbol-level precoding (SLP) and space-time adaptive\nprocessing (STAP) to fully exploit the benefits of multi-perspective\nobservations, enabling superior target-clutter separation and significantly\nimproving detection accuracy. The objective is to jointly design the transmit\nwaveform, reflection coefficients of multiple active RISs, and spatial-temporal\nreceive filters to maximize the radar output signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio\n(SCNR) for target detection, while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements of communication users. To address the resulting non-convex\noptimization problem, an effective iterative algorithm is developed, combining\nfractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM), and the\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).

However, this assumption, which is called\nclosed-set learning, is hard to meet in realistic scenarios for deploying deep\nlearning models. As one of the solutions to mitigate this assumption, research\non out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has been actively explored in various\ndomains. In OOD detection, we assume that we are given the data of a new class\nthat was not seen in the training phase, i.e., outlier, at the evaluation\nphase. The ultimate goal of OOD detection is to detect and classify such unseen\noutlier data as a novel \"unknown\" class. Among various research branches for\nOOD detection, generating a virtual outlier during the training phase has been\nproposed. However, conventional generation-based methodologies utilize\nin-distribution training dataset to imitate outlier instances, which limits the\nquality of the synthesized virtual outlier instance itself. In this paper, we\npropose a novel methodology for OOD detection named Auxiliary Range Expansion\nfor Outlier Synthesis, or ARES. ARES models the region for generating\nout-of-distribution instances by escaping from the given in-distribution\nregion; instead of remaining near the boundary of in-distribution region.\nVarious stages consists ARES to ultimately generate valuable OOD-like virtual\ninstances.

Specifically, we consider a design principle of ``animation for\nediting'', and train Qffusion as a general animation framework from two still\nreference images while we can use it for portrait video editing easily by\napplying modified start and end frames as references during inference.\nLeveraging the powerful generative power of Stable Diffusion, we propose a\nQuadrant-grid Arrangement (QGA) scheme for latent re-arrangement, which\narranges the latent codes of two reference images and that of four facial\nconditions into a four-grid fashion, separately. Then, we fuse features of\nthese two modalities and use self-attention for both appearance and temporal\nlearning, where representations at different times are jointly modeled under\nQGA. Our Qffusion can achieve stable video editing without additional networks\nor complex training stages, where only the input format of Stable Diffusion is\nmodified. Further, we propose a Quadrant-grid Propagation (QGP) inference\nstrategy, which enjoys a unique advantage on stable arbitrary-length video\ngeneration by processing reference and condition frames recursively. Through\nextensive experiments, Qffusion consistently outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques on portrait video editing. Project page:\nhttps://qffusion.github.io/page/.",

In this study, we interviewed 27\nChinese developers in commercial software development and open source global\nsoftware development teams and applied Bourdieu's capital-field-habitus\nframework in an abductive data analysis process. Our study reveals four types\nof capital (language, social, symbolic, and economic) involved in their\nexperiences and examines the interrelations among them.

However, the absence of a standalone\nstatistical software package to facilitate DDDM for large healthcare\nadministrative databases has remained a significant gap. This paper introduces\nthe R statistical software package CMHSU, available on the Comprehensive R\nArchive Network (CRAN), for the diagnosis of mental health (MH), substance use\n(SU), and their concurrent status (MHSU). The package implements DDDM using\nhospital and medical service physician visit counts along with maximum time\nspan parameters for MH, SU, and MHSU diagnoses. A working example using a\nsimulated real-world dataset is presented to examine various analytical\naspects, including three key dimensions of MHSU detection based on the DDDM\nframework, as well as temporal analysis to demonstrate the package's\napplication for healthcare policymakers. Additionally, the limitations of the\nCMHSU package and potential directions for its future extension are discussed.",

The Hester Davis Score (HDS) is commonly used to assess fall\nrisk, with current clinical practice relying on a threshold-based approach. In\nthis method, a patient is classified as high-risk when their HDS exceeds a\npredefined threshold. However, this approach may fail to capture dynamic\npatterns in fall risk over time. In this study, we model the threshold-based\napproach and propose two machine learning approaches for enhanced fall\nprediction: One-step ahead fall prediction and sequence-to-point fall\nprediction. The one-step ahead model uses the HDS at the current timestamp to\npredict the risk at the next timestamp, while the sequence-to-point model\nleverages all preceding HDS values to predict fall risk using deep learning. We\ncompare these approaches to assess their accuracy in fall risk prediction,\ndemonstrating that deep learning can outperform the traditional threshold-based\nmethod by capturing temporal patterns and improving prediction reliability.\nThese findings highlight the potential for data-driven approaches to enhance\npatient safety through more reliable fall prevention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often underperform on\nmathematical problem-solving tasks that require fine-grained visual\nunderstanding. The limitation is largely attributable to inadequate perception\nof geometric primitives during image-level contrastive pre-training (e.g.,\nCLIP). While recent efforts to improve math MLLMs have focused on scaling up\nmathematical visual instruction datasets and employing stronger LLM backbones,\nthey often overlook persistent errors in visual recognition. In this paper, we\nsystematically evaluate the visual grounding capabilities of state-of-the-art\nMLLMs and reveal a significant negative correlation between visual grounding\naccuracy and problem-solving performance, underscoring the critical role of\nfine-grained visual understanding. Notably, advanced models like GPT-4o exhibit\na 70% error rate when identifying geometric entities, highlighting that this\nremains a key bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning. To address this, we\npropose a novel approach, SVE-Math (Selective Vision-Enhanced Mathematical\nMLLM), featuring a geometric-grounded vision encoder and a feature router that\ndynamically adjusts the contribution of hierarchical visual feature maps. Our\nmodel recognizes accurate visual primitives and generates precise visual\nprompts tailored to the language model's reasoning needs. In experiments,\nSVE-Math-Qwen2.5-7B outperforms other 7B models by 15% on MathVerse and is\ncompatible with GPT-4V on MathVista. Despite being trained on smaller datasets,\nSVE-Math-7B achieves competitive performance on GeoQA, rivaling models trained\non significantly larger datasets. Our findings emphasize the importance of\nincorporating fine-grained visual understanding into MLLMs and provide a\npromising direction for future research.",

Specifically, after imputing non-overlapping\nsamples, we introduce evidence theory to estimate the uncertainty of imputed\nsamples, and only samples with low uncertainty are selected. In this way,\nhigh-quality non-overlapping samples are utilized to improve VFL model.\nExperiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate the significant performance\ngains achieved by the RISA, especially with the limited overlapping samples,\ne.g., a 48% accuracy gain on CIFAR-10 with only 1% overlapping samples.",

    "abstract": "Scaling language models to handle longer input sequences typically\nnecessitates large key-value (KV) caches, resulting in substantial memory\noverhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Tensor Product Attention\n(TPA), a novel attention mechanism that uses tensor decompositions to represent\nqueries, keys, and values compactly, substantially shrinking the KV cache size\nat inference time. By factorizing these representations into contextual\nlow-rank components and seamlessly integrating with Rotary Position Embedding\n(RoPE), TPA achieves improved model quality alongside memory efficiency. Based\non TPA, we introduce the Tensor Product Attention Transformer,(T6), a new model\narchitecture for sequence modeling. Through extensive empirical evaluation on\nlanguage modeling tasks, we demonstrate that T6 surpasses or matches the\nperformance of standard Transformer baselines, including Multi-Head Attention\n(MHA), Multi-Query Attention (MQA), Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), and\nMulti-Head Latent Attention (MLA) across various metrics, including perplexity\nand a range of established evaluation benchmarks. Notably, TPA's memory\nefficiency and computational efficiency at the decoding stage enable processing\nlonger sequences under fixed resource constraints, addressing a critical\nscalability challenge in modern language models. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/tensorgi/T6.",

    "abstract": "Program synthesis has traditionally relied on human-provided specifications,\nexamples, or prior knowledge to generate functional algorithms. Existing\nmethods either emulate human-written algorithms or solve specific tasks without\ngenerating reusable programmatic logic, limiting their ability to create novel\nalgorithms. We introduce AlgoPilot, a groundbreaking approach for fully\nautomated program synthesis without human-written programs or trajectories.\nAlgoPilot leverages reinforcement learning (RL) guided by a Trajectory Language\nModel (TLM) to synthesize algorithms from scratch. The TLM, trained on\ntrajectories generated by random Python functions, serves as a soft constraint\nduring the RL process, aligning generated sequences with patterns likely to\nrepresent valid algorithms. Using sorting as a test case, AlgoPilot\ndemonstrates its ability to generate trajectories that are interpretable as\nclassical algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, while operating without prior\nalgorithmic knowledge. This work establishes a new paradigm for algorithm\ndiscovery and lays the groundwork for future advancements in autonomous program\nsynthesis.",

In this work, the perturbation equations\nof two scalar fields for the Yang-Mills field modified RN black hole are\nderived. By combining the WKB method and the Prony method, the quasi-normal\nmodes frequencies of the perturbations are analyzed. Additionally, constraints\non the charge-to-mass ratio of the charged and massive scalar field are\nobtained using the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), and it is shown that the\nYang-Mills field modified RN black hole satisfies the SCCC conditions in the\nextreme state. The study reveals that the Yang-Mills field charge $q_{YM}$\nsignificantly affects the damping effect and gravitational blueshift effect of\nthe perturbations, causing the RN black hole in the extreme state to transition\nfrom violating the SCCC to satisfying it. Furthermore, when the charge-to-mass\nratio $q/m$ of the charged and massive scalar field satisfies the WGC\ncondition, the scalar field perturbations destabilize the Cauchy horizon of the\nYang-Mills field modified RN black hole in the extreme state, thus confirming\nthe applicability of the SCCC under extreme conditions. This study highlights\nthe key role of nonlinear fields in singularity theory and gravitational\ndynamics, providing important support for the completeness of general\nrelativity and offering new insights into the theoretical research of black\nholes in extreme states.",

Emerging\nresearch suggests that the accuracy of the standard quasi-steady-state\napproximation improves as the ratio of the initial enzyme concentration, $e_0$,\nto the Michaelis constant, $K_M$, decreases. In this work, we examine this\nratio and its implications for the accuracy and validity of the standard\nquasi-steady-state approximation as compared to other quasi-steady-state\nreductions in its proximity.

Here, we report on observations of an RB resulting from an EUV jet\nwith a speed of about 90\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. The loops connecting the RB and the jet\nhave an apparent length of about 59\\,Mm. Intriguingly, the RB exhibits at least\ntwo episodes of brightenings, as characterised by two peaks in its lightcurve.\nThe energies, which sustain the first and second peaks of the RB, are\n$6.3\\times10^{26}$\\,erg and $8.4\\times10^{26}$\\,erg, respectively, and take a\nsignificant proportion of the total energy. The first peak of the RB\nbrightenings coincides with the jet's peak with a time delay of 12 seconds,\nwhile the second peak lags behind by 108 seconds. Besides the flows of the\nejecta, we have identified two additional flows originating from the eruption\nsite. One is relatively cool with a temperature of $log_{10}T/K=5.8-6.1$ and\nhas a speed of about $275\\pm15$\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. The other is hot with a\ntemperature of $log_{10}T/K=7.0-7.3$ and travels much faster with a speed of\nabout 750$\\pm$\\,70\\,km\\,s$^{-1}$. We attribute the second peak of RB directly\nto this hot flow, which our numerical experiments suggest is the result of a\nslow shock wave. Considering the minimal time delay between the first peak of\nRB and the eruption, we infer this first episode is due to heating by\nnonthermal electrons.

For a couple of the calculated\nsensitivities, well-configured finite difference calculations are the most\nefficient, followed closely by DSM. However, since seeking such well-configured\nfinite difference is not always practical, in the rest of the cases, including\nthe all-parameter simultaneous sensitivity calculation, DSM has the highest\nefficiency, demonstrating its robustness.",

    "abstract": "In the standard picture of fully-developed turbulence, highly intermittent\nhydrodynamic fields are nonlinearly coupled across scales, where local energy\ncascades from large scales into dissipative vortices and large density\ngradients. Microscopically, however, constituent fluid molecules are in\nconstant thermal (Brownian) motion, but the role of molecular fluctuations on\nlarge-scale turbulence is largely unknown, and with rare exceptions, it has\nhistorically been considered irrelevant at scales larger than the molecular\nmean free path. Recent theoretical and computational investigations have shown\nthat molecular fluctuations can impact energy cascade at Kolmogorov length\nscales. Here we show that molecular fluctuations not only modify energy\nspectrum at wavelengths larger than the Kolmogorov length in compressible\nturbulence, but they also significantly inhibit spatio-temporal intermittency\nacross the entire dissipation range. Using large-scale direct numerical\nsimulations of computational fluctuating hydrodynamics, we demonstrate that the\nextreme intermittency characteristic of turbulence models is replaced by\nnearly-Gaussian statistics in the dissipation range. These results demonstrate\nthat the compressible Navier-Stokes equations should be augmented with\nmolecular fluctuations to accurately predict turbulence statistics across the\ndissipation range. Our findings have significant consequences for turbulence\nmodeling in applications such as astrophysics, reactive flows, and hypersonic\naerodynamics, where dissipation-range turbulence is approximated by closure\nmodels.",

    "abstract": "The inflated radii of hot Jupiters have been explored by various theoretical\nmechanisms. By connecting planetary thermal evolution models with the observed\nproperties of hot Jupiters using hierarchical Bayesian models, a theoretical\nparameter called the heating efficiency has been introduced to describe the\nheating of the interiors of these planets. Previous studies have shown that the\nmarginal distribution of this heating efficiency parameter has a single-peak\ndistribution along the planetary equilibrium temperature (Teq). Since the\nfoundation of these Bayesian inference models are the observed properties of\nhot Jupiters, there must be a corresponding feature in the observed data that\nleads to the inferred single-peak distribution of the heating efficiency. This\nstudy aims to find the underlying cause of the single-peak heating efficiency\ndistribution without relying on specific theoretical models. By analyzing the\nrelationship between different observed physical properties, we obtained a\nsimilar single-peak distribution of the radius expansion efficiency of hot\nJupiters along Teq, which can be explained by the correlation with the stellar\neffective temperature. However, a detailed investigation suggests that this\nsingle-peak distribution is actually the result of straightforward physical\nprocesses. Specifically, the increase in heating efficiency can be attributed\nto the increase in incident stellar flux, while the decrease in heating\nefficiency can be attributed to the rise in gravitational binding energy\nassociated with the increase in planetary mass.",

To date, most theoretical and\nexperimental explorations have focused on two-dimensional (2D) chaotic\ndielectric microcavities, while there have been minimal studies on\nthree-dimensional (3D) ones since precise geometrical information of a 3D\nmicrocavity can be difficult to obtain. Here, we image 3D microcavities with\nsubmicron resolution using X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro CT), enabling\nnondestructive imaging that preserves the sample for subsequent use. By\nanalyzing the ray dynamics of a typical deformed microsphere, we demonstrate\nthat a sufficient deformation along all three dimensions can lead to chaotic\nray trajectories over extended time scales. Notably, using the X-ray micro CT\nreconstruction results, the phase space chaotic ray dynamics of a deformed\nmicrosphere are accurately established. X-ray micro CT could become a unique\nplatform for the characterization of such deformed 3D microcavities by\nproviding a precise means for determining the degree of deformation necessary\nfor potential applications in ray chaos and quantum chaos.",
