    "abstract": "Given a very special $\\Gamma$-space $X$, repeated application of Segal's\ndelooping functor produces the constituent spaces of the associated connective\n$\\Omega$-spectrum. In particular, by applying this construction to\n\\textit{discrete} very special $\\Gamma$-spaces (a.k.a.~Abelian groups), one\nrecovers Eilenberg-MacLane spectra. The delooping functor is entirely formal,\nhowever, and can be applied to arbitrary $\\Gamma$-spaces without any\nconditions. Work of Connes and Consani suggests that the ``field with one\nelement'' can be fruitfully realized as a (discrete) $\\Gamma$-space (which\nlocalizes to the classical sphere spectrum). This note computes Segal's\ndeloopings of this model of $\\mathbb{F}_1$. They are $n$-fold simplicial sets\nwhose geometric realizations are the $n$-spheres, equipped with \\textit{free\npartial commutative monoid} structures. Equivalently, they are the (nerves of\nthe) free partial strict $n$-categories with free partial symmetric monoidal\nstructures.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes steady periodic hydroelastic waves propagating on the\nwater surface of finite depth beneath nonlinear elastic membranes. Unlike\nprevious work \\cite{BaldiT,BaldiT1,Toland,Toland1}, our formulation\naccommodates rotational flows in finite-depth water. We employ a conformal\nmapping technique to transform the free-boundary problem into a quasilinear\npseudodifferential equation, resulting in a periodic function of a single\nvariable. This reduction allows the existence question for such waves to be\naddressed within the framework of bifurcation theory. With the wavelength\nnormalized to 2$\\pi$, the problem features two free parameters: the wave speed\nand the constant vorticity. Under the assumption of the local convexity of\nundeformed membrane's stored energy, it is observed that the problem, when\nlinearized about uniform horizontal flow, has at most two independent solutions\nfor any values of the parameters. Fixing the vorticity and treating the wave\nspeed as the bifurcation parameter, the linearized problem possesses a single\nsolution. We demonstrate that the full nonlinear problem exhibits a sheet of\nsolutions comprising a family of curves bifurcating from simple eigenvalues.\nTaking both the wave speed and vorticity as parameters, when the constant\nvorticity approaches critical values, the linearized problem exhibits a\ntwo-dimensional kernel. Near these critical points, a secondary bifurcation\ncurve emerges from the primary solution branch. This secondary branch consists\nof ripple solutions on the surface.",

While LLMs for generating code have been widely\nstudied, their role in code modification remains less understood. Although\n\"prompting\" serves as the primary interface for developers to communicate\nintents to LLMs, constructing effective prompts for code modification\nintroduces challenges different from generation. Prior work suggests that\nnatural language summaries may help scaffold this process, yet such approaches\nhave been validated primarily in narrow domains like SQL rewriting. This study\ninvestigates two prompting strategies for LLM-assisted code modification:\nDirect Instruction Prompting, where developers describe changes explicitly in\nfree-form language, and Summary-Mediated Prompting, where changes are made by\nediting the generated summaries of the code. We conducted an exploratory study\nwith 15 developers who completed modification tasks using both techniques\nacross multiple scenarios. Our findings suggest that developers followed an\niterative workflow: understanding the code, localizing the edit, and validating\noutputs through execution or semantic reasoning. Each prompting strategy\npresented trade-offs: direct instruction prompting was more flexible and easier\nto specify, while summary-mediated prompting supported comprehension, prompt\nscaffolding, and control. Developers' choice of strategy was shaped by task\ngoals and context, including urgency, maintainability, learning intent, and\ncode familiarity. These findings highlight the need for more usable prompt\ninteractions, including adjustable summary granularity, reliable summary-code\ntraceability, and consistency in generated summaries.",

Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train\nan outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers\nthat utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,\ninter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents\ncommunicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high\nscalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs\nduring inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,\nwe introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration\nand body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,\nenables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused\nby cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various\nreal-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model\nuncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the\nstate-of-the-art centralized method.

In this paper, we show that this vanishing gradient\nphenomenon is not an artifact of any particular method, but a universal feature\nof all A-stable and L-stable stiff numerical integration schemes. We analyze\nthe rational stability function for general stiff integration schemes and\ndemonstrate that the relevant parameter sensitivities, governed by the\nderivative of the stability function, decay to zero for large stiffness.\nExplicit formulas for common stiff integration schemes are provided, which\nillustrate the mechanism in detail. Finally, we rigorously prove that the\nslowest possible rate of decay for the derivative of the stability function is\n$O(|z|^{-1})$, revealing a fundamental limitation: all A-stable time-stepping\nmethods inevitably suppress parameter gradients in stiff regimes, posing a\nsignificant barrier for training and parameter identification in stiff neural\nODEs.",

Our\nanalyses cover both squeezed and entangled quantum combs with division\nreceivers and heterodyne receivers, leading to four protocols with quantum\nadvantages scalable with squeezing/entanglement strength. In the spectroscopy\nof a single absorption line, whereas the division receiver with the squeezed\ncomb suffers from amplified thermal noise, the other three protocols\ndemonstrate a surprising robustness to loss at a few comb lines. Such a unique\nloss-robustness of a scalable quantum advantage has not been found in any\ntraditional quantum sensing protocols.",

The framework adopts a parametric\nrepresentation of the design geometry and produces new parameter sets\ncorresponding to designs with enhanced performance metrics. A key advantage of\nthe reward-directed approach is its suitability for scenarios in which\nperformance metrics rely on costly engineering simulations or surrogate models\n(e.g. graph-based, ensemble models, or tree-based) are non-differentiable or\nprohibitively expensive to differentiate.

By incorporating\nsoft-value guidance during both the training and inference phases, the proposed\napproach reduces computational and memory costs to achieve high-reward designs,\neven beyond the training data. Empirical results indicate that this iterative\nreward-directed method substantially improves the ability of the diffusion\nmodels to generate samples with reduced resistance in 3D ship hull design and\nenhanced hydrodynamic performance in 2D airfoil design tasks. The proposed\nframework generates samples that extend beyond the training data distribution,\nresulting in a greater 25 percent reduction in resistance for ship design and\nover 10 percent improvement in the lift-to-drag ratio for the 2D airfoil\ndesign.

Our experiments demonstrate that this\nactivation overhead, scaling with sequence length and hidden dimension,\nprevents current SVD compression techniques from achieving any reduction in\npeak inference memory, thereby limiting their viability for real-world,\non-device deployments.\n  We introduce FlashSVD, a novel, end-to-end rank-aware streaming inference\nframework specifically designed for SVD-compressed large language models.\nFlashSVD can be seamlessly integrated with any model that employs SVD-based\nmethods for parameter reduction.

    "abstract": "Indian classical music relies on a sophisticated microtonal system of 22\nshrutis (pitch intervals), which provides expressive nuance beyond the 12-tone\nequal temperament system. Existing symbolic music processing tools fail to\naccount for these microtonal distinctions and culturally specific raga grammars\nthat govern melodic movement. We present ShrutiSense, a comprehensive symbolic\npitch processing system designed for Indian classical music, addressing two\ncritical tasks: (1) correcting westernized or corrupted pitch sequences, and\n(2) completing melodic sequences with missing values. Our approach employs\ncomplementary models for different tasks: a Shruti-aware finite-state\ntransducer (FST) that performs contextual corrections within the 22-shruti\nframework and a grammar-constrained Shruti hidden Markov model (GC-SHMM) that\nincorporates raga-specific transition rules for contextual completions.\nComprehensive evaluation on simulated data across five ragas demonstrates that\nShrutiSense (FST model) achieves 91.3% shruti classification accuracy for\ncorrection tasks, with example sequences showing 86.7-90.0% accuracy at\ncorruption levels of 0.2 to 0.4. The system exhibits robust performance under\npitch noise up to +/-50 cents, maintaining consistent accuracy across ragas\n(90.7-91.8%), thus preserving the cultural authenticity of Indian classical\nmusic expression.",

However,\ndownstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive\npretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it\ndegrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders\ntrained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key\nfactor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment.

Although\nthese conjectures appear unrelated, but surprising connection between these\nconjectures, It establishes a bridge between the quantum and the cosmic. By\nimposing specific constraints on the black hole's parameters, we demonstrate\nthat the WGC and WCCC can be compatible in certain regions. We examine the\nproperties of the KNKL black hole for $q/m > (Q/M )_{ext}$, where $(Q/M\n)_{ext}$ is the charge-to-mass ratio of a large extremal black hole. We present\nfigures to test the validity of both conjectures simultaneously. Without the\nspin parameter \\(a\\), the cloud of string parameter \\(b\\), quintessence\nparameter \\(\\gamma\\), and equation of state parameter \\(\\omega\\), the black\nhole either has two event horizons if \\(Q^2/M^2 \\leq 1\\) or none event horizon\nif \\(Q^2/M^2 > 1\\) which leads to a naked singularity that contradicts the\nWCCC.

The crystallinity of the observed\nphase differs from previously reported a priori predictions of an amorphous\ninterlayer.

However,\nhow confinement geometry influences these responses remains poorly understood.\nHere, we investigate microtubule-kinesin active fluids under external shear\nstresses in two geometries. In slab-like confinement (a narrow-gap cavity),\nexternal stresses propagated throughout the system, leading to stress\ncompetition and a kinematic transition that shifted dynamics from active\nstress-dominated to shear stress-dominated flow. At the transition, we estimate\nthe active stress to be ~1.5 mPa. Simulation supported that this transition\narises from stress competition. In contrast, in ring-like confinement (a\ntoroidal system), external forces acted locally, inducing a mini cavity flow\nthat triggered self-organized reconfiguration rather than direct entrainment.\nThese findings show that the response of active fluids to external forcing\ndepends not only on the magnitude of the applied stress but also on how\nconfinement geometry directs and redistributes that stress, revealing a new\napproach to controlling active fluid behavior by combining static geometrical\ndesign with dynamic external stimuli for real-time modulation of flow patterns.\nSuch control strategies may be applied to microfluidic systems, where external\ninputs such as micromechanical actuators can dynamically tune active fluid\nbehavior within fixed device geometries, enabling transitions between chaotic\nand coherent flows for tasks such as mixing, sorting, or directed transport.",

Programming languages differ from natural language in\nthat they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical\norganization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level\ncorruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which\nmay hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code.

Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we\nselectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST\nsubtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects\ngrammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves\nsyntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen\ncode patterns.

Given a\ntesting goal, FdLoop iteratively selects, evolves and learn the input\ndistribution of goal-specific test inputs via test feedback and a probabilistic\ngrammar. We concretize FdLoop for four testing goals, namely unique code\ncoverage, input-to-code complexity, program failures (exceptions) and long\nexecution time. We evaluate FdLoop using three (3) well-known input formats\n(JSON, CSS and JavaScript) and 20 open-source software. In most (86%) settings,\nFdLoop outperforms all five tested baselines namely the baseline grammar-based\ntest generators (random, probabilistic and inverse-probabilistic methods),\nEvoGFuzz and DynaMosa.

Coupled with these techniques, VWAttacker\nextracts 63 properties from 11 specifications, evaluates 1,116 testcases, and\ndetects 13 issues in 21 UEs. The issues range from enforcing a DH shared secret\nto 0 to supporting weak algorithms. These issues result in attacks that expose\nthe victim UE's identity or establish weak channels, thus severely hampering\nthe security of cellular networks. We responsibly disclose the findings to all\nthe related vendors. At the time of writing, one of the vulnerabilities has\nbeen acknowledged by MediaTek with high severity.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen Purchase Agreements (HPAs) guarantee revenue streams that mitigate\nthe financial risks inherent in the long-term production of green hydrogen from\nrenewable energy sources. However, the intermittency of renewable electricity\nand the availability of parallel revenue opportunities in both the electricity\nand hydrogen markets complicate the scheduling of green hydrogen production.\nThe scheduling should maximise the total revenue from short-term sales of\nelectricity and hydrogen against the long-term HPA delivery obligations. This\nchallenge is addressed by developing a Bounded Fuzzy Logic Control (BFLC) which\ndetermines the daily HPA delivery target based on day-ahead forecasts of\nelectricity and hydrogen prices, as well as wind capacity factors.\nSubsequently, the daily target is imposed as a constraint in dispatch\noptimisation which allocates energy and hydrogen flows for each hour of the\nday. Revenue comparisons over several years demonstrate that the BFLC achieves\ntotal annual revenues within 9% of optimal revenues that are based on perfect\nforesight. The BFLC revenues consistently exceed those of steady control, with\nthe largest differences observed under conditions of elevated price levels and\nvariability. The BFLC provides an effective long-term scheduling of green\nhydrogen production, enabling realistic revenue quantification that mitigates\neconomic risks without overlooking economically viable projects.",

Although existing Audio Deepfake Detection (ADD) methods\nhave demonstrated good performance under clean conditions, their effectiveness\ndrops significantly under degradations such as packet losses and speech codec\ncompression in real-world communication environments. In this work, we propose\nthe first unified framework for robust ADD under such degradations, which is\ndesigned to effectively accommodate multiple types of Time-Frequency (TF)\nrepresentations. The core of our framework is a novel Multi-Granularity\nAdaptive Attention (MGAA) architecture, which employs a set of customizable\nmulti-scale attention heads to capture both global and local receptive fields\nacross varying TF granularities. A novel adaptive fusion mechanism subsequently\nadjusts and fuses these attention branches based on the saliency of TF regions,\nallowing the model to dynamically reallocate its focus according to the\ncharacteristics of the degradation. This enables the effective localization and\namplification of subtle forgery traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines\nacross various real-world communication degradation scenarios, including six\nspeech codecs and five levels of packet losses. In addition, comparative\nanalysis reveals that the MGAA-enhanced features significantly improve\nseparability between real and fake audio classes and sharpen decision\nboundaries.

The training process was\ncontinued until the Wasserstein distance between the input and output\ntomographic patterns levelled off at a low value. The mean photon number,\nvariances and higher moments were extracted directly from the generated\ntomograms, to distinguish between different Fock states and also between the CS\nand the $1$-PACS, without using an additional classifier neural network. The\nrobustness of our results has been verified using two error models and also\nwith different colormaps that define the tomographic patterns.

Rather than preset thresholds, our method lets the data determine\nwhich observations are truly rare. Evaluation on 32 benchmark imbalanced\nregression datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art data augmentation methods.",

We analyzed 18 events that have both\n(i) sufficient satellite information to derive orbits and (ii) ground-based\nobservational counterparts. We quantify the uncertainties on these calibrated\nevents using the orbital similarity criterion $D_D$. We also examine the\nvelocity components imbalance and identify discriminants that can indicate the\naccuracy of an event. We identify two groups in the CNEOS database. CNEOS data\nproduces ephemeris determinations with $D_D$<0.1 for fireballs reported either\n(i) after late 2017 or (ii) with impact energies above 0.45 kt with 74-78% of\nevents having $D_D$=0.03$\\pm$0.02, while ~11% show $D_D$<0.008. Our statistical\ntest confirms these two parameters as the only reliable discriminants that,\nwhen combined, explain the two accuracy groups. Daylight, z-velocity component,\nlow altitude, long duration, and latitude might also indicate errors, although\nthe limited dataset may obscure correlations. No clear discriminants are\nidentified for more restrictive $D_D$ cut-offs. We provide estimates of orbital\nuncertainties for calibrated events. The hyperbolic fireball subset in the\nCNEOS database appears as an outlier in the velocity imbalance test. Our\nresults confirm that the fidelity of CNEOS fireball data improved significantly\nfrom 2018, likely due to the deployment of next-generation space sensors, and\nshow a growing number of high-velocity events. Hyperbolic candidates should be\ninterpreted with caution, as their velocities and inclinations likely reflect\nmeasurement errors. Accuracy constraints remain limited by the dataset size, as\nevidenced by the lack of statistically significant dependence on duration,\npreventing strong conclusions from being drawn.",

Overly complex models can be\nimpractical and hard to interpret, necessitating data-driven methods for\nsimpler and more accurate representations. In this paper, we propose a\ndata-driven approach to simplify a class of continuous-time NL system models\nusing linear approximations around varying operating points. Specifically, for\nsparse additive NL models, our method identifies the number of NL subterms and\ntheir corresponding input spaces. Under small-signal operation, we approximate\nthe unknown NL system as a trajectory-scheduled Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV)\nsystem, with LPV coefficients representing the gradient of the NL function and\nindicating input sensitivity. Using this sensitivity measure, we determine the\nNL system's structure through LPV model reduction by identifying non-zero LPV\ncoefficients and selecting scheduling parameters. We introduce two sparse\nestimators within a vector-valued Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)\nframework to estimate the LPV coefficients while preserving their structural\nrelationships. The structure of the sparse additive NL model is then determined\nby detecting non-zero elements in the gradient vector (LPV coefficients) and\nthe Hessian matrix (Jacobian of the LPV coefficients). We propose two\ncomputationally tractable RKHS-based estimators for this purpose.

    "abstract": "Machine learning and Large language models (LLMs) for vulnerability detection\nhas received significant attention in recent years. Unfortunately,\nstate-of-the-art techniques show that LLMs are unsuccessful in even\ndistinguishing the vulnerable function from its benign counterpart, due to\nthree main problems: Vulnerability detection requires deep analysis, which LLMs\noften struggle with when making a one-shot prediction. Existing techniques\ntypically perform function-level analysis, whereas effective vulnerability\ndetection requires contextual information beyond the function scope. The focus\non binary classification can result in identifying a vulnerability but\nassociating it with the wrong security weaknesses (CWE), which may mislead\ndevelopers. We propose a novel multi-agent LLM approach to address the\nchallenges of identifying CWEs. This approach consists of three steps: (1) a\nteam of LLM agents performs an exhaustive search for potential CWEs in the\nfunction under review, (2) another team of agents identifies relevant external\ncontext to support or refute each candidate CWE, and (3) a final agent makes\ninformed acceptance or rejection decisions for each CWE based on the gathered\ncontext. A preliminary evaluation of our approach shows promising results. In\nthe PrimeVul dataset, Step 1 correctly identifies the appropriate CWE in 40.9\\%\nof the studied vulnerable functions. We further evaluated the full pipeline on\nten synthetic programs and found that incorporating context information\nsignificantly reduced false positives from 6 to 9 CWEs to just 1 to 2, while\nstill correctly identifying the true CWE in 9 out of 10 cases.",

However,\nexisting SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant\nand low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and\nsuboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this\nproblem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and\nreasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility\nreflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence\nalone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but\nlack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly\ncomplex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence\nQuadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence\nquadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient\ninfluence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.\nFurthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected\nsubsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is\nmore aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and\nevidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning\npatterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match\nfull-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the\nbaseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over\nbrute-force scaling.

In Chia, blocks record the amount of\nspace S (via a proof of space) and sequential computational steps V (via a\nVDF).\n  In this paper, we ask what weight functions {\\Gamma}(S,V,W) (that assign a\nweight to a block as a function of the recorded space, speed, and work) are\nsecure in the sense that whenever the weight of the resources controlled by\nhonest parties is larger than the weight of adversarial parties, the blockchain\nis secure against private double-spending attacks.\n  We completely classify such functions in an idealized \"continuous\" model:\n{\\Gamma}(S,V,W) is secure against private double-spending attacks if and only\nif it is homogeneous of degree one in the timed resources V and W, i.e.,\n{\\alpha}{\\Gamma}(S,V,W)={\\Gamma}(S,{\\alpha}V, {\\alpha}W).

To address this, we\nintroduce Meta-Prompted Code Optimization (MPCO), a framework that\nautomatically generates high-quality, task-specific prompts across diverse LLMs\nwhile maintaining industrial efficiency requirements. MPCO leverages\nmeta-prompting to dynamically synthesize context-aware optimization prompts by\nintegrating project metadata, task requirements, and LLM-specific contexts, and\nit seamlessly deploys on the ARTEMIS industrial platform for automated\nvalidation and scaling.\n  Our comprehensive evaluation on five real-world codebases with 366 hours of\nruntime benchmarking demonstrates MPCO's effectiveness: it achieves overall\nperformance improvements up to 19.06% with the best statistical rank across all\nsystems compared to baseline methods. Analysis shows that 96% of the\ntop-performing optimizations stem from meaningful edits. Through systematic\nablation studies and meta-prompter sensitivity analysis, we identify that\ncomprehensive context integration is essential for effective meta-prompting,\nand that all three major LLMs can serve effectively as meta-prompters,\nproviding actionable insights for industrial practitioners.",

To ensure consistent\naugmentation across each demonstration, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on\nrobot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation.

Unlike end-to-end IR, PnP\nallows the same pretrained denoiser to be used across different imaging tasks,\nwithout the need for retraining. However, black-box networks can make the\niterative process in PnP unstable. A common issue observed across architectures\nlike CNNs, diffusion models, and transformers is that the visual quality and\nPSNR often improve initially but then degrade in later iterations. Previous\nattempts to ensure stability usually impose restrictive constraints on the\ndenoiser. However, standard denoisers, which are freely trained for single-step\nnoise removal, need not satisfy such constraints. We propose a simple\ndata-driven stabilization mechanism that adaptively averages the potentially\nunstable PnP operator with a contractive IR operator. This acts as a form of\nviscosity regularization, where the contractive component progressively dampens\nupdates in later iterations, helping to suppress oscillations and prevent\ndivergence. We validate the effectiveness of our stabilization mechanism across\ndifferent proximal algorithms, denoising architectures, and imaging tasks.",

In this study, we propose a novel deep\nlearning framework that uses a class-conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)\nto augment training data for pan-cancer gene expression classification. Using\n801 tumor RNA-Seq samples spanning 5 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas\n(TCGA), we first perform feature selection to reduce 20,531 gene expression\nfeatures to the 500 most variably expressed genes. A cVAE is then trained on\nthis data to learn a latent representation of gene expression conditioned on\ncancer type, enabling the generation of synthetic gene expression samples for\neach tumor class. We augment the training set with these cVAE-generated samples\n(doubling the dataset size) to mitigate overfitting and class imbalance. A\ntwo-layer multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier is subsequently trained on the\naugmented dataset to predict tumor type. The augmented framework achieves high\nclassification accuracy (~98%) on a held-out test set, substantially\noutperforming a classifier trained on the original data alone. We present\ndetailed experimental results, including VAE training curves, classifier\nperformance metrics (ROC curves and confusion matrix), and architecture\ndiagrams to illustrate the approach.

By comparing the velocity maps of mock catalogues of the future Gaia data\nreleases DR4, DR5 and GaiaNIR, we find that the asymmetric signature in the bar\nquadrupole is independent of observational errors.

    "abstract": "Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires\nboth precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a\nreal-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object\ndetection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce\na lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared\nand task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between\ntasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the\nweights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This\navoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation\ntasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and\ntesting labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.\nExperiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves\nstate-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object\ndetection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and\naccuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6\nFPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD\nperformance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers\nstable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at\nhttps://github.com/JiayuanWang-JW/RMT-PPAD.",

Through a year-long\ncollaboration with Ericsson Montr\\'eal, developing TMLL (Trace-Server Machine\nLearning Library, now in the Eclipse Foundation), we investigated barriers to\ntrace analysis adoption. Contrary to assumptions about complexity or automation\nneeds, practitioners struggled with translating expert knowledge into\nactionable insights, integrating analysis into their workflows, and trusting\nautomated results they could not validate. We identified what we called the\nExcellence Paradox: technical excellence can actively impede adoption when\nconflicting with usability, transparency, and practitioner trust. TMLL\naddresses this through adoption-focused design that embeds expert knowledge in\ninterfaces, provides transparent explanations, and enables incremental\nadoption. Validation through Ericsson's experts' feedback, Eclipse Foundation's\nintegration, and a survey of 40 industry and academic professionals revealed\nconsistent patterns: survey results showed that 77.5% prioritize quality and\ntrust in results over technical sophistication, while 67.5% prefer\nsemi-automated analysis with user control, findings supported by qualitative\nfeedback from industrial collaboration and external peer review. Results\nvalidate three core principles: cognitive compatibility, embedded expertise,\nand transparency-based trust.

Each of these problems has its quirks, meaning there needs to be\ndifferent approaches to each, so we matched the models to the shape of the\nproblem. For intrusion detection, catching things like unauthorized access, we\ntested unsupervised anomaly detection methods. Isolation forests and deep\nautoencoders both gave us useful signals by picking up odd patterns in network\ntraffic. When it came to malware detection, we leaned on ensemble models like\nRandom Forest and XGBoost, trained on features pulled from files and traffic\nlogs. Phishing was more straightforward. We fed standard classifiers (logistic\nregression, Random Forest, XGBoost) a mix of email and web-based features.\nThese models handled the task surprisingly well. Phishing turned out to be the\neasiest problem to crack, at least with the data we had. There was a different\nstory. We utilized an LSTM autoencoder to identify behavioral anomalies in user\nactivity logs. It caught every suspicious behavior but flagged a lot of\nharmless ones too. That kind of model makes sense when the cost of missing a\nthreat is high and you are willing to sift through some noise. What we saw\nacross the board is that performance was not about stacking the most complex\nmodel. What mattered was how well the models structure matched the way the data\nbehaved. When signals were strong and obvious, simple models worked fine. But\nfor messier, more subtle threats, we needed something more adaptive, sequence\nmodels and anomaly detectors, though they brought their trade offs.

We developed four machine learning\nmodels, Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM neural networks,\nusing historical data without incorporating the liquidity proxy metrics, and\nevaluated their performance. We then retrained the models, including the\nliquidity proxy metrics, and reassessed their performance.

    "abstract": "The realization of long-distance quantum communication and the envisioned\nquantum internet relies on coherent hybrid light-matter interfaces connecting\nquantum light emitters with quantum memory (QM) systems. Unlike probabilistic\nphoton pair sources such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion,\ndeterministic quantum light emitters enable the on-demand production of pure\nand bright single and entangled photons, essential for scalable quantum\nnetworks. In this work, we present the first experimental realization of a\ncoherent hybrid light-matter interface between a chip-integrated InAsP/InP\nnanowire quantum dot (QD) and a solid-state QM based on Er$^{3+}$ ions doped in\na glass silica fiber (erbium-doped fiber, EDF). The emission spectrum of the\nInAsP/InP nanowire QD aligns with the absorption bandwidth of the EDF at 980 nm\nat cryogenic temperatures, allowing efficient interaction between the two\nsystems. To demonstrate this, we present a spectroscopic characterization of\nthe $^{4}I_{15/2} \\leftrightarrow ^{4}I_{11/2}$ optical transition in EDF at\n980 nm. Our measurements reveal substantial inhomogeneous broadening of this\noptical transition and a long spin population lifetime, underscoring EDFs\npotential for broadband QM implementation. We implement an 8 GHz bandwidth\nmultimode QM based on the Atomic Frequency Comb protocol, enabling the storage\nand retrieval of 59 weak coherent pulses. Furthermore, we characterize\nsingle-photon emission from an InAsP/InP nanowire QD at 980 nm and demonstrate\nits deterministic storage and recall in the EDF QM. Notably, this is achieved\nwithout spectral tuning of the QD emission, demonstrating its direct\ncompatibility with a solid-state QM.",

    "abstract": "Random effects are the gold standard for capturing structural heterogeneity\nin data, such as spatial dependencies, individual differences, or temporal\ndependencies. However, testing for their presence is challenging, as it\ninvolves a variance component constrained to be non-negative -- a boundary\nproblem. This paper proposes a flexible empirical Bayes factor (EBF) for\ntesting random effects. Rather than testing whether a variance component is\nzero, the EBF tests the equivalent hypothesis that all random effects are zero.\nCrucially, it avoids manual prior specification based on external knowledge, as\nthe distribution of random effects is part of the model's lower level and\nestimated from the data -- yielding an \"empirical\" Bayes factor. The EBF uses a\nSavage-Dickey density ratio, allowing all random effects to be tested using\nonly the full model fit. This eliminates the need to fit multiple models with\ndifferent combinations of random effects. Simulations on synthetic data\nevaluate the criterion's general behavior. To demonstrate its flexibility, the\nEBF is applied to generalized linear crossed mixed models, spatial random\neffects models, dynamic structural equation models, random intercept\ncross-lagged panel models, and nonlinear mixed effects models.",

ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we\novercome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by\nincorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to\nforgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the\ngeneralization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide\nexplanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we\nintroduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences\nin AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based\nagent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that\nfurther enhances our model's performance.

In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed\nin the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these\nsuppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address\nthis limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as\nobject contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In\nthis paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection\nEnhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency\nrepresentations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the\n``spatialization\" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm\nof directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method\ninversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial\nmaps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion\nattention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between\nthese maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs\nadaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma\nparameters for the two domains.",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision\ntasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing\nattribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that\nall attribute classes are consistently available during both training and\ninference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world\nscenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in\nbenchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them\nless discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval\n(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,\nregardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support\nthis task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body\npart representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.\nFurthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute\nrecognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the\nnecessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework.

Applying these\nmethods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static\nvehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed\ninstallations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,\nocclusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on\nspecialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these\nconditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable\ndirect recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.\nThis study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models\nrecognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and\nnon-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline\nfilters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several\nprompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a\nrevised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection\nmodule, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class\ndataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected\non the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of\n91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public\nUFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The\nself-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make\nand model recognition.

    "abstract": "Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the\nissue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational\nefficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention\nmechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear\nattention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight\ndesign, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence\nmodeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention\ncomputations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the\nnumber of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the\nprocess of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and\ncomputational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this\npaper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature\nmap sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of\nkey sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention\ncomputation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to\nsimulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.\nFinally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines\nit with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.\nThrough visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO\n2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is\ndemonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both\ninference speed and model accuracy.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage\nRefined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives\nwithin a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main\ninnovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature\nre-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during\nboth the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the\nTraining mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating\npedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby\nconstructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.\nDuring the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the\nClassifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into\nthe proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through\npedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm\nvertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region\nproposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,\nfiltering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a\nresult, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress\npedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on\nmultiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,\nsupported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively\neliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments\nconducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in\nenhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small\npedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.",

To improve recommendation performance for\ncold-start and long-tail items, recent studies focus on leveraging item\nmultimodal features to model users' interests. However, obtaining multimodal\nrepresentations for items relies on complex pre-trained encoders, which incurs\nunacceptable computation cost to train jointly with downstream ranking models.\nTherefore, it is important to maintain alignment between semantic and behavior\nspace in a lightweight way.\n  To address these challenges, we propose a Semantic-Behavior Alignment for\nCold-start Recommendation framework, which mainly focuses on utilizing\nmultimodal representations that align with the user behavior space to predict\nCTR.

We show that there exist lightweight network\ntopologies that are immune to message delivery failures incurred by (at most) a\nconstant fraction of all nodes. More precisely, we design a novel deterministic\nfault-tolerant local load balancing (LLB) algorithm, which, similarly to their\nclassical counterparts working in fault-free networks, has a relatively simple\nstructure and guarantees exponentially fast convergence to the average value\ndespite crash and omission failures.\n  As the second part of our contribution, we show three applications of the\nnewly developed fault-tolerant local load balancing protocol. We give a\nrandomized consensus algorithm, working against $t < n / 3$ crash failures,\nthat improves over the best-known consensus solution by Hajiaghayi et al. with\nrespect to communication complexity, yet with an arguable simpler technique of\ncombining a randomly and locally selected virtual communication graph with a\ndeterministic fault-tolerant local load balancing on this graph.\n  We also give a new solution for consensus for networks with omission\nfailures. Our solution works against $t < \\frac{n}{C\\log{n} (\\log\\log n)^2}$\nomissions, for some constant $C$, is nearly optimal in terms of time\ncomplexity, but most notably -- it has communication complexity $O((t^2 +\nn)\\text{ polylog } {n})$, matching, within a polylogarithmic factor, the lower\nbound by Abraham et. al. with respect to both terms depending on $t$ and $n$.\nOurs is the first algorithm in the literature that is simultaneously nearly\noptimal, in terms of $n,t$, with respect to both complexity measures, against\nthe adaptive omission-causing adversary.",

Hence, we introduce a road-node-centric framework that\nrepresents road-user trajectories on the city's road-intersection graph,\nthereby relaxing the closed-world constraint and supporting next-step\nforecasting beyond fixed POI sets.

Evaluated on city-scale road-user\ntrajectories, our model outperforms six state-of-the-art baselines by up to 17\npercentage points in accuracy at one hop and 10 percentage points in MRR, and\nmaintains high resilience under noise, losing only 2.4 percentage points in\naccuracy at one under 50 meter GPS perturbation and 8.9 percentage points in\naccuracy at one hop under 25 percent POI noise.",

We study how, in the limit when the number of\nparticles diverges and under quite general assumptions, the center of mass of\nthe system is not anymore described by quantum mechanics but by classical\nmechanics: the center of mass of the system becomes with a well-defined\nposition and momentum, the state of the center of mass is fully determined by\nits position and by its momentum, and its dynamics is given by the classical\nlaw of dynamics. In order to get this result, three assumptions on the\nmany-body system are necessary: the total mass of the system must be much\nlarger than the mass of each particle composing the system; at most a finite\nnumber of particles has non-zero correlation in position with an infinite\nnumber of particles; finally, when the number of particles composing the system\ndiverge, the variance in position of each particle converges to a finite value.\nThese assumptions are commonly realized for a macroscopic solid and liquid\nsystems.

    "abstract": "We present VLH, a novel Visual-Language-Haptic Foundation Model that unifies\nperception, language, and tactile feedback in aerial robotics and virtual\nreality. Unlike prior work that treats haptics as a secondary, reactive\nchannel, VLH synthesizes mid-air force and vibration cues as a direct\nconsequence of contextual visual understanding and natural language commands.\nOur platform comprises an 8-inch quadcopter equipped with dual inverse five-bar\nlinkage arrays for localized haptic actuation, an egocentric VR camera, and an\nexocentric top-down view. Visual inputs and language instructions are processed\nby a fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone - adapted via LoRA on a bespoke dataset of 450\nmultimodal scenarios - to output a 7-dimensional action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx,\nHy, Hz, Hv). INT8 quantization and a high-performance server ensure real-time\noperation at 4-5 Hz. In human-robot interaction experiments (90 flights), VLH\nachieved a 56.7% success rate for target acquisition (mean reach time 21.3 s,\npose error 0.24 m) and 100% accuracy in texture discrimination. Generalization\ntests yielded 70.0% (visual), 54.4% (motion), 40.0% (physical), and 35.0%\n(semantic) performance on novel tasks. These results demonstrate VLH's ability\nto co-evolve haptic feedback with perceptual reasoning and intent, advancing\nexpressive, immersive human-robot interactions.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted as research\nassistants, particularly for literature review and reference recommendation,\nyet little is known about whether they introduce demographic bias into citation\nworkflows. This study systematically investigates gender bias in LLM-driven\nreference selection using controlled experiments with pseudonymous author\nnames. We evaluate several LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude Sonnet, and Claude\nHaiku) by varying gender composition within candidate reference pools and\nanalyzing selection patterns across fields. Our results reveal two forms of\nbias: a persistent preference for male-authored references and a majority-group\nbias that favors whichever gender is more prevalent in the candidate pool.\nThese biases are amplified in larger candidate pools and only modestly\nattenuated by prompt-based mitigation strategies. Field-level analysis\nindicates that bias magnitude varies across scientific domains, with social\nsciences showing the least bias. Our findings indicate that LLMs can reinforce\nor exacerbate existing gender imbalances in scholarly recognition. Effective\nmitigation strategies are needed to avoid perpetuating existing gender\ndisparities in scientific citation practices before integrating LLMs into\nhigh-stakes academic workflows.",

    "abstract": "The success of large-scale pre-training paradigm, exemplified by Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), has inspired the development of Time Series Foundation\nModels (TSFMs). However, their application to financial candlestick (K-line)\ndata remains limited, often underperforming non-pre-trained architectures.\nMoreover, existing TSFMs often overlook crucial downstream tasks such as\nvolatility prediction and synthetic data generation. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Kronos, a unified, scalable pre-training framework\ntailored to financial K-line modeling. Kronos introduces a specialized\ntokenizer that discretizes continuous market information into token sequences,\npreserving both price dynamics and trade activity patterns. We pre-train Kronos\nusing an autoregressive objective on a massive, multi-market corpus of over 12\nbillion K-line records from 45 global exchanges, enabling it to learn nuanced\ntemporal and cross-asset representations. Kronos excels in a zero-shot setting\nacross a diverse set of financial tasks. On benchmark datasets, Kronos boosts\nprice series forecasting RankIC by 93% over the leading TSFM and 87% over the\nbest non-pre-trained baseline. It also achieves a 9% lower MAE in volatility\nforecasting and a 22% improvement in generative fidelity for synthetic K-line\nsequences. These results establish Kronos as a robust, versatile foundation\nmodel for end-to-end financial time series analysis. Our pre-trained model is\npublicly available at https://github.com/shiyu-coder/Kronos.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, open source software has been continuously\nintegrated into software supply chains worldwide, drastically increasing\nreliance and dependence. Because of the role this software plays, it is\nimportant to understand ways to measure and promote its stability and potential\nfor sustainability. Recent work proposed the use of control theory to\nunderstand repository stability and evaluate repositories' ability to return to\nequilibrium after a disturbance such as the introduction of a new feature\nrequest, a spike in bug reports, or even the influx or departure of\ncontributors. This approach leverages commit frequency patterns, issue\nresolution rate, pull request merge rate, and community activity engagement to\nprovide a Composite Stability Index (CSI). While this framework has theoretical\nfoundations, there is no empirical validation of the CSI in practice. In this\npaper, we present the first empirical validation of the proposed CSI by\nexperimenting with 100 highly ranked GitHub repositories. Our results suggest\nthat (1) sampling weekly commit frequency pattern instead of daily is a more\nfeasible measure of commit frequency stability across repositories and (2)\nimproved statistical inferences (swapping mean with median), particularly with\nascertaining resolution and review times in issues and pull request, improves\nthe overall issue and pull request stability index. Drawing on our empirical\ndataset, we also derive data-driven half-width parameters that better align\nstability scores with real project behavior. These findings both confirm the\nviability of a control-theoretic lens on open-source health and provide\nconcrete, evidence-backed applications for real-world project monitoring tools.",

    "abstract": "Code clone detection is a critical task in software engineering, aimed at\nidentifying duplicated or similar code fragments within or across software\nsystems. Traditional methods often fail to capture functional equivalence,\nparticularly for semantic clones (Type 4), where code fragments implement\nidentical functionality despite differing syntactic structures. Recent advances\nin large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding code\nsemantics. However, directly applying LLMs to code clone detection yields\nsuboptimal results due to their sensitivity to syntactic differences. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage framework that combines\nLLM-based screening with execution-based validation for detecting semantic\nclones in Python programs. In the first stage, an LLM evaluates code pairs to\nfilter out obvious non-clones based on semantic analysis. For pairs not\nidentified as clones, the second stage employs an execution-based validation\napproach, utilizing LLM-generated test inputs to assess functional equivalence\nthrough cross-execution validation. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates\nsignificant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score compared to direct\nLLM-based detection, highlighting the framework's effectiveness in identifying\nsemantic clones. Future work includes exploring cross-language clone detection\nand optimizing the framework for large-scale applications.",

Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can\nhelp in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a\nroutinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping,\nespecially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher\nincidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent\nprogress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and\nclassification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built\non vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and\nattention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR\nmutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data\nfrom an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets:\nInternal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from\nTCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets,\nwith AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and\nexternal test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently\ntrained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to\nseveral prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study\ndemonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status\nusing routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using\nfoundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.",

    "abstract": "Security issues are becoming increasingly significant with the rapid\nevolution of Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs). As NFTs are traded as digital assets,\nthey have emerged as prime targets for cyber attackers. In the development of\nNFT smart contracts, there may exist undiscovered defects that could lead to\nsubstantial financial losses if exploited. To tackle this issue, this paper\npresents a framework called NATLM(NFT Assistant LLM), designed to detect\npotential defects in NFT smart contracts. The framework effectively identifies\nfour common types of vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts: ERC-721\nReentrancy, Public Burn, Risky Mutable Proxy, and Unlimited Minting. Relying\nexclusively on large language models (LLMs) for defect detection can lead to a\nhigh false-positive rate. To enhance detection performance, NATLM integrates\nstatic analysis with LLMs, specifically Gemini Pro 1.5. Initially, NATLM\nemploys static analysis to extract structural, syntactic, and execution flow\ninformation from the code, represented through Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) and\nControl Flow Graphs (CFG). These extracted features are then combined with\nvectors of known defect examples to create a matrix for input into the\nknowledge base. Subsequently, the feature vectors and code vectors of the\nanalyzed contract are compared with the contents of the knowledge base.\nFinally, the LLM performs deep semantic analysis to enhance detection\ncapabilities, providing a more comprehensive and accurate identification of\npotential security issues. Experimental results indicate that NATLM analyzed\n8,672 collected NFT smart contracts, achieving an overall precision of 87.72%,\na recall of 89.58%, and an F1 score of 88.94%. The results outperform other\nbaseline experiments, successfully identifying four common types of defects.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndecentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing\nsize of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation\nchallenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into\nFL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by\nupdating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its\neffectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains\na critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified\nconvergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current\naggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS).\nThen we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive\nboth weak and strong convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore,\nwe present both weak and strong convergence condition that guarantee\nconvergence of the local model and the global model respectively. These\ntheoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various aggregation\nstrategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation methods satisfy\nthe weak and strong convergence condition respectively, but differ in their\nability to achieve the optimal convergence rate.

However, many smart\ncontracts have been found to contain vulnerabilities and errors, leading to the\nloss of assets within the blockchain. Despite a range of tools that have been\ndeveloped to identify vulnerabilities in smart contracts at the source code or\nbytecode level, most rely on a single modality, reducing performance, accuracy,\nand limited generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a multimodal deep\nlearning approach, MultiCFV, which is designed specifically to analyze and\ndetect erroneous control flow vulnerability, as well as identify code clones in\nsmart contracts. Bytecode is generated from source code to construct control\nflow graphs, with graph embedding techniques extracting graph features.\nAbstract syntax trees are used to obtain syntax features, while code comments\ncapture key commentary words and comment features. These three feature vectors\nare fused to create a database for code inspection, which is used to detect\nsimilar code and identify contract vulnerabilities. Experimental results\ndemonstrate our method effectively combines structural, syntactic, and semantic\ninformation, improving the accuracy of smart contract vulnerability detection\nand clone detection.",

The average H2 ionisation rate in\nthe CMZ is estimated to be 2e-14 s-1, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher\nthan anywhere else in the Galaxy. Due to the high gas density in this region,\nelectromagnetic radiation is rapidly absorbed, leaving low-energy cosmic rays\n(CRs) as the only effective ionising agents. Hence, a high CR density has been\ninvoked to explain such high ionisation rates. However, a corresponding excess\nin gamma rays, which would result from interactions of high-energy CRs, has not\nbeen observed. This suggests that the supposed excess exists only in the\nlow-energy CR spectrum. To constrain this unknown low-energy component, we\nfirst derive the high-energy CR injection spectra using gamma-ray and radio\ndata, to which we add various low-energy components. We then propagate these\ninjection spectra by numerically solving the CR transport equation using a\nCrank-Nicolson scheme. Testing multiple CR injection scenarios, we find that\nthe energy required to sustain the observed ionisation rates is excessively\nhigh in every case.

    "abstract": "Machine learning models trained on Earth observation data, such as satellite\nimagery, have demonstrated significant promise in predicting household-level\nwealth indices, enabling the creation of high-resolution wealth maps that can\nbe leveraged across multiple causal trials. However, because standard training\nobjectives prioritize overall predictive accuracy, these predictions inherently\nsuffer from shrinkage toward the mean, leading to attenuated estimates of\ncausal treatment effects and limiting their utility in policy. Existing\ndebiasing methods, such as Prediction-Powered Inference, can handle this\nattenuation bias but require additional fresh ground-truth data at the\ndownstream stage of causal inference, which restricts their applicability in\ndata-scarce environments. Here, we introduce and evaluate two correction\nmethods -- linear calibration correction and Tweedie's correction -- that\nsubstantially reduce prediction bias without relying on newly collected labeled\ndata. Linear calibration corrects bias through a straightforward linear\ntransformation derived from held-out calibration data, whereas Tweedie's\ncorrection leverages empirical Bayes principles to directly address\nshrinkage-induced biases by exploiting score functions derived from the model's\nlearning patterns. Through analytical exercises and experiments using\nDemographic and Health Survey data, we demonstrate that the proposed methods\nmeet or outperform existing approaches that either require (a) adjustments to\ntraining pipelines or (b) additional labeled data.

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is\ntransforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex\nworkflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven\nmulti-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure\ncommunication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or\nadversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of\nthese emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies\ncannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the\nfirst unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable\nand agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts\ndecentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent\nauthentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability,\nand smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control\npolicies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message\nauthenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across\nagent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine\n(DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including\nByzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission\nrevocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in\nneutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS\nattacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a\npractical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that\nBlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment\nin production LLM-based MAS environments.",

In order to reveal the dynamical features of these anomalous edge\nstates, we elaborately adjust the optical parameters and ultimately achieve a\nsuccessful mapping of the model onto a photonic waveguide array. Subsequently,\nthrough numerical simulation of the wave equation, we observe the unique\nbehavior of three-period evolution. Our work may serve as a reference for\nrealizing period-multiplied dynamics, and the anomalous edge states discussed\nhere might also find applications in quantum computation.",

    "abstract": "Open-Vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition (OV-MER) aims to predict\nemotions without being constrained by predefined label spaces, enabling\nfine-grained and human-like emotion understanding. Unlike traditional\ndiscriminative methods, OV-MER leverages generative models, such as large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with extensive vocabularies, to capture the full\nspectrum of emotions. Previous approaches (like AffectGPT) primarily rely on\ntoken-level loss for training. However, this objective does not align with the\nemotion wheel (EW)-based evaluation metrics used in OV-MER. Unfortunately,\nEW-based metrics cannot be directly optimized via gradient backpropagation. In\nthis paper, we propose AffectGPT-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that\ndirectly optimizes performance on EW-based metrics. Specifically, we treat\nthese metrics as the reward function and employ Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) to maximize rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that\nAffectGPT-R1 achieves significant improvements on OV-MER. We hope this work\nadvances the field of multimodal emotion recognition.

    "abstract": "Symbiotic stars, which generally comprise a red giant and an accreting white\ndwarf, are excellent laboratories to understand mass transfer in wide binaries,\nwith application to a wide family of systems. One of the fundamental questions\nis how mass is transferred from the red giant to the white dwarf. We use\ninterferometric measurements made with the VLTI/PIONIER instrument, combined\nwith Gaia data, to measure the radius of the giant in seven symbiotic systems.\nWe further place the giants in the H-R diagramme, which allows us to estimate\ntheir mass and to show that they are all very evolved and likely on the\nasymptotic giant branch. We compare our measured giant radii to their\nRoche-lobe radius and show that, except for ZZ CMi, all giants are well within\ntheir Roche lobe and that mass transfer likely takes place via stellar wind.\nOur interferometric data provide further evidence that the giant in ZZ CMi\n(nearly) fills its Roche lobe. Our conclusions are still hampered by the poor\ncharacterisation of some of the giants or their binary orbit, and we encourage\nthe community to make an effort to provide these.",

Most existing\nmethods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches.\nIn this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation\nand Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge\nediting. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited\nknowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit\naugmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a\nself-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a\nfilter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of\ninference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the\noriginal pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their\nrelated edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In\nexperiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of\n36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its\nstrong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean\nscores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both\nparameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly.

    "abstract": "The reasoning and planning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have\nbeen a frequent topic of discussion in recent years. Their ability to take\nunstructured planning problems as input has made LLMs' integration into AI\nplanning an area of interest. Nevertheless, LLMs are still not reliable as\nplanners, with the generated plans often containing mistaken or hallucinated\nactions. Existing benchmarking and evaluation methods investigate planning with\nLLMs, focusing primarily on success rate as a quality indicator in various\nplanning tasks, such as validating plans or planning in relaxed conditions. In\nthis paper, we approach planning with LLMs as a natural language processing\n(NLP) task, given that LLMs are NLP models themselves. We propose a recovery\npipeline consisting of an NLP-based evaluation of the generated plans, along\nwith three stages to recover the plans through NLP manipulation of the\nLLM-generated plans, and eventually complete the plan using a symbolic planner.\nThis pipeline provides a holistic analysis of LLM capabilities in the context\nof AI task planning, enabling a broader understanding of the quality of invalid\nplans. Our findings reveal no clear evidence of underlying reasoning during\nplan generation, and that a pipeline comprising an NLP-based analysis of the\nplans, followed by a recovery mechanism, still falls short of the quality and\nreliability of classical planners. On average, only the first 2.65 actions of\nthe plan are executable, with the average length of symbolically generated\nplans being 8.4 actions. The pipeline still improves action quality and\nincreases the overall success rate from 21.9% to 27.5%.",

    "abstract": "Online intelligent education platforms have generated a vast amount of\ndistributed student learning data. This influx of data presents opportunities\nfor cognitive diagnosis (CD) to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts\nwhile also raising significant data privacy and security challenges. To cope\nwith this issue, federated learning (FL) becomes a promising solution by\njointly training models across multiple local clients without sharing their\noriginal data. However, the data quality problem, caused by the ability\ndifferences and educational context differences between different\ngroups/schools of students, further poses a challenge to the fairness of\nmodels. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fairness-aware\nfederated cognitive diagnosis framework (FedCD) to jointly train CD models\nbuilt upon a novel parameter decoupling-based personalization strategy,\npreserving privacy of data and achieving precise and fair diagnosis of students\non each client. As an FL paradigm, FedCD trains a local CD model for the\nstudents in each client based on its local student learning data, and each\nclient uploads its partial model parameters to the central server for parameter\naggregation according to the devised innovative personalization strategy. The\nmain idea of this strategy is to decouple model parameters into two parts: the\nfirst is used as locally personalized parameters, containing diagnostic\nfunction-related model parameters, to diagnose each client's students fairly;\nthe second is the globally shared parameters across clients and the server,\ncontaining exercise embedding parameters, which are updated via fairness-aware\naggregation, to alleviate inter-school unfairness. Experiments on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FedCD\nframework and the personalization strategy compared to five FL approaches under\nthree CD models.",

In this\nwork, we present a comprehensive optical investigation of crystalline r-GeO$_2$\nthin films grown on r-TiO$_2$ (001) substrates via metal-organic chemical vapor\ndeposition (MOCVD). Cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopy reveals broad visible\nemissions with distinct peaks near 470~nm and 520~nm. CL mapping indicates\nenhanced emission intensity in regions with larger crystalline domains,\nhighlighting the correlation between domain size and optical quality. X-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the presence of Ge$^{4+}$ oxidation\nstate and provides a bandgap estimation of $\\sim$4.75~eV based on valence band\nand secondary electron cutoff analysis. UV--Vis transmittance measurements show\na sharp absorption edge near 250--260~nm, corresponding to an optical bandgap\nin the range of 4.81--5.0~eV. These findings offer valuable insights into the\ndefect-related emission behavior and band-edge characteristics of r-GeO$_2$,\nreinforcing its potential for future applications in power electronics and\ndeep-ultraviolet optoelectronic devices.",

    "abstract": "Ensuring sufficient exploration is a central challenge when training\nmeta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) agents to solve novel environments.\nConventional solutions to the exploration-exploitation dilemma inject explicit\nincentives such as randomization, uncertainty bonuses, or intrinsic rewards to\nencourage exploration. In this work, we hypothesize that an agent trained\nsolely to maximize a greedy (exploitation-only) objective can nonetheless\nexhibit emergent exploratory behavior, provided three conditions are met: (1)\nRecurring Environmental Structure, where the environment features repeatable\nregularities that allow past experience to inform future choices; (2) Agent\nMemory, enabling the agent to retain and utilize historical interaction data;\nand (3) Long-Horizon Credit Assignment, where learning propagates returns over\na time frame sufficient for the delayed benefits of exploration to inform\ncurrent decisions. Through experiments in stochastic multi-armed bandits and\ntemporally extended gridworlds, we observe that, when both structure and memory\nare present, a policy trained on a strictly greedy objective exhibits\ninformation-seeking exploratory behavior. We further demonstrate, through\ncontrolled ablations, that emergent exploration vanishes if either\nenvironmental structure or agent memory is absent (Conditions 1 & 2).\nSurprisingly, removing long-horizon credit assignment (Condition 3) does not\nalways prevent emergent exploration-a result we attribute to the\npseudo-Thompson Sampling effect. These findings suggest that, under the right\nprerequisites, exploration and exploitation need not be treated as orthogonal\nobjectives but can emerge from a unified reward-maximization process.",

To solve this problem, we\ninvestigate the input-output relation of ODDM systems considering the wideband\neffect, which is also known as the Doppler squint effect (DSE) in the\nliterature. The extra delay-Doppler (DD) dispersion caused by the DSE is first\nexplicitly explained by employing the time-variant frequency response of\nmultipath channels. Its characterization is then derived for both reduced\ncyclic prefix (RCP) and zero padded (ZP)-based wideband ODDM systems, where the\nextra DD spread and more complicated power leakage outside the peak region are\npresented theoretically.

Our analysis identified H2O and FeH as the primary absorbers\nin the observed J- and H-band spectra. Additionally, the observed features were\nreproduced with a model that includes cloud opacity, assuming an optically\nthick cloud at the pressure $P_\\mathrm{top}$. The resulting temperature at the\ncloud top pressure suggests the potential formation of clouds composed of TiO2,\nAl2O3, or Fe.

To solve these\nproblems, we propose a Graph Convolutional Network Framework based on Feature\nNetwork, abbreviated as FNGCN (graph convolutional network is abbreviated as\nGCN in the following text). Further, to exclude noises and reduce redundency,\nFNGCN utilizes feature network to represent the complicated relationships among\nthe local centralities, based on which the most suitable local centralities are\ndetermined.

This paper presents a novel Semantic-Aware Proactive\nLLM Orchestration (SP-LLM) framework to address these issues. Our method\ntransforms the traditional Digital Twin (DT) into a Predictive Digital Twin\n(pDT) that predicts important network parameters such as task arrivals, vehicle\nmobility, and channel quality. A Large Language Model (LLM) that serves as a\ncognitive orchestrator is at the heart of our framework.

The LLM's ability to decipher high-level\nsemantic commands given in natural language is crucial because it enables it to\ndynamically modify its optimization policy to match evolving strategic\nobjectives, like giving emergency services priority or optimizing energy\nefficiency. We show through extensive simulations that SP-LLM performs\nsignificantly better in terms of scalability, robustness in volatile\nconditions, and adaptability than state-of-the-art reactive and MARL-based\napproaches.

Typical unsupervised methods\nrely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which\nsuffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive\npatterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D\ngeometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.\nHowever, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information\nfrom randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization\nof 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity\nestimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to\naddress these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence\nestimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,\nthe local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their\ncorresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.\nAfterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident\ndisparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a\ndual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance\nat disparity discontinuities.

To\naddress this challenge, we propose the Knowledge Conflict Reasoning (KCR)\nframework, which enhances the ability of LLMs to resolve conflicting knowledge.\nThe key idea of KCR is to train backbone LLMs to establish a correct reasoning\nprocess by rewarding them for selecting and adhering to the context with\nstronger logical consistency when presented with conflicting contexts.\nSpecifically, we first extract reasoning paths, represented by either text or\nlocal knowledge graphs, from the conflicting long contexts.

However, directly extending them to the video\ndomain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects\ntemporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group\nCaptioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it\ndevelops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame\ninformation while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.\nFurthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine\nsimilarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by\na single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level\nsupervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the\nKey Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision\n(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups\nthat models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence\ncausal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video\ncaptioning.

For this kind of sensor, the coherence effect induced by\ncoupling atoms with microwave plays a key role, and the decoherence may reduce\nthe sensitivity. A multi-level Rydberg atomic scheme with optimized quantum\ncoherence, which enhances both the bandwidth and the sensitivity for 4 GHz\nmicrowave sensing, is demonstrated experimentally in this work. The enhanced\nquantum coherence of Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and\nmicrowave induced Autler-Townes (AT) splitting in EIT windows are shown using\noptical pumping at D1 line. The enhanced sensitivity at 3.4 GHz with 0.3 GHz\nbandwidth can be realized, based on the enhanced EIT-AT spectrum. The\nexperimental results show that in the stepped Rydberg EIT system, the spectral\nwidth of EIT and microwave field EIT-AT can be narrowed by optical pumping\n(OP), so the sensitivity of microwave electric field measurement can be\nimproved. After optimizing the EIT amplitude and adding single-frequency\nmicrowaves, the sensitivity of the microwave electric field measurement\nobserved by the AT splitting interval is improved by 1.3 times.

In this\npaper, we present TestWeaver, a novel LLM-based approach that integrates\nlightweight program analysis to guide test generation more effectively.\nTestWeaver introduces three key innovations: (1) it reduces hallucinations and\nimproves focus by supplying the LLM with the backward slice from the target\nline instead of full program context; (2) it identifies and incorporates close\ntest cases - those that share control-flow similarities with the path to the\ntarget line - to provide execution context within the LLM's context window; and\n(3) it enhances LLM's reasoning with execution in-line annotations that encode\nvariable states as comments along executed paths. By equipping LLMs with these\ntargeted and contextualized inputs, TestWeaver improves coverage-guided test\ngeneration and mitigates redundant explorations.

However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces\ncritical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection\nattacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime\ntraces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present\nAgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph\nintermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations\n(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.\nAgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that\nreconstructs the agent's runtime traces as graph-based intermediate\nrepresentations with control and data flow described within; (2) a property\nregistry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools \\& data,\nand (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the\nintermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured\nprograms, AgentArmor enables program analysis for sensitive data flow, trust\nboundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo\nbenchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can reduce the ASR to 3\\%, with the\nutility drop only 1\\%.",

While existing\ndetectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to\ngeneralize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content\nbetween real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the\nuse of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical\nlimitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual\nfeatures hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,\na novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple\nsemantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive\nlearning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and\ngenerated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve\nfine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image\nstructures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images\ngenerated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\\% improvement in detection accuracy,\nthereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and\ndiffusion-based image generation techniques.",

Inspired by this, we adopt the well-known\nconductance metric to measure the quality of a community and introduce a novel\nproblem of conductance-based community search (CCS). CCS aims at finding a\nsubgraph with the smallest conductance among all connected subgraphs that\ncontain the query vertex. We prove that the CCS problem is NP-hard. To\nefficiently query CCS, a four-stage subgraph-conductance-based community search\nalgorithm, SCCS, is proposed.

Namely, we\nfirst utilize a seeding strategy to obtain an initial community to enhance its\ninternal cohesiveness. Then, we iteratively add qualified vertices in the\nexpansion stage to guarantee the internal cohesiveness and external sparsity of\nthe community.

However, effective navigation and situational awareness depend on\nusers' prior knowledge of the environment, limiting the usefulness of these\nsystems for exploring unfamiliar places. We explore how integrating\nlocation-aware LLM-based narrative capabilities into a mobile robot can support\nremote exploration. We developed a prototype system, called NarraGuide, that\nprovides narrative guidance for users to explore and learn about a remote place\nthrough a dialogue-based interface. We deployed our prototype in a geology\nmuseum, where remote participants (n=20) used the robot to tour the museum. Our\nfindings reveal how users perceived the robot's role, engaged in dialogue in\nthe tour, and expressed preferences for bystander encountering.

    "abstract": "Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high\ncomputational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational\ncost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which\nconsists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods\nhave made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe\nperformance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual\ninformation. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method\n(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image\ncaption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption\nmodel and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related\ndescriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector\nfurther identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.\nLeveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently\nwithout any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments\nacross seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly\noutperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%\nwith 6.5% fewer FLOPs).",

These high-energy radiations\ncause severe biological effects on astronauts and degrade spacecraft systems,\nmaking effective shielding critical. Traditionally, passive shielding materials\nlike aluminum have been used, but their limitations, particularly in generating\nsecondary radiation, necessitate better alternatives. In this study, the\nperformance of shielding materials such as lithium hydride, polyethylene,\nlithium borohydride, beryllium borohydride, and ammonia borane are evaluated in\nGCR and SPE environments using OLTARIS, a NASA developed tool. The October 1989\nSPE is used to study particle flux and dose distributions. Shielding\neffectiveness varies by environment. Beryllium borohydride performs best in\nSPE, while lithium hydride gives the lowest dose in GCR. In SPE, performance is\nlinked to hydrogen content. Effect of Solar modulation on GCR dose is also\nstudied. Higher modulation lowers GCR intensity and dose. The complex nature of\nhigh energy space radiation and material combinations creates computational\nchallenges. To address this, the material selection problem is modeled as a\nQuadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization and solved using the Variational\nQuantum Eigensolver and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm.

We resolve the inner disk's polarization, revealing a significant\nnear-far side asymmetry, with the near side being markedly brighter than the\nfar side in polarized intensity. This asymmetry is attributed to a\ngeometrically thick inner dust disk, suggesting a large aspect ratio of $H/R\n\\ge 0.15$.

Our algorithms prepare quantum states encoding finite\ndifferences and apply Fourier sampling to estimate uniformity norms, enabling\nefficient detection of structural correlations.\n  As a key application, we show that for certain degrees $ d = 4, 5, 6 $ and\nunder appropriate conditions on the underlying field, there exist\nquasipolynomial-time quantum algorithms that distinguish whether a bounded\nfunction $ f(x) $ is a degree-$ d $ phase polynomial or far from any such\nstructure.

This methodological contribution lies in\napplying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal\npoints, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for\ndenoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on\nstructured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of\nany data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric\nfidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with\ncomplex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder\nfluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car\nexternal aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for\nreal-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit\nmodels (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps\ncompared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to\n200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our\nproposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion\nmodel: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters\nwhile achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive\ncomparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and\nMeshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all\nthree physical systems.

Analytical results for the case\nof a single user and a single eavesdropper reveal the optimal APV structure\nthat minimizes their channel correlation. For the general multiuser scenario,\nwe develop a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm by leveraging\nRiemannian manifold optimization.

This study revisits the alignment and uniformity properties within\nthe context of multimodal recommender systems, revealing a proclivity among\nextant models to prioritize uniformity to the detriment of alignment. Our\nhypothesis challenges the conventional assumption of equitable item treatment\nthrough a uniformity loss, proposing a more nuanced approach wherein items with\nsimilar multimodal attributes converge toward proximal representations within\nthe hyperspheric manifold. Specifically, we leverage the inherent similarity\nbetween items' multimodal data to calibrate their uniformity distribution,\nthereby inducing a more pronounced repulsive force between dissimilar entities\nwithin the embedding space. A theoretical analysis elucidates the relationship\nbetween this calibrated uniformity loss and the conventional uniformity\nfunction.

    "abstract": "A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require\nmulti-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the\ninternet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different\nlocations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often\nfocus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce\ntransactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required\nfor web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks\ntypically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not\nassess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,\nanalysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first\nend-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data\nscience tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data\nportals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,\nmulti-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats\nthat better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of\ncurrent SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing\nthese tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web\nVoyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis\nsuggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,\nrepetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks\ndisplay. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets\nthe stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful\nLLM-based data science.",

This variant\nnot only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\\times$\ntraining speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy\nof end-to-end backpropagation.

However, as a compact and\nminimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many\nrepetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in\nambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D\nstructural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual\npre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual\nimages. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower\nFLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.\nIn particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering\nconstraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room\nimages. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of\nthe observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the\nscene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc\nalgorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite\nvisual FLoc.

This limitation overlooks\nthe semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the\nspatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of\nsemantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,\nwe propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by\nlearning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer\ntask. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a\nstrategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It\nleverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize\npseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling\n(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using\ndomain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic\nspace, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.\nExtensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our\nframework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity\nand structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer\nwith semantic preservation.

Despite\nthe emergence of a few GNN-based methods attempting to mitigate its missing\nsituation, when only a few features are available, they rather perform worse\nthan traditional structure-based models. To this end, we propose a novel\nframework that further illuminates the potential of classical Label Propagation\n(Oldie), taking advantage of Feature Propagation, especially when only a\npartial feature is available. Now called by GOODIE, it takes a hybrid approach\nto obtain embeddings from the Label Propagation branch and Feature Propagation\nbranch. To do so, we first design a GNN-based decoder that enables the Label\nPropagation branch to output hidden embeddings that align with those of the FP\nbranch. Then, GOODIE automatically captures the significance of structure and\nfeature information thanks to the newly designed Structure-Feature Attention.\nFollowed by a novel Pseudo-Label contrastive learning that differentiates the\ncontribution of each positive pair within pseudo-labels originating from the LP\nbranch, GOODIE outputs the final prediction for the unlabeled nodes. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model, GOODIE,\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods not only when only a few\nfeatures are available but also in abundantly available situations.

    "abstract": "Fault detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of modern\nindustrial systems. However, a significant scientific challenge is the lack of\nrigorous risk control and reliable uncertainty quantification in existing\ndiagnostic models, particularly when facing complex scenarios such as\ndistributional shifts. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel fault\ndetection method that integrates significance testing with the conformal\nprediction framework to provide formal risk guarantees. The method transforms\nfault detection into a hypothesis testing task by defining a nonconformity\nmeasure based on model residuals. It then leverages a calibration dataset to\ncompute p-values for new samples, which are used to construct prediction sets\nmathematically guaranteed to contain the true label with a user-specified\nprobability, $1-\\alpha$. Fault classification is subsequently performed by\nanalyzing the intersection of the constructed prediction set with predefined\nnormal and fault label sets. Experimental results on cross-domain fault\ndiagnosis tasks validate the theoretical properties of our approach. The\nproposed method consistently achieves an empirical coverage rate at or above\nthe nominal level ($1-\\alpha$), demonstrating robustness even when the\nunderlying point-prediction models perform poorly. Furthermore, the results\nreveal a controllable trade-off between the user-defined risk level ($\\alpha$)\nand efficiency, where higher risk tolerance leads to smaller average prediction\nset sizes. This research contributes a theoretically grounded framework for\nfault detection that enables explicit risk control, enhancing the\ntrustworthiness of diagnostic systems in safety-critical applications and\nadvancing the field from simple point predictions to informative,\nuncertainty-aware outputs.",

Under current protocols,\npackets with errors are discarded, preventing the receiver from utilizing\nerroneous semantic data for robust decoding. To address this issue, a\npacket-loss-resistant MoE Swin Transformer-based Video Semantic Communication\n(MSTVSC) system is proposed in this paper. Semantic vectors are encoded by\nMSTVSC and transmitted through upper-layer protocol packetization. To\ninvestigate the impact of the packetization, a theoretical analysis of the\npacketization strategy is provided. To mitigate the semantic loss caused by\npacket loss, a 3D CNN at the receiver recovers missing information using\nun-lost semantic data and an packet-loss mask matrix. Semantic-level\ninterleaving is employed to reduce concentrated semantic loss from packet\ndrops. To improve compression, a common-individual decomposition approach is\nadopted, with downsampling applied to individual information to minimize\nredundancy.

However, existing\nbenchmarks face two major challenges: (1) the escalating cost of constructing\nhigh-quality test suites and reference solutions, and (2) the increasing risk\nof data contamination, which undermines the reliability of benchmark-based\nevaluations. In this paper, we propose BIS, a prompt-centric evaluation\nframework that enables ground-truth-free prediction of LLM performance on code\ngeneration tasks. Rather than executing generated code, BIS estimates\nperformance metrics by analyzing the prompt distribution alone. Built on\nimportance sampling theory and implemented using Importance Weighted\nAutoencoders, our method reweights samples from existing annotated benchmarks\nto estimate performance on new, unseen benchmarks. To stabilize the estimation,\nwe introduce weight truncation strategies and compute marginal expectations\nacross the fitted distributions. BIS serves as a complementary tool that\nsupports benchmark development and validation under constrained resources,\noffering actionable and quick feedback for prompt selection and contamination\nassessment. We conduct extensive experiments involving 8,000 evaluation points\nacross 4 CodeLlama models and 9 diverse benchmarks. Our framework achieves an\naverage absolute prediction error of 1.1% for code correctness scores, with\nbest- and worst-case errors of 0.3% and 1.9%, respectively. It also generalizes\nwell to other metrics, attaining average absolute errors of 2.15% for pass@1.\nThese results demonstrate the reliability and broad applicability of BIS, which\ncan significantly reduce the cost and effort of benchmarking LLMs in\ncode-related tasks.",

Yet, the need\nfor content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change\nrapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of\nharmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical\ndue to the high computational, data, and storage demands.

Dividing the spectrum at log-scale energy 5 GeV, we contrast low- and\nhigh-energy anisotropy features via sidereal modulation, angular profiles,\nFourier analysis, and full-sky HEALPix mapping. Gaussian and power-law fits to\nenergy distributions are evaluated using chi-squared, reduced chi-squared, and\nBayesian Information Criterion. Results show strong dipolar and large-scale\nanisotropy at low energies, likely due to geomagnetic and atmospheric effects,\nwhile high-energy muons display weaker, more localized structures consistent\nwith reduced scattering and source-related anisotropy. Energy distributions are\nwell fit by Gaussians, especially in the 6.5 to 100 bin, validating IceCube's\nreconstruction at PeV scales. These findings confirm energy-dependent\nanisotropy and support cosmic-ray diffusion models.",

However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning\nvia three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,\nwe design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs\nfrom scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution\nconditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that\nvanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions.

In\naddition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas\ndepicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and\noperate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances\nsignificantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object.

This model features a quantum-corrected metric\ntensor, representing a deformation of the classical Schwarzschild solution.\nInvestigations into the quasi-normal modes reveal that these quantum-corrected\nblack holes exhibit stability against scalar perturbations. Notably, the\nexponential decay rate within the Lorentzian qOS model demonstrates a\nsignificant reduction compared to both the earlier qOS model devoid of this\nterm and the standard Schwarzschild black hole. The higher overtones of the\nLorentzian qOS model also differ significantly from those of the earlier qOS\nmodel and the standard Schwarzschild black hole, indicating that the\nnear-horizon geometry is substantially modified. The thermodynamic properties\nwith both positive and negative cosmological constant are considered. For the\nanti-de Sitter case, our analysis reveals that for small black hole masses, the\ntemperature within this loop quantum gravity framework decreases as the mass\ndiminishes, contrasting with classical black hole behavior. Furthermore, a\nlogarithmic term emerges as the leading-order correction to the\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy. Additionally, LQG corrections induce an extra phase\ntransition in the black hole's heat capacity at smaller radius. While for the\nde Sitter case, the temperature increases as the mass decreases for small black\nholes, again differing from classical expectations.

To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient\nframework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two\nmodules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism\nthat reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention\nreallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen\nbackbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it\nmitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent\nsamples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities.\nExperiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our\nCA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nparticularly under modality conflict conditions.",

This mismatch in risk preferences can inevitably\nlead to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose Risk-Seeking\nPolicy Optimization (RSPO), a novel method that directly targets Pass@k and\nMax@k during training. A key challenge in optimizing these metrics is the\n\"hitchhiking\" problem: low-reward responses are inadvertently reinforced if\nthey co-occur with a high-reward response within a sample of k generations,\nresulting in inefficient optimization. RSPO addresses this problem by\nleveraging the closed-form probability that a given response is the maximum\namong k samplings.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown significant promise in automated\nportfolio management; however, effectively balancing risk and return remains a\ncentral challenge, as many models fail to adapt to dynamically changing market\nconditions. In this paper, we propose Meta-controlled Agents for a Risk-aware\nSystem (MARS), a novel RL framework designed to explicitly address this\nlimitation through a multi-agent, risk-aware approach. Instead of a single\nmonolithic model, MARS employs a Heterogeneous Agent Ensemble where each agent\npossesses a unique, intrinsic risk profile. This profile is enforced by a\ndedicated Safety-Critic network and a specific risk-tolerance threshold,\nallowing agents to specialize in behaviors ranging from capital preservation to\naggressive growth. To navigate different market regimes, a high-level\nMeta-Adaptive Controller (MAC) learns to dynamically orchestrate the ensemble.\nBy adjusting its reliance on conservative versus aggressive agents, the MAC\neffectively lowers portfolio volatility during downturns and seeks higher\nreturns in bull markets, thus minimizing maximum drawdown and enhancing overall\nstability. This two-tiered structure allows MARS to generate a disciplined and\nadaptive portfolio that is robust to market fluctuations. The framework\nachieves a superior balance between risk and return by leveraging behavioral\ndiversity rather than explicit market-feature engineering. Experiments on major\ninternational stock indexes, including periods of significant financial crisis,\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our framework on risk-adjusted criteria,\nsignificantly reducing maximum drawdown and volatility while maintaining\ncompetitive returns.",

Initial classroom pilots utilized a multi-method\nassessment framework combining pre- and post-tests, in-game analytics, and\nqualitative feedback from students and teachers. Preliminary findings indicate\nthat SPARC significantly increases student engagement, with most participants\nreporting greater interest in STEM subjects and moderate gains in conceptual\nunderstanding observed in post-test results. Ongoing development focuses on\nrefining the AI agent, expanding curriculum integration, and improving\naccessibility. These early results demonstrate the potential of combining\nAI-driven peer support with game-based learning to create inclusive, effective,\nand engaging educational experiences for K-12 learners.",

    "abstract": "The inevitable modality imperfection in real-world scenarios poses\nsignificant challenges for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA). While existing\nmethods tailor reconstruction or joint representation learning strategies to\nrestore missing semantics, they often overlook complex dependencies within and\nacross modalities. Consequently, they fail to fully leverage available\nmodalities to capture complementary semantics. To this end, this paper proposes\na novel graph-based framework to exploit both intra- and inter-modality\ninteractions, enabling imperfect samples to derive missing semantics from\ncomplementary parts for robust MSA. Specifically, we first devise a learnable\nhypergraph to model intra-modality temporal dependencies to exploit contextual\ninformation within each modality. Then, a directed graph is employed to explore\ninter-modality correlations based on attention mechanism, capturing\ncomplementary information across different modalities. Finally, the knowledge\nfrom perfect samples is integrated to supervise our interaction processes,\nguiding the model toward learning reliable and robust joint representations.\nExtensive experiments on MOSI and MOSEI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our method.",

However, current approaches\ntypically address these aspects in isolation, overlooking their internal\ncorrelation in lifelong skill acquisition. We address this limitation with a\nunified framework named Tokenized Skill Scaling (T2S). Specifically, by\ntokenizing the model parameters, the linear parameter mapping of the\ntraditional transformer is transformed into cross-attention between input and\nlearnable tokens, thereby enhancing model scalability through the easy\nextension of new tokens. Additionally, we introduce language-guided skill\nscaling to transfer knowledge across tasks efficiently and avoid linearly\ngrowing parameters. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that\nT2S: 1) effectively prevents catastrophic forgetting (achieving an average NBT\nof 1.0% across the three LIBERO task suites), 2) excels in new skill scaling\nwith minimal increases in trainable parameters (needing only 8.0% trainable\ntokens in an average of lifelong tasks), and 3) enables efficient knowledge\ntransfer between tasks (achieving an average FWT of 77.7% across the three\nLIBERO task suites), offering a promising solution for lifelong imitation\nlearning.",

In conversational scenarios, effectively utilizing context\ncan enhance its accuracy. Large Language Models' (LLMs) exceptional\nlong-context understanding and reasoning abilities enable LLM-based ASR\n(LLM-ASR) to leverage historical context for recognizing conversational speech,\nwhich has a high degree of contextual relevance. However, existing\nconversational LLM-ASR methods use a fixed number of preceding utterances or\nthe entire conversation history as context, resulting in significant ASR\nconfusion and computational costs due to massive irrelevant and redundant\ninformation. This paper proposes a multi-modal retrieval-and-selection method\nnamed MARS that augments conversational LLM-ASR by enabling it to retrieve and\nselect the most relevant acoustic and textual historical context for the\ncurrent utterance. Specifically, multi-modal retrieval obtains a set of\ncandidate historical contexts, each exhibiting high acoustic or textual\nsimilarity to the current utterance. Multi-modal selection calculates the\nacoustic and textual similarities for each retrieved candidate historical\ncontext and, by employing our proposed near-ideal ranking method to consider\nboth similarities, selects the best historical context. Evaluations on the\nInterspeech 2025 Multilingual Conversational Speech Language Model Challenge\ndataset show that the LLM-ASR, when trained on only 1.5K hours of data and\nequipped with the MARS, outperforms the state-of-the-art top-ranking system\ntrained on 179K hours of data.",

Our method constructs a local\ncontrast function from adjacent increments, which avoids inversion of large\ncovariance matrices and allows for efficient computation. We prove consistency\nand asymptotic normality of the resulting estimators under general ergodicity\nconditions. A distinctive feature of our approach is that the drift estimator\nattains a nonstandard convergence rate, stemming from the direct Riemann\nintegrability of the drift density. This highlights a fundamental difference\nfrom standard estimation regimes. Furthermore, when the local contrast fails to\nidentify all parameters in the covariance kernel, moment-based corrections can\nbe incorporated to recover identifiability.

Such inability to retain learned knowledge limits\ntheir applicability in the real world, where AD systems need to operate across\nvarying scenarios with dynamic distributions. As revealed by neuroscience, the\nhippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in memory replay, effectively\nreconstructing learned knowledge based on limited resources. Inspired by this,\nwe propose a hippocampal circuit-inspired continual learning method (H2C) for\ntrajectory prediction across varying scenarios. H2C retains prior knowledge by\nselectively recalling a small subset of learned samples. First, two\ncomplementary strategies are developed to select the subset to represent\nlearned knowledge. Specifically, one strategy maximizes inter-sample diversity\nto represent the distinctive knowledge, and the other estimates the overall\nknowledge by equiprobable sampling. Then, H2C updates via a memory replay loss\nfunction calculated by these selected samples to retain knowledge while\nlearning new data. Experiments based on various scenarios from the INTERACTION\ndataset are designed to evaluate H2C. Experimental results show that H2C\nreduces catastrophic forgetting of DL baselines by 22.71% on average in a\ntask-free manner, without relying on manually informed distributional shifts.\nThe implementation is available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/H2C-lifelong.",

    "abstract": "Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual\nappearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training\nparadigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and\nprogressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels\ninto the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a\ncurriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning\nto fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH\nrequires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is\nmodel-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder\nframeworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that\nmodels trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially\nunder challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general\napplicability.",

In this work, we first\ninvestigate the vulnerabilities of model-merging methods and pinpoint the\nsource-model characteristics that critically underlie them. Specifically, we\nidentify two factors that are particularly harmful to the merging process: (1)\ndisparities in task vector norms, and (2) the low confidence of the source\nmodels. To address this issue, we propose DisTaC (Distillation for Task vector\nConditioning), a novel method that pre-conditions these problematic task\nvectors before the merge. DisTaC leverages knowledge distillation to adjust a\ntask vector's norm and increase source-model confidence while preserving its\nessential task-specific knowledge.

    "abstract": "Parameter estimation is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. In\nmany safety-critical applications, one is not only interested in a {\\it point}\nestimator, but also the uncertainty bound that can self-assess the accuracy of\nthe estimator. In this regard, the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is of\ngreat importance, as it provides a lower bound on the variance of {\\it any}\nunbiased estimator. In many cases, it is the only way of evaluating, without\nrecourse to simulations, the expected accuracy of numerically obtainable\nestimates. For the existence of the CRLB, there have been widely accepted\nregularity conditions, one of which is that the support of the likelihood\nfunction (LF) -- the pdf of the observations conditioned on the parameter of\ninterest -- should be independent of the parameter to be estimated. This paper\nstarts from reviewing the derivations of the classical CRLB under the condition\nthat the LF has parameter-independent support. To cope with the case of\nparameter-dependent support, we generalize the CRLB to the {\\it\nCram\\'{e}r-Rao-Leibniz lower bound (CRLLB)}, by leveraging the general Leibniz\nintegral rule. Notably, the existing results on CRLLB and CRLB are unified\nunder the framework of CRLLB with multidimensional parameters.

This blindness makes it difficult to\ndistinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures.\nWe introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this\nsemantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors\nagents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using\neBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic\nintent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally\ncorrelates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine\nand secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is\nframework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3%\nperformance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection\nattacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden\ncoordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an\nopen-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.",

    "abstract": "To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework\nthat integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as\nlarge-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI\nvolumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets\ncollected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and\n578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the\nBraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing\n(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,\nskull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were\nconducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and\nablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The\nproposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label\nscarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on\nseveral detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The\nproposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%\n(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)\nmethods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive\nperformance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,\nindicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size\nshowed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without\nevidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic\nsemi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly\ndetection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial\ndatasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its\npotential for real-world clinical applications.",

However, existing automatic database O&M methods,\nincluding commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On\nthe one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,\nmetric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and\ncannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting\nguidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve\nfragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate\ninaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present\nDBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with\nknowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a\nheterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and\nproposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from\nthousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)\nreusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and\nimplicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps\nproposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis\npaths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a\nreasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear\ndiagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four\nmainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates\nthat DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher\nin root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.",

However, in real-world scenarios, users\nrarely leave reviews, resulting in severe sparsity that undermines the\neffectiveness of existing models. A natural solution is to impute or generate\nmissing reviews to enrich the data. However, conventional imputation techniques\n-- such as matrix completion and LLM-based augmentation -- either lose\ncontextualized semantics by embedding texts into vectors, or overlook\nstructural dependencies among user-item interactions. To address these\nshortcomings, we propose TWISTER (ToWards Imputation on Sparsity with Textual\nEdge Graph Representation), a unified framework that imputes missing reviews by\njointly modeling semantic and structural signals.

To capture relational context, we construct line-graph views and\nemploy a large language model as a graph-aware aggregator. For each interaction\nlacking a textual review, our model aggregates the neighborhood's\nnatural-language representations to generate a coherent and personalized\nreview. Experiments on the Amazon and Goodreads datasets show that TWISTER\nconsistently outperforms traditional numeric, graph-based, and LLM baselines,\ndelivering higher-quality imputed reviews and, more importantly, enhanced\nrecommendation performance.

However, measurement discrepancies between Gaia\nblue and red samples, regarding whether the transverse velocity is remarkable,\nintroduce significant ambiguity. In this work, we remeasure the systemic PMs of\nM31 and M33 using massive supergiant stars from Gaia Data Release 3. Clean disk\ntracers are selected via color-color diagrams, with foreground contaminants\nremoved through kinematic and astrometric cuts. We identify the discrepancy in\nM31's blue and red samples as arising from systematic differences between\nGaia's 5-parameter (5p) and 6-parameter (6p) astrometric solutions. The 6p\nsolution, applied to sources lacking accurate color information, relies on a\npseudo-color approximation, leading to lower precision and larger\nuncertainties. Two key limitations of the 6p solution are: 1) degraded\nastrometric accuracy for very red sources (GBP - GRP > 2.6); 2) significant PM\nzero-point offsets. In our sample, red sources are dominated by the 6p\nsolution, while blue sources include a substantial fraction of 5p sources; this\nmismatch drives the observed discrepancy. By excluding extreme red sources and\ncalibrating PM zero-points separately for 5p and 6p sources using background\nquasars, we reduce the discrepancy, bringing blue and red measurements into\nagreement within 1 sigma.

    "abstract": "Neural scaling laws have driven the development of increasingly large\nlanguage models (LLMs) by linking accuracy improvements to growth in parameter\ncount, dataset size, and compute. However, these laws overlook the carbon\nemissions that scale exponentially with LLM size. This paper presents\n\\textit{CarbonScaling}, an analytical framework that extends neural scaling\nlaws to incorporate both operational and embodied carbon in LLM training. By\nintegrating models for neural scaling, GPU hardware evolution, parallelism\noptimization, and carbon estimation, \\textit{CarbonScaling} quantitatively\nconnects model accuracy to carbon footprint. Results show that while a\npower-law relationship between accuracy and carbon holds, real-world\ninefficiencies significantly increase the scaling factor. Hardware technology\nscaling reduces carbon emissions for small to mid-sized models, but offers\ndiminishing returns for extremely large LLMs due to communication overhead and\nunderutilized GPUs. Training optimizations-especially aggressive critical batch\nsize scaling-help alleviate this inefficiency. \\textit{CarbonScaling} offers\nkey insights for training more sustainable and carbon-efficient LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is\ncrucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,\nadvancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by\naccurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.\nHowever, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with\nstructured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world\negocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and\ndynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nEgocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks\nthat utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without\nrelying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional\nmotion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored\nfor egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports\negocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person\nvisual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene\nsemantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer\nplausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a\nlarge-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth\n3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in\negocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a\nsingle egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling\nand unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.",

    "abstract": "Journalists have incorporated social networks into their work as a standard\ntool, enhancing their ability to produce and disseminate information and making\nit easier for them to connect more directly with their audiences. However, this\ngreater presence in the digital public sphere has also increased their exposure\nto harassment and hate speech, particularly in the case of women journalists.\nThis study analyzes the presence of harassment and hate speech in responses (n\n= 60,684) to messages that 200 journalists and media outlets posted on X\n(formerly Twitter) accounts during the days immediately preceding and following\nthe July 23 (23-J) general elections held in Spain in 2023. The results\nindicate that the most common forms of harassment were insults and political\nhate, which were more frequently aimed at personal accounts than institutional\nones, highlighting the significant role of political polarization-particularly\nduring election periods-in shaping the hostility that journalists face.\nMoreover, although, generally speaking, the total number of harassing messages\nwas similar for men and women, it was found that a greater number of sexist\nmessages were aimed at women journalists, and an ideological dimension was\nidentified in the hate speech that extremists or right-wing populists directed\nat them. This study corroborates that this is a minor but systemic issue,\nparticularly from a political and gender perspective. To counteract this, the\nmedia must develop proactive policies and protective actions extending even to\nthe individual level, where this issue usually applies.",

It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across\nall metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in\nactivity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS\ndata utility for mobility analysis.

    "abstract": "As a countermeasure against misinformation that undermines the healthy use of\nsocial media, a preventive intervention known as prebunking has recently\nattracted attention in the field of psychology. Prebunking aims to strengthen\nindividuals' cognitive resistance to misinformation by presenting weakened\ndoses of misinformation or by teaching common manipulation techniques before\nthey encounter actual misinformation. Despite the growing body of evidence\nsupporting its effectiveness in reducing susceptibility to misinformation at\nthe individual level, an important open question remains: how best to identify\nthe optimal targets for prebunking interventions to mitigate the spread of\nmisinformation in a social network. To address this issue, we formulate a\ncombinatorial optimization problem, called the network prebunking problem, to\nidentify optimal prebunking targets for minimizing the spread of misinformation\nin a social network. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and propose an\napproximation algorithm, MIA-NPP, based on the Maximum Influence Arborescence\n(MIA) approach, which restricts influence propagation around each node to a\nlocal directed tree rooted at that node. Through numerical experiments using\nreal-world social network datasets, we demonstrate that MIA-NPP effectively\nsuppresses the spread of misinformation under both fully observed and uncertain\nmodel parameter settings.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new method for detecting dark matter axions using a resonant\ncavity coupled with a quantum Hall system. When a sample exhibiting quantum\nHall effect is placed inside the cavity and the cavity is tuned to resonance,\ntwo-dimensional electrons absorb the amplified radiation, leading to a rise in\nthe sample's temperature. By monitoring this temperature increase, the mass\n$m_a$ of the axion can be inferred. As an example, consider a GaAs sample with\nsmall thickness $d = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and its heat capacity $C_s$ at\ntemperature $T = 20\\,\\mathrm{mK}$.

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted attention as an\nalternative approach to solve partial differential equations using a deep\nneural network (DNN). Their simplicity and capability allow them to solve\ninverse problems for many applications. Despite the versatility of PINNs, it\nremains challenging to reduce their training cost. Using a DNN pre-trained with\nan arbitrary dataset with transfer learning or fine-tuning is a potential\nsolution. However, a pre-trained model using a different geometry and flow\ncondition than the target may not produce suitable results. This paper proposes\na fine-tuning approach for PINNs with coordinate transformation, modelling\nlid-driven cavity flows with various shapes. We formulate the inverse problem,\nwhere the reference data inside the domain and wall boundary conditions are\ngiven. A pre-trained PINN model with an arbitrary Reynolds number and shape is\nused to initialize a target DNN. To reconcile the reference shape with\ndifferent targets, governing equations as a loss of the PINNs are given with\ncoordinate transformation using a deformation gradient tensor. Numerical\nexamples for various cavity flows with square, rectangular, and shear deformed\ngeometries demonstrate that the proposed fine-tuning approach improves the\ntraining convergence compared with an un-trained model. A pre-trained model\nwith a similar geometry to the target further increases training efficiency.\nThese findings are useful for real-world applications such as modelling\nintra-aneurysmal blood flows in clinical use.",
