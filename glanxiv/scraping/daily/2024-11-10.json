    "abstract": "Off-road environments pose significant perception challenges for high-speed\nautonomous navigation due to unstructured terrain, degraded sensing conditions,\nand domain-shifts among biomes. Learning semantic information across these\nconditions and biomes can be challenging when a large amount of ground truth\ndata is required. In this work, we propose an approach that leverages a\npre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) with fine-tuning on a small (<500 images),\nsparse and coarsely labeled (<30% pixels) multi-biome dataset to predict 2D\nsemantic segmentation classes. These classes are fused over time via a novel\nrange-based metric and aggregated into a 3D semantic voxel map. We demonstrate\nzero-shot out-of-biome 2D semantic segmentation on the Yamaha (52.9 mIoU) and\nRellis (55.5 mIoU) datasets along with few-shot coarse sparse labeling with\nexisting data for improved segmentation performance on Yamaha (66.6 mIoU) and\nRellis (67.2 mIoU). We further illustrate the feasibility of using a voxel map\nwith a range-based semantic fusion approach to handle common off-road hazards\nlike pop-up hazards, overhangs, and water features.",

However, the design of provably stable\nnumerical methods for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws pose a significant\nchallenge. We present the dual-pairing (DP) and upwind summation-by-parts (SBP)\nfinite difference (FD) framework for accurate and robust numerical\napproximations of nonlinear conservation laws. The framework has an inbuilt\n\"limiter\" whose goal is to detect and effectively resolve regions where the\nsolution is poorly resolved and/or discontinuities are found. The DP SBP FD\noperators are a dual-pair of backward and forward FD stencils, which together\npreserve the SBP property. In addition, the DP SBP FD operators are designed to\nbe upwind, that is they come with some innate dissipation everywhere, as\nopposed to traditional SBP and collocated discontinuous Galerkin spectral\nelement methods which can only induce dissipation through numerical fluxes\nacting at element interfaces. We combine the DP SBP operators together with\nskew-symmetric and upwind flux splitting of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation\nlaws. Our semi-discrete approximation is provably entropy-stable for arbitrary\nnonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The framework is high order accurate,\nprovably entropy-stable, convergent, and avoids several pitfalls of current\nstate-of-the-art high order methods. We give specific examples using the\nin-viscid Burger's equation, nonlinear shallow water equations and compressible\nEuler equations of gas dynamics.

State-of-the-art vine robots have been tested in\narchaeological and other field settings, but their translational capabilities\nto urban search and rescue (USAR) are not well understood. To this end, we\npresent a set of experiments designed to test the limits of a vine robot\nsystem, the Soft Pathfinding Robotic Observation Unit (SPROUT), operating in an\nengineered collapsed structure. Our testing is driven by a taxonomy of\ndifficulty derived from the challenges USAR crews face navigating void spaces\nand their associated hazards. Initial experiments explore the viability of the\nvine robot form factor, both ideal and implemented, as well as the control and\nsensorization of the system. A secondary set of experiments applies\ndomain-specific design improvements to increase the portability and reliability\nof the system.

Attacks like membership inference (MIA) have shown that trained models\ncan reveal sensitive data, jeopardizing confidentiality. While traditional\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANNs) dominate ML applications, neuromorphic\narchitectures, specifically Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), are emerging as\npromising alternatives due to their low power consumption and event-driven\nprocessing, akin to biological neurons. Privacy in ANNs is well-studied;\nhowever, little work has explored the privacy-preserving properties of SNNs.\nThis paper examines whether SNNs inherently offer better privacy. Using MIAs,\nwe assess the privacy resilience of SNNs versus ANNs across diverse datasets.\nWe analyze the impact of learning algorithms (surrogate gradient and\nevolutionary), frameworks (snnTorch, TENNLab, LAVA), and parameters on SNN\nprivacy. Our findings show that SNNs consistently outperform ANNs in privacy\npreservation, with evolutionary algorithms offering additional resilience. For\ninstance, on CIFAR-10, SNNs achieve an AUC of 0.59, significantly lower than\nANNs' 0.82, and on CIFAR-100, SNNs maintain an AUC of 0.58 compared to ANNs'\n0.88.

Two-qubit quantum gates are\ntypically realized using coherent two-photon laser excitation of atoms to\nstrongly interacting Rydberg states. However, two-photon excitation encounters\nchallenges in individual addressing with tightly focused laser beams due to\natom position uncertainty and the spatial inhomogeneity in both Rabi\nfrequencies and light shifts. In this work, we theoretically demonstrate that\nthe fidelity of individual addressing can be improved by employing coherent\nthree-photon laser excitation of Rydberg states. For a specific example of\n$5s_{1/2}\\!\\xrightarrow{\\Omega_1}\\!5p_{3/2}\\!\\xrightarrow{\\Omega_2}\\!6s_{1/2}\\!\\xrightarrow{\\Omega_3}\\!np$\nexcitation in $^{87}$Rb atoms, we find that upon strong laser coupling in the\nsecond step (Rabi frequency $\\Omega_2$) and moderate coupling in the first and\nthird steps (Rabi frequencies $\\Omega_1$ and $\\Omega_3$), the three-photon Rabi\nfrequency is given by $\\Omega \\!=\\!\\Omega_1\\Omega_3/\\Omega_2$. If the spatial\ndistributions of $(\\Omega_1\\Omega_3)$ and $\\Omega_2$ are arranged to be\nidentical, $\\Omega$ becomes independent of atom position, even within very\ntightly focused laser beams. This approach dramatically improves individual\naddressing of Rydberg excitation for neighboring atoms in trap arrays compared\nto conventional two-photon excitation schemes. Our findings are crucial for\nlarge-scale quantum registers of neutral atoms, where distances between\nadjacent atoms should be minimized to ensure stronger Rydberg interactions and\ncompact arrangement of atom arrays.",

    "abstract": "3D Gaussian Splatting has recently achieved notable success in novel view\nsynthesis for dynamic scenes and geometry reconstruction in static scenes.\nBuilding on these advancements, early methods have been developed for dynamic\nsurface reconstruction by globally optimizing entire sequences. However,\nreconstructing dynamic scenes with significant topology changes, emerging or\ndisappearing objects, and rapid movements remains a substantial challenge,\nparticularly for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose AT-GS, a\nnovel method for reconstructing high-quality dynamic surfaces from multi-view\nvideos through per-frame incremental optimization. To avoid local minima across\nframes, we introduce a unified and adaptive gradient-aware densification\nstrategy that integrates the strengths of conventional cloning and splitting\ntechniques. Additionally, we reduce temporal jittering in dynamic surfaces by\nensuring consistency in curvature maps across consecutive frames. Our method\nachieves superior accuracy and temporal coherence in dynamic surface\nreconstruction, delivering high-fidelity space-time novel view synthesis, even\nin complex and challenging scenes. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view\nvideo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing clear\nadvantages over baseline methods.

Offline MARL mitigates these challenges by using historical\ntraffic data for training but faces significant difficulties with heterogeneous\nbehavior policies in real-world datasets, where mixed-quality data complicates\nlearning. We introduce OffLight, a novel offline MARL framework designed to\nhandle heterogeneous behavior policies in TSC datasets. To improve learning\nefficiency, OffLight incorporates Importance Sampling (IS) to correct for\ndistributional shifts and Return-Based Prioritized Sampling (RBPS) to focus on\nhigh-quality experiences. OffLight utilizes a Gaussian Mixture Variational\nGraph Autoencoder (GMM-VGAE) to capture the diverse distribution of behavior\npolicies from local observations. Extensive experiments across real-world urban\ntraffic scenarios show that OffLight outperforms existing offline RL methods,\nachieving up to a 7.8% reduction in average travel time and 11.2% decrease in\nqueue length. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of OffLight's\ncomponents in handling heterogeneous data and improving policy performance.\nThese results highlight OffLight's scalability and potential to improve urban\ntraffic management without the risks of online learning.",

Purpose: To develop and evaluate a novel 3D\nsurface dosimetry method for UHDR PBS proton therapy using high-speed imaging\nof a scintillator array for real-time, high-resolution surface dose monitoring.\nThe spatial, temporal, and dosimetric components are validated via imaging of a\nQA phantom and comparison against TPS predictions. Methods: A deformable\nmulti-element scintillator array was designed with 7.5mm element pitch and\n0.5mm inter-element gap. Scintillation linearity with dose was evaluated with\nvariation in response to increasing imaging and irradiation angles. WED testing\nevaluated beam attenuation at two energy levels. Scintillation emission was\nimaged at 1kHz and mesh position was monitored via 2-camera stereovision.\nSystem setup was validated using a 3D QA phantom to assess spatial accuracy and\nguide setup correction.

Kernel-based residual spot\nfitting derived cumulative dose maps compared to TPS dose profile of 5x5cm UHDR\nPBS delivery using 3%/2mm gamma analysis. PBS and maximum dose rate maps were\ncalculated. Results: Setup achieved average localization error of 0.62 mm,\nsurpassing typical 1+ mm clinical threshold.

While large language model (LLM) based approaches show promise in\nautomating scientific discovery, they often overlook the importance of\ncriticizing scientific models. Criticizing models deepens scientific\nunderstanding and drives the development of more accurate models. Automating\nmodel criticism is difficult because it traditionally requires a human expert\nto define how to compare a model with data and evaluate if the discrepancies\nare significant--both rely heavily on understanding the modeling assumptions\nand domain. Although LLM-based critic approaches are appealing, they introduce\nnew challenges: LLMs might hallucinate the critiques themselves. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce CriticAL (Critic Automation with Language Models). CriticAL\nuses LLMs to generate summary statistics that capture discrepancies between\nmodel predictions and data, and applies hypothesis tests to evaluate their\nsignificance. We can view CriticAL as a verifier that validates models and\ntheir critiques by embedding them in a hypothesis testing framework. In\nexperiments, we evaluate CriticAL across key quantitative and qualitative\ndimensions. In settings where we synthesize discrepancies between models and\ndatasets, CriticAL reliably generates correct critiques without hallucinating\nincorrect ones.

This is unnatural and inconsistent. Different\ntheoretical and phenomenological conundrums suggest that the $\\Lambda$CDM\nnecessitates further theoretical underpinning to cope with modern observations.\nAn interesting approach is the framework of the `running vacuum model' (RVM).\nIt endows $\\Lambda$ with cosmic dynamics within a fundamental framework since\nit is based on QFT. In the RVM, the vacuum energy density (VED) appears as a\nseries of powers of the Hubble function and its derivatives, $\\rho_{\\rm vac}\n(H, \\dot{H},...)$. In the current universe, $\\rho_{\\rm vac}$ changes as $\\sim\nH^2$. Higher order effects ${\\cal O}(H^4)$, on the other hand, can be\nresponsible for a new mechanism of inflation (RVM-inflation). On the practical\nside the RVM can alleviate the cosmological tensions on $\\sigma_8$ and $H_0$.\nAn intriguing smoking gun signature of the RVM is that its equation of state\ncan mimic quintessence, as recently observed by DESI, so the vacuum can be the\nsought-for dynamical DE. At a deeper theoretical level, the RVM-renormalized\nform of the VED can avoid extreme fine tuning related to the well-known\ncosmological constant problem. Overall, the RVM has the capacity to impinge\npositively on relevant theoretical and practical aspects of modern cosmology.",

    "abstract": "Simulating radiative transfer in the atmosphere with Monte Carlo ray tracing\nprovides realistic surface irradiance in cloud-resolving models. However, Monte\nCarlo methods are computationally expensive because large sampling budgets are\nrequired to obtain sufficient convergence. Here, we explore the use of machine\nlearning for denoising direct and diffuse surface solar irradiance fields. We\nuse Monte Carlo ray tracing to compute pairs of noisy and well-converged\nsurface irradiance fields for an ensemble of cumulus cloud fields and solar\nangles, and train a denoising autoencoder to predict the well-converged\nirradiance fields from the noisy input. We demonstrate that denoising diffuse\nirradiance from 1 sample per pixel (per spectral quadrature point) is an order\nof magnitude faster and twice as accurate as ray tracing with 128 samples per\npixel, illustrating the advantage of denoising over larger sampling budgets.\nDenoising of direct irradiance is effective in sunlit areas, while errors\npersist on the edges of cloud shadows. For diffuse irradiance, providing\nadditional atmospheric information such as liquid water paths and solar angles\nto train the denoising algorithm reduces errors by approximately a factor of\ntwo. Our results open up possibilities for coupled Monte Carlo ray tracing with\ncomputational costs approaching those of two-stream-based radiative transfer\nsolvers, although future work is needed to improve generalization across\nresolutions and cloud types.",

They gave an efficient randomized PIT\nalgorithm for +-regular circuits of depth 3 and posed the problem of developing\nan efficient black-box PIT for higher depths as an open problem.\n  We present a randomized black-box polynomial-time algorithm for +-regular\ncircuits of any constant depth. Specifically, our algorithm runs in\n$s^{O(d^2)}$ time, where $s$ and $d$ represent the size and the depth of the\n$+$-regular circuit, respectively. We combine several key techniques in a novel\nway. We employ a nondeterministic substitution automaton that transforms the\npolynomial into a structured form and utilizes polynomial sparsification along\nwith commutative transformations to maintain non-zeroness. Additionally, we\nintroduce matrix composition, coefficient modification via the automaton, and\nmulti-entry outputs-methods that have not previously been applied in the\ncontext of black-box PIT. Together, these techniques enable us to effectively\nhandle exponential degrees and doubly exponential sparsity in non-commutative\nsettings, enabling polynomial identity testing for higher-depth circuits.

Existing blackstart solutions utilize blackstart units to establish\nmultiple microgrids, sequentially energize non-blackstart units, and restore\nloads. However, these approaches often result in isolated microgrids. In\nDER-aided blackstart, the continuous operation of these microgrids is uncertain\ndue to the finite energy capacity of commonly used blackstart units, such as\nbattery energy storage (BES)-based grid-forming inverters (GFMIs). To address\nthis issue, this article proposes a holistic blackstart and restoration\nframework that incorporates synchronization between microgrids and the entire\nDS with the transmission grid (TG). To support synchronization, we leveraged\nvirtual synchronous generator-based control for GFMIs to estimate their\nfrequency response to load pick-up events using only initial/final\nquasi-steady-state points. Subsequently, a synchronization switching condition\nwas developed to model synchronizing switches, aligning them seamlessly with a\nlinearized branch flow problem. Finally, we designed a bottom-up blackstart and\nrestoration framework that considers the switching structure of the DS,\nenergizing/synchronizing switches, DERs with grid-following inverters, and\nBES-based GFMIs with frequency security constraints. The proposed framework is\nvalidated in IEEE-123-bus system, considering cases with two and four GFMIs\nunder various TG recovery instants.",

The proposed scheme achieves\nfourth-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time while\nutilizing only seven directly adjacent grid points of the compact stencils at\nthe $(n+1)$ time level, making it highly efficient and super compact. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first higher-order accurate finite\ndifference scheme proposed to study 3D natural convection and entropy\ngeneration in non-Newtonian fluids. A time-marching technique is applied, where\npressure corrections are addressed using a modified artificial compressibility\nmethod. The scheme is applied to the power-law model of non-Newtonian fluids,\ninvestigating both shear-thinning and shear-thickening effects on natural\nconvection and entropy generation within a 3D cubic cavity. In the numerical\nsimulations, the Prandtl number remains constant at $Pr = 1.0$, while various\nRayleigh numbers ($Ra = 10^2$, $10^3$, $10^4$, $10^5$) and power-law indices\n($n = 0.75$, $1.0$, $1.25$) are considered.

The validation of the proposed scheme demonstrates excellent\nagreement with existing benchmark results. The numerical study reveals that the\n$n$ and $Ra$ have significant impacts on flow dynamics, heat transfer, and\nentropy generation. As $Ra$ increases, the maximum value of average Nusselt\nnumber ($Nu_{\\text{avg}}$) also increases, whereas an opposite trend is\nobserved with $n$ values. Shear-thinning fluids demonstrate the highest\nconvection efficiency compared to Newtonian and shear-thickening fluids at any\nspecific $Ra$.",

To achieve this, they require a carbon\nsignal, i.e. a metric that defines the real-time carbon intensity of their\nelectricity supply. Unfortunately, in a grid with multiple generation sources\nand multiple consumers, the physics of the system do not provide an unambiguous\nway to trace electricity from source to sink. As a result, there are a\nmultitude of proposed carbon signals, each of which has a distinct set of\nproperties and method of calculation. It remains unclear which signal best\nquantifies the carbon footprint of electricity. This paper seeks to inform the\ndiscussion about which carbon signal is better or more suitable for two\nimportant use cases, namely carbon-informed load shifting and carbon\naccounting. We do this by developing a new software package\nElectricityEmissions$.$jl, that computes several established and newly proposed\ncarbon emission metrics for standard electric grid test cases. We also\ndemonstrate how the package can be used to investigate the effects of using\nthese metrics to guide load shifting. Our results affirm previous research,\nwhich showed that the choice of carbon emission metric has significant impact\non shifting results and associated carbon emission reductions. In addition, we\ndemonstrate the impact of load shifting on both the consumers that perform the\nshifting and consumers that do not.

However, unlike simulated sandbox environments,\nreal-world environments such as the web are rife with irreversible actions.\nThis undermines the feasibility of backtracking, a cornerstone of (tree)\nsearch. Overly relying on test-time search also hurts efficiency. We advocate\nmodel-based planning for web agents that employs a world model to simulate and\ndeliberate over the outcome of each candidate action before committing to one.\nWe systematically explore this paradigm by (1) Proposing a model-based planning\nframework, WebDreamer, which employs LLMs to serve as both world models and\nvalue functions; (2) Training specialized LLMs as world models with a scalable\ndata synthesis pipeline. Empirical results demonstrate that WebDreamer achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements over reactive baselines. It is\ncompetitive, while being 4-5 times more efficient, with tree search in sandbox\nenvironments (VisualWebArena) and also works effectively on real-world websites\n(Online-Mind2Web and Mind2Web-Live). Furthermore, our trained world model,\nDreamer-7B, performs comparable to GPT-4o, highlighting the potential of\nspecialized world models for efficient and effective planning in complex web\nenvironments.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based semantic communication methods have shown significant\nadvantages in image transmission by harnessing the generative power of\ndiffusion models. However, they still face challenges, including generation\nrandomness that leads to distorted reconstructions and high computational\ncosts. To address these issues, we propose CASC, a condition-aware semantic\ncommunication framework that incorporates a latent diffusion model (LDM)-based\ndenoiser. The LDM denoiser at the receiver utilizes the received noisy latent\ncodes as the conditioning signal to reconstruct the latent codes, enabling the\ndecoder to accurately recover the source image. By operating in the latent\nspace, the LDM reduces computational complexity compared to traditional\ndiffusion models (DMs). Additionally, we introduce a condition-aware neural\nnetwork (CAN) that dynamically adjusts the weights in the hidden layers of the\nLDM based on the conditioning signal. This enables finer control over the\ngeneration process, significantly improving the perceptual quality of the\nreconstructed images. Experimental results show that CASC significantly\noutperforms DeepJSCC in both perceptual quality and visual effect. Moreover,\nCASC reduces inference time by 51.7% compared to existing DM-based semantic\ncommunication systems, while maintaining comparable perceptual performance. The\nablation studies also validate the effectiveness of the CAN module in improving\nthe image reconstruction quality.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates a novel method for estimating two-dimensional\nvelocities using coarse-grained imaging data, which is particularly relevant\nfor applications in plasma diagnostics. The method utilizes measurements from\nthree non-collinear points and is derived from a stochastic model that\ndescribes the propagation of uncorrelated pulses through two-dimensional space.\nWe demonstrate that the method provides exact time delay estimates when applied\nto a superposition of Gaussian structures and remains accurate for various\nother pulse functions. Through extensive numerical simulations, we evaluate the\nmethod's performance under variations in signal duration, pulse overlap,\nspatial and temporal resolution, and the presence of additive noise.\nAdditionally, we investigate the impact of temporal pulse evolution due to\nlinear damping and explore the so-called barberpole effect, which occurs with\nelongated and tilted structures. Although the method is susceptible to the\nbarberpole effect, we analytically demonstrate that this effect does not occur\nwhen the elongated structures propagate parallel to one of their axes, and we\nestablish bounds for the associated errors. We propose a series of safeguards\nto anticipate the applicability of the velocity estimation method, considering\nfactors such as signal length, number of pulses, temporal and spatial\nresolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and pulse size. However, these safeguards do\nnot ensure applicability in cases involving the barberpole effect or\ncorrelations between amplitudes and velocities. Overall, our findings provide a\ncomprehensive and robust framework for accurate two-dimensional velocity\nestimation, enhancing the capabilities of fusion plasma diagnostics and\npotentially benefiting other fields requiring precise motion analysis.",

    "abstract": "Spin fluctuations have been proposed as a key mechanism for mediating\nsuperconductivity, particularly in high-temperature superconducting cuprates,\nwhere conventional electron-phonon interactions alone cannot account for the\nobserved critical temperatures. Traditionally, their role has been analyzed\nthrough tight-binding based model Hamiltonians. In this work we present a\nmethod that combines density functional theory with a momentum- and\nfrequency-dependent pairing interaction derived from the Fluctuation Exchange\n(FLEX) type Random Phase Approximation (FLEX-RPA) to compute Eliashberg\nspectral functions $\\alpha ^{2}F(\\omega )$ which are central to spin\nfluctuation theory of superconductivity. We apply our numerical procedure to\nstudy a series of cuprates where our extracted material specific $\\alpha\n^{2}F(\\omega )$ are found to exhibit remarkable similarities characterized by a\nsharp peak in the vicinity of 40-60 meV and their rapid decay at higher\nfrequencies. Our exact diagonalization of a linearized BCS gap equation\nextracts superconducting energy gap functions for realistic Fermi surfaces of\nthe cuprates and predicts their symmetry to be $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ in all studied\nsystems. Via a variation of on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$ for the copper\n$d$-electrons we show that that the range of the experimental values of $T_{c}$\ncan be reproduced in this approach but is extremely sensitive to the proximity\nof the spin density wave instability. These data highlight challenges in\nbuilding first-principle theories of high temperature superconductivity but\noffer new insights beyond previous treatments, such as the confirmation of the\nusability of approximate BCS-like $T_{c}$ equations, together with the\nevaluations of the material specific coupling constant $\\lambda $ without\nreliance on tight-binding approximations of their electronic structures.",

Rather than using coefficient fields as direct inputs and\niterating over a learned latent space, we employ thermodynamic encodings --\ndrawn from the constitutive equations -- and iterate over the solution space\nitself. Through an extensive series of case studies, we elucidate the\nadvantages of these design choices in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and\nflexibility. We also analyze the model's stability and extrapolation properties\non out-of-distribution coefficient fields and demonstrate an improved\nspeed-accuracy tradeoff for predicting elastic quantities of interest.",

In this paper, we confront the\ncritical problem of epistemic miscalibration $\\unicode{x2013}$ where a model's\nlinguistic assertiveness fails to reflect its true internal certainty. We\nintroduce a new human-labeled dataset and a novel method for measuring the\nlinguistic assertiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) which cuts error rates\nby over 50% relative to previous benchmarks. Validated across multiple\ndatasets, our method reveals a stark misalignment between how confidently\nmodels linguistically present information and their actual accuracy. Further\nhuman evaluations confirm the severity of this miscalibration. This evidence\nunderscores the urgent risk of the overstated certainty LLMs hold which may\nmislead users on a massive scale.

Experimental findings in terms of the mean square error\n(MSE) results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the performance of\nall state-of-the-art DL-based channel estimators with negligible added\ncomplexity.

In this paper, we adapt the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, a model\nof human communication, to explicitly model a reader's understanding of a\nquery-focused summary and integrate it within the generation method of existing\nQFS systems. In particular, we introduce the answer reconstruction objective\nwhich approximates a reader's understanding of a summary by their ability to\nuse it to reconstruct the answer to their initial query. Using this objective,\nwe are able to re-rank candidate summaries generated by existing QFS systems\nand select summaries that better align with their corresponding query and\nreference summary.

Previous works studying pure electron\nplasmas have shown that strong magnetization significantly inhibits energy\nexchange between parallel and perpendicular directions, leading to a prolonged\ntime for relaxation of a temperature anisotropy. Recent work studying repulsive\nelectron-ion interactions showed that strong magnetization increases both the\nparallel and perpendicular temperature relaxation rates of ions, but in\ndiffering magnitudes, resulting in the formation of temperature anisotropy\nduring equilibration. This previous study treated electrons as a heat bath and\nassumed weak magnetization of ions. Here, we broaden this analysis and compute\nthe full temperature and temperature anisotropy evolution over a broad range of\nmagnetic field strengths. It is found that when electrons are strongly\nmagnetized ($\\beta_e \\gg 1$) and ions are weakly magnetized ($\\beta_i \\ll 1$),\nthe magnetic field strongly suppresses the perpendicular energy exchange rate\nof electrons, whereas the parallel exchange rate slightly increases in\nmagnitude compared to the value at weak magnetization. In contrast, the ion\nperpendicular and parallel energy exchange rates both increase in magnitude\ncompared to the values at weak magnetization. Consequently, equilibration\ncauses the electron parallel temperature to rapidly align with the ion\ntemperature, while the electron perpendicular temperature changes much more\nslowly. It is also shown that when both ions and electrons are strongly\nmagnetized ($\\beta_i, \\beta_e \\gg 1$) the ion-electron perpendicular relaxation\nrate dramatically decreases with magnetization strength as well.",

Recent\nadvances in causal representation learning have shown promise in identifying\ninterpretable latent causal variables with formal theoretical guarantees.\nUnfortunately, most current work on multimodal distributions either relies on\nrestrictive parametric assumptions or yields only coarse identification\nresults, limiting their applicability to biomedical research that favors a\ndetailed understanding of the mechanisms.\n  In this work, we aim to develop flexible identification conditions for\nmultimodal data and principled methods to facilitate the understanding of\nbiomedical datasets.

The performance\nof the proposed design is validated by fabricating GaInP/GaAs/GaInNAsSb\ntriple-junction solar cells employing the grid design with external busbars.\nLight-biased current-voltage and electroluminescence characteristics of the\ncells reveal that an additional contact GaAs etching step prior to front\ncontact metal deposition is needed to ensure good photovoltaic performance with\na fill factor of 85% at one-sun illumination. The improvement is attributed to\nremoving the plasma-damaged material layer that can extend to a depth beyond\n100 nm, leading to resistive losses.",

We present PRISM\n(Privacy-preserving Inter-Site MRI Harmonization), a novel Deep Learning\nframework for harmonizing structural brain MRI across multiple sites while\npreserving data privacy. PRISM employs a dual-branch autoencoder with\ncontrastive learning and variational inference to disentangle anatomical\nfeatures from style and site-specific variations, enabling unpaired image\ntranslation without traveling subjects or multiple MRI modalities. Our modular\ndesign allows harmonization to any target site and seamless integration of new\nsites without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. Using multi-site\nstructural MRI data, we demonstrate PRISM's effectiveness in downstream tasks\nsuch as brain tissue segmentation and validate its harmonization performance\nthrough multiple experiments. Our framework addresses key challenges in medical\nAI/ML, including data privacy, distribution shifts, model generalizability and\ninterpretability.

The research sample was selected using convenience sampling. Data\nwere collected from 226 pre-service teachers in the Bachelor of Education\nElementary Specialty (BEES) using a 28-item questionnaire. The validity of the\nitems was tested by factor analysis using the extraction method of principal\ncomponent analysis with varimax rotation. Reliability tests for the different\nconstructs were conducted by calculating Cronbach's alpha. Frequency, mean,\nstandard deviation and Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze the data. The\nresults revealed that pre-service elementary teachers have generally neutral\nattitudes toward integrated STEM education, and they also showed that\npre-service teachers' attitudes toward integrated STEM education do not depend\non gender or grade level. However, these attitudes are dependent on\npre-university studies.

    "abstract": "Coordination in traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in\nurban networks. Existing pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate\nupstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased\nnetwork delays. However, effective signal control inherently requires\ncoordination across a broader spatial scope, as the effect of upstream traffic\nshould influence signal control decisions at downstream intersections,\nimpacting a large area in the traffic network. Although agent communication\nusing neural network-based feature extraction can implicitly enhance spatial\nawareness, it significantly increases the learning complexity, adding an\nadditional layer of difficulty to the challenging task of control in deep\nreinforcement learning. To address the issue of learning complexity and myopic\ntraffic pressure definition, our work introduces a novel concept based on\nMarkov chain theory, namely \\textit{multi-hop upstream pressure}, which\ngeneralizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond\nthe immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the\ndeep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the multi-hop upstream\nqueues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial\nawareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios\ndemonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly\nreduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a\nbroader understanding of upstream congestion.",

Given\nthis limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant\nself-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware.\nHowever, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of\nrigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for\ndownstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish\nan information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability\nof E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL\nthat creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This\nsynergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve\nits equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring\nsemantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the\ninfluence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical\ndesigns of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods\nbut also sheds light on new directions by exploring the benefits of model\nequivariance.

In this paper, we present CULL-MT, a compression method\nfor machine translation models based on structural layer pruning and selected\nlanguage directions.

The tree edit distance is a well-known\ngeneralization of string edit distance and has been studied since the 1970s.\nYears of steady improvements have led to an $O(n^3)$ algorithm [DMRW 2010].\nFine-grained complexity casts light onto the hardness of TED showing that a\ntruly subcubic time algorithm for TED implies a truly subcubic time algorithm\nfor All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) [BGMW 2020].

The model is based on the insight\nthat the scaled experimental data depend in a universal way on two\ncharacteristic length scales of the system: the microscopic length scale $L_0$\nfrom which the renormalization group flow starts, and the dephasing length,\n$L_{\\varphi}(T)$ as given by the distance travelled by system-specific\nelementary excitations over the Planckian time. Our analysis reveals that the\ndata for all five arrays (both 1D and 2D) can be quantitatively and\nself-consistently explained within the framework of interacting superconducting\nplasmons. In this picture, $L_{\\varphi}=v_p\\hbar/k_B T$, and $L_0 \\approx\n\\Lambda$, where $v_p$ is the speed of the plasmons and $\\Lambda$ is the Coulomb\nscreening length of the Cooper pairs. We also observe that, in 1D arrays, the\ntransition is significantly shifted towards the insulating side compared to the\npredictions of the sine-Gordon model.

    "abstract": "With the advancement of information hiding techniques, generation-based\ncoverless steganography has emerged as an alternative to traditional methods,\nleveraging generative models to transform secret information into stego-objects\nrather than embedding it within the redundancy of the cover. However, existing\ngeneration-based approaches require pseudo-keys that must be shared between\ncommunication parties, leading to high overhead of frequent key exchanges and\nsecurity risks due to their tight coupling with the secret information. This\npaper proposes a DDIM-driven coverless steganography scheme that utilizes a\nreal-key mechanism, improving the key management. By integrating reversible\ndata hiding (RDH) and chaotic encryption into generation model, the proposed\nmethod eliminates excessive key exchanges and reduces the correlation between\nthe key and the secret information. Furthermore, it requires only a single key\nnegotiation for multiple communication, which lowers overhead. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed scheme resists substitution attacks,\nenhancing the security of covert communication.",

    "abstract": "Many quantum algorithms, such as adiabatic algorithms (e.g. AQC) and phase\nrandomisation, require simulating Hamiltonian evolution. In addition, the\nsimulation of physical systems is an important objective in its own right. In\nmany cases, the Hamiltonian is complex at first sight, but can be decomposed as\na linear combination of simple ones; for instance, a sum of local Hamiltonians\nfor Ising models or a sum of time-independent Hamiltonians with time-dependent\ncoefficients (which is typically the case for adiabatic algorithms). In this\npaper we develop a new compiler, similar to the first order randomized Trotter,\nor qDRIFT, but with an arguably simpler framework. It is more versatile as it\nsupports a large class of randomisation schemes and as well as time-dependent\nweights. We first present the model and derive its governing equations. We then\ndefine and analyze the simulation error for a sum of two Hamiltonians, and\ngeneralize it to a sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians. We prove that the number of gates\nnecessary to simulate the weighted sum of $Q$ Hamiltonians of magnitude $C$\nduring a time $T$ with an error less than $\\epsilon_0$ grows as\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(C^2T^2\\epsilon_0^{-1}\\right)$.",

The recent Mamba architecture shows promising results in\nefficiently modeling long and complex sequences, yet two significant challenges\nremain: Firstly, directly applying Mamba to extended motion generation is\nineffective, as the limited capacity of the implicit memory leads to memory\ndecay. Secondly, Mamba struggles with multimodal fusion compared to\nTransformers, and lack alignment with textual queries, often confusing\ndirections (left or right) or omitting parts of longer text queries. To address\nthese challenges, our paper presents three key contributions: Firstly, we\nintroduce KMM, a novel architecture featuring Key frame Masking Modeling,\ndesigned to enhance Mamba's focus on key actions in motion segments. This\napproach addresses the memory decay problem and represents a pioneering method\nin customizing strategic frame-level masking in SSMs. Additionally, we designed\na contrastive learning paradigm for addressing the multimodal fusion problem in\nMamba and improving the motion-text alignment.

In the\nflat-accrual scheme, all members accrue the benefits at the same rate\nirrespective of age. This captures the most significant feature of the Royal\nMail Collective Pension Plan, which is currently the only UK CDC scheme. The\ndynamic-accrual schemes seeks to reduce intergenerational cross-subsidies by\nvarying the rate of benefit-accrual in accordance to the age of members and the\ncurrent funding level.\n  We find that these CDC schemes can often be successful in smoothing pension\noutcomes post-retirement while outperforming a defined contribution scheme\nfollowed by annuity purchase at the point of retirement. However, this\nout-performance is not guaranteed in a flat-accrual scheme and there is little\nsmoothing of projected pension outcomes before retirement.\n  There are significant intergenerational cross-subsidies in the flat-accrual\nscheme. These qualitatively mirror the cross-subsidies seen in existing defined\nbenefit schemes, but we find the magnitude of the cross-subsidies is much\nlarger in flat accrual CDC schemes.\n  The dynamic-accrual scheme design is intended to reduce such cross-subsidies,\nbut we find they still arise due to the approximate pricing methodology used to\ndetermine the benefits accrued by each contribution. Although the\ncross-subsidies tend to cancel out over time, in any given year they can be\nlarge. Thus, the benefits accrued by contributions should be calculated\nrigorously to reduce cross-subsidies.",

    "abstract": "Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and ultrasound imaging (USI) are important\nbiomedical imaging techniques, due to their unique and complementary advantages\nin tissue's structure and function visualization. In this Letter, we proposed a\ncoaxial photoacoustic-ultrasound dual-modal imaging system (coPAUS) with\ndisposable opto-acoustic window. This opto-acoustic window allows part of light\nto go through it, and another part of light to be converted to ultrasound\ntransmission signal by photoacoustic effect. By single laser pulse\nillumination, both PA signals and reflected US signals can be generated. Then,\na linear array probe receives both PA and US signals, enabling simultaneous\ndual-modal PA and US imaging. Ex vivo experiments were conducted involving\npencil lead, hair, and plastic tube with black spot, as well as in vivo\nexperiment on human finger. The system's resolutions for PA and US imaging are\n215 um and 91.125 um, with signal-to-noise ratios for PA and US signals reached\nup to 37.48 dB and 29.75 dB, respectively, proving the feasibility of the\ncoPAUS dual-modal imaging. The proposed coPAUS system with disposable\nopto-acoustic window provides an immediate and cost-effective approach to\nenable US imaging capability based on an existing PA imaging system.",

    "abstract": "We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For\nan eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the\ncharacteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other\nhand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of\neigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter,\nthen the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes\nnondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our\ndynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size\nat $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric\nmultiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits\nrelaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the\ndefectivity of $\\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes\nare realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\\lambda_0$. Here\nthe pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not\nnecessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely\nlarge values. The defective eigenvalue $\\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation\nand the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the\npseudospectrum including $\\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace\nfor $\\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of\nmatrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the\nsystems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the\npresent analysis.",

Considering that the surface of a CAD model can be\neasily decomposed into a collection of surface patches, its 3D medial axis can\nbe extracted by computing the Voronoi diagram of these surface patches, where\neach surface patch serves as a generator. However, no solver currently exists\nfor accurately computing such an extended Voronoi diagram. Under the assumption\nthat each generator defines a linear distance field over a sufficiently small\nrange, our approach operates by tetrahedralizing the region of interest and\ncomputing the medial axis within each tetrahedral element.

Compressing these models not only reduces storage\nrequirements, making deployment to edge devices feasible, but also accelerates\ninference, thereby reducing latency and computational costs. Structured\npruning, which removes filters at the layer level, directly modifies the model\narchitecture. This approach achieves a more compact architecture while\nmaintaining target accuracy, ensuring that the compressed model retains good\ncompatibility and hardware efficiency. Our method is based on a key\nobservation: filters in different layers of a neural network have varying\nimportance to the model's performance. When the number of filters to prune is\nfixed, the optimal pruning distribution across different layers is uneven to\nminimize performance loss. Layers that are more sensitive to pruning should\naccount for a smaller proportion of the pruning distribution.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to train a joint model without\ndisclosing their local data. Instead, they share their local model updates with\na central server that moderates the process and creates a joint model. However,\nFL is susceptible to a series of privacy attacks. Recently, the source\ninference attack (SIA) has been proposed where an honest-but-curious central\nserver tries to identify exactly which client owns a specific data record. n\nthis work, we propose a defense against SIAs by using a trusted shuffler,\nwithout compromising the accuracy of the joint model. We employ a combination\nof unary encoding with shuffling, which can effectively blend all clients'\nmodel updates, preventing the central server from inferring information about\neach client's model update separately. In order to address the increased\ncommunication cost of unary encoding we employ quantization. Our preliminary\nexperiments show promising results; the proposed mechanism notably decreases\nthe accuracy of SIAs without compromising the accuracy of the joint model.",

    "abstract": "We discuss the thermal production of axions in renormalizable models\ninvolving two Higgs doublet fields and a complex singlet field with a global\n$U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, i.e., DFSZ type axion models. We demonstrate\nthat, when the reheating temperature exceeds the mass scale of heavy Higgs\nbosons, axions are efficiently produced through heavy Higgs boson decays and\nscatterings at temperatures comparable to the heavy Higgs boson mass scale. As\na result, the abundance of thermally produced axions is independent of the\nreheating temperature, which should be contrasted with the KSVZ axion model.\nThis is because thermal productions via renormalizable interactions are\nIR-dominated processes. We demonstrate that the heavy Higgs boson decays are\nthe main channels for axion thermal productions among various processes in the\nDFSZ-type axion models, which were missed in the literature. Our results apply\nto the original DFSZ QCD axion model since the production mechanism does not\ndepend on the axion mass. As an application of axion productions from the heavy\nHiggs boson decays, we calculate the contributions to $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ for\naxions with a mass smaller than ${\\cal O}(0.1){\\rm eV}$. Future measurements of\n$\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$ could constrain model parameters in both axion and Higgs\nsectors. Focusing on axions with masses from keV to sub-GeV scale, we then\ndiscuss how cosmological observations such as X-ray and cosmic microwave\nbackground constrain the produced axion. We show that a large portion of the\nparameter space of the models can be explored even if the amount of the axion\nproduced from the heavy Higgs bosons is much smaller than the observed cold\ndark matter abundance.",

The restoration of UHD images\nis a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often\nleads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample\nUHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches\nfor separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant\ninformation loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary\nartifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD\nimage restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution\ninference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing\nthe images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the\ncharacteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of\nfeatures. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also\ndesign a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features.\nAdditionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features\nfrom the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information. Extensive\nexperiments on three UHD image restoration tasks, including low-light image\nenhancement, image dehazing, and image deblurring, show that our model achieves\nbetter quantitative and qualitative results than state-of-the-art methods.",

In this study, a machine learning\nmethod called random forest was used to identify \"high-quality\" nodes.\n\"High-quality\" nodes refer to those with high message delivery success rates\nand optimal paths. The high-quality node data was filtered according to the\nnode report of successful transmission generated by the One simulator. The node\ncontact report generated by another One simulator was used to calculate the\ndata of the three feature vectors required for training the model. The feature\nvectors and the high-quality node data were then fed into the model to train\nthe random forest model, which was then able to identify high-quality nodes.\nThe simulation experiment was carried out in the ONE simulator in the Helsinki\ncity centre, with two categories of weekday and holiday scenarios, each with a\ndifferent number of nodes. Three groups were set up in each category: the\noriginal unmodified group, the group with high-quality nodes, and the group\nwith random nodes. The results show that this method of loading high-quality\nnodes significantly improves the performance of the protocol, increasing the\nsuccess rate of information transmission and reducing latency.

    "abstract": "Recovering impact parameter variations in multi-planet systems is an\neffective approach for detecting non-transiting planets and refining planetary\nmass estimates. Traditionally, two methodologies have been employed: the\nIndividual Fit, which fits each transit independently to analyze impact\nparameter changes, and the Dynamical Fit, which simulates planetary dynamics to\nmatch transit light curves. We introduce a new fitting method, Simultaneous\nImpact Parameter Variation Analysis (SIPVA), which outperforms the Individual\nFit and is computationally more efficient than the Dynamical Fit. SIPVA\ndirectly integrates a linear time-dependent model for impact parameters into\nthe Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm by fitting all transits\nsimultaneously. We evaluate SIPVA and the Individual Fit on artificial systems\nwith varying LLRs and find that SIPVA consistently outperforms the Individual\nFit in recovery rates and accuracy. When applied to selected Kepler planetary\ncandidates exhibiting significant transit duration variations (TDVs), SIPVA\nidentifies significant impact parameter trends in 10 out of 16 planets. In\ncontrast, the Individual Fit does so in only 4. We also employ probabilistic\nmodeling to calculate the theoretical distribution of planets with significant\nimpact parameter variations across all observed Kepler systems and compare the\ndistribution of recovered candidates by the Individual Fit and Dynamical Fit\nfrom previous work with our theoretical distribution. Our findings offer an\nalternative framework for analyzing planetary transits, relying solely on\nBayesian inference without requiring prior assumptions about the planetary\nsystem's dynamical architecture.",

In this work, we explore\nCP violation through flavour-violating di-Higgs couplings, which emerge due to\nthe localization of bulk fermions and the Higgs near the TeV brane. The\nanalysis focuses on the role of these couplings in di-Higgs production and\ndecay processes, leading to enhanced CP-violating effects. Numerical\nsimulations show that the predicted CP-violating observables are within\nexperimental bounds and could be tested in future collider experiments.

However, most methods require the number\nand coordinates of gradient directions during testing and training to remain\nstrictly consistent, significantly limiting the generalization and robustness\nof these models in NODDI parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose a\nq-space sampling augmentation-based continuous representation learning\nframework (SamRobNODDI) to achieve robust and generalized NODDI. Specifically,\na continuous representation learning method based on q-space sampling\naugmentation is introduced to fully explore the information between different\ngradient directions in q-space. Furthermore, we design a sampling consistency\nloss to constrain the outputs of different sampling schemes, ensuring that the\noutputs remain as consistent as possible, thereby further enhancing performance\nand robustness to varying q-space sampling schemes. SamRobNODDI is also a\nflexible framework that can be applied to different backbone networks. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared it with 7\nstate-of-the-art methods across 18 different q-space sampling schemes,\ndemonstrating that the proposed SamRobNODDI has better performance, robustness,\ngeneralization, and flexibility.",

As a result,\nMBs are often the victims of security breaches and cyber-attacks every year, as\ndemonstrated by various studies. This calls for a non-technical, simple\nsolution tailored specifically for MBs. To address this pressing need, the\nSEANCE Cybersecurity Framework was developed through a 7-step methodology: (1)\nA literature review was conducted to explore the current state of research and\navailable frameworks and methodologies, (2) followed by a qualitative survey to\nidentify the cybersecurity challenges faced by MBs.

Nevertheless, a\ngreat limitation of amorphous semiconductors is their low carrier mobilities\nrelative to their monocrystalline counterparts. Based on a recently established\nband fluctuation framework [Y. Luo and A. Flewitt, Phys. Rev. B 109, 104203\n(2024)], this paper shows that the intrinsic carrier mobility of amorphous\nsemiconductors can significantly increase simply through device downscaling,\nwithout any material-level optimizations. Specifically, it is revealed that the\nintrinsic electron mobility of hydrogenated amorphous silicon in a 10-nm long\ngap can increase by around 12 times, and does not compromise device-to-device\nuniformity. This mobility improvement is a result of reduced localized band\ntail states due to the ultra-short gap length relative to the band fluctuation\nlength scale before downscaling; the latter is determined by the short- and\nmedium-range structural order of the amorphous semiconductor.",

This\nresults in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between\nordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For\npartially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its\nsign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba\nstrength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We\nextend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show\nthat they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to\nsimilar results.

    "abstract": "Genetic diversity is central to the process of evolution. Both natural\nselection and random genetic drift are influenced by the level of genetic\ndiversity of a population; selection acts on diversity while drift samples from\nit. At a given locus in a diploid population, each individual carries only two\nalleles, but the population as a whole can possess a much larger number of\nalleles, with the upper limit constrained by twice the population size. This\nallows for many possible types of homozygotes and heterozygotes. Moreover,\nthere are biologically important loci, for example those related to the MHC\ncomplex, the ABO blood types, and cystic fibrosis, that exhibit a large number\nof alleles. Despite this, much of population genetic theory, and data analysis,\nare limited to considering biallelic loci. However, to the present, what is\nlacking is a flexible expression for the force of selection that allows an\narbitrary number of alleles (and hence an arbitrary number of heterozygotes),\nalong with a variety of forms of fitness. In this work, we remedy this absence\nby giving an analytical representation of the force of selection that\nemphasises the very different roles played by the diversity of the population,\nand the fitnesses of different genotypes. The result presented facilitates our\nunderstanding and applies in a variety of different situations involving\nmultiple alleles. This includes situations where fitnesses are: additive,\nmultiplicative, randomly fluctuating, frequency-dependent, and it allows\nfitnesses which involve explicit gene interactions, such as heterozygote\nadvantage.",

For instance, a money laundering transaction might involve an\nabnormal account and the broader community it interacts with. To address this,\nwe present UniGAD, the first unified framework for detecting anomalies at node,\nedge, and graph levels jointly. Specifically, we develop the Maximum Rayleigh\nQuotient Subgraph Sampler (MRQSampler) that unifies multi-level formats by\ntransferring objects at each level into graph-level tasks on subgraphs. We\ntheoretically prove that MRQSampler maximizes the accumulated spectral energy\nof subgraphs (i.e., the Rayleigh quotient) to preserve the most significant\nanomaly information. To further unify multi-level training, we introduce a\nnovel GraphStitch Network to integrate information across different levels,\nadjust the amount of sharing required at each level, and harmonize conflicting\ntraining goals.

Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to\nassess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on\nscenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt\niterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential\nprompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while\nignoring others, facilitating context manipulation. This paper introduces\nSequentialBreak, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits this vulnerability. We\ndiscuss several scenarios, not limited to examples like Question Bank, Dialog\nCompletion, and Game Environment, where the harmful prompt is embedded within\nbenign ones that can fool LLMs into generating harmful responses. The distinct\nnarrative structures of these scenarios show that SequentialBreak is flexible\nenough to adapt to various prompt formats beyond those discussed. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SequentialBreak uses only a single query to\nachieve a substantial gain of attack success rate over existing baselines\nagainst both open-source and closed-source models. Through our research, we\nhighlight the urgent need for more robust and resilient safeguards to enhance\nLLM security and prevent potential misuse.

Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is\na popular choice of algorithm, but prior explanations, attributing its effects\nsolely to dampened toxic neurons in the MLP layers, are incomplete. In this\nstudy, we analyse four language models (Llama-3.1-8B, Gemma-2-2B, Mistral-7B,\nGPT-2-Medium) and show that toxic neurons only account for 2.5% to 24% of DPO's\neffects across models. Instead, DPO balances distributed activation shifts\nacross all MLP neurons to create a net toxicity reduction. We attribute this\nreduction to four neuron groups, two aligned with reducing toxicity and two\npromoting anti-toxicity, whose combined effects replicate DPO across models. To\nfurther validate this understanding, we develop an activation editing method\nmimicking DPO through distributed shifts along a toxicity representation. This\nmethod outperforms DPO in reducing toxicity while preserving perplexity,\nwithout requiring any weight updates.

For this purpose, the MOCCA code has been\nsignificantly extended to take into account the formation of an enriched\npopulation of stars from re-accreted gas with a time delay after the formation\nof the pristine population of stars. The possibility of cluster migration in\nthe host galaxy and the fact that the pristine population can be described by a\nmodel not in virial equilibrium are also taken into account. Gas re-accretion\nand cluster migration have a decisive impact on the observational parameters of\nclusters and the ratio of the number of objects between the pristine and\nenriched populations. The obtained results, together with observational data,\nsuggest a speculative refinement of the AGB scenario that makes it possible to\nexplain some observational data, such as the ratio of the pristine to the\nenriched populations, the observational fact that for some GCs the pristine\npopulation is more concentrated than the enriched one, and possibly a\ncorrelation between the ratio of the number of enriched stars to the total\nnumber of stars and the mass of the cluster. In this scenario, it is important\nto take into account the environment in which the cluster lives, the conditions\nin the galaxy when it formed, and the fact that a significant part of the GCs\nassociated with the Galaxy come from dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky\nWay. The initial conditions of GCs in our simulations differ from the widely\nused typical models, as they require GCs to fill the Roche lobe rather than\nbeing highly concentrated within it, imposing strong constraints on their\nformation locations within the galaxy.",

HidePrint hides the transmitter's fingerprint\nagainst an illegitimate eavesdropper by injecting controlled noise in the\ntransmitted signal. We evaluate our solution against state-of-the-art\nimage-based RFF techniques considering different adversarial models, different\ncommunication links (wired and wireless), and different configurations. Our\nresults show that the injection of a Gaussian noise pattern with a standard\ndeviation of (at least) 0.02 prevents device fingerprinting in all the\nconsidered scenarios, thus making the performance of the identification process\nindistinguishable from the random guess while affecting the Signal-to-Noise\nRatio (SNR) of the received signal by only 0.1 dB. Moreover, we introduce\nselective radio fingerprint disclosure, a new technique that allows the\ntransmitter to disclose the radio fingerprint to only a subset of intended\nreceivers.

    "abstract": "Cavities exhibit inherent self-sustaining oscillations driven by the coupling\nbetween their hydrodynamic and acoustic properties. In practical applications,\ncavities are often placed within confinements that introduce compression waves,\nsignificantly influencing their primary flow characteristics. The oscillations\nin cavities have widespread applications, such as in fuel-air mixing, heat\nexchangers, and landing gears However, when resonance occurs, these\noscillations can lead to structural failures. Therefore, understanding cavity\noscillations under diverse geometrical configurations and flow conditions is\nessential. The present study examines the impact of top wall confinement on an\nopen cavity with a length-to-depth ratio (L/D) ratio of 3 at Mach 1.71, along\nwith the effects of varying deflection angles on flow characteristics and the\ninfluence of an increased Mach number on configurations with the highest and\nlowest oscillation frequencies. A three-dimensional numerical investigation is\ncarried out, employing large eddy simulations within the OpenFOAM framework. We\nanalyze the flow fields through the spatial variation of density over time.\nFast Fourier Transformation and Wavelet Transformation reveal the frequency\ncontent from unsteady pressure signals and illustrate its evolution over time\nunder different conditions. Additionally, reduced-order modeling provides a\nbetter understanding of the relationship between frequencies and flow\nstructures of the cavity. Results from these analyses demonstrate that top wall\nconfinement increases oscillation frequency, while greater deflection angles\nintroduce Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the flow field, reducing the\nfrequency. An increase in the Mach number to 2, further intensifies\ninstability, substantially affecting oscillations.",

Copyright\nmay be transferred without notice, after which this version may no longer be\naccessible.\" Driver's interaction with a vehicle via automatic gesture\nrecognition is expected to enhance driving safety by decreasing driver's\ndistraction. Optical and infrared-based gesture recognition systems are limited\nby occlusions, poor lighting, and varying thermal conditions and, therefore,\nhave limited performance in practical in-cabin applications. Radars are\ninsensitive to lighting or thermal conditions and, therefore, are more suitable\nfor in-cabin applications. However, the spatial resolution of conventional\nradars is insufficient for accurate gesture recognition. The main objective of\nthis research is to derive an accurate gesture recognition approach using\nlow-resolution radars with deep learning-based super-resolution processing. The\nmain idea is to reconstruct high-resolution information from the radar's\nlow-resolution measurements. The major challenge is the derivation of the\nreal-time processing approach. The proposed approach combines conventional\nsignal processing and deep learning methods. The radar echoes are arranged in\n3D data cubes and processed using a super-resolution model to enhance range and\nDoppler resolution. The FFT is used to generate the range-Doppler maps, which\nenter the deep neural network for efficient gesture recognition.

    "abstract": "Sound event localization and detection (SELD) has seen substantial\nadvancements through learning-based methods. These systems, typically trained\nfrom scratch on specific datasets, have shown considerable generalization\ncapabilities. Recently, deep neural networks trained on large-scale datasets\nhave achieved remarkable success in the sound event classification (SEC) field,\nprompting an open question of whether these advances can be extended to the\ndevelopment of SELD foundation models. In this paper, leveraging the power of\npre-trained SEC models, we propose pre-trained SELD networks (PSELDNets) on a\nlarge-scale synthetic dataset. The synthetic dataset, generated by convolving\nsound events with simulated spatial room impulse responses (SRIRs), contains\n1,167 hours of audio clips with an ontology of 170 sound classes. These\nPSELDNets are applied to various SELD scenarios. When we adapt PSELDNets to\nspecific scenarios, particularly in cases of low-resource data, we introduce a\ndata-efficient fine-tuning method, AdapterBit. PSELDNets are evaluated on\nsynthetic-test-set using collected SRIRs from the TAU Spatial Room Impulse\nResponse Database (TAU-SRIR DB) and achieve satisfactory performance. We also\ncarried out experiments to validate the transferability of PSELDNets to three\npublicly available datasets and our own real-world recordings. The results\ndemonstrate that PSELDNets surpass state-of-the-art systems across all publicly\navailable datasets. Given the need for direction-of-arrival estimation, SELD\ngenerally relies on sufficient multi-channel audio clips. However,\nincorporating the AdapterBit, PSELDNets show more efficient adaptability to\nvarious scenarios using minimal multi-channel or even just monophonic audio\nclips, outperforming traditional fine-tuning approaches.",

On the one hand, \"relation\ndiscovery\" is a pivotal part when leveraging the price information of other\nstocks to achieve accurate stock movement prediction. Given that stock\nrelations are often unidirectional, such as the \"supplier-consumer\"\nrelationship, causal relations are more appropriate to capture the impact\nbetween stocks. On the other hand, there is substantial noise existing in the\nnews data leading to extracting effective information with difficulty. With\nthese two issues in mind, we propose a novel framework called CausalStock for\nnews-driven multi-stock movement prediction, which discovers the temporal\ncausal relations between stocks. We design a lag-dependent temporal causal\ndiscovery mechanism to model the temporal causal graph distribution. Then a\nFunctional Causal Model is employed to encapsulate the discovered causal\nrelations and predict the stock movements. Additionally, we propose a Denoised\nNews Encoder by taking advantage of the excellent text evaluation ability of\nlarge language models (LLMs) to extract useful information from massive news\ndata. The experiment results show that CausalStock outperforms the strong\nbaselines for both news-driven multi-stock movement prediction and multi-stock\nmovement prediction tasks on six real-world datasets collected from the US,\nChina, Japan, and UK markets.

While CFLs lack the expressiveness needed\nfor high precision, common formalisms for context-sensitive languages are such\nthat the corresponding reachability problem is undecidable. Are there useful\ncontext-sensitive language-reachability models for static analysis?\n  In this paper, we introduce Multiple Context-Free Language (MCFL)\nreachability as an expressive yet tractable model for static program analysis.\nMCFLs form an infinite hierarchy of mildly context sensitive languages\nparameterized by a dimension $d$ and a rank $r$. We show the utility of MCFL\nreachability by developing a family of MCFLs that approximate interleaved Dyck\nreachability, a common but undecidable static analysis problem.\n  We show that MCFL reachability be computed in $O(n^{2d+1})$ time on a graph\nof $n$ nodes when $r=1$, and $O(n^{d(r+1)})$ time when $r>1$. Moreover, we show\nthat when $r=1$, the membership problem has a lower bound of $n^{2d}$ based on\nthe Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, while reachability for $d=1$ has a\nlower bound of $n^{3}$ based on the combinatorial Boolean Matrix Multiplication\nHypothesis. Thus, for $r=1$, our algorithm is optimal within a factor $n$ for\nall levels of the hierarchy based on $d$.\n  We implement our MCFL reachability algorithm and evaluate it by\nunderapproximating interleaved Dyck reachability for a standard taint analysis\nfor Android. Used alongside existing overapproximate methods, MCFL reachability\ndiscovers all tainted information on 8 out of 11 benchmarks, and confirms\n$94.3\\%$ of the reachable pairs reported by the overapproximation on the\nremaining 3.

By partitioning the\nLIS based on the transition matrix's block structure, it turns out that the\nstability of the subsystem is independent of the global LIS if the decoupling\nvariable is selected as the number of out-neighbors. Additionally, it is\nrevealed that any LIS can be equivalently represented by a Markov system. Based\non this insight, we show that the stability decoupling above can also be\nachieved if the decoupling variable equals the number of in-neighbors. Then,\nthe distributed estimator is proved to be stable if the DMRE remains uniformly\nbounded. When the LIS is considered time-invariant, and by analyzing the\nspectral radius of a linear operator, it is proved that the DMRE is uniformly\nbounded if and only if a linear matrix inequality is feasible. Based on the\nboundedness result, we also show that the distributed estimator converges to a\nunique steady state for any initial condition.

Extensive research has focused on developing stealthy\nbackdoor attacks to evade detection and defense mechanisms. However, these\napproaches still have limitations that leave the door open for detection and\nmitigation due to their inherent design to cause malicious behavior in the\npresence of a trigger. To address this limitation, we introduce Deferred\nActivated Backdoor Functionality (DABF), a new paradigm in backdoor attacks.\nUnlike conventional attacks, DABF initially conceals its backdoor, producing\nbenign outputs even when triggered. This stealthy behavior allows DABF to\nbypass multiple detection and defense methods, remaining undetected during\ninitial inspections. The backdoor functionality is strategically activated only\nafter the model undergoes subsequent updates, such as retraining on benign\ndata. DABF attacks exploit the common practice in the life cycle of machine\nlearning models to perform model updates and fine-tuning after initial\ndeployment. To implement DABF attacks, we approach the problem by making the\nunlearning of the backdoor fragile, allowing it to be easily cancelled and\nsubsequently reactivate the backdoor functionality. To achieve this, we propose\na novel two-stage training scheme, called DeferBad. Our extensive experiments\nacross various fine-tuning scenarios, backdoor attack types, datasets, and\nmodel architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and stealthiness of DeferBad.",

We release reduced NIRCam mosaics (F090W, F115W, F150W,\nF200W, F356W, F444W), photometric source catalogs, as well as preliminary WFSS\nspectra (in F322W2 and F444W) for the subset of bright sources (F356W$<$21 mag\nor F444W$<$21 mag). These observations fully cover the NEXUS-Deep area, and\nanchor the long-term baseline of the program. These data will be used for\ninitial target selection for the NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy starting from June\n2025. The NIRCam imaging reaches depths of 27.4--28.2 (AB) mags in\nF090W--F444W. Upcoming NEXUS-Wide epochs will expand the area to the full $\\sim\n400\\,{\\rm arcmin^2}$, and improve the NIRCam exposure depths in the Wide tier\nby a factor of three. In addition, this central region will be repeatedly\ncovered by the NEXUS-Deep observations (NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec/MSA PRISM\nspectroscopy) over 18 epochs with a $\\sim 2$-month cadence.

These sketches are space-efficient, typically requiring only\nlogarithmic storage in the input size, and enable approximation of cardinality\n(or the number of nonzero entries). A crucial property in applications is\n\\emph{composability}, meaning that the sketch of a union of sets can be\ncomputed from individual sketches. Existing designs provide strong statistical\nguarantees, ensuring that a randomly sampled sketching map remains robust for\nan exponential number of queries in terms of the sketch size $k$. However,\nthese guarantees degrade to quadratic in $k$ when queries are \\emph{adaptive},\nmeaning they depend on previous responses.\n  Prior works on statistical queries (Steinke and Ullman, 2015) and specific\nMinHash cardinality sketches (Ahmadian and Cohen, 2024) established that this\nis tight in that they can be compromised using a quadratic number of adaptive\nqueries. In this work, we develop a universal attack framework that applies to\nbroad classes of cardinality sketches. We show that any union-composable\nsketching map can be compromised with $\\tilde{O}(k^4)$ adaptive queries and\nthis improves to a tight bound of $\\tilde{O}(k^2)$ for monotone maps (including\nMinHash, statistical queries, and Boolean linear maps).

To address\nthese challenges, we conducted a trace-based experimental analysis and made\ninsightful observations, leading to the design of a system called EconoServe.\nEconoServe maximizes multi-resource utilization while ensuring service-level\nobjective (SLO) guarantees in LLM serving. To enable adding prompts to a batch\nto maximize GPU utilization in each iteration, EconoServe maintains separate\nwaiting queues for prompt processing tasks (PTs) and generation tasks (GTs). It\nbatches GTs with the same predicted response lengths (RL) to save scheduling\ntime and allocates KVC space for the predicted RL to avoid KVC allocation\nfailures. It further has a novel KVC pipelining method, allowing sharing\nallocated but unused KVC space to enhance KVC utilization. In addition, it\nprioritizes queued requests that occupy more KVC to release KVC earlier and\nsatisfy request service-level-objective (SLO).

    "abstract": "Scattering imaging is often hindered by extremely low signal-to-noise ratios\n(SNRs) due to the prevalence of scattering noise. Light field imaging has been\nshown to be effective in suppressing noise and collect more ballistic photons\nas signals. However, to overcome the SNR limit in super-strong scattering\nenvironments, even with light field framework, only rare ballistic signals are\ninsufficient. Inspired by radiative transfer theory, we propose a diffuse light\nfield imaging model (DLIM) that leverages light field imaging to retrieve\nforward-scattered photons as signals to overcome the challenges of low-SNR\nimaging caused by super-strong scattering environments. This model aims to\nrecover the ballistic photon signal as a source term from forward-scattered\nphotons based on diffusion equations. The DLIM consists of two main processes:\nradiance modeling and diffusion light-field approximation. Radiate modeling\nanalyzes the radiance distribution in scattering light field images using a\nproposed three-plane parameterization, which solves a 4-D radiate kernel\ndescribing the impulse function of scattering light field. Then, the scattering\nlight field images synthesize a diffuse source satisfying the diffusion\nequation governing forward scattering photons, solved under Neumann boundary\nconditions in imaging space. This is the first physically-aware scattering\nlight field imaging model, extending the conventional light field imaging\nframework from free space into diffuse space. The extensive experiments confirm\nthat the DLIM can reconstruct the target objects even when scattering light\nfield images are reduced as random noise at extremely low SNRs.",

The main contributions\ninclude introducing a normalization scheme using mean latent representations to\nhandle statistical heterogeneity in FL, demonstrating the seamless integration\nwith existing FL algorithms to improve performance in non-IID settings, and\nvalidating the approach through extensive experiments on diverse datasets.\nResults show significant improvements in model accuracy and consistency across\nskewed distributions.

The results demonstrate that the OCA achieves faster convergence\ncompared to the L-M algorithm. Moreover, the incorporation of a bisection-based\nupdate procedure significantly enhances the OCA's performance, particularly in\npoorly initialized datasets. These findings indicate that the OCA can\nsubstantially improve the efficiency of 3D reconstructions in cryo-electron\ntomography.",

    "abstract": "Ghost imaging (GI) is an unconventional technique that combines information\nfrom two correlated patterned light fields to compute an image of the object of\ninterest. GI can be performed with visible light as well as penetrating\nradiation such as x-rays, electrons, etc. Penetrating radiation is usually\nionizing and damages biological specimens; therefore, minimising the dose of\nthis radiation in a medical or biological imaging context is important. GI has\nbeen proposed as a potential way to achieve this. With prior knowledge of the\nobject of interest, such as sparsity in a specific basis (e.g., Fourier basis)\nor access to a large dataset for neural network training, it is possible to\nreconstruct an image of the object with a limited number of measurements.\nHowever, low sampling does not inherently equate to low dose. Here, we\nspecifically explore the scenario where reduced sampling corresponds to\nlow-dose conditions. In this simulation-based paper, we examine how deep\nlearning (DL) techniques could reduce dose in classical x-ray GI. Since GI is\nbased on illumination patterns, we start by exploring optimal sets of patterns\nthat allow us to reconstruct the image with the fewest measurements, or lowest\nsampling rate, possible. We then propose a DL neural network that can directly\nreconstruct images from GI measurements even when the sampling rate is\nextremely low. We demonstrate that our deep learning-based GI (DLGI) approach\nhas potential in image reconstruction, with results comparable to direct\nimaging (DI) at the same dose. However, given the same prior knowledge and\ndetector quantum efficiency, it is very challenging for DLGI to outperform DI\nunder low-dose conditions. We discuss how it may be achievable due to the\nhigher sensitivity of bucket detectors over pixel detectors.",

    "abstract": "Conventional computer vision models rely on very deep, feedforward networks\nprocessing whole images and trained offline with extensive labeled data. In\ncontrast, biological vision relies on comparatively shallow, recurrent networks\nthat analyze sequences of fixated image patches, learning continuously in\nreal-time without explicit supervision. This work introduces a vision network\ninspired by these biological principles. Specifically, it leverages a joint\nembedding predictive architecture incorporating recurrent gated circuits. The\nnetwork learns by predicting the representation of the next image patch\n(fixation) based on the sequence of past fixations, a form of self-supervised\nlearning. We show mathematical and empirically that the training algorithm\navoids the problem of representational collapse. We also introduce\n\\emph{Recurrent-Forward Propagation}, a learning algorithm that avoids\nbiologically unrealistic backpropagation through time or memory-inefficient\nreal-time recurrent learning. We show mathematically that the algorithm\nimplements exact gradient descent for a large class of recurrent architectures,\nand confirm empirically that it learns efficiently. This paper focuses on these\ntheoretical innovations and leaves empirical evaluation of performance in\ndownstream tasks, and analysis of representational similarity with biological\nvision for future work.",

However,\nunlike Tarjanian's Nullstellensatz, Laksov's Nullstellensatz is not very\nexplicit. Later, Laksov and Westin in 1990 proposed a strengthening to Laksov's\nNullstellensatz in the form of four conjectures.\n  A projective analogue of Nullstellensatz of the classical Nullstellensatz of\nHilbert is well-known for projective varieties over algebraically closed\nfields.

This stems from the small switching window of FiM and the\ndynamic resistance variation during the magnetization switching. We find the\nresulting current variation can be suppressed by reducing the magnetoresistance\nratio. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the switching window can be expanded by\nadjusting the amount of Gd in FiM. We predict that the polarity of both\nswitching current (Jc,switch) and oscillation current (Jc,osc) reverses at the\nangular momentum compensation point but not the magnetization compensation\npoint. This anomalous dynamic behavior is attributed to the different physical\nnature of magnetization switching and oscillation in FiM, which must be\nconsidered when designing FiM-based MRAM.",

This impact map\ncaptures the velocity jump assuming an instantaneous contact transition between\nrigid objects, neglecting the nearly instantaneous contact transition and\nimpact-induced vibrations. Feedback control, which is required for complex\nimpact scenarios, will affect velocity signals when these vibrations are still\nactive, making an evaluation solely based on velocity signals as in previous\nworks unreliable.

Based on the key idea that\nselecting the correct rigid impact map in this reference spreading framework\nwill minimize the net feedback signal, the rigid impact map is experimentally\ndetermined and compared with the impact map obtained from simulation, resulting\nin a 3.1% average error between the post-impact velocity identified from\nsimulations and from experiments.",
