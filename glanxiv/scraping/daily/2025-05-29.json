    "abstract": "The ESP32-CAM is one of the most widely adopted open-source modules for\nprototyping embedded vision applications. Since its release in 2019, it has\ngained popularity among both hobbyists and professional developers due to its\naffordability, versatility, and integrated wireless capabilities. Despite its\nwidespread use, comprehensive documentation of the performance metrics remains\nlimited. This study addresses this gap by collecting and analyzing over six\nhours of real-time video streaming logs across all supported resolutions of the\nOV2640 image sensor, tested under five distinct voltage conditions via an\nHTTP-based WiFi connection. A long standing bug in the official Arduino ESP32\ndriver, responsible for inaccurate frame rate logging, was fixed. The resulting\nanalysis includes key performance metrics such as instantaneous and average\nframe rate, total streamed data, transmission count, and internal chip\ntemperature. The influence of varying power levels was evaluated to assess the\nreliability of the module.",

The severe class imbalance between failing\nand passing test cases have hindered the FL effectiveness.\n  To address this issue, we propose PCD-DAug: a Principal Context-aware\nDiffusion guided Data Augmentation approach that generate synthesized failing\ntest cases for improving FL. PCD-DAug first combines program slicing with\nprincipal component analysis to construct a principal context that shows how a\nset of statements influences the faulty output via statistical program\ndependencies. Then, PCD-DAug devises a conditional diffusion model to learn\nfrom principle contexts for generating synthesized failing test cases and\nacquiring a class balanced dataset for FL. We conducted large-scale experiments\non six state-of-the-art FL approaches and compare PCD-DAug with six data\naugmentation baselines.

It\nis used to collect data for the evaluation of how built environments impact\nhuman behavior, health, mobility, and overall urban functionality.\nTraditionally, built environment audits were conducted using field surveys and\nmanual observations, which were time-consuming and costly. The emerging street\nview imagery, e.g., Google Street View, has become a widely used data source\nfor conducting built environment audits remotely. Deep learning and computer\nvision techniques can extract and classify objects from street images to\nenhance auditing productivity. Before meaningful analysis, the detected objects\nneed to be geospatially mapped for accurate documentation. However, the mapping\nmethods and tools based on street images are underexplored, and there are no\nuniversal frameworks or solutions yet, imposing difficulties in auditing the\nstreet objects. In this study, we introduced an open source street view mapping\nframework, providing three pipelines to map and measure: 1) width measurement\nfor ground objects, such as roads; 2) 3D localization for objects with a known\ndimension (e.g., doors and stop signs); and 3) diameter measurements (e.g.,\nstreet trees). These pipelines can help researchers, urban planners, and other\nprofessionals automatically measure and map target objects, promoting built\nenvironment auditing productivity and accuracy.

Finally, we\nextend to explore a unified agentic framework that integrates re-ranking and\ngeneration through self-reflection, enabling LVLMs to select relevant evidence\nand suppress irrelevant context dynamically.

    "abstract": "The deployment of robot controllers is hindered by modeling discrepancies due\nto necessary simplifications for computational tractability or inaccuracies in\ndata-generating simulators. Such discrepancies typically require ad-hoc tuning\nto meet the desired performance, thereby ensuring successful transfer to a\ntarget domain. We propose a framework for automated, gradient-based tuning to\nenhance performance in the deployment domain by leveraging differentiable\nsimulators. Our method collects rollouts in an iterative manner to co-tune the\nsimulator and controller parameters, enabling systematic transfer within a few\ntrials in the deployment domain. Specifically, we formulate multi-step\nobjectives for tuning and employ alternating optimization to effectively adapt\nthe controller to the deployment domain. The scalability of our framework is\ndemonstrated by co-tuning model-based and learning-based controllers of\narbitrary complexity for tasks ranging from low-dimensional cart-pole\nstabilization to high-dimensional quadruped and biped tracking, showing\nperformance improvements across different deployment domains.",

In recent years, the rapid development of\nlarge language models (LLMs) tailored for TCM has underscored the need for an\nobjective and comprehensive evaluation framework to assess their performance on\nreal-world tasks. However, existing evaluation datasets are limited in scope\nand primarily text-based, lacking a unified and standardized multimodal\nquestion-answering (QA) benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce\nTCM-Ladder, the first multimodal QA dataset specifically designed for\nevaluating large TCM language models. The dataset spans multiple core\ndisciplines of TCM, including fundamental theory, diagnostics, herbal formulas,\ninternal medicine, surgery, pharmacognosy, and pediatrics. In addition to\ntextual content, TCM-Ladder incorporates various modalities such as images and\nvideos. The datasets were constructed using a combination of automated and\nmanual filtering processes and comprise 52,000+ questions in total. These\nquestions include single-choice, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, diagnostic\ndialogue, and visual comprehension tasks. We trained a reasoning model on\nTCM-Ladder and conducted comparative experiments against 9 state-of-the-art\ngeneral domain and 5 leading TCM-specific LLMs to evaluate their performance on\nthe datasets. Moreover, we propose Ladder-Score, an evaluation method\nspecifically designed for TCM question answering that effectively assesses\nanswer quality regarding terminology usage and semantic expression. To our\nknowledge, this is the first work to evaluate mainstream general domain and\nTCM-specific LLMs on a unified multimodal benchmark.

This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the\nwall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers\nand preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding\nthe use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human\nexperimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$\nwere investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the\npolar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse\nForce Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall\ndisplacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local\nferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration. For example, twin boundaries in\npolydomains regions like a$_1^-$/$c^+$ $\\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stay pinned up\nto a certain level of bias magnitude and change only marginally as the bias\nincreases from 20V to 30V, whereas single variant boundaries like a$_2^+$/$c^+$\n$\\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stack are already activated at 20V. These statistics\non the possible ferroelectric and ferroelastic wall orientations, together with\nthe automated, high-throughput AFM workflow, can be distilled into a predictive\nmap that links domain configurations to pulse parameters. This\nmicrostructure-specific rule set forms the foundation for designing\nferroelectric memories.",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents frequently suffer from neuronal\nactivity loss, which impairs their ability to adapt to new data and learn\ncontinually. A common method to quantify and address this issue is the\ntau-dormant neuron ratio, which uses activation statistics to measure the\nexpressive ability of neurons. While effective for simple MLP-based agents,\nthis approach loses statistical power in more complex architectures. To address\nthis, we argue that in advanced RL agents, maintaining a neuron's learning\ncapacity, its ability to adapt via gradient updates, is more critical than\npreserving its expressive ability. Based on this insight, we shift the\nstatistical objective from activations to gradients, and introduce GraMa\n(Gradient Magnitude Neural Activity Metric), a lightweight,\narchitecture-agnostic metric for quantifying neuron-level learning capacity. We\nshow that GraMa effectively reveals persistent neuron inactivity across diverse\narchitectures, including residual networks, diffusion models, and agents with\nvaried activation functions. Moreover, resetting neurons guided by GraMa\n(ReGraMa) consistently improves learning performance across multiple deep RL\nalgorithms and benchmarks, such as MuJoCo and the DeepMind Control Suite.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a hypothetical model for the dual role of respiratory\naerosols and inflammatory exudates in the dynamics and progression of\nSARS-CoV-2 lung infection. Starting from a new paradigm in infectious disease\ntransmission, we reflect on the often-overlooked role of physical transmission\nmedia within the host individual. The hypothesis posits that tiny aerosols\n(including those inhaled externally and those self-generated and re-inhaled by\nthe host) play a crucial role in the initial seeding and early expansion of the\ninfection in the lungs, explaining the multifocal characteristics observed in\nearly CT imaging. As the infection progresses, inflammatory exudates, formed\ndue to lung inflammation, become a new efficient vehicle, driving the\nlarge-scale spread of the virus within the lungs and accounting for the\ndevelopment of diffuse lesions. This model reveals a \"dynamic equilibrium\npoint\" where the dominant mechanism shifts from aerosol-mediated to\nexudate-mediated spread. Although direct validation of this hypothesis faces\nethical and technical challenges, existing clinical imaging, viral kinetics,\nand epidemiological patterns provide indirect support. The paper also\nconceptualizes ideal experimental designs and retrospective analyses to\nvalidate the hypothesis. Finally, we discuss the implications of this\nhypothesis for public health practice, emphasizing the importance of improving\nventilation in the microenvironment of infected individuals to achieve a \"for\nall, by all\" (literally \"everyone for me, I for everyone\") bidirectional\nprotection.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great ability for node classification\non graphs. However, the success of GNNs relies on abundant labeled data, while\nobtaining high-quality labels is costly and challenging, especially for newly\nemerging domains. Hence, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which trains a\nclassifier on the labeled source graph and adapts it to the unlabeled target\ngraph, is attracting increasing attention. Various approaches have been\nproposed to alleviate the distribution shift between the source and target\ngraphs to facilitate the classifier adaptation. However, most of them simply\nadopt existing UDA techniques developed for independent and identically\ndistributed data to gain domain-invariant node embeddings for graphs, which do\nnot fully consider the graph structure and message-passing mechanism of GNNs\nduring the adaptation and will fail when label distribution shift exists among\ndomains. In this paper, we proposed a novel framework that adopts link\nprediction to connect nodes between source and target graphs, which can\nfacilitate message-passing between the source and target graphs and augment the\ntarget nodes to have ``in-distribution'' neighborhoods with the source domain.\nThis strategy modified the target graph on the input level to reduce its\ndeviation from the source domain in the embedding space and is insensitive to\ndisproportional label distributions across domains. To prevent the loss of\ndiscriminative information in the target graph, we further design a novel\nidentity-preserving learning objective, which guides the learning of the edge\ninsertion module together with reconstruction and adaptation losses.\nExperimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour framework.",

However, its high\nefficiency stems from an approximation of projecting 3D Gaussians onto the\nimage plane as 2D Gaussians, which inherently limits rendering\nquality--particularly under large Field-of-View (FoV) camera inputs. While\nseveral recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors,\nnone have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency\nsimultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient\nVolumetric Gaussian Rendering method. Starting from first principles, we derive\na closed-form expression for the density integral along a ray traversing a 3D\nGaussian distribution. This formulation enables precise forward rendering with\narbitrary camera models and supports gradient-based optimization of 3D Gaussian\nparameters. To ensure both exactness and real-time performance, we propose an\nefficient method for computing a tight Particle Bounding Frustum (PBF) for each\n3D Gaussian, enabling accurate and efficient ray-Gaussian association. We also\nintroduce a novel Bipolar Equiangular Projection (BEAP) representation to\naccelerate ray association under generic camera models. BEAP further provides a\nmore uniform ray sampling strategy to apply supervision, which empirically\nimproves reconstruction quality.

A defining beyond-5G capability is network slicing. 3GPP specifies\nthree core slice categories, massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC),\nenhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications\n(URLLC), while ETSI's Zero-Touch Network and Service Management (ZSM) targets\nhuman-less operation. Yet existing documents do not spell out end-to-end (E2E)\nmanagement spanning multiple domains and subnet instances. We introduce the\nNetwork Slice-as-a-Service Platform (NASP), designed to work across 3GPP and\nnon-3GPP networks. NASP (i) translates business-level slice requests into\nconcrete physical instances and inter-domain interfaces, (ii) employs a\nhierarchical orchestrator that aligns distributed management functions, and\n(iii) exposes clean south-bound APIs toward domain controllers. A prototype was\nbuilt by unifying guidance from 3GPP, ETSI, and O-RAN, identifying overlaps and\ngaps among them. We tested NASP with two exemplary deployments, 3GPP and\nnon-3GPP, over four scenarios: mMTC, URLLC, 3GPP-Shared, and non-3GPP. The\nCommunication Service Management Function handled all requests, underlining the\nplatform's versatility. Measurements show that core-network configuration\ndominates slice-creation time (68 %), and session setup in the URLLC slice is\n93 % faster than in the Shared slice. Cost analysis for orchestrating five\nversus ten concurrent slices reveals a 112 % delta between edge and centralized\ndeployments.

Existing mitigation approaches typically depend on external\nannotations of spurious correlations, which may be difficult to obtain and are\nnot relevant to the spurious bias in a model. In this paper, we take a step\ntowards self-guided mitigation of spurious bias by proposing NeuronTune, a post\nhoc method that directly intervenes in a model's internal decision process. Our\nmethod probes in a model's latent embedding space to identify and regulate\nneurons that lead to spurious prediction behaviors. We theoretically justify\nour approach and show that it brings the model closer to an unbiased one.\nUnlike previous methods, NeuronTune operates without requiring spurious\ncorrelation annotations, making it a practical and effective tool for improving\nmodel robustness.

Establishing consistent methodological foundations for engineering\nsystems remains a challenge -- one that both systems engineering and network\nscience have sought to address. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has\nrecently emerged as a practical, interdisciplinary approach for developing\ncomplex systems from concept through implementation. In contrast, network\nscience focuses on the quantitative analysis of networks present within\nengineering systems. This paper introduces hetero-functional graph theory\n(HFGT) as a conceptual bridge between these two fields, serving as a tutorial\nfor both communities. For systems engineers, HFGT preserves the heterogeneity\nof conceptual and ontological constructs in MBSE, including system form,\nfunction, and concept. For network scientists, it provides multiple graph-based\ndata structures enabling matrix-based quantitative analysis. The modeling\nprocess begins with ontological foundations, defining an engineering system as\nan abstraction and representing it with a model. Model fidelity is assessed\nusing four linguistic properties: soundness, completeness, lucidity, and\nlaconicity. A meta-architecture is introduced to manage the convergence\nchallenges between domain-specific reference architectures and case-specific\ninstantiations. Unlike other meta-architectures, HFGT is rooted in linguistic\nstructures, modeling resources as subjects, system processes as predicates, and\noperands-such as matter, energy, organisms, information, and money-as objects.\nThese elements are integrated within a system meta-architecture expressed in\nthe Systems Modeling Language (SysML).

To model the relevant dynamics leading to the emergence of such\ndiverse domain structures, simplified descriptions of the switching behavior of\nindividual nanomagnets are necessary. In this work, we employ kinetic Monte\nCarlo simulations of the demagnetization of square artificial spin ice toward\nits ground state, and compare how the choice of transition barriers affect the\nemergence of mesoscale domains. We find that the commonly used mean-field\nbarrier model (informed by equilibrium energetics only) results in propagation\nof ground-state string avalanches. In contrast, taking into account chiral\nbarrier splitting enabled by state-dependent local torques supports the\nemergence of complex-shaped coral domains and their successful relaxation\ntowards the ground state in later relaxation stages. Our results highlight that\nintrinsic contributions to switching barriers, in addition to the effect of\nextrinsic defects often attributed to nanofabrication irregularities, can\nsubtly shift favored transition pathways and result in different emergent\nmesoscale features. Future kinetic Monte Carlo models that describe the\nevolution of artificial spin systems should thus account for these effects.",

While post-training pruning methods like SparseGPT and Wanda can\neffectively reduce the model size, but struggle to maintain model performance\nat high sparsity levels, limiting their utility for downstream tasks. Existing\nfine-tuning methods, such as full fine-tuning and LoRA, fail to preserve\nsparsity as they require updating the whole dense metrics, not well-suited for\nsparse LLMs. In this paper, we propose Sparsity Evolution Fine-Tuning (SEFT), a\nnovel method designed specifically for sparse LLMs. SEFT dynamically evolves\nthe sparse topology of pruned models during fine-tuning, while preserving the\noverall sparsity throughout the process.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework grounded in the theory of describing function\n(DF) and incremental-input DF to theoretically analyze the nonlinear\noscillatory response of automated vehicles (AVs) car-following (CF) amidst\ntraffic oscillations, considering the limits of traffic state and control\ninput. While prevailing approaches largely ignore these limits (i.e.,\nsaturation of acceleration/deceleration and speed) and focus on linear string\nstability analysis, this framework establishes a basis for theoretically\nanalyzing the frequency response of AV systems with nonlinearities imposed by\nthese limits. To this end, trajectories of CF pairs are decomposed into nominal\nand oscillatory trajectories, subsequently, the controlled AV system is\nrepositioned within the oscillatory trajectory coordinates. Built on this base,\nDFs are employed to approximate the frequency responses of nonlinear saturation\ncomponents by using their first harmonic output, thereby capturing the\nassociated amplification ratio and phase shift. Considering the closed-loop\nnature of AV control systems, where system states and control input mutually\ninfluence each other, amplification ratios and phase shifts are balanced within\nthe loop to ensure consistency. This balancing process may render multiple\nsolutions, hence the incremental-input DF is further applied to identify the\nreasonable ones. The proposed method is validated by estimations from Simulink,\nand further comparisons with prevailing methods are conducted. Results confirm\nthe alignment of our framework with Simulink results and exhibit its superior\naccuracy in analysis compared to the prevailing methods. Furthermore, the\nframework proves valuable in string stability analysis, especially when\nconventional linear methods offer misleading insights.",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is crucial for site-specific farm\nmanagement; however, most existing methods depend on labor intensive\npixel-level annotations. A further challenge arises when models trained on one\nfield (source domain) fail to generalize to new fields (target domain) due to\ndomain shifts, such as variations in lighting, camera setups, soil composition,\nand crop growth stages. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this by\nenabling adaptation without target-domain labels, but current UDA methods\nstruggle with occlusions and visual blending between crops and weeds, leading\nto misclassifications in real-world conditions. To overcome these limitations,\nwe introduce MaskAdapt, a novel approach that enhances segmentation accuracy\nthrough multimodal contextual learning by integrating RGB images with features\nderived from depth data. By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our\nmethod captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities.\nThese gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature\nrepresentations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we\npropose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical,\nand stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the\nbroader spatial context for robust visual recognition. Evaluations on real\nagricultural datasets demonstrate that MaskAdapt consistently outperforms\nexisting State-of-the-Art (SOTA) UDA methods, achieving improved segmentation\nmean Intersection over Union (mIOU) across diverse field conditions.",

We also apply\nKL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the\ntraining instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive\nsupervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional\ndrift.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the\nintegration of EDFs into heuristic planning has been carried out in a loosely\ncoupled fashion, dismissing EDF properties that can be used to\naccelerate/improve the planning process and enhance the safety margins of the\nresultant trajectories. This paper presents a fast graph search planner based\non a modified Lazy Theta* planning algorithm for aerial robots in challenging\n3D environments that exploits the EDF properties. The proposed planner\noutperforms classic graph search planners in terms of path smoothness and\nsafety. It integrates EDFs as environment representation and directly generates\nfast and smooth paths avoiding the use of post-processing methods; it also\nconsiders the analytical properties of EDFs to obtain an approximation of the\nEDF cost along the line-of-sight segments and to reduce the number of\nvisibility neighbours, which directly impacts the computation time. Moreover,\nwe demonstrate that the proposed EDF-based cost function satisfies the triangle\ninequality, which reduces calculations during exploration and, hence,\ncomputation time. Many experiments and comparatives are carried out in 3D\nchallenging indoor and outdoor simulation environments to evaluate and validate\nthe proposed planner.

In practice, neural\nnetworks trained with SGD are known to exhibit simplicity bias -- a tendency to\nfind simple solutions. In contrast, we show that Adam is more resistant to such\nsimplicity bias. To demystify this phenomenon, in this paper, we investigate\nthe differences in the implicit biases of Adam and GD when training two-layer\nReLU neural networks on a binary classification task involving synthetic data\nwith Gaussian clusters. We find that GD exhibits a simplicity bias, resulting\nin a linear decision boundary with a suboptimal margin, whereas Adam leads to\nmuch richer and more diverse features, producing a nonlinear boundary that is\ncloser to the Bayes' optimal predictor. This richer decision boundary also\nallows Adam to achieve higher test accuracy both in-distribution and under\ncertain distribution shifts. We theoretically prove these results by analyzing\nthe population gradients. To corroborate our theoretical findings, we present\nempirical results showing that this property of Adam leads to superior\ngeneralization across datasets with spurious correlations where neural networks\ntrained with SGD are known to show simplicity bias and don't generalize well\nunder certain distributional shifts.",

Design principles such as defense-in-depth, least privilege,\ncomplete mediation, and psychological acceptability have helped guide the\ndesign of mechanisms for securing information systems over the last five\ndecades, and we argue that their explicit and conscientious adoption will help\nsecure agentic systems. To illustrate this approach, we introduce AgentSandbox,\na conceptual framework embedding these security principles to provide\nsafeguards throughout an agent's life-cycle.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text but struggle to\nenforce external constraints because they generate tokens sequentially without\nexplicit control mechanisms. GenCP addresses this limitation by combining LLM\npredictions with Constraint Programming (CP) reasoning, formulating text\ngeneration as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In this paper, we\nimprove GenCP by integrating Masked Language Models (MLMs) for domain\ngeneration, which allows bidirectional constraint propagation that leverages\nboth past and future tokens. This integration bridges the gap between\ntoken-level prediction and structured constraint enforcement, leading to more\nreliable and constraint-aware text generation. Our evaluation on COLLIE\nbenchmarks demonstrates that incorporating domain preview via MLM calls\nsignificantly improves GenCP's performance. Although this approach incurs\nadditional MLM calls and, in some cases, increased backtracking, the overall\neffect is a more efficient use of LLM inferences and an enhanced ability to\ngenerate feasible and meaningful solutions, particularly in tasks with strict\ncontent constraints.",

In the case of\nthe hydrogenated surface, the system spin is quenched, yielding a negatively\ncharged azafullerene (C$_{59}$N$^-$) and neutrally charged NV$^0$ as the most\nstable electronic configuration. In contrast, fluorinating the surface favours\nthe negatively charged NV$^-$, and conserves the C$_{59}$N$^\\bullet$,\nneutrality and stabilizes uncompensated free spins. This opposing behaviour is\nattributed to surface charge doping emerging from different band bending\neffects associated with the surface EA.

    "abstract": "Transformers deliver outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and\nare now a dominant backbone architecture for large language models (LLMs).\nTheir task-solving performance is improved by increasing parameter size, as\nshown in the recent studies on parameter scaling laws. Although recent\nmechanistic-interpretability studies have deepened our understanding of the\ninternal behavior of Transformers by analyzing their residual stream, the\nrelationship between these internal mechanisms and the parameter scaling laws\nremains unclear. To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which\nmainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first\ntheoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a\nbias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error\nof each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which\nindicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing\nTransformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when\nindividual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain\nmutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when\nindividual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth. Finally, we introduce\nan information-theoretic diversity and show our main findings that adding\nlayers enhances performance only when those layers behave differently, i.e.,\nare diverse. We also reveal the performance gains from increasing the number of\nlayers exhibit submodularity: marginal improvements diminish as additional\nlayers increase, mirroring the logarithmic convergence predicted by the\nparameter scaling laws.

In a perfect world,\ntraining algorithms would not require workload-specific hyperparameter tuning,\nbut would instead have default settings that performed well across many\nworkloads. Recently, there has been a growing literature on optimization\nmethods which attempt to reduce the number of hyperparameters -- particularly\nthe learning rate and its accompanying schedule. Given these developments, how\nfar away is the dream of neural network training algorithms that completely\nobviate the need for painful tuning?\n  In this paper, we evaluate the potential of learning-rate-free methods as\ncomponents of hyperparameter-free methods. We freeze their (non-learning rate)\nhyperparameters to default values, and score their performance using the\nrecently-proposed AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark. We found that\nliterature-supplied default settings performed poorly on the benchmark, so we\nperformed a search for hyperparameter configurations that performed well across\nall workloads simultaneously. The best AlgoPerf-calibrated learning-rate-free\nmethods had much improved performance but still lagged slightly behind a\nsimilarly calibrated NadamW baseline in overall benchmark score.

This study addresses these\nchallenges by introducing a novel multi-output classification (MOC) framework\ntailored for domain adaptation in partially labeled target datasets. Unlike\nconventional multi-class classification (MCC) approaches, the MOC framework\nclassifies the severity levels of compound faults simultaneously. Furthermore,\nwe explore various single-task and multi-task architectures applicable to the\nMOC formulation-including shared trunk and cross-talk-based designs-for\ncompound fault diagnosis under partially labeled conditions.

Compound fault\nconditions were implemented using a motor-based test setup and evaluated across\nsix domain adaptation scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate its\nsuperior macro F1 performance compared to baseline models. We further showed\nthat the structural advantage of RNDR is more pronounced in compound fault\nsettings through a single-fault comparison. We also found that frequency-layer\nnormalization fits the fault diagnosis task better than conventional methods.\nLastly, we analyzed the RNDR with various conditions, other models with\nincreased number of parameters, and compared with the ablated RNDR structure.",

    "abstract": "Sunspots survive on the solar surface for time-scales ranging from days to\nmonths. This requires them to be in an equilibrium involving magnetic fields\nand hydrodynamic forces. Unfortunately, theoretical models of sunspot\nequilibrium are very simplified as they assume that spots are static and\npossess a self-similar and axially symmetric magnetic field. These assumptions\nneglect the role of small scale variations of the magnetic field along the\nazimuthal direction produced by umbral dots, light bridges, penumbral\nfilaments, and so forth. We aim at studying whether sunspot equilibrium is\nmaintained once azimuthal fluctuations in the magnetic field, produced by the\nsunspot fine structure, are taken into account. To this end we apply the FIRTEZ\nStokes inversion code to spectropolarimetric observations to infer the magnetic\nand thermodynamic parameters in two sunspots located at disk center and\nobserved with two different instruments: one observed from the ground with the\n1.5-meter German GREGOR Telescope and another with the Japanese spacecraft\nHinode. We compare our results with three dimensional radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations of a sunspot carried out with the MuRAM code.\nWe infer clear variations in the gas pressure and density of the plasma\ndirectly related to fluctuations in the Lorentz force and associated with the\nfilamentary structure in the penumbra. Similar results are obtained in the\numbra despite its lack of observed filamentary structure. Results from the two\nobserved sunspots are in excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with\nthe numerical simulations. Our results indicate that the magnetic topology of\nsunspots along the azimuthal direction is very close to magnetohydrostatic\nequilibrium, thereby helping to explain why sunspots are such long-lived\nstructures capable of surviving on the solar surface for days or even full\nsolar rotations.",

    "abstract": "Complex systems often exhibit highly structured network topologies that\nreflect functional constraints. In this work, we investigate how, under varying\ncombinations of system-wide selection rules and special agents, different\nclasses of random processes give rise to global order, with a focus restricted\nto finite-size networks. Using the large-$N$ Erdos-Renyi model as a null\nbaseline, we contrast purely random link-adding processes with goal-directed\ndynamics, including variants of the chip-firing model and intracellular network\ngrowth, both driven by transport efficiency. Through simulations and structural\nprobes such as $k$-core decomposition and $HITS$ centrality, we show that\npurely stochastic processes can spontaneously generate modest functional\nstructures, but that significant departures from random behavior generically\nrequire two key conditions: critical topological complexity and dynamic\nalignment between topology and functionality. Our results suggest that the\nemergence of functional architectures depends not only on the presence of\nselection mechanisms or specialized roles, but also on the network's capacity\nto support differentiation and feedback. These findings provide insight into\nhow topology-functionality relationships emerge in natural and artificial\nsystems and offer a framework for using random graph baselines to diagnose the\nrise of global order in evolving finite-size networks.",

Current\nnavigation systems and patient-specific instruments, while accurate, present\nlimitations including high costs, radiation exposure, workflow disruption, long\nproduction time, and lack of reusability. This study evaluates a real-time\nvision-guided surgical system combined with modular jigs to improve accuracy in\npelvic bone tumor resections. A vision-guided surgical system combined with\nmodular cutting jigs and real-time optical tracking was developed and\nvalidated. Five female pelvis sawbones were used, with each hemipelvis randomly\nassigned to either the vision-guided and modular jig system or traditional\nfreehand method. A total of twenty resection planes were analyzed for each\nmethod. Accuracy was assessed by measuring distance and angular deviations from\nthe planned resection planes. The vision-guided and modular jig system\nsignificantly improved resection accuracy compared to the freehand method,\nreducing the mean distance deviation from 2.07 $\\pm$ 1.71 mm to 1.01 $\\pm$ 0.78\nmm (p=0.0193). In particular, all specimens resected using the vision-guided\nsystem exhibited errors of less than 3 mm. Angular deviations also showed\nsignificant improvements with roll angle deviation reduced from 15.36 $\\pm$\n17.57$^\\circ$ to 4.21 $\\pm$ 3.46$^\\circ$ (p=0.0275), and pitch angle deviation\ndecreased from 6.17 $\\pm$ 4.58$^\\circ$ to 1.84 $\\pm$ 1.48$^\\circ$ (p<0.001).\nThe proposed vision-guided and modular jig system significantly improves the\naccuracy of pelvic bone tumor resections while maintaining workflow efficiency.\nThis cost-effective solution provides real-time guidance without the need for\nreferencing external monitors, potentially improving surgical outcomes in\ncomplex pelvic bone tumor cases.",

We present a\nstudy of the MIR emission of nearby AGNs by exploring the effects of dust\ndistribution and chemical composition on the spectral energy distributions\n(SEDs) using radiative transfer simulations. Our model grid includes smooth,\nclumpy, and two-phase dust distributions, combined with two dust compositions:\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) dust composition including large grains (up to\n$\\rm{10 \\ \\mu m}$), and the oxide/silicate-based composition from Reyes-Amador\net al. (2024). A synthetic SED library was generated and analysed both on a\nmodel-to-model basis and with observed MIR spectra from 68 AGNs. We found that\ndust density distribution and dust composition significantly influence the\nspectral shapes and silicate features at $10$ and $\\rm{18 \\ \\mu m}$, especially\nat edge-on orientations. The smooth distribution produces stronger and broader\nsilicate absorption features, while the clumpy distribution generates stronger\nfeatures in emission. The two-phase distributions exhibit intermediate\ncharacteristics depending on the clumpiness fraction ($f_{\\text{cl}}$) and\nfilling factor ($f_{\\text{fill}}$). The ISM dust composition with large grains\nis more suited to reproduce the observed features and a higher fraction of good\nfits, particularly with Type-2 SEDs, independently of dust density\ndistributions. The Reyes-Amador et al. (2024) composition provides a larger\nnumber of good fits with Type-1 SEDs for $f_{\\text{cl}} \\leq 0.5$, and with\nType-2 SEDs for $f_{\\text{cl}} \\geq 0.9$.

However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data,\nparticularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet,\nsignificantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is\ntraditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice\nthickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of\nkilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning\nframework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice\nthickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic\nloss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography,\nBedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass\nconservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate\nhigh-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively\nadjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in\nareas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution\nof BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates. Our approach incorporates\ngradient-based and trend surface features to enhance model performance and\nutilizes a CNN architecture designed for subgrid-scale predictions. By\nsystematically testing on the Upernavik Isstr{\\o}m) region, the model achieves\nhigh accuracy, outperforming baseline methods in reconstructing subglacial\nterrain. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in bridging\nobservational gaps, providing a scalable and efficient solution to inferring\nsubglacial topography.",

    "abstract": "The right batch size is important when training language models at scale: a\nlarge batch size is necessary for fast training, but a batch size that is too\nlarge will harm token efficiency. To navigate this tradeoff, McCandlish et al.\n(2018) suggest that a critical batch size (CBS), below which training will not\nsubstantially degrade loss, can be estimated based on the gradient noise scale\nduring training. While their method has been adopted in practice, e.g., when\ntraining GPT-3, strong assumptions are required to justify gradient noise as a\nproxy for the CBS, which makes it unclear whether their approach should be\ntrusted in practice, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we introduce a\nsimple, empirical approach to directly measure the CBS and show how the CBS\nevolves over training. Applying our approach to the OLMo models, we find that\nCBS is near 0 at initialization, increases rapidly at first, and then plateaus\nas training progresses. Furthermore, we find that this trend holds across\ndifferent model sizes (1B and 7B), suggesting CBS from small training runs can\ninform larger-scale training runs. Our findings about how the CBS changes over\ntraining motivate batch size warmup as a natural way to reliably train language\nmodels at large batch size: start the batch size small and increase it as the\nCBS grows. To validate this claim, we use batch size warmup to train OLMo 1B to\nslightly better loss than the original training run with 43% fewer gradient\nsteps. This shows how our framework can be applied to reliably train language\nmodels at larger batch sizes, increasing data parallelism without compromising\nperformance.",

    "abstract": "Searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences employ a\nprocess called matched filtering, in which gravitational wave strain data is\ncross-correlated against a bank of waveform templates. Data from every\nobserving run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration is typically analyzed\nin this way twice, first in a low-latency mode in which gravitational wave\ncandidates are identified in near-real time, and later in a high-latency mode.\nSuch high-latency analyses have traditionally been considered more sensitive,\nsince background data from the full observing run is available for assigning\nsignificance to all candidates, as well as more robust, since they do not need\nto worry about keeping up with live data. In this work, we present a novel\ntechnique to use the matched filtering data products from a low-latency\nanalysis and re-process them by assigning significances in a high-latency way,\neffectively removing the need to perform matched filtering a second time. To\ndemonstrate the efficacy of our method, we analyze 38 days of LIGO and Virgo\ndata from the third observing run (O3) using the GstLAL pipeline, and show that\nour method is as sensitive and reliable as a traditional high-latency analysis.\nSince matched filtering represents the vast majority of computing time for a\ntraditional analysis, our method greatly reduces the time and computational\nburden required to produce the same results as a traditional high-latency\nanalysis. Consequently, it has already been adopted by GstLAL for the fourth\nobserving run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Bars are considered an efficient mechanism for transporting gas toward the\ncentral regions of galaxies, potentially enhancing nuclear activity. However,\nthe extent to which bars influence active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and whether\ntheir efficiency varies with environment, remain open questions. In this study,\nwe aim to quantify the role of bars in triggering AGNs by comparing the AGN\nfraction in barred and non-barred galaxies across different environments. We\nconstructed a sample from the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS catalog, ensuring a control\nselection where both samples share similar distributions in stellar mass,\nredshift, magnitude, concentration index, and local density parameter. AGNs\nwere identified using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,\nyielding 1330 barred AGNs and 1651 unbarred AGNs. We use the [OIII]5007\nluminosity (Lum[OIII]) and the accretion rate parameter R as indicators of\nnuclear activity. Based on these, we applied criteria to distinguish powerful\nfrom weak AGNs, allowing a more precise assessment of the bar's impact on the\nsupermassive black hole. Our analysis reveals that barred galaxies tend to host\na higher fraction of powerful AGNs. From Lum[OIII], we find that more active\nnuclei reside in massive, blue galaxies with young stellar populations. We also\nobserve a slight tendency for barred galaxies to host less massive black holes\naccreting more efficiently. The classification of strong and weak bars shows\nthat more prominent bars correlate with higher nuclear activity. While this\ntrend shows no significant differences in intermediate-density environments, it\nbecomes evident in both low- and high-density regions, where galaxies with\nstrong bars show enhanced AGN activity.",

We used the prototype to\ncharacterise for the first time in literature over a broad THz range, pure\ndichloromethane and chloroform, two pollutants known as very short-lived\nsubstances (VSLS) that strongly contribute to ozone depletion. The THz range\nallows selectively detecting their absorption lines related to the rotational\nmolecular motion for which we also present the theoretical confirmation.

For these first\nmeasurements, we developed the set-up specifically for laboratory condition in\nwhich the substances are directly injected into the gas-cell circuit. Finally,\nwe modified the prototype to ensure that the ambient atmosphere is drawn\ndirectly into the gas cell via a long pipe and a suction system opportunely\ndeveloped. The analysis of the mixtures in both laboratory and in-field\nconditions demonstrates that the prototype together with the approach employed\nin this work can simultaneously identify and quantify single components in the\natmosphere.

We study how the performance varies\namong the 988-detector array with different detector characteristics and data\ntaking conditions.

The analysis methods employed reduce the overall background\nby about an order of magnitude, reaching 2.06 $\\pm$ 0.05 counts/(keV kg days)\nand 16 $\\pm$ 2 counts/(keV kg days) at the thresholds of 10 keV and 3 keV.

We demonstrate that tonne-scale cryogenic calorimeters can operate\nacross a wide energy range, from keV to MeV, establishing their scalability as\nversatile detectors for rare event and dark matter physics.

While prior work\nhas studied strategic responses broadly, disentangling misreporting from\ngenuine modification remains a fundamental challenge. In this paper, we propose\na causally-motivated approach to identify and quantify how much an agent\nmisreports on average by distinguishing deceptive changes in their features\nfrom genuine modification. Our key insight is that, unlike genuine\nmodification, misreported features do not causally affect downstream variables\n(i.e., causal descendants). We exploit this asymmetry by comparing the causal\neffect of misreported features on their causal descendants as derived from\nmanipulated datasets against those from unmanipulated datasets. We formally\nprove identifiability of the misreporting rate and characterize the variance of\nour estimator. We empirically validate our theoretical results using a\nsemi-synthetic and real Medicare dataset with misreported data, demonstrating\nthat our approach can be employed to identify misreporting in real-world\nscenarios.",

    "abstract": "Automatic code generation has gained significant momentum with the advent of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Although many studies focus on\nimproving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work\ntries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to\nimprove failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic\nof code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the\nsuccess of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity\nmetrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation\nwith LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic\nregression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of\ncode correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback\nmethod, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity\nmetrics from previous failed outputs. We validate our approach across multiple\nbenchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, LeetCode, and BigCodeBench) and various LLMs\n(i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and GPT-o3 mini), comparing the\nresults with two baseline methods: (a) zero-shot generation, and (b) iterative\nexecution-based feedback without our code complexity insights. Experiment\nresults show that our approach makes notable improvements, particularly with a\nsmaller LLM (GPT3.5 Turbo), where, e.g., Pass@1 increased by 35.71% compared to\nthe baseline's improvement of 12.5% on the HumanEval dataset. The study expands\nexperiments to BigCodeBench and integrates the method with the Reflexion code\ngeneration agent, leading to Pass@1 improvements of 20% (GPT-4o) and 23.07%\n(GPT-o3 mini). The results highlight that complexity-aware feedback enhances\nboth direct LLM prompting and agent-based workflows.",

    "abstract": "As multimodal large models (MLLMs) continue to advance across challenging\ntasks, a key question emerges: What essential capabilities are still missing? A\ncritical aspect of human learning is continuous interaction with the\nenvironment -- not limited to language, but also involving multimodal\nunderstanding and generation. To move closer to human-level intelligence,\nmodels must similarly support multi-turn, multimodal interaction. In\nparticular, they should comprehend interleaved multimodal contexts and respond\ncoherently in ongoing exchanges. In this work, we present an initial\nexploration through the InterMT -- the first preference dataset for multi-turn\nmultimodal interaction, grounded in real human feedback. In this exploration,\nwe particularly emphasize the importance of human oversight, introducing expert\nannotations to guide the process, motivated by the fact that current MLLMs lack\nsuch complex interactive capabilities. InterMT captures human preferences at\nboth global and local levels into nine sub-dimensions, consists of 15.6k\nprompts, 52.6k multi-turn dialogue instances, and 32.4k human-labeled\npreference pairs. To compensate for the lack of capability for multi-modal\nunderstanding and generation, we introduce an agentic workflow that leverages\ntool-augmented MLLMs to construct multi-turn QA instances. To further this\ngoal, we introduce InterMT-Bench to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting\njudges with multi-turn, multimodal tasks. We demonstrate the utility of\n\\InterMT through applications such as judge moderation and further reveal the\nmulti-turn scaling law of judge model. We hope the open-source of our data can\nhelp facilitate further research on aligning current MLLMs to the next step.\nOur project website can be found at https://pku-intermt.github.io .",

    "abstract": "Network pruning reduces the computational requirements of large neural\nnetworks, with N:M sparsity -- retaining only N out of every M consecutive\nweights -- offering a compelling balance between compressed model quality and\nhardware acceleration. However, N:M sparsity only accelerates forward-pass\ncomputations, as N:M patterns are not preserved during matrix transposition,\nlimiting efficiency during training where both passes are computationally\nintensive. While transposable N:M sparsity has been proposed to address this\nlimitation, existing methods for finding transposable N:M sparse masks either\nfail to scale to large models or are restricted to M=4 which results in\nsuboptimal compression-accuracy trade-off. We introduce an efficient solver for\ntransposable N:M masks that scales to billion-parameter models. We formulate\nmask generation as optimal transport problems and solve through entropy\nregularization and Dykstra's algorithm, followed by a rounding procedure. Our\ntensor-based implementation exploits GPU parallelism, achieving up to 100x\nspeedup with only 1-10% error compared to existing methods. Our approach can be\nintegrated with layer-wise N:M pruning frameworks including Wanda, SparseGPT\nand ALPS to produce transposable N:M sparse models with arbitrary N:M values.\nExperiments show that LLaMA3.2-8B with transposable 16:32 sparsity maintains\nperformance close to its standard N:M counterpart and outperforms standard 2:4\nsparse model, showing the practical value of our approach.",

The origin of this dynamical signature\nremains unclear. We revisit the \"breaking the chains\" formation model and\npropose that late dynamical instabilities -- occurring after disk dispersal --\nmay account for the elevated eccentricities observed in the radius valley. Our\nsimulations show that sub-valley planets ($R < 2 R_\\oplus$) are generally\nrocky, while those beyond the valley ($R > 2 R_\\oplus$) are typically\nwater-rich. Rocky planets that undergo strong dynamical instabilities and\nnumerous late giant impacts have their orbits excited and their radii\nincreased, ultimately placing them into the radius valley. In contrast, the\nlarger, water-rich planets just beyond the valley experience weaker\ninstabilities and fewer impacts, resulting in lower eccentricities. This\ncontrast leads to a peak in the eccentricity distribution within the valley.\nThe extent to which planets in the radius valley are dynamically excited\ndepends sensitively on the orbital architecture before the orbital instability.\nElevated eccentricities among radius valley planets arise primarily in\nscenarios that form a sufficiently large number of rocky planets within 100\ndays (typically $\\gtrsim 5$) prior to instability, and that also host external\nperturbers ($P > 100$ days), which further amplify the strength of dynamical\ninstabilities.",

Moreover, the\nassociated transfer operator $\\mathcal{L}_{f , t\\phi}$, acting on the space of\nH\\\"older continuous functions, has the spectral gap property for $t \\in\n\\mathbb{R}$. For dynamics that are topologically conjugate to an expanding map,\na full understanding has yet to be achieved. On the one hand, by\n\\cite{KQW21,KQ22}, for such maps and continuous potentials, the associated\ntopological pressure function can behave wildly. On the other hand, by\n\\cite{BF23}, for transitive local diffeomorphisms on the circle and a large\nclass of H\\\"older continuous potentials, the phase transition does not occur,\nand the associated transfer operator has the spectral gap property for all\nparameters $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. As a first approach to understanding what\nhappens in high dimensions, in this paper, we study positively expansive local\ndiffeomorphisms. In particular, we show that the associated transfer operator\nhas the spectral gap property for a large class of regular potentials.\nMoreover, for a class of intermittent skew-products and a large class of\nregular potentials, we obtain phase transition results analogous to\n\\cite{BF23}.",

    "abstract": "Human-aligned deep learning models exhibit behaviors consistent with human\nvalues, such as robustness, fairness, and honesty. Transferring these\nbehavioral properties to models trained on different tasks or data\ndistributions remains challenging: aligned behavior is easily forgotten during\nfine-tuning, and collecting task-specific data that preserves this behavior can\nbe prohibitively costly. We introduce BIRD (Behavior Induction via\nRepresentation-structure Distillation), a flexible framework for transferring\naligned behavior by matching the internal representation structure of a student\nmodel to that of a teacher. Applied to out-of-distribution robustness in image\nclassification, BIRD outperforms fine-tuning, transfer learning, and continual\nlearning methods, improving robust accuracy by up to 16% over the next\nstrongest baseline. It remains effective even when the teacher is trained on a\nmuch simpler dataset and is $25 \\times$ smaller than the student. In a\nlarge-scale study of over 400 teacher-student pairs, we show that three\ninterpretable and computable properties of the teacher's representations (i.e.,\ntask relevance, behavioral relevance, and complementary knowledge) explain up\nto 85% of the variance in transfer success. These insights offer practical\nguidance for teacher selection and design. BIRD turns small, well-aligned\nmodels into scalable alignment seeds, removing a key bottleneck in deploying\nsafe AI systems in the wild.",

To support these interactive\nevaluations, we introduce a retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) module\nthat efficiently handles long-context challenges by providing syntactically and\nsemantically relevant code snippets from large codebases, supporting multiple\nprogramming languages (C++, Python, Rust, and Go). This enables the framework\nto scale across diverse tasks and contexts while respecting token limitations.\nOur experiments, using over 400 high-quality real-world GitHub issues selected\nfrom a pool of 2,300 issues, show that models like GPT-4o excel at aggressive\npatch generation, whereas DeepSeek and Gemini prioritize correctness in CI\nvalidation.

    "abstract": "This study introduces a novel conceptual framework distinguishing\nproblem-seeking from problem-solving to clarify the unique features of human\nintelligence in contrast to AI. Problem-seeking refers to the embodied,\nemotionally grounded process by which humans identify and set goals, while\nproblem-solving denotes the execution of strategies aimed at achieving such\npredefined objectives. The framework emphasizes that while AI excels at\nefficiency and optimization, it lacks the orientation derived from experiential\ngrounding and the embodiment flexibility intrinsic to human cognition. To\nempirically explore this distinction, the research analyzes metadata from 157\nYouTube videos discussing AI. Conducting a thematic analysis combining\nqualitative insights with keyword-based quantitative metrics, this\nmixed-methods approach uncovers recurring themes in public discourse, including\nprivacy, job displacement, misinformation, optimism, and ethical concerns. The\nresults reveal a dual sentiment: public fascination with AI's capabilities\ncoexists with anxiety and skepticism about its societal implications. The\ndiscussion critiques the orthogonality thesis, which posits that intelligence\nis separable from goal content, and instead argues that human intelligence\nintegrates goal-setting and goal-pursuit. It underscores the centrality of\nembodied cognition in human reasoning and highlights how AI's limitations come\nfrom its current reliance on computational processing. The study advocates for\nenhancing emotional and digital literacy to foster responsible AI engagement.\nIt calls for reframing public discourse to recognize AI as a tool that augments\n-- rather than replaces -- human intelligence. By positioning problem seeking\nat the core of cognition and as a critical dimension of intelligence, this\nresearch offers new perspectives on ethically aligned and human-centered AI\ndevelopment.",

This can be\nattributed to both the comparatively smaller scale of 3D datasets, as well as\nthe disparate sources of the data itself. Point clouds are captured by diverse\nsensors (e.g., depth cameras, LiDAR) across varied domains (e.g., indoor,\noutdoor), each introducing unique scanning patterns, sampling densities, and\nsemantic biases. Such domain heterogeneity poses a major barrier towards\ntraining unified models at scale, especially under the realistic constraint\nthat domain labels are typically inaccessible at inference time.

We show that\nstandard point cloud backbones degrade significantly in performance when\ntrained on mixed-domain data, whereas Point-MoE with a simple top-k routing\nstrategy can automatically specialize experts, even without access to domain\nlabels. Our experiments demonstrate that Point-MoE not only outperforms strong\nmulti-domain baselines but also generalizes better to unseen domains.

    "abstract": "Although long-video understanding demands that models capture hierarchical\ntemporal information -- from clip (seconds) and shot (tens of seconds) to event\n(minutes) and story (hours) -- existing benchmarks either neglect this\nmulti-scale design or scatter scale-specific questions across different videos,\npreventing direct comparison of model performance across timescales on the same\ncontent. To address this, we introduce ScaleLong, the first benchmark to\ndisentangle these factors by embedding questions targeting four hierarchical\ntimescales -- clip (seconds), shot (tens of seconds), event (minutes), and\nstory (hours) -- all within the same video content. This within-content\nmulti-timescale questioning design enables direct comparison of model\nperformance across timescales on identical videos. ScaleLong features 269 long\nvideos (avg.\\ 86\\,min) from 5 main categories and 36 sub-categories, with 4--8\ncarefully designed questions, including at least one question for each\ntimescale. Evaluating 23 MLLMs reveals a U-shaped performance curve, with\nhigher accuracy at the shortest and longest timescales and a dip at\nintermediate levels. Furthermore, ablation studies show that increased visual\ntoken capacity consistently enhances reasoning across all timescales. ScaleLong\noffers a fine-grained, multi-timescale benchmark for advancing MLLM\ncapabilities in long-video understanding.

The Low Resolution\nSpectrometer reveals a prominent emission feature at 7.5 $\\mu$m, resulting from\nthe blend of three hydrogen recombination lines.

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution and linewidth of Mercury's sodium and potassium\nexosphere were observed using a combination of long-slit and high-resolution\npoint spectroscopy. Effective temperatures were estimated from emission line\nprofiles by forward modeling their Doppler broadening. These serve as an energy\nmetric for collisionless gas that is inherently nonthermal. The Na gas at low\nand mid-latitudes ranges from 1200-1300 K along the noon meridian, in agreement\nwith MESSENGER scale heights, increasing by ~200 K at the poles and terminator.\nThis increase is attributed to the loss of low energy atoms to the surface\nduring photon-driven transport antisunward. An escaping potassium tail was\nmeasured for the first time, observed to a distance of 10.4 RM with Na/K ~95 at\n5.8 RM. Emission linewidths increase sharply between the dayside and escaping\ntail, with Na growing from about 1200 to 7500 K, and K from 750 to 8500 K by\nthe time the gas reaches 4.3 RM downtail. Na D line profiles down the exotail\nalso evolve from Gaussian to boxcar in shape. Both characteristics are\ninterpreted as filtering of the nascent velocity distribution function, wherein\nlow energy atoms on gravitationally bound trajectories are removed from the gas\npopulation, while high energy escaping atoms are retained. Na linewidths become\ninvariant past 3.5 RM, placing this altitude as the ballistic apex of bound\ntrajectories. In this way, Mercury's emissions prototype a novel technique\ntowards a broader understanding of atmospheric escape, using emission line\nmorphology to probe the transition between bound and escaping gas.",

Our\ntheory for the Onsager transport tensor highlights the general breakdown of the\nfamiliar Onsager reciprocal relations and Einstein relations when a local\nequilibrium is absent. The procedure outlined is applied to a variety of\nsystems, including passive systems, mixtures with nonreciprocal interactions,\nelectrolytes under an electric field, and active systems, and can be\nstraightforwardly used to understand other transport processes.

Systems with rapid transitions between\nthe inner and outer slopes are shown to have an inflection in their isotropic\ndistribution function (DF), where ${\\rm d} f/{\\rm d} E > 0$, thereby violating\nAntonov's stability criterion. Using high-resolution $N$-body simulations, we\nshow that the resulting instability causes the growth of a rotating dipole (or\n$l=1$) mode. The inflection feature in the DF responds to the mode by promoting\nits growth, driving the instability. The growth of the dipole results in a\ntorque that dislodges the original cusp from its central location, and sets it\nin motion throughout the central region. Once the mode goes non-linear, it\nsaturates, together with the cusp, into a long-lived soliton (the $l=1$\nequivalent of a bar in a disk galaxy), which maintains its sloshing motion\nthrough the center of the halo along a slowly precessing, elliptical orbit.\nConcurrently, the soliton traps increasingly more particles into libration, and\nthe exchange of energy and angular momentum with these trapped particles works\ntowards eroding the bump in the distribution function. We point out\nsimilarities between the dipole mode and the bump-on-tail instability in\nelectrostatic plasmas, and highlight a potential connection with core stalling\nand dynamical buoyancy in systems with a cored density profile.

Unstratified simulations are commonly used\nto study the SI, based on the assumption that they approximate conditions near\nthe disk midplane. However, it remains unclear how accurately these\nunstratified simulations capture the midplane dust-gas dynamics in stratified\ndisks. To address this, we examine the saturated state of the SI in stratified\nsimulations and compare dust-gas dynamics to those in unstratified simulations\nacross various radial pressure gradients. To this end, we consider a\ndimensionless dust stopping time ($\\tau_s$) of 0.1 and perform 2D axisymmetric,\nstratified simulations. We find that the formation of dust filaments during\ndust settling exhibits morphological similarities to those in unstratified\nsimulations. Vertical gravity acts to redistribute momentum vertically in\nresponse to momentum flux, resulting in midplane velocities in the\ncenter-of-mass frame that are consistent with those from unstratified models at\nany given pressure gradient. Furthermore, the velocity dispersions and density\ndistributions of the gas and dust near the midplane of our stratified\nsimulations closely match those in unstratified simulations. While further\nexploration across the parameter space is needed, our results suggest that, for\n$\\tau_s=0.1$, unstratified simulations represents well the midplane dust--gas\ndynamics in stratified disks before any strong clumping occurs. Consequently,\nour results confirm that in the saturated state, the streaming turbulence in\nstratified simulations behaves similarly to that in unstratified simulations\nfor the parameter values explored here.",

We find that for objects\nwith $i<3H_0R_0^{-1}$, where $H_0R_0^{-1}$ is the disc aspect ratio, the\ninclination lost per midplane crossing is proportional to the inclination\npreceding the crossing, resulting in a net exponential decay in inclination.\nFor objects with $i>3H_0R_0^{-1}$, damping efficiency decreases for higher\ninclinations. We consider a variety of different AGN environments, finding that\ndamping is stronger for systems with a higher ambient Hill mass: the initial\ngas mass within the BH sphere-of-influence. We provide a fitting formula for\nthe inclination changes as a function of Hill mass. We find reasonable\nagreement between the damping driven by gas gravity in the simulations and the\ndamping driven by accretion under a Hill-limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton\nprescription. We find that gas dynamical friction consistently overestimates\nthe strength of damping, especially for lower inclination systems, by at least\nan order of magnitude. For regions in the AGN disc where coplanar binary black\nhole formation by gas dissipation is efficient, we find that the simulated\ndamping timescales are especially short with $\\tau_d < 10P_\\mathrm{SMBH}$.

Various dark\nmatter candidates leave unique imprints on the low-mass range of the halo mass\nfunction, which can be challenging to detect. Among these are hot and warm dark\nmatter models, which predict a reduced abundance of low-mass structures\ncompared to the $\\Lambda$CDM model. Models with PBHs also affect this mass\nrange, but in the opposite direction, producing an increase in low-mass\nobjects. By examining lensing perturbations in galaxy clusters, constraints can\nbe placed on the low-mass subhalo abundance and, therefore, on these different\ndark matter models. We aim to provide predictions useful for this type of\nperturbation in the PBH case. Additionally, we examine the abundance of haloes\nand subhaloes in the range where the stellar-to-halo mass relation rises\nsteeply, which could be contrasted with brightness fluctuations in clusters\ncaused by low-luminosity satellites. To do this, we run cosmological\nsimulations using the {\\small SWIFT} code, comparing a fiducial model with\nalternative inflationary models, both with and without PBHs. We find a\nsignificant excess of substructure in the presence of PBHs compared to\n$\\Lambda$CDM, without altering the abundance of high-mass haloes at redshift\nzero. This increase reaches factors of $\\sim6$ for extended PBH mass functions\nwith exponential cutoffs at $M_{\\rm PBH}=10^2M_\\odot$ in the range of parameter\nspace where they could make up all of the dark matter, and persists even for\nsub-percent PBH fractions with cutoffs at $M_{\\rm PBH}=10^4M_\\odot$.",

Understanding how such\nfeedback shapes large-scale accretion is key to bridging observations from\ngalactic scales (e.g., the Bondi radius, $r_{\\rm B}$) down to event horizon\nscales ($r_{\\rm g}$), spanning 5-6 orders of magnitude. We tackle this\nchallenge by varying the spatial scale separation across 2-4 orders of\nmagnitude and performing some of the longest contiguous 3D general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to date ($t \\lesssim 4\\times10^6 r_{\\rm\ng}/c$), of Bondi-like accretion of rotating, non-relativistic gas with weak\nvertical magnetic fields onto a rapidly spinning BH, achieving inflow\nequilibrium out to $r \\gtrsim 10^3 r_{\\rm g}$. We find that, regardless of\nscale separation or ambient gas rotation, all simulations reach a magnetically\narrested disk (MAD) state where the BH becomes magnetically saturated. In this\nstate, the mass inflow rate follows a universal radial scaling: $\\dot{M}_{\\rm\nin}(r) \\sim r^s$ with $s = 0.66 \\pm 0.03$. The MAD state self-regulates through\njets, outflows, and magnetic flux eruptions that can disrupt coherent angular\nmomentum inflow, giving rise to a rocking accretion disk (RAD) state. This RAD\nstate features chaotically oriented inflows, weak intermittent jets, and a\nsteeper inflow slope of $s = 0.87 \\pm 0.05$. The MAD and RAD BH accretion rates\nbecome comparable at typical scale separations, $r_{\\rm B}/ r_{\\rm g} \\gtrsim\n10^5$. Weaker RAD outflows allow large-scale inflows to resume, restoring the\nMAD state and enabling a recurring MAD-RAD cycle. These cycles can last tens of\nBondi timescales, $t_{\\rm B} \\sim 0.2\\,\\text{Myr} \\times (r_{\\rm B}/10^{5}\nr_{\\rm g})^{3/2} \\times (M_{\\rm BH}/10^9M_\\odot)$, potentially setting the duty\ncycle of jetted AGN outbursts, such as in M87*.",

The binaries\npresent in such a cluster could be considered naturally as triples, with the\nSMBH as a third object, and their dynamics also depend on the interaction with\nthe gas-rich disc. In this paper, we study the evolution of such a binary on an\ninclined orbit with respect to the disc. The binary experiences both\neccentricity excitation via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and drag\nforces from each time it penetrates the disc. We find that, as the outer\norbital inclination decreases, the evolution of inner orbital separation can\ntransition from a regime of gradual hardening to a regime of rapid softening.\nAs such binaries grow wider, their minimum pericentre distances (during ZLK\noscillations) decrease. We show that a simple geometric condition, modulated by\nthe complex ZLK evolution, dictates whether a binary expands or contracts due\nto the interactions with the AGN disc. Our results suggest that the interaction\nwith gas-rich accretion disc could enhance the rate of stellar mergers and\nformation of gravitational wave sources, as well as other transients.

To address these\nlimitations, we propose ZeroGUI, a scalable, online learning framework for\nautomating GUI Agent training at Zero human cost. Specifically, ZeroGUI\nintegrates (i) VLM-based automatic task generation to produce diverse training\ngoals from the current environment state, (ii) VLM-based automatic reward\nestimation to assess task success without hand-crafted evaluation functions,\nand (iii) two-stage online reinforcement learning to continuously interact with\nand learn from GUI environments. Experiments on two advanced GUI Agents\n(UI-TARS and Aguvis) demonstrate that ZeroGUI significantly boosts performance\nacross OSWorld and AndroidLab environments.

Despite an already\nmature research endeavour for photos, there is no research on the efficient\ninference specifically designed for sketch data. In this paper, we first\ndemonstrate existing state-of-the-art efficient light-weight models designed\nfor photos do not work on sketches. We then propose two sketch-specific\ncomponents which work in a plug-n-play manner on any photo efficient network to\nadapt them to work on sketch data. We specifically chose fine-grained\nsketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) as a demonstrator as the most recognised\nsketch problem with immediate commercial value. Technically speaking, we first\npropose a cross-modal knowledge distillation network to transfer existing photo\nefficient networks to be compatible with sketch, which brings down number of\nFLOPs and model parameters by 97.96% percent and 84.89% respectively. We then\nexploit the abstract trait of sketch to introduce a RL-based canvas selector\nthat dynamically adjusts to the abstraction level which further cuts down\nnumber of FLOPs by two thirds. The end result is an overall reduction of 99.37%\nof FLOPs (from 40.18G to 0.254G) when compared with a full network, while\nretaining the accuracy (33.03% vs 32.77%) -- finally making an efficient\nnetwork for the sparse sketch data that exhibit even fewer FLOPs than the best\nphoto counterpart.",

    "abstract": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for\naligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite\nits empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio\nreward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap\nby utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution\nover token sequences that captures the information gained during policy\nupdates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential\ninformation required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the\nlog-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the\ntarget policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a\nclosed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected\nresponses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode\ndifferential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption\nregarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in\npreference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the\nentropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential\ninformation reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential\ninformation induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood\ndisplacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic\nexperiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our\nresults suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial\nfor general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential\ninformation benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work\npresents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of\npreference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of\ndifferential information.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have\nsignificantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their\nspatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on\nadditional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their\nutility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this\npaper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial\nreasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which\nrely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our\nkey insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward\nvisual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder\narchitecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and\na spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to\nextract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into\nunified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we\npropose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects\nthe spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under\nlimited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial\nreasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k\ndataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO.\nExtensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nspatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of\nvisual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake\nthat forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We\nidentify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry\nof the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake\nmorphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The\ninclination damping $\\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as\na power law in $\\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\\text{H,0}$ as $\\Delta\ni/i \\propto m_{\\rm H,0}^{0.4} \\sin(i)^{-2.7}$.

To enhance all these three\naspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that\nlearns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current\nand past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.\nBuilding on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like\narchitectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the\noriginal Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language\nmodeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context\nunderstanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers\nand recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context\nperformance of Titans, achieving +80\\% accuracy in 10M context length of\nBABILong benchmark.",

We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method\nfor retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which\nallows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We\nconstruct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3, top-5,\nand top-10 accuracy among template-free methods. We prove that DiffER is a\nstrong baseline for a new class of template-free model, capable of learning a\nvariety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings and outperforming a\nvariety of other template-free methods on top-k accuracy metrics. By\nconstructing an ensemble of categorical diffusion models with a novel length\nprediction component with variance, our method is able to approximately sample\nfrom the posterior distribution of reactants, producing results with strong\nmetrics of confidence and likelihood. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrate\nthat accurate prediction of the SMILES sequence length is key to further\nboosting the performance of categorical diffusion models.",

    "abstract": "In-context learning, the ability of large language models to perform tasks\nusing only examples provided in the prompt, has recently been adapted for time\nseries forecasting. This paradigm enables zero-shot prediction, where past\nvalues serve as context for forecasting future values, making powerful\nforecasting tools accessible to non-experts and increasing the performance when\ntraining data are scarce. Most existing zero-shot forecasting approaches rely\non transformer architectures, which, despite their success in language, often\nfall short of expectations in time series forecasting, where recurrent models\nlike LSTMs frequently have the edge. Conversely, while LSTMs are well-suited\nfor time series modeling due to their state-tracking capabilities, they lack\nstrong in-context learning abilities. We introduce TiRex that closes this gap\nby leveraging xLSTM, an enhanced LSTM with competitive in-context learning\nskills. Unlike transformers, state-space models, or parallelizable RNNs such as\nRWKV, TiRex retains state-tracking, a critical property for long-horizon\nforecasting. To further facilitate its state-tracking ability, we propose a\ntraining-time masking strategy called CPM. TiRex sets a new state of the art in\nzero-shot time series forecasting on the HuggingFace benchmarks GiftEval and\nChronos-ZS, outperforming significantly larger models including TabPFN-TS\n(Prior Labs), Chronos Bolt (Amazon), TimesFM (Google), and Moirai (Salesforce)\nacross both short- and long-term forecasts.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present the \\emph{twiddless fast Fourier transform (TFFT)},\na novel algorithm for computing the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT).\nThe TFFT's divide strategy builds on recent results that decimate an $N$-point\nsignal (by a factor of $p$) into an $N/p$-point compressed signal whose DFT\nreadily yields $N/p$ coefficients of the original signal. However, existing\ncompression-domain DFT analyses have been limited to computing only the\neven-indexed DFT coefficients. With TFFT, we overcome this limitation by\nefficiently computing both \\emph{even- and odd-indexed} DFT coefficients in the\ncompressed domain with $O(N \\log N)$ complexity. TFFT introduces a new\nrecursive decomposition of the DFT problem, wherein $N/2^i$ coefficients of the\noriginal input are computed at recursion level $i$, with no need for twiddle\nfactor multiplications or butterfly structures. Additionally, TFFT generalizes\nthe input length to $N = c \\cdot 2^k$ (for $k \\geq 0$ and non-power-of-two $c >\n0$), reducing the need for zero-padding and potentially improving efficiency\nand stability over classical FFTs.

This fast\nweight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past\ntokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show\neffectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on\nmodern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely\nlow FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online\nminibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,\na small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the\ndata, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or\nN-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the\nopposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to\n1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk\nTest-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of\nmagnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size\n(up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity,\nall without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It\nalso allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online\nupdates.

Common separation techniques are not applicable for separating\nspecies based on motility as such species can have indistinguishable physical\nproperties, i.e., size, shape, density, and differ only by their ability to\nexecute self-propelled motion as, e.g., motile, and immotile sperm cells.\nTherefore, selecting active species based on motility requires completely\ndifferent approaches. Some of these have been developed including sperm cell\nselection techniques, e.g., swim-up techniques, passive selection methods based\non the ability of highly motile sperm cells to swim across streamlines, as well\nas more sophisticated techniques. Here we theoretically demonstrate via\nnumerical simulations various efficient methods of selection and separation\nbased on the motility of active species using arrays of traps. Two approaches\nare proposed: one allowed the selective escape of motile species from traps,\nand the other one relying on a deterministic lateral displacement (DLD)-type\nmethod. As a model system, we consider self-propelled Janus particles whose\nmotility can be tuned. The resulted separation methods are applicable for\nseparation of biological motile species, such as bacteria or sperm cells, as\nwell as for Janus micro- and nanoparticles.",

The Gaussian graphical model (GGM) is an important class of\ngraphical models, where the conditional dependence among variables is\nrepresented by nodes and edges in a graph. In many real applications, we are\ninterested in detecting hubs in graphical models, which refer to nodes with a\nsignificant higher degree of connectivity compared to non-hub nodes. A typical\nstrategy for hub detection consists of estimating the graphical model, and then\nusing the estimated graph to identify hubs. Despite its simplicity, the success\nof this strategy relies on the accuracy of the estimated graph. In this paper,\nwe directly target on the estimation of hubs, without the need of estimating\nthe graph. We establish a novel connection between the presence of hubs in a\ngraphical model, and the spectral decomposition of the underlying covariance\nmatrix. Based on this connection, we propose the method of inverse principal\ncomponents for hub detection (IPC-HD). Both consistency and convergence rates\nare established for IPC-HD. Our simulation study demonstrates the superior\nperformance and fast computation of the proposed method compared to existing\nmethods in the literature in terms of hub detection.

Extensive experiments on standard benchmark\ndatasets show that DiCoFlex outperforms existing methods in terms of validity,\ndiversity, proximity, and constraint adherence, making it a practical and\nscalable solution for counterfactual generation in sensitive decision-making\ndomains.",

However, most of these policies are trained on data\ncollected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to\npoor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these\npolicies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing\nbuttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization\nproblem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in\ndistribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of\ncamera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust\nto unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples\nnavigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional\ndemonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing\nefforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and\nremains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the\nMobi-$\\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty\nof mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation\ntasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization\ntools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel\napproach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's\nbase pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our\napproach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score\nfunction to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to\nidentify optimal robot poses.

We\nconducted a case study at a large German IT consulting company, utilizing a\nweb-based personnel management software.

However, the\nlearnability of such constructions, particularly the conditions on the data\ndistribution that enable efficient learning via gradient-based optimization,\nremains an open question. Towards answering this question, in this work we\nstudy the learnability of the $k$-fold composition task, which requires\ncomputing an interleaved composition of $k$ input permutations and $k$ hidden\npermutations, and can be expressed by a transformer with $O(\\log k)$ layers. On\nthe negative front, we prove a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound showing that\nany SQ learner that makes only polynomially-many queries to an SQ oracle for\nthe $k$-fold composition task distribution must have sample size exponential in\n$k$, thus establishing a statistical-computational gap. On the other hand, we\nshow that this function class can be efficiently learned, with runtime and\nsample complexity polynomial in $k$, by gradient descent on an $O(\\log\nk)$-depth transformer via two different curriculum learning strategies: one in\nwhich data consists of $k'$-fold composition functions with $k' \\le k$\npresented in increasing difficulty, and another in which all such data is\npresented simultaneously.

In typical applications of real-time\ndata analysis, both the length of the stream $T$ and the size of the universe\n$|U|$ from which data come can be extremely large. This motivates the study of\nprivate algorithms in the turnstile setting using space sublinear in both $T$\nand $|U|$. In this paper, we give the first sublinear space differentially\nprivate algorithms for the fundamental problem of counting distinct elements in\nthe turnstile streaming model.

Our result significantly improves upon\nthe space requirements of the state-of-the-art algorithms for this problem,\nwhich is linear, approaching the known $\\Omega(T^{1/4})$ additive error lower\nbound for arbitrary streams. Moreover, when a bound $W$ on the number of times\nan item appears in the stream is known, our algorithm provides\n$\\tilde{O}_{\\eta}(\\sqrt{W})$ additive error, using $\\tilde{O}_{\\eta}(\\sqrt{W})$\nspace. This additive error asymptotically matches that of prior work which\nrequired instead linear space. Our results address an open question posed by\n[Jain, Kalemaj, Raskhodnikova, Sivakumar, Smith, Neurips23] about designing\nlow-memory mechanisms for this problem.

We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement\nLearning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each\nreasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual\ndecision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces,\nguiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When\nfine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables\nthe model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds.\nAcross a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK\nfor spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and\nVisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both\nsupervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit\ngrounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual\nfeedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI\nelements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find\nthat grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration,\ngrounded subgoal setting, and visual verification.

Linear attention methods are efficient\nalternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of\nsoftmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into\neach linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length\ntasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from\nlong contexts due to \"memory collisions\". In this paper , we propose LoLA:\nLow-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores\nadditional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative\nmemories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models\nand transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of\nmemory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize\npairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent\nhidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables\npass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks\nfrom RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to\n97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1\n8B.

We start by designing\nthe tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where\ntokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising\nsteps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens\nnaturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to\nautoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on\nthese tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or\ntraining/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token\ngeneration directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is,\nonce the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly\ndecode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the\nstreaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties,\nfor example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of\ntokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard\nImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone\nwith 256 discrete tokens.

Despite the significance of this\nclass of processes, quantifying the information content of self-organizing\npatterning systems remains challenging due to the complexity and the\nqualitative diversity of developmental mechanisms. In this study, we applied a\nrecently proposed information-theoretical framework which quantifies the\nself-organization potential of cell-fate patterning systems, employing a\nutility function that integrates (local) positional information and (global)\ncorrelational information extracted from developmental pattern ensembles.\nSpecifically, we examined a stochastic and spatially resolved simulation model\nof EPI-PRE lineage proportioning, evaluating its information content across\nvarious simulation scenarios with different numbers of system cells. To\novercome the computational challenges hindering the application of this novel\nframework, we developed a mathematical strategy that indirectly maps the\nlow-dimensional cell-fate counting probability space to the high-dimensional\ncell-fate patterning probability space, enabling the estimation of\nself-organization potential for general cell-fate proportioning processes.\nOverall, this novel information-theoretical framework provides a promising,\nuniversal approach for quantifying self-organization in developmental biology.\nBy formalizing measures of self-organization, the employed quantification\nframework offers a valuable tool for uncovering insights into the underlying\nprinciples of cell-fate specification and the emergence of complexity in early\ndevelopmental systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have enabled\nhigh-fidelity and realistic video synthesis. However, current T2V models often\nstruggle to generate physically plausible content due to their limited inherent\nability to accurately understand physics. We found that while the\nrepresentations within T2V models possess some capacity for physics\nunderstanding, they lag significantly behind those from recent video\nself-supervised learning methods. To this end, we propose a novel framework\ncalled VideoREPA, which distills physics understanding capability from video\nunderstanding foundation models into T2V models by aligning token-level\nrelations. This closes the physics understanding gap and enable more\nphysics-plausible generation. Specifically, we introduce the Token Relation\nDistillation (TRD) loss, leveraging spatio-temporal alignment to provide soft\nguidance suitable for finetuning powerful pre-trained T2V models, a critical\ndeparture from prior representation alignment (REPA) methods. To our knowledge,\nVideoREPA is the first REPA method designed for finetuning T2V models and\nspecifically for injecting physical knowledge. Empirical evaluations show that\nVideoREPA substantially enhances the physics commonsense of baseline method,\nCogVideoX, achieving significant improvement on relevant benchmarks and\ndemonstrating a strong capacity for generating videos consistent with intuitive\nphysics.

In this paper, we study how such implicit reasoning emerges by\ntraining transformers from scratch in a controlled symbolic environment. Our\nanalysis reveals a three-stage developmental trajectory: early memorization,\nfollowed by in-distribution generalization, and eventually cross-distribution\ngeneralization. We find that training with atomic triples is not necessary but\naccelerates learning, and that second-hop generalization relies on query-level\nexposure to specific compositional structures. To interpret these behaviors, we\nintroduce two diagnostic tools: cross-query semantic patching, which identifies\nsemantically reusable intermediate representations, and a cosine-based\nrepresentational lens, which reveals that successful reasoning correlates with\nthe cosine-base clustering in hidden space. This clustering phenomenon in turn\nprovides a coherent explanation for the behavioral dynamics observed across\ntraining, linking representational structure to reasoning capability.

Based on experiments, the\nblastocyst lumen is hypothesized to influence EPI-PRE tissue specification, but\nits particular functional role remains theoretically underexplored. In this\nstudy, we extended our stochastic ICM differentiation model to incorporate both\nthe blastocyst lumen (blastocoel) and the trophectoderm (TE) as adjacent\ncompartments where the primary signaling protein (FGF4) for EPI-PRE\ndifferentiation can diffuse, degrade, or accumulate. This extended ICM model\nallows for a spatially resolved analysis of EPI-PRE lineage proportioning under\nthe influence of luminally deposited FGF4 molecules. Our results reveal that\nthe blastocoel acts as a localized signaling source, while the TE functions as\nan embryo-wide signaling sink, guiding cell-fate decisions within the ICM. A\ncritical determinant of the ideal target system behavior is the initial amount\nof luminally deposited FGF4, which is required to recapitulate the correct\nspatio-temporal patterning of EPI and PRE (blastocyst) cell lineages. Notably,\nthis requirement is independent of ICM population size and shape, highlighting\nthe robustness of the FGF4 signaling process.

Recently,\nG\\k{a}sieniec, Grodzicki, and Stachowiak (PODC 2025) proved that $n+O(\\log n)$\nstates suffice to achieve $O(n \\log n)$ time both in expectation and with high\nprobability (w.h.p.). If substantially more states are available, sublinear\ntime can be achieved. Burman~et~al.~(PODC 2021) presented a $2^{O(n^\\rho\\log\nn)}$-state SS-LE protocol with a parameter $\\rho$: setting $\\rho = \\Theta(\\log\nn)$ yields an optimal $O(\\log n)$ time both in expectation and w.h.p., while\n$\\rho = \\Theta(1)$ results in $O(\\rho\\,n^{1/(\\rho+1)})$ expected time.

When $\\rho =\n\\Theta\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n}\\right)$,the proposed protocol is the\nfirst to achieve sublinear time while using only polynomially many states.

For instance, DeepSeek-R1\nreports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while\nOpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally\nraises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to\nhallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1)\nWe first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our\nanalysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold\nstart supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate\ntheir hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training\nwithout cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To\nexplore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on\nhallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two\ncritical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw\nRepetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the\nsame underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer\nfails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate\nthe mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model\nuncertainty.

Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) is a\nstatistical method that has gained significant traction in environmental\nmixture studies due to its ability to account for complex non-linear\nrelationships between the exposures and health outcome and its ability to\nidentify interaction effects between the exposures. However, BKMR makes the\ncrucial assumption that the error terms have a constant variance, and this\nassumption is not typically checked in practice. In this paper, we create a\ndiagnostic function for checking this constant variance assumption in practice\nand develop Heteroscedastic BKMR (HBKMR) for environmental mixture analyses\nwhere this assumption is not met. By specifying a Bayesian hierarchical\nvariance model for the error term variance parameters, HBKMR produces updated\nestimates of the environmental mixture's health effects and their corresponding\n95% credible intervals. We apply HBKMR in two real-world case studies that\nmotivated this work: 1) Examining the effects of prenatal metal exposures on\nbehavioral problems in toddlers living in Suriname and 2) Assessing the impacts\nof metal exposures on simple reaction time in children living near coal-fired\npower plants in Kentucky. In both case studies, HBKMR provides a substantial\nimprovement in model fit compared to BKMR, with differences in some of the\nmixture effect estimates and typically narrower 95% credible intervals after\naccounting for the heteroscedasticity.",

The\nrequired coupling to an ancillary control qubit, however, can negate these\nbenefits by inducing highly detrimental effects such as excess decoherence and\nundesired nonlinearities. An important question is thus whether a cavity-qubit\ncoupling can be realized that offers readout and control capabilities without\nspoiling the cavity. Here, motivated by its long lifetime and design\nflexibility of its Hamiltonian, we experimentally investigate the fluxonium as\na control qubit for superconducting cavities. We couple a fluxonium qubit to a\nsuperconducting resonator in the strong-dispersive regime and use it to measure\nthe coherence and inherited nonlinearities of the resonator. We then\ndemonstrate universal control by preparing and characterizing resonator Fock\nstates and their superpositions, with fidelities limited by resonator decay in\nour planar prototype device. Finally, we use the predictability of the\nresonator's inherited nonlinearities to show numerically that the fluxonium can\nreach cavity-coupling regimes that eliminate undesirable cavity nonlinearities.\nThese results demonstrate the potential of the fluxonium as a high-performance\nbosonic control qubit for superconducting cavities.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, highlighted the critical need\nfor accurate prediction of disease severity to optimize healthcare resource\nallocation and patient management. The spike protein, which facilitates viral\nentry into host cells, exhibits high mutation rates, particularly in the\nreceptor-binding domain, influencing viral pathogenicity. Artificial\nintelligence approaches, such as deep learning, offer promising solutions for\nleveraging genomic and clinical data to predict disease outcomes. Objective:\nThis study aimed to develop a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model to predict\nCOVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and associated clinical\nmetadata from South American patients. Methods: We retrieved 9,570 spike\nprotein sequences from the GISAID database, of which 3,467 met inclusion\ncriteria after standardization. The dataset included 2,313 severe and 1,154\nmild cases. A feature engineering pipeline extracted features from sequences,\nwhile demographic and clinical variables were one-hot encoded. A hybrid\nCNN-LSTM architecture was trained, combining CNN layers for local pattern\nextraction and an LSTM layer for long-term dependency modeling. Results: The\nmodel achieved an F1 score of 82.92%, ROC-AUC of 0.9084, precision of 83.56%,\nand recall of 82.85%, demonstrating robust classification performance. Training\nstabilized at 85% accuracy with minimal overfitting. The most prevalent\nlineages (P.1, AY.99.2) and clades (GR, GK) aligned with regional\nepidemiological trends, suggesting potential associations between viral\ngenetics and clinical outcomes. Conclusion: The CNN-LSTM hybrid model\neffectively predicted COVID-19 severity using spike protein sequences and\nclinical data, highlighting the utility of AI in genomic surveillance and\nprecision public health. Despite limitations, this approach provides a\nframework for early severity prediction in future outbreaks.",

A significant\nlimitation of existing frameworks is their reliance on invariant meta-actions\nassigned over fixed future time intervals, causing temporal misalignment with\nthe actual behavior trajectories. This misalignment leads to irrelevant\nassociations between the prescribed meta-actions and the resulting\ntrajectories, disrupting task coherence and limiting model performance. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce Autoregressive Meta-Actions, an approach\nintegrated into autoregressive trajectory generation frameworks that provides a\nunified and precise definition for meta-action-conditioned trajectory\nprediction. Specifically, We decompose traditional long-interval meta-actions\ninto frame-level meta-actions, enabling a sequential interplay between\nautoregressive meta-action prediction and meta-action-conditioned trajectory\ngeneration. This decomposition ensures strict alignment between each trajectory\nsegment and its corresponding meta-action, achieving a consistent and unified\ntask formulation across the entire trajectory span and significantly reducing\ncomplexity. Moreover, we propose a staged pre-training process to decouple the\nlearning of basic motion dynamics from the integration of high-level decision\ncontrol, which offers flexibility, stability, and modularity. Experimental\nresults validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating improved\ntrajectory adaptivity and responsiveness to dynamic decision-making scenarios.\nWe provide the video document and dataset, which are available at\nhttps://arma-traj.github.io/.",

Existing approaches\nprimarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is\nexpensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating\nmultiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one.\nAlthough effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly\nscoring, limiting its practical application.

To\nreduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model\nto self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL).

We investigate the impact of Log-Gabor, Gabor, and\nstandard convolutional layers on semantic segmentation performance through\nextensive experimentation.

MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four\nphases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery,\nand knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs\nin real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing\nthe GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes\nthrough pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by\nrolling back to previously stable states.

In this paper, we study both the theoretical and algorithmic\naspects of likelihood-based approaches for multilook coherent imaging,\nproviding a rigorous framework for analysis and method development.

Data complexity stems from technologies\nlike imaging, remote sensing, wearables, and genomic sequencing.\nSimultaneously, black-box models -- especially deep neural networks -- have\nachieved impressive results. This combination raises new challenges for\nuncertainty quantification and statistical inference, which we term \"black-box\ninference.\"\n  Black-box inference is difficult due to the lack of traditional modeling\nassumptions and the opaque behavior of modern estimators. These make it hard to\ncharacterize the distribution of estimation errors. A popular solution is\npost-hoc randomization, which, under mild assumptions like exchangeability, can\nyield valid uncertainty quantification. Such methods range from classical\ntechniques like permutation tests, jackknife, and bootstrap, to recent\ninnovations like conformal inference. These approaches typically need little\nknowledge of data distributions or the internal working of estimators. Many\nrely on the idea that estimators behave similarly under small data changes -- a\nconcept formalized as stability. Over time, stability has become a key\nprinciple in data science, influencing generalization error, privacy, and\nadaptive inference.\n  This article investigates cross-validation (CV) -- a widely used resampling\nmethod -- through the lens of stability. We first review recent theoretical\nresults on CV for estimating generalization error and model selection under\nstability. We then examine uncertainty quantification for CV-based risk\nestimates.

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for timely,\ncost-effective last-mile delivery have increased interest in collaborative\nlogistics. This research introduces a novel collaborative synchronized\nmulti-platform vehicle routing problem with drones and robots (VRP-DR), where a\nfleet of $\\mathcal{M}$ trucks, $\\mathcal{N}$ drones and $\\mathcal{K}$ robots,\ncooperatively delivers parcels. Trucks serve as mobile platforms, enabling the\nlaunching, retrieving, and en-route charging of drones and robots, thereby\naddressing critical limitations such as restricted payload capacities, limited\nrange, and battery constraints. The VRP-DR incorporates five realistic\nfeatures: (1) multi-visit service per trip, (2) multi-trip operations, (3)\nflexible docking, allowing returns to the same or different trucks (4) cyclic\nand acyclic operations, enabling return to the same or different nodes; and (5)\nen-route charging, enabling drones and robots to recharge while being\ntransported on the truck, maximizing operational efficiency by utilizing idle\ntransit time. The VRP-DR is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP)\nto minimize both operational costs and makespan. To overcome the computational\nchallenges of solving large-scale instances, a scalable heuristic algorithm,\nFINDER (Flexible INtegrated Delivery with Energy Recharge), is developed, to\nprovide efficient, near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments across various\ninstance sizes evaluate the performance of the MILP and heuristic approaches in\nterms of solution quality and computation time. The results demonstrate\nsignificant time savings of the combined delivery mode over the truck-only mode\nand substantial cost reductions from enabling multi-visits. The study also\nprovides insights into the effects of en-route charging, docking flexibility,\ndrone count, speed, and payload capacity on system performance.",

To address\nthis issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance\nforecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision.\nSpecifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating\ntheir accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using\ncontextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from\nboth local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models\ndemonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and\nsignificantly improves forecasting reliability.",

By\nbuilding on available results on the SVD of the sketched matrix $SA$ derived by\nGilbert, Park, and Wakin (Proc. of SPARS-2013), a novel decomposition of $A$,\nthe $S^{\\top\\!} S$-SVD, is proposed, which is exact with high probability, and\nin which the left singular vectors are orthonormal with respect to a\n(semi-)norm defined by the sketching matrix $S$.

For\nexample, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be\nboth surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper\ncrafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical\nfor a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion\nfor Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the\nnew task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with\natypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts\natypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their\nuser-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to\nrerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system\ndevelopment and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are\nmanually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially\ngenerated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect\nutility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic\nselection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based\njudgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that\nserendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with\nground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual\nannotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we\nhope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in\nthis paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go\nbeyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.\n  The datasets and the code are made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/ramituncc49er/ATARS .",

However, neither instability alone can explain the dynamics when\nboth mechanisms are present. We identify a previously unseen multi-modal\ninstability emerging from their coexistence. When the denser fluid is\npolydimethylsiloxane, the mixed region at a high density contrast (Atwood\nnumber=0.9) spans a vibration amplitude range approximately twice the\ngravitational acceleration. Using Floquet stability analysis, we show how\nvibrations govern transitions between the RT and Faraday instabilities, leading\nto contention between these instabilities rather than resonant enhancement. The\ninitial transient growth is represented by the exponential modal growth of the\nmost unstable Floquet exponent, along with its accompanying periodic behavior.\nDirect numerical simulations validate these findings and track interface\nbreakup into the multiscale and nonlinear regimes. Specifically, we show that\ngrowing RT modes nonlinearly suppress Faraday responses even when the initial\ngrowth rate of the Faraday instability is 3.63 times that of RT, so a\nbidirectional competition hinders their sustained coexistence.",

    "abstract": "Layered hybrid perovskites containing larger organic cations have\ndemonstrated superior environmental stability, but the presence of these\ninsulating spacers also strengthens the exciton binding energy, which\ncontributes to reduced carrier separation. The consequences of increased\nbinding energy on device efficiency are still not fully documented, and binding\nenergy measurements are often conducted at cryogenic temperatures where\nlinewidths are decreased and a series of hydrogen-like bound states can be\nidentified, but not under ambient conditions where devices are expected to\noperate. In contrast to the quenching observed in 3D perovskites such as\nmethylammonium lead iodide, where exciton binding energies are thought to\ndecrease at higher temperatures, we present evidence for a smaller excitonic\nradius at higher temperatures in the $n=5$ member of butylammonium-spaced\nmethylammonium lead iodide, (BA)$_2$(MA)$_{n-1}$Pb$_n$I$_{3n+1}$. We measured\nthe temperature-dependent diamagnetic shift coefficient in magnetic fields up\nto 40\\,T, which is one-third as large at room temperature as those at cryogenic\ntemperatures. In both the ideal 2D and 3D hydrogen models, this trend would\nindicate that the exciton binding energy more than triples at room temperature.",

To reduce the carbon\nfootprint and financial costs of training, some data mixing methods, which\napplied the optimized domain weights of a small proxy model to train a larger\none, were proposed. However, these methods did not evolute with the training\ndynamics. The existing online data mixing (ODM) method addressed this\nlimitation by applying the multi-armed bandit algorithm as data sampling\nstrategy. Yet, it did not consider the intra-domain interactions. In this\npaper, we develop an actor-critic based online data mixing (AC-ODM) method,\nwhich captures the varying domain weights by auxiliary actor-critic networks\nand consider the intra-domain interactions with the reward function. While\nconstructing the dataset to pretrain a large target LLM, we directly apply the\nactor, which is trained with a small proxy LLM as the environment, as the\nsampling strategy. The transfer of sampling strategy can not only ensure the\nefficiency of dynamical data mixing, but also expedite the convergence of\npretraining the target LLM. Numerical results demonstrate that AC-ODM-410M,\nwhich invokes the sampling strategy obtained by a proxy LLM with 410M\nparameters, reaching the optimal validation perplexity of ODM 71% faster, and\nimproves performance on the zero-shot MMLU benchmark by 27.5% of accuracy,\nabout 2.23x better on pass@1 of HumanEval benchmark.",

Existing\napproaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities:\nToken-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage\nsignals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training\nan accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g.,\nGRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward,\nleading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we\npropose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages\nsegment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a\nbetter balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level\nmethods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods,\nenabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a\ncritic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible\nsegment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy\noptimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask\nstrategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain\nfor short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and\nchain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point\nimprovements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K.

However, long reasoning dilutes visual tokens,\ncausing visual information to receive less attention and may trigger\nhallucinations. Although introducing text-only reflection processes shows\npromise in language models, we demonstrate that it is insufficient to suppress\nhallucinations in VLMs. To address this issue, we introduce Qwen-LookAgain\n(Qwen-LA), a novel VLRM designed to mitigate hallucinations by incorporating a\nvision-text reflection process that guides the model to re-attention visual\ninformation during reasoning. We first propose a reinforcement learning method\nBalanced Reflective Policy Optimization (BRPO), which guides the model to\ndecide when to generate vision-text reflection on its own and balance the\nnumber and length of reflections. Then, we formally prove that VLRMs lose\nattention to visual tokens as reasoning progresses, and demonstrate that\nsupplementing visual information during reflection enhances visual attention.\nTherefore, during training and inference, Visual Token COPY and Visual Token\nROUTE are introduced to force the model to re-attention visual information at\nthe visual level, addressing the limitations of text-only reflection.\nExperiments on multiple visual QA datasets and hallucination metrics indicate\nthat Qwen-LA achieves leading accuracy performance while reducing\nhallucinations.

However, existing approaches often inadequately\noverlook the theoretical and practical implications of system and data\nheterogeneity, thereby failing to optimize the overall training efficiency,\nparticularly in terms of wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose an adaptive\nfederated LoRA strategy with independent client sampling to minimize the\nconvergence wall-clock time of federated fine-tuning under both computation and\ncommunication heterogeneity. We first derive a new convergence bound for\nfederated LoRA with arbitrary and independent client sampling, notably without\nrequiring the stringent bounded gradient assumption. Then, we introduce an\nadaptive bandwidth allocation scheme that accounts for heterogeneous client\nresources and system bandwidth constraints. Based on the derived theory, we\nformulate and solve a non-convex optimization problem to jointly determine the\nLoRA sketching ratios and sampling probabilities, aiming to minimize wall-clock\nconvergence time. An efficient and low-complexity algorithm is developed to\napproximate the solution. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our\napproach significantly reduces wall-clock training time compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods across various models and datasets.",

In\nseveral past years neural networks models such as YOLOv11 and Detectron2 have\nrevolutionized visual data analysis, but their application to domain-specific\ncultural artifacts - such as manuscripts and incunabula - remains limited by\nthe absence of methodologies that address structural feature extraction and\nsemantic interoperability. In this position paper, we argue, that the\nintegration of neural networks with semantic technologies represents a paradigm\nshift in cultural heritage digitization processes. We present the Metadata\nEnrichment Model (MEM), a conceptual framework designed to enrich metadata for\ndigitized collections by combining fine-tuned computer vision models, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) and structured knowledge graphs. The Multilayer Vision\nMechanism (MVM) appears as the key innovation of MEM. This iterative process\nimproves visual analysis by dynamically detecting nested features, such as text\nwithin seals or images within stamps. To expose MEM's potential, we apply it to\na dataset of digitized incunabula from the Jagiellonian Digital Library and\nrelease a manually annotated dataset of 105 manuscript pages.

Current\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms are computationally expensive as they\nrequire extensive function evaluations, which is prohibitive for real-world\napplications. In addition, existing methods ignore valuable domain information\ninherent in real-world tensor data and lack transparency in their identified TN\nstructures. To this end, we propose a novel TN-SS framework, termed the tnLLM,\nwhich incorporates domain information about the data and harnesses the\nreasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to directly predict\nsuitable TN structures. The proposed framework involves a domain-aware\nprompting pipeline which instructs the LLM to infer suitable TN structures\nbased on the real-world relationships between tensor modes. In this way, our\napproach is capable of not only iteratively optimizing the objective function,\nbut also generating domain-aware explanations for the identified structures.\nExperimental results demonstrate that tnLLM achieves comparable TN-SS objective\nfunction values with much fewer function evaluations compared to SOTA\nalgorithms.

We propose a\nnovel Normal Mixture Quasi-Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NM-QMLE) method to\naddress the limitations of conventional quasi-maximum likelihood estimation\n(QMLE) under non-Gaussian conditions. By incorporating a normal mixture\ndistribution into the quasi-likelihood framework, NM-QMLE effectively captures\nboth heavy-tailed behavior and skewness. A critical contribution of this paper\nis addressing the often-overlooked challenge of selecting the appropriate\nnumber of mixture components, $K$, a key parameter that significantly impacts\nmodel performance. We systematically evaluate the effectiveness of different\nmodel selection criteria. Under regularity conditions, we establish the\nconsistency and asymptotic normality of the NM-QMLE estimator for DAR($p$)\nmodels. Numerical simulations demonstrate that NM-QMLE outperforms commonly\nadopted QMLE methods in terms of estimation accuracy, particularly when the\ninnovation distribution deviates from normality. Our results also show that\nwhile criteria like BIC and ICL improve parameter estimation of $K$, fixing a\nsmall order of components provides comparable accuracy. To further validate its\npractical applicability, we apply NM-QMLE to empirical data from the S\\&P 500\nindex and assess its performance through Value at Risk (VaR) estimation. The\nempirical findings highlight the effectiveness of NM-QMLE in modeling\nreal-world financial data and improving risk assessment.

Resolving fields\nranging from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers, as well as across\nmaterial junctions, is particularly important since these fields often\ndetermine the functional properties of devices. However, it is also challenging\nsince they are orders of magnitude smaller than atomic electric fields. Thus,\nsubtle changes in diffraction conditions lead to significant changes in the\nmeasured MRSTEM signal. One established approach to partially overcome this\nproblem is precession electron diffraction, in which the incident electron beam\nis continuously precessed while precession-averaged diffraction patterns are\nacquired. Here, we present an alternative approach in which we sequentially\ntilt the incident electron beam and record a full diffraction pattern for each\ntilt and spatial position. This approach requires no hardware modification of\nthe instrument and enables the use of arbitrary beam tilt patterns that can be\noptimized for specific applications. Furthermore, recording diffraction\npatterns for every beam tilt allows access to additional information. In this\nwork, we use this information to create virtual large-angle convergent beam\nelectron diffraction (vLACBED) patterns to assess MRSTEM data quality and\nimprove field measurements by applying different data analysis methods beyond\nsimple averaging.

    "abstract": "We study the stable pair theory on toric surfaces and determine the virtual\ntangent space over the fixed point loci. Further, we present a program to\ncompute the virtual Euler characteristic, illustrated by the case of the\nprojective plane. As an application, conjectures regarding rationality and\nsymmetry are supported by verification of a special case.",

    "abstract": "The substructure of jets in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) has garnered\nsignificant attention with the advent of infrared- and collinear-safe\nclustering algorithms and observables. A key question emerging from these\nstudies is how in-jet emissions at soft and hard energy scales, across\ncollinear and wide angles relative to the emitter, differ with the mass of the\nemitting parton. The Lund jet plane (LJP) is a perturbatively well-defined\nsubstructure observable that maps the radiation pattern of jets onto a plane,\nvisually distinguishing emissions with different kinematic properties.\nComparing LJP for jets containing hadrons of low versus high mass enables the\ntesting of QCD splitting functions from first-principles calculations across\nboth soft and hard regimes and at different radiation angles. This article\npresents the first measurement of the LJP for light-quark-enriched and\nbeauty-initiated jets at center-of-mass energy of 13\\tev at LHCb. This marks\nthe first direct observation of the dead-cone effect in beauty-quark jets,\nmeasured in the collinear region of the LJP.",

    "abstract": "Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine\nlearning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into\nlow-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used\nin GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we\npropose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our\napproach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps\nsubgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input\nsubgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled\ndistribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the\nWasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the\nsimilarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive\nlearning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate\nthat \\method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of\nSSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the\ngenerated contrastive pairs.",

Biases\nassociated with age, race, and gender in a multi-cohort dataset, as well as the\ninfluence of proxy features encoding these sensitive attributes, are\ninvestigated. The reliability of various fairness definitions and metrics in\nthe identification of such biases is also assessed. Based on the most\nappropriate fairness measures, a comparative analysis of widely used\npre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing bias mitigation strategies\nis performed. Moreover, a novel composite measure is introduced to quantify the\ntrade-off between fairness and performance by considering the F1-score and the\nequalized odds ratio, making it appropriate for medical diagnostic\napplications. The obtained results reveal the existence of biases related to\nage and race, while no significant gender bias is observed. The deployed\nmitigation strategies yield varying improvements in terms of fairness across\nthe different sensitive attributes and studied subproblems. For race and\ngender, Reject Option Classification improves equalized odds by 46% and 57%,\nrespectively, and achieves harmonic mean scores of 0.75 and 0.80 in the MCI\nversus AD subproblem, whereas for age, in the same subproblem, adversarial\ndebiasing yields the highest equalized odds improvement of 40% with a harmonic\nmean score of 0.69.

The\nvalidity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can\nnow be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of\nradio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the\nlarge-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the\nexpectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a\nperturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed\ndipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole\nagrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger,\ndemonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear\nisotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy\nin at least one of them.

Built on over a decade of\npractical experience, CASE underwent a major architectural rework in 2024,\ntransitioning from a microservice-based design to a streamlined monolithic\narchitecture. This evolution significantly improved maintainability,\nflexibility, and accessibility to deployment, particularly for institutions\nwith limited technical capacity. CASE has been successfully deployed across\ndiverse domains, powering national disease surveillance platforms, supporting\npost-COVID cohort studies, and enabling real-time sentiment analysis during\npolitical events. These applications, involving tens of thousands of\nparticipants, demonstrate the framework's scalability, versatility, and\npractical value. This paper describes the foundations of CASE, details its\narchitectural evolution, and presents lessons learned from real-world\ndeployments. We establish CASE as a mature and reusable research infrastructure\nthat balances sophisticated functionality with practical implementation,\naddressing the critical global need for sustainable and institutionally\ncontrolled data collection systems.",

Predictive models focus on estimating the\nmean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the\nfull distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to\nover-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was\nshown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the\nstochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We\nuse this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M\nparameters and a low latency, our system is designed for real-time streaming\nwith a lightweight architecture. Experiments show that our system improves over\nthe first stage in terms of NISQA-MOS metric. Finally, through an ablation\nstudy, we show the importance of noisy conditioning in our system.

We argue that these methods fail to capture critical components\nof epistemic uncertainty, particularly due to the often-neglected component of\nmodel bias. To show this, we make use of a more fine-grained taxonomy of\nepistemic uncertainty sources in machine learning models, and analyse how the\nclassical bias-variance decomposition of the expected prediction error can be\ndecomposed into different parts reflecting these uncertainties. By using a\nsimulation-based evaluation protocol which encompasses epistemic uncertainty\ndue to both procedural- and data-driven uncertainty components, we illustrate\nthat current methods rarely capture the full spectrum of epistemic uncertainty.\nThrough theoretical insights and synthetic experiments, we show that high model\nbias can lead to misleadingly low estimates of epistemic uncertainty, and\ncommon second-order uncertainty quantification methods systematically blur\nbias-induced errors into aleatoric estimates, thereby underrepresenting\nepistemic uncertainty. Our findings underscore that meaningful aleatoric\nestimates are feasible only if all relevant sources of epistemic uncertainty\nare properly represented.",

Many real-world learning settings\nintroduce sources of epistemic uncertainty that can not be resolved on the\nbasis of training (source) data alone: The source data may arise from multiple\ntasks (multitask learning), the target data may differ systematically from the\nsource data tasks (distribution shift), and/or the learner may not arrive at an\naccurate characterization of the source data (imperfect learning). We introduce\na principled definition of epistemic error, and provide a generic,\ndecompositional epistemic error bound. Our error bound is the first to (i)\nconsider epistemic error specifically, (ii) accommodate all the sources of\nepistemic uncertainty above, and (iii) separately attribute the error to each\nof multiple aspects of the learning procedure and environment. As corollaries\nof the generic result, we provide (i) epistemic error bounds specialized to the\nsettings of Bayesian transfer learning and distribution shift within\n$\\epsilon$-neighborhoods, and (ii) a set of corresponding generalization\nbounds.

While distributed storage can\nreduce costs and increase reliability, the heterogeneity in storage capacity,\nI/O performance, and failure rates of storage resources makes their efficient\nuse a challenge. Further, node failures are common and can lead to data\nunavailability and even data loss. Erasure coding is a common resiliency\nstrategy implemented in storage systems to mitigate failures by striping data\nacross storage locations. However, erasure coding is computationally expensive\nand existing systems do not consider the heterogeneous resources and their\nvaried capacity and performance when placing data chunks. We tackle the\nchallenges of using erasure coding with distributed and heterogeneous nodes,\naiming to store as much data as possible, minimize encoding and decoding time,\nand meeting user-defined reliability requirements for each data item. We\npropose two new dynamic scheduling algorithms, D-Rex LB and D-Rex SC, that\nadaptively choose erasure coding parameters and map chunks to heterogeneous\nnodes. D-Rex SC achieves robust performance for both storage utilization and\nthroughput, at a higher computational cost, while D-Rex LB is faster but with\nslightly less competitive performance. In addition, we propose two greedy\nalgorithms, GreedyMinStorage and GreedyLeastUsed, that optimize for storage\nutilization and load balancing, respectively. Our experimental evaluation shows\nthat our dynamic schedulers store, on average, 45% more data items without\nsignificantly degrading I/O throughput compared to state-of-the-art algorithms,\nwhile GreedyLeastUsed is able to store 21% more data items while also\nincreasing throughput.",

This perspective\noffers a new lens on why high LRs prevent training from converging to the loss\nminima and how different LRs lead to stabilization at different loss levels. We\nempirically validate the free energy framework on both underparameterized (UP)\nand overparameterized (OP) models. UP models consistently follow free energy\nminimization, with temperature increasing monotonically with LR, while for OP\nmodels, the temperature effectively drops to zero at low LRs, causing SGD to\nminimize the loss directly and converge to an optimum.

    "abstract": "Video captions play a crucial role in text-to-video generation tasks, as\ntheir quality directly influences the semantic coherence and visual fidelity of\nthe generated videos. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) have\ndemonstrated significant potential in caption generation, existing benchmarks\ninadequately address fine-grained evaluation, particularly in capturing\nspatial-temporal details critical for video generation. To address this gap, we\nintroduce the Fine-grained Video Caption Evaluation Benchmark (VCapsBench), the\nfirst large-scale fine-grained benchmark comprising 5,677 (5K+) videos and\n109,796 (100K+) question-answer pairs. These QA-pairs are systematically\nannotated across 21 fine-grained dimensions (e.g., camera movement, and shot\ntype) that are empirically proven critical for text-to-video generation. We\nfurther introduce three metrics (Accuracy (AR), Inconsistency Rate (IR),\nCoverage Rate (CR)), and an automated evaluation pipeline leveraging large\nlanguage model (LLM) to verify caption quality via contrastive QA-pairs\nanalysis. By providing actionable insights for caption optimization, our\nbenchmark can advance the development of robust text-to-video models.

Recently, these questions have also\nserved as benchmarks for evaluating large language models' (LLMs) neurosurgical\nknowledge. This study aims to assess the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs\non neurosurgery board-like questions and to evaluate their robustness to the\ninclusion of distractor statements. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted\nusing 28 large language models. These models were tested on 2,904 neurosurgery\nboard examination questions derived from the CNS-SANS. Additionally, the study\nintroduced a distraction framework to assess the fragility of these models. The\nframework incorporated simple, irrelevant distractor statements containing\npolysemous words with clinical meanings used in non-clinical contexts to\ndetermine the extent to which such distractions degrade model performance on\nstandard medical benchmarks. 6 of the 28 tested LLMs achieved board-passing\noutcomes, with the top-performing models scoring over 15.7% above the passing\nthreshold. When exposed to distractions, accuracy across various model\narchitectures was significantly reduced-by as much as 20.4%-with one model\nfailing that had previously passed. Both general-purpose and medical\nopen-source models experienced greater performance declines compared to\nproprietary variants when subjected to the added distractors. While current\nLLMs demonstrate an impressive ability to answer neurosurgery board-like exam\nquestions, their performance is markedly vulnerable to extraneous, distracting\ninformation.

Evaluating their effectiveness and further suggesting optimization\nopportunities often rely on high-quality tests to demonstrate the performance\nbottlenecks presented in the program.

We present WEDGE, a framework for generating\nperformance-stressing input given the program under test. WEDGE synthesizes\nexplicit performance-characterizing constraints in the form of branch\nconditions to partition the programs' execution space into performance-specific\nregions. When integrated with the coverage-guided fuzzer, reaching different\nregions introduces explicit rewards for test generation to explore inefficient\nimplementations. Our evaluation shows that WEDGE introduces a significant\nslowdown compared to the tests in CodeContests and those claimed to be\noptimized by existing approaches. From the utility perspective, integrating our\ntests substantially improves the existing code optimization approaches that\nrely on test-driven execution feedback.

While\nsignificant progress has been made, existing approaches mainly focus on\nwatertight, object-level 3D models. The orientation of large-scale,\nnon-watertight 3D scenes remains an underexplored challenge. To address this\ngap, we propose DACPO (Divide-And-Conquer Point Orientation), a novel framework\nthat leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy for scalable and robust point\ncloud orientation. Rather than attempting to orient an unbounded scene at once,\nDACPO segments the input point cloud into smaller, manageable blocks, processes\neach block independently, and integrates the results through a global\noptimization stage. For each block, we introduce a two-step process: estimating\ninitial normal orientations by a randomized greedy method and refining them by\nan adapted iterative Poisson surface reconstruction. To achieve consistency\nacross blocks, we model inter-block relationships using an an undirected graph,\nwhere nodes represent blocks and edges connect spatially adjacent blocks. To\nreliably evaluate orientation consistency between adjacent blocks, we introduce\nthe concept of the visible connected region, which defines the region over\nwhich visibility-based assessments are performed. The global integration is\nthen formulated as a 0-1 integer-constrained optimization problem, with block\nflip states as binary variables. Despite the combinatorial nature of the\nproblem, DACPO remains scalable by limiting the number of blocks (typically a\nfew hundred for 3D scenes) involved in the optimization. Experiments on\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate DACPO's strong performance, particularly in\nchallenging large-scale, non-watertight scenarios where existing methods often\nfail.

Of particular importance, CFGRL can operate\nwithout explicitly learning a value function, allowing us to generalize simple\nsupervised methods (e.g., goal-conditioned behavioral cloning) to further\nprioritize optimality, gaining performance for \"free\" across the board.",

This paper presents a novel\ntethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground\nVehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection\ntasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The\nsystem extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether\nconnected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the\nhardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability\nand describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of\nopen-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The\nproposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct\nLiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated\ntrajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the\nsystem through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to\nestimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3)\nan inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities.\nExperimental results confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system, its\ncapacity to operate in GNSS-denied environments, and its potential for\nlong-endurance, autonomous inspection and monitoring tasks.",

While most research focuses on sentiment polarity\n(e.g., positive, negative, neutral), fine-grained emotion classification in app\nreviews remains underexplored. Fine-grained emotion classification is thus\nneeded to better understand users' affective responses and support downstream\ntasks such as feature-emotion analysis, user-oriented release planning, and\nissue triaging. This paper addresses this gap by identifying and addressing the\nchallenges and limitations in fine-grained emotion analysis in the context of\napp reviews.

Through an iterative\nhuman annotation process, we define clear annotation guidelines and document\nkey challenges in emotion classification. Additionally, we evaluate the\nfeasibility of automating emotion annotation using large language models,\nassessing their cost-effectiveness and agreement with human-labelled data. Our\nfindings reveal that while large language models significantly reduce manual\neffort and maintain substantial agreement with human annotators, full\nautomation remains challenging due to the complexity of emotional\ninterpretation.

    "abstract": "Existing two-stage Scene Graph Generation (SGG) frameworks typically\nincorporate a detector to extract relationship features and a classifier to\ncategorize these relationships; therefore, the training paradigm follows a\ncausal chain structure, where the detector's inputs determine the classifier's\ninputs, which in turn influence the final predictions. However, such a causal\nchain structure can yield spurious correlations between the detector's inputs\nand the final predictions, i.e., the prediction of a certain relationship may\nbe influenced by other relationships. This influence can induce at least two\nobservable biases: tail relationships are predicted as head ones, and\nforeground relationships are predicted as background ones; notably, the latter\nbias is seldom discussed in the literature. To address this issue, we propose\nreconstructing the causal chain structure into a reverse causal structure,\nwherein the classifier's inputs are treated as the confounder, and both the\ndetector's inputs and the final predictions are viewed as causal variables.\nSpecifically, we term the reconstructed causal paradigm as the Reverse causal\nFramework for SGG (RcSGG). RcSGG initially employs the proposed Active Reverse\nEstimation (ARE) to intervene on the confounder to estimate the reverse\ncausality, \\ie the causality from final predictions to the classifier's inputs.\nThen, the Maximum Information Sampling (MIS) is suggested to enhance the\nreverse causality estimation further by considering the relationship\ninformation. Theoretically, RcSGG can mitigate the spurious correlations\ninherent in the SGG framework, subsequently eliminating the induced biases.\nComprehensive experiments on popular benchmarks and diverse SGG frameworks show\nthe state-of-the-art mean recall rate.",

For a standard n-class classification task, we extend the\nclassifier to an (n+1)-class model by introducing a \"garbage\" class, initially\npopulated with random gaussian noise to represent outlier inputs. After each\ntraining epoch, we use network inversion to reconstruct input images\ncorresponding to all output classes that initially appear as noisy and\nincoherent and are therefore excluded to the garbage class for retraining the\nclassifier. This cycle of training, inversion, and exclusion continues\niteratively till the inverted samples begin to resemble the in-distribution\ndata more closely, suggesting that the classifier has learned to carve out\nmeaningful decision boundaries while sanitising the class manifolds by pushing\nOOD content into the garbage class. During inference, this training scheme\nenables the model to effectively detect and reject OOD samples by classifying\nthem into the garbage class.

Nonetheless, while the\ninterest in missing data visualization has increased in the last decade, it is\nstill a relatively overlooked research topic with a comparably small number of\npublications, few of which address scalability issues. Efficient visual\nanalysis approaches are needed to enable exploration of missingness structures\nin large and high-dimensional data, and to support informed decision-making in\ncontext of potential data quality issues. This paper suggests a set of quality\nmetrics for identification of patterns of interest for understanding of\nstructural missingness in data. These quality metrics can be used as guidance\nin visual analysis, as demonstrated through a use case exploring structural\nmissingness in data from a real-life walking monitoring study.

    "abstract": "Engineered timber is pivotal to low-carbon construction, but moisture uptake\nduring its service life can compromise structural reliability and impede reuse\nwithin a circular economy model. Despite growing interest, quantitative\nstandards for classifying the reusability of moisture-exposed timber are still\nlacking. This study develops a probabilistic framework to determine the\npost-exposure reusability of engineered timber. Laminated specimens were soaked\nto full saturation, dried to 25% moisture content, and subjected to destructive\nthree-point flexural testing. Structural integrity was quantified by a\nresidual-performance metric that assigns 80% weight to the retained flexural\nmodulus and 20% to the retained maximum load, benchmarked against unexposed\ncontrols. A hierarchical Bayesian multinomial logistic model with horseshoe\npriors, calibrated through Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling, jointly infers\nthe decision threshold separating three Modern Methods of Construction (MMC)\nreuse levels and predicts those levels from five field-measurable features:\ndensity, moisture content, specimen size, grain orientation, and surface\nhardness. Results indicate that a single wet-dry cycle preserves 70% of\nspecimens above the 0.90 residual-performance threshold (Level 1), whereas\nrepeated cycling lowers the mean residual to 0.78 and reallocates many\nspecimens to Levels 2-3. The proposed framework yields quantified decision\nboundaries and a streamlined on-site testing protocol, providing a foundation\nfor robust quality assurance standards.",

    "abstract": "Describing the interactions of water molecules is one of the most common, yet\ncritical, tasks in molecular dynamics simulations. Because of its unique\nproperties, hundreds of attempts have been made to construct an ideal\ninteraction potential model for water. In various studies, the models have been\nevaluated based on their ability to reproduce different properties of water.\nThis work focuses on the atomic-scale structure in the liquid phase of water.\nForty-four classical water potential models are compared to identify those that\ncan accurately describe the structure in alignment with experimental results.\nIn addition to some older models that are still popular today, new or\nre-parametrized classical models using effective pair-additive potentials that\nhave appeared in recent years are examined. Molecular dynamics simulations were\nperformed over a wide range of temperatures and the resulting trajectories were\nused to calculate the partial radial distribution functions. The total\nscattering structure factors were compared with data from neutron and X-ray\ndiffraction experiments. Our analysis indicates that models with more than four\ninteraction sites, as well as flexible or polarizable models with higher\ncomputational requirements, do not provide a significant advantage in\naccurately describing the structure. On the other hand, recent three-site\nmodels have made considerable progress in this area, although the best\nagreement with experimental data over the entire temperature range was achieved\nwith four-site, TIP4P-type models.",

Furthermore, we introduce a novel sparse-regularization\nmethod that embeds the concept of rank-based selective sparsity into the KGC\nregularizer. The core idea is to selectively penalize those components with\nsignificant features in the embedding vector, thus effectively ignoring many\ncomponents that contribute little and may only represent noise.

To overcome the lack of\ncompactness and continuity issues due to common noise, we exploit the point\nprocess representation of the Poisson random measure with finite intensity and\npropose a pathwise formulation by freezing a sample path of the common noise.\nWe first study a pathwise relaxed control problem in an auxiliary setup without\ncommon noise but with finite deterministic jumping times over the finite\nhorizon. By employing the compactification argument for the pathwise relaxed\ncontrol problem with Skorokhod topology, we establish the existence of optimal\ncontrols in the pathwise formulation. To address the original problem, the main\nchallenge is to close the gap between the problem in the original model with\ncommon noise and the pathwise formulation. With the help of concatenation\ntechniques over the sequence of deterministic jumping times, we develop a new\ntool, also interpreted as the superposition principle in the pathwise\nformulation, to draw a relationship between the pathwise relaxed control\nproblem and the pathwise measure-valued control problem associated to\nFokker-Planck equation.

In this paper, we investigate this issue for telecom-tuned LLMs using\nthree representative datasets featured by the GenAINet initiative. We show that\nsafety degradation persists even for structured and seemingly harmless datasets\nsuch as 3GPP standards and tabular records, indicating that telecom-specific\ndata is not immune to safety erosion during fine-tuning. We further extend our\nanalysis to publicly available Telecom LLMs trained via continual pre-training,\nrevealing that safety alignment is often severely lacking, primarily due to the\nomission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues in both\nfine-tuned and pre-trained models, we conduct extensive experiments and\nevaluate three safety realignment defenses (SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, and\nSafeMERGE) using established red-teaming benchmarks. The results show that,\nacross all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety after\nharmful degradation without compromising downstream task performance, leading\nto Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models.

    "abstract": "Existing neural rendering-based urban scene reconstruction methods mainly\nfocus on the Interpolated View Synthesis (IVS) setting that synthesizes from\nviews close to training camera trajectory. However, IVS can not guarantee the\non-par performance of the novel view outside the training camera distribution\n(\\textit{e.g.}, looking left, right, or downwards), which limits the\ngeneralizability of the urban reconstruction application. Previous methods have\noptimized it via image diffusion, but they fail to handle text-ambiguous or\nlarge unseen view angles due to coarse-grained control of text-only diffusion.\nIn this paper, we design UrbanCraft, which surmounts the Extrapolated View\nSynthesis (EVS) problem using hierarchical sem-geometric representations\nserving as additional priors. Specifically, we leverage the partially\nobservable scene to reconstruct coarse semantic and geometric primitives,\nestablishing a coarse scene-level prior through an occupancy grid as the base\nrepresentation. Additionally, we incorporate fine instance-level priors from 3D\nbounding boxes to enhance object-level details and spatial relationships.\nBuilding on this, we propose the \\textbf{H}ierarchical\n\\textbf{S}emantic-Geometric-\\textbf{G}uided Variational Score Distillation\n(HSG-VSD), which integrates semantic and geometric constraints from pretrained\nUrbanCraft2D into the score distillation sampling process, forcing the\ndistribution to be consistent with the observable scene.

This paper develops existing computational models for locating\nUnstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) in polynomial dynamical systems using\nSum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization technique and proposes a numerical framework\nto converge UPOs for the Planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (PCR3BP)\nin astrodynamics. This is done by developing the polynomial SOS optimization\ntechnique with extension to systems with non-polynomial and Hamiltonian\ndynamics. First, we demonstrate and exploit the dependency of convergence of\ntight bounds on an observable of interest with varying scaling factors for\nlarge polynomial degrees. SOS optimization is then used to compute nonnegative\npolynomials, the minimization sublevel sets of which, approximately localise\nparts of the corresponding UPO. Improvements in current non-linear optimization\ntechniques are suggested to compute a large number of points inside the\nrelevant sublevel sets. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO\ncomputations with existing algorithms. The distinguishing feature of such UPOs\nis that they optimize the long-time average of an input observable of interest\nwhich is a function of state variables. For the PCR3BP this means that such\norbits in space can be traversed indefinitely in time without continuous fuel\nexpenditure.

This\nwork examines the effectiveness and generalisability of models utilising\nelementary head motion units, termed kinemes, for depression severity\nestimation. Specifically, we consider three depression datasets from different\nwestern cultures (German: AVEC2013, Australian: Blackdog and American: Pitt\ndatasets) with varied contextual and recording settings to investigate the\ngeneralisability of the derived kineme patterns via two methods: (i) k-fold\ncross-validation over individual/multiple datasets, and (ii) model reuse on\nother datasets.

However, this comes at the cost\nof requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training\nefficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance\ndegradation.

Front-end\nwarehouses are placed in residential areas to ensure the timely delivery of\nfresh goods and are usually in small size. This brings the challenge of\ndeciding which goods to stock and in what quantities, taking into account\ncapacity constraints. To address this issue, traditional predict-then-optimize\n(PTO) methods that predict sales and then decide on inventory often don't align\nprediction with inventory goals, as well as fail to prioritize consumer\nsatisfaction. This paper proposes a multi-task\nOptimize-then-Predict-then-Optimize (OTPTO) approach that jointly optimizes\nproduct selection and inventory management, aiming to increase consumer\nsatisfaction by maximizing the full order fulfillment rate. Our method employs\na 0-1 mixed integer programming model OM1 to determine historically optimal\ninventory levels, and then uses a product selection model PM1 and the stocking\nmodel PM2 for prediction. The combined results are further refined through a\npost-processing algorithm OM2. Experimental results from JD.com's 7Fresh\nplatform demonstrate the robustness and significant advantages of our OTPTO\nmethod. Compared to the PTO approach, our OTPTO method substantially enhances\nthe full order fulfillment rate by 4.34% (a relative increase of 7.05%) and\nnarrows the gap to the optimal full order fulfillment rate by 5.27%. These\nfindings substantiate the efficacy of the OTPTO method in managing inventory at\nfront-end warehouses of fresh e-commerce platforms and provide valuable\ninsights for future research in this domain.",

For this reason, the\nlearning rate (LR) is often decreased when the size of a model is increased.\nSuch a simple solution is not enough in the case of speech-to-text (S2T)\ntrainings, where evolved and more complex variants of the Transformer\narchitecture -- e.g., Conformer or Branchformer -- are used in light of their\nbetter performance. As a workaround, OWSM designed a double linear warmup of\nthe LR, increasing it to a very small value in the first phase before updating\nit to a higher value in the second phase. While this solution worked well in\npractice, it was not compared with alternative solutions, nor was the impact on\nthe final performance of different LR warmup schedules studied. This paper\nfills this gap, revealing that i) large-scale S2T trainings demand a\nsub-exponential LR warmup, and ii) a higher LR in the warmup phase accelerates\ninitial convergence, but it does not boost final performance.",

    "abstract": "The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world\nbugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become\nstandard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been\nupdated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and\ndepend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment\nsetup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and\ndata contamination. In this work, we present SWE-bench-Live, a live-updatable\nbenchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our initial release consists\nof 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created since 2024, spanning 93\nrepositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated Docker image to ensure\nreproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is \\method, an automated\ncuration pipeline that streamlines the entire process from instance creation to\nenvironment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and enabling scalability and\ncontinuous updates. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agent frameworks\nand LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a substantial performance gap compared to\nstatic benchmarks like SWE-bench, even under controlled evaluation conditions.\nTo better understand this discrepancy, we perform detailed analyses across\nrepository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty. By providing a fresh,\ndiverse, and executable benchmark grounded in live repository activity,\nSWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous, contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs\nand agents in dynamic, real-world software development settings.",

Recent studies have also shown that\nPC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict\nneural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence\nsuggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference,\nwhile unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring\nbidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC\nmodel that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while\nmaintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC\nmatches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or\ndiscriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously\nsuits both tasks.

Many\nof these profile changes involve small (few percent) variations in the relative\nintensity of different profile components, and hence tools such as Gaussian\nprocess regression have been employed to separate the time-correlated profile\nvariation from intrinsic noise. In this paper, we present a computationally\nefficient approximation of a 2-D Gaussian process model that enhances\nsensitivity by simultaneously tracking time- and phase-correlated signals.\nApplying this model to 26 pulsars observed at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we\ndetect significant profile shape variations in 21 pulsars.

    "abstract": "The stability of an accretion disc surrounding a millisecond pulsar is\nanalysed from an energetic point of view, using magnetohydrodynamic simulations\nthat consider realistic disc structures and a variety of magnetic field\ninclination angles. The time-averaged components of the magnetic field interact\nwith the disc through ohmic dissipation, which causes heating and partial\nevaporation of its innermost region. The stability of the disc right after the\nmagnetic field is turned on is analysed as a function of the location of the\ninner radius of the disc and the magnetic inclination angle. Our results show\nthat the disc is severely altered in those cases where its inner radius lies\nwell beyond the light cylinder and the magnetic axis is not totally aligned\nwith the neutron star spin axis. Overall, the results of the simulations agree\nwith those obtained in previous works where analytical or semi-analytical\nenergy models were also used to discuss the stability of the disc. The\nimplications for the understanding of the transitional millisecond pulsars are\ndiscussed. We briefly mention implications of our results for low-mass X-ray\nbinaries and supernova fallback discs.",

However, current methods face significant limitations.\nExisting approaches often generate talking faces, hindering seamless\nintegration into original scenes, or employ inpainting techniques that discard\nvital visual information like partial occlusions and lighting variations. This\nwork introduces EdiDub, a novel framework that reformulates visual dubbing as a\ncontent-aware editing task. EdiDub preserves the original video context by\nutilizing a specialized conditioning scheme to ensure faithful and accurate\nmodifications rather than mere copying. On multiple benchmarks, including a\nchallenging occluded-lip dataset, EdiDub significantly improves identity\npreservation and synchronization. Human evaluations further confirm its\nsuperiority, achieving higher synchronization and visual naturalness scores\ncompared to the leading methods.

While there has been\nan exponential growth in the application of generative AI in scaling various\naspects of formative assessment, ranging from automatic question generation to\nintelligent tutoring systems and personalized feedback, few have directly\naddressed the core pedagogical principles of formative assessment. Here, we\ncritically examined how generative AI, especially large-language models (LLMs)\nsuch as ChatGPT, can support key components of formative assessment: helping\nstudents, teachers, and peers understand \"where learners are going,\" \"where\nlearners currently are,\" and \"how to move learners forward\" in the learning\nprocess. With the rapid emergence of new prompting techniques and LLM\ncapabilities, we also provide guiding principles for educators to effectively\nleverage cost-free LLMs in formative assessments while remaining grounded in\npedagogical best practices. Furthermore, we reviewed the role of LLMs in\ngenerating feedback, highlighting limitations in current evaluation metrics\nthat inadequately capture the nuances of formative feedback, such as\ndistinguishing feedback at the task, process, and self-regulatory levels.\nFinally, we offer practical guidelines for educators and researchers, including\nconcrete classroom strategies and future directions such as developing robust\nmetrics to assess LLM-generated feedback, leveraging LLMs to overcome systemic\nand cultural barriers to formative assessment, and designing AI-aware\nassessment strategies that promote transferable skills while mitigating\noverreliance on LLM-generated responses.

For models\nwith strong comprehension ability, MEF uses a more complex Fu+En1+En2 strategy,\nin which additional dual-ended encryption techniques are applied to the LLM's\nresponses, further contributing to evasion of the LLM's defenses at the output\nstage. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\nachieving attack success rates of 98.9% on GPT-4o (29 May 2025 release) and\n99.8% on GPT-4.1 (8 July 2025 release).

Observations at frequencies below 100 MHz\nare essential for investigating the physics of radio relics as they provide\nunique access to the low-energy population of cosmic-ray electrons. We aim to\nstudy the morphology, spectral characteristics, and physical processes that\nproduce relics. We present the first observations of the Sausage cluster at 45\nMHz, the lowest radio frequency at which this cluster has been studied to date,\nusing the Low Band Antenna (LBA) of the LOFAR radio interferometer. We made use\nof ten hours of LOFAR LBA observations, from which we achieved a thermal-noise\nlimited radio image with a noise level of 1.5 mJy/beam at a resolution of 15\narcsec. These data were combined with existing multi-frequency measurements at\nhigher frequencies: LOFAR High Band Antenna, Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope,\nWesterbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. This\nbroad frequency coverage allowed us to derive integrated spectral indices,\nspectral index and curvature maps, and Mach number distributions across the\nrelics. We derived Mach numbers from the local injection index measure using\nlow-frequency data with M_N = 2.9 +-0.5 for the northern relic and M_S =\n2.9+-0.8 for the southern relic. LOFAR LBA observations reveal a remarkably\nsymmetric surface brightness profile across the eastern part of the northern\nrelic, with wings extending on either side of the peak. This discovery is\ncontrary to the expectation of particle acceleration at a single, sharp shock\nand the subsequent downstream advection of accelerated electrons. We modelled\nthe surface brightness profile, including the effects of projection, magnetic\nfield variation, and shock deformation.",

Many assume static\nor binary autonomy settings, failing to account for the varied complexity,\ncriticality, and risk across SOC tasks considering Humans and AI collaboration.\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework\ngrounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped\nto Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel multi-antenna architecture, termed ray antenna\narray (RAA), which practically enables flexible beamforming and also enhances\nwireless communication performance for high frequency systems in a\ncost-effective manner. RAA consists of a large number of inexpensive antenna\nelements and a few radio frequency (RF) chains. These antenna elements are\narranged in a novel ray like structure, where each ray corresponds to one\nsimple uniform linear array (sULA) with a carefully designed orientation. The\nantenna elements within each sULA are directly connected, so that each sULA is\nable to form a beam towards a direction matching the ray orientation without\nrelying on any analog or digital beamforming. By further designing a ray\nselection network (RSN), appropriate sULAs are selected to connect to the RF\nchains for subsequent baseband processing. Compared to conventional\nmulti-antenna architectures such as the uniform linear array (ULA) with hybrid\nanalog/digital beamforming (HBF), the proposed RAA enjoys three appealing\nadvantages: (i) finer and uniform angular resolution for all signal directions;\n(ii) enhanced beamforming gain by using antenna elements with higher\ndirectivity, as each sULA is only responsible for a small portion of the total\nangle coverage range; and (iii) dramatically reduced hardware cost since no\nphase shifters are required, which are expensive and difficult to design in\nhigh-frequency systems such as mmWave and THz systems. To validate such\nadvantages, we first present the input-output mathematical model for RAA-based\nwireless communications. Efficient algorithms for joint RAA beamforming and ray\nselection are then proposed for single-user and multi-user RAA-based wireless\ncommunications. Simulation results demonstrate that RAA achieves superior\nperformance compared to the conventional ULA with HBF, while significantly\nreducing hardware cost.",

Furthermore, previously proposed \"multiple threshold\" models\nintroduce different problems: making overly restrictive assumptions, or failing\nto provide summary sensitivity and specificity estimates across thresholds.\n  To address this, we proposed a series of ordinal regression-based models,\nrepresenting a natural extension of established frameworks. Our approach offers\nnotable advantages: (i) complete data utilisation: rather than discarding\ninformation like standard methods, we incorporate all threshold data; (ii)\nthreshold-specific inference: by providing summary accuracy estimates across\nthresholds, our models deliver critical information for clinical\ndecision-making; (iii) enhanced flexibility: unlike previous \"multiple\nthresholds\" approaches, our methodology imposes fewer assumptions, leading to\nbetter accuracy estimates; (iv) our models use an induced-Dirichlet framework,\nallowing for either fixed-effects or random-effects cutpoint parameters, whilst\nalso allowing for intuitive cutpoint priors.\n  Our (ongoing) simulation study - based on real-world anxiety and depression\nscreening data - demonstrates notably better accuracy estimates than previous\napproaches, even when the number of categories is high.\n  Furthermore, we implemented these models in a user-friendly R package -\nMetaOrdDTA (https://github.com/CerulloE1996/MetaOrdDTA).

    "abstract": "Purpose: Accurate wound segmentation is essential for automated DESIGN-R\nscoring. However, existing models such as FUSegNet, which are trained primarily\non foot ulcer datasets, often fail to generalize to wounds on other body sites.\n  Methods: We propose an annotation-efficient pipeline that combines a\nlightweight YOLOv11n-based detector with the pre-trained FUSegNet segmentation\nmodel. Instead of relying on pixel-level annotations or retraining for new\nanatomical regions, our method achieves robust performance using only 500\nmanually labeled bounding boxes. This zero fine-tuning approach effectively\nbridges the domain gap and enables direct deployment across diverse wound\ntypes. This is an advance not previously demonstrated in the wound segmentation\nliterature.\n  Results: Evaluated on three real-world test sets spanning foot, sacral, and\ntrochanter wounds, our YOLO plus FUSegNet pipeline improved mean IoU by 23\npercentage points over vanilla FUSegNet and increased end-to-end DESIGN-R size\nestimation accuracy from 71 percent to 94 percent (see Table 3 for details).\n  Conclusion: Our pipeline generalizes effectively across body sites without\ntask-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating that minimal supervision, with 500\nannotated ROIs, is sufficient for scalable, annotation-light wound\nsegmentation. This capability paves the way for real-world DESIGN-R automation,\nreducing reliance on pixel-wise labeling, streamlining documentation workflows,\nand supporting objective and consistent wound scoring in clinical practice.

    "abstract": "The tension between the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) and that measured from late-time observations, such\nas the local distance ladder, is a major challenge in modern cosmology. Early\ndark energy (EDE) has been proposed as a possible resolution to the $H_0$\ntension, but it typically worsens the $S_8$ tension by enhancing the\nsmall-scale matter power spectrum due to an increased cold dark matter density.\nTo address this issue, we propose a model that combines EDE with an interacting\ndark energy-dark matter (iDEDM) scenario, and investigate whether this mixed\nmodel can simultaneously resolve both tensions. We find that the DE-DM\ninteraction suppress the growth of structure and reduce $S_8$, while EDE\ncontributes to increase $H_0$, although less effectively than in the EDE-only\ncase. Our MCMC analysis using Planck 2018, DESI BAO, DES, Pantheon+, and SH0ES\ndata shows that the mixed model provides modest improvements in both tensions,\nalthough it does not fully resolve either. This limitation appears to stem from\nthe fact that both EDE and iDEDM independently favor a higher present-day\nmatter density, which reduces the angular diameter distance and limits the\ndegree to which EDE can lower the sound horizon.",

The DSR takes the\nformalization as input and formulates geometry problem solving as a hypergraph\nexpansion task, executing mathematically rigorous and reliable derivation to\nproduce minimal and human-readable stepwise solutions. Extensive experimental\nevaluations demonstrate that AutoGPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on\nbenchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Collaborative multiple robots for unknown environment exploration have become\nmainstream due to their remarkable performance and efficiency. However, most\nexisting methods assume perfect robots' communication during exploration, which\nis unattainable in real-world settings. Though there have been recent works\naiming to tackle communication-constrained situations, substantial room for\nadvancement remains for both information-sharing and exploration strategy\naspects. In this paper, we propose a Communication-Constrained Multi-Robot\nEntropy-Field-Based Exploration (MEF-Explore). The first module of the proposed\nmethod is the two-layer inter-robot communication-aware information-sharing\nstrategy. A dynamic graph is used to represent a multi-robot network and to\ndetermine communication based on whether it is low-speed or high-speed.\nSpecifically, low-speed communication, which is always accessible between every\nrobot, can only be used to share their current positions. If robots are within\na certain range, high-speed communication will be available for inter-robot map\nmerging. The second module is the entropy-field-based exploration strategy.\nParticularly, robots explore the unknown area distributedly according to the\nnovel forms constructed to evaluate the entropies of frontiers and robots.\nThese entropies can also trigger implicit robot rendezvous to enhance\ninter-robot map merging if feasible. In addition, we include the\nduration-adaptive goal-assigning module to manage robots' goal assignment. The\nsimulation results demonstrate that our MEF-Explore surpasses the existing ones\nregarding exploration time and success rate in all scenarios. For real-world\nexperiments, our method leads to a 21.32% faster exploration time and a 16.67%\nhigher success rate compared to the baseline.",

These pseudo neighbours\nenhance the effective connectivity of the system without altering its local\nstructure. While their presence slows down the dynamics, they influence\nthermodynamic properties even more significantly. In particular, the\nconfigurational entropy obtained via thermodynamic integration vanishes at a\ntemperature much higher than the temperature where the dynamics begin to slow\ndown, leading to a clear breakdown of the Adam Gibbs relation. To uncover a\npossible dynamical signature of this thermodynamic transition, we analyse bond\nbreakage dynamics. Unlike real-real bonds, which decay similarly in both the\nparent Kob Andersen model and its mean field variant, real-pseudo bonds exhibit\nlong lived, persistent behaviour with strong temperature dependence. These\nbonds do not fully decay over time, leading to a finite saturation value of the\nbond breakage correlation function.

Recent efforts have advanced PRMs from step-level to token-level\ngranularity by integrating reward modeling into the training of generative\nmodels, with reward scores derived from token generation probabilities.\nHowever, the conflict between generative language modeling and reward modeling\nmay introduce instability and lead to inaccurate credit assignments. To address\nthis challenge, we revisit token-level reward assignment by decoupling reward\nmodeling from language generation and derive a token-level reward model through\nthe optimization of a discriminative policy, termed the Q-function Reward Model\n(Q-RM). We theoretically demonstrate that Q-RM explicitly learns token-level\nQ-functions from preference data without relying on fine-grained annotations.\nIn our experiments, Q-RM consistently outperforms all baseline methods across\nvarious benchmarks.

While existing methods have made progress in addressing\ncorrupted actions and rewards, they remain insufficient for handling corruption\nin high-dimensional state spaces and for cases where multiple elements in the\ndataset are corrupted simultaneously. Diffusion models, known for their strong\ndenoising capabilities, offer a promising direction for this problem-but their\ntendency to overfit noisy samples limits their direct applicability. To\novercome this, we propose Ambient Diffusion-Guided Dataset Recovery (ADG), a\nnovel approach that pioneers the use of diffusion models to tackle data\ncorruption in offline RL. First, we introduce Ambient Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Models (DDPM) from approximated distributions, which enable\nlearning on partially corrupted datasets with theoretical guarantees. Second,\nwe use the noise-prediction property of Ambient DDPM to distinguish between\nclean and corrupted data, and then use the clean subset to train a standard\nDDPM. Third, we employ the trained standard DDPM to refine the previously\nidentified corrupted data, enhancing data quality for subsequent offline RL\ntraining. A notable strength of ADG is its versatility-it can be seamlessly\nintegrated with any offline RL algorithm. Experiments on a range of benchmarks,\nincluding MuJoCo, Kitchen, and Adroit, demonstrate that ADG effectively\nmitigates the impact of corrupted data and improves the robustness of offline\nRL under various noise settings, achieving state-of-the-art results.",

Weak elasticity is characterized by a small\nbut finite Deborah number ($De$), and the suspending fluid rheology is\ntherefore modeled as a second-order fluid, with the constitutive equation\ninvolving a material parameter $\\epsilon$ related to the ratio of the first and\nsecond normal stress differences; polymer solutions correspond to\n$\\epsilon\\in[-0.7,-0.5]$. Employing a reciprocal theorem formulation, along\nwith expressions for the relevant disturbance fields in terms of vector\nspheroidal harmonics, we obtain the spheroid angular velocity to $O(De)$. In\nthe Newtonian limit, a spheroid rotates along Jeffery orbits parametrized by an\norbit constant $C$, although this closed-trajectory topology is structurally\nunstable, being susceptible to weak perturbations. For $De$ well below a\nthreshold, $De_c(\\kappa)$, weak viscoelasticity transforms the\nclosed-trajectory topology into a tightly spiralling one. A multiple-scales\nanalysis is used to interpret the resulting orientation dynamics in terms of an\n$O(De)$ orbital drift.

The\nquestions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling\nobserved visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and\npredicting information beyond the video.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has received\nincreasing attention in this field, but still faces challenges, including\nlimited training efficiency and high reliance on initial learning conditions.\nInteractive RL, which combines human (grower) input with the RL agent's\nlearning, offers a potential solution to overcome these challenges. However,\ninteractive RL has not yet been applied to greenhouse climate control and may\nface challenges related to imperfect inputs. Therefore, this paper aims to\nexplore the possibility and performance of applying interactive RL with\nimperfect inputs into greenhouse climate control, by: (1) developing three\nrepresentative interactive RL algorithms tailored for greenhouse climate\ncontrol (reward shaping, policy shaping and control sharing); (2) analyzing how\ninput characteristics are often contradicting, and how the trade-offs between\nthem make grower's inputs difficult to perfect; (3) proposing a neural\nnetwork-based approach to enhance the robustness of interactive RL agents under\nlimited input availability; (4) conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the\nthree interactive RL algorithms with imperfect inputs in a simulated greenhouse\nenvironment. The demonstration shows that interactive RL incorporating\nimperfect grower inputs has the potential to improve the performance of the RL\nagent. RL algorithms that influence action selection, such as policy shaping\nand control sharing, perform better when dealing with imperfect inputs,\nachieving 8.4% and 6.8% improvement in profit, respectively.

Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics\nincluding accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

    "abstract": "Flow Matching (FM) is an effective framework for training a model to learn a\nvector field that transports samples from a source distribution to a target\ndistribution. To train the model, early FM methods use random couplings, which\noften result in crossing paths and lead the model to learn non-straight\ntrajectories that require many integration steps to generate high-quality\nsamples. To address this, recent methods adopt Optimal Transport (OT) to\nconstruct couplings by minimizing geometric distances, which helps reduce path\ncrossings. However, we observe that such geometry-based couplings do not\nnecessarily align with the model's preferred trajectories, making it difficult\nto learn the vector field induced by these couplings, which prevents the model\nfrom learning straight trajectories. Motivated by this, we propose\nModel-Aligned Coupling (MAC), an effective method that matches training\ncouplings based not only on geometric distance but also on alignment with the\nmodel's preferred transport directions based on its prediction error. To avoid\nthe time-costly match process, MAC proposes to select the top-$k$ fraction of\ncouplings with the lowest error for training.

Importantly, our approach necessitates no modifications to\nmodel architectures or sampling schedules and maintains full compatibility with\nexisting diffusion frameworks. We validate the effectiveness of CFG-Rejection\nin image generation through extensive experiments, demonstrating marked\nimprovements on human preference scores (HPSv2, PickScore) and challenging\nbenchmarks (GenEval, DPG-Bench). We anticipate that CFG-Rejection will offer\nsignificant advantages for diverse generative modalities beyond images, paving\nthe way for more efficient and reliable high-quality sample generation.",

However, their massive size\nand the limited availability of fine-grained annotations pose substantial\nchallenges for conventional supervised learning. We propose DSAGL (Dual-Stream\nAttention-Guided Learning), a novel weakly supervised classification framework\nthat combines a teacher-student architecture with a dual-stream design. DSAGL\nexplicitly addresses instance-level ambiguity and bag-level semantic\nconsistency by generating multi-scale attention-based pseudo labels and guiding\ninstance-level learning. A shared lightweight encoder (VSSMamba) enables\nefficient long-range dependency modeling, while a fusion-attentive module\n(FASA) enhances focus on sparse but diagnostically relevant regions. We further\nintroduce a hybrid loss to enforce mutual consistency between the two streams.\nExperiments on CIFAR-10, NCT-CRC, and TCGA-Lung datasets demonstrate that DSAGL\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL baselines, achieving superior\ndiscriminative performance and robustness under weak supervision.",

While\ntechniques such as continuous batching and paged attention address\nservice-level objectives (SLOs), and quantization methods accelerate inference,\nthe dynamic and efficient adaptation of precision at runtime remains a\nsignificant, largely underexplored challenge. The emergence of hardware support\nfor FP8 arithmetic, offering up to 2x the throughput of FP16, presents an\nattractive opportunity for interactive LLM serving. However, current approaches\nlike co-deploying FP8 and FP16 models suffer from increased storage overhead\nand fail to unlock FP8's full potential. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce NestedFP, a novel precision-adaptive serving technique enabling\nseamless FP8 and FP16 inference from a single 16-bit model representation,\nthereby incurring no additional memory cost. NestedFP decomposes each FP16\nweight into two 8-bit components, facilitating efficient FP8 execution while\npreserving full FP16 accuracy. We demonstrate the practical viability of our\napproach by implementing a custom CUTLASS-based GEMM kernel that reconstructs\nFP16 operands on-the-fly, integrated within the vLLM serving framework. Our\nevaluation shows that NestedFP delivers up to 1.55x throughput improvement in\nFP8 mode with negligible accuracy degradation compared to FP16 precision, while\nintroducing only 3.9% performance overhead on average in FP16 mode across\nvarious models. NestedFP thus provides a flexible foundation for dynamic,\nSLO-aware precision selection, paving the way for more scalable and efficient\nLLM serving under bursty and heterogeneous workloads.",

The distributions reveal double lognormal profiles\nin both flux and index, primarily in the 3-day and 7-day binnings, supporting\nthe ``two-flux-state hypothesis\" for blazars. These profiles, which become\ninsignificant at 30-day binning, suggest that shorter timescales are better at\ncapturing distinct states, while longer timescales smooth out shorter\nvariations. Most VHE FSRQs exhibit a ``harder-when-brighter\" trend, where the\nphoton index decreases during high-flux states, suggesting efficient particle\nacceleration and possibly reduced radiative cooling. In contrast, two sources\ndisplay a ``softer-when-brighter\" behavior, likely due to enhanced radiative\ncooling in high photon density environments. Additionally, we observe that the\nSpearman rank correlation between flux and photon index strengthens with\nincreasing time bin sizes, indicating more pronounced correlations over longer\ntimescales. This possibly indicates that, on shorter timescales, flux\nvariations are driven by a combination of photon index changes and\nnormalization effects. Averaging flux over longer durations minimizes the\neffect of normalization variation, thereby enhancing the observed correlation.\nWe also compare the flux and index distributions of VHE and non-VHE FSRQs,\nemphasizing the differences in their variability and emission patterns.",

However, concurrently executing multiple DETR tasks presents\nsignificant challenges in meeting firm real-time deadlines (R1) and high\naccuracy requirements (R2), particularly for safety-critical objects, while\nnavigating the inherent latency-accuracy trade-off under resource constraints.\nExisting real-time DNN scheduling approaches often treat models generically,\nfailing to leverage Transformer-specific properties for efficient resource\nallocation. To address these challenges, we propose CF-DETR, an integrated\nsystem featuring a novel coarse-to-fine Transformer architecture and a\ndedicated real-time scheduling framework NPFP**. CF-DETR employs three key\nstrategies (A1: coarse-to-fine inference, A2: selective fine inference, A3:\nmulti-level batch inference) that exploit Transformer properties to dynamically\nadjust patch granularity and attention scope based on object criticality,\naiming to satisfy R2. The NPFP** scheduling framework (A4) orchestrates these\nadaptive mechanisms A1-A3. It partitions each DETR task into a safety-critical\ncoarse subtask for guaranteed critical object detection within its deadline\n(ensuring R1), and an optional fine subtask for enhanced overall accuracy (R2),\nwhile managing individual and batched execution. Our extensive evaluations on\nserver, GPU-enabled embedded platforms, and actual AV platforms demonstrate\nthat CF-DETR, under an NPFP** policy, successfully meets strict timing\nguarantees for critical operations and achieves significantly higher overall\nand critical object detection accuracy compared to existing baselines across\ndiverse AV workloads.",

This undesired consequence exposes a fundamental limitation in\ncontrastive alignment, which we characterize as likelihood underdetermination.\nIn this work, we revisit direct preference optimization (DPO) -- the seminal\ndirect alignment method -- and demonstrate that its loss theoretically admits a\ndecomposed reformulation. The reformulated loss not only broadens applicability\nto a wider range of feedback types, but also provides novel insights into the\nunderlying cause of likelihood underdetermination. Specifically, the standard\nDPO implementation implicitly oversimplifies a regularizer in the reformulated\nloss, and reinstating its complete version effectively resolves the\nunderdetermination issue. Leveraging these findings, we introduce PRoximalized\nPReference Optimization (PRO), a unified method to align with diverse feeback\ntypes, eliminating likelihood underdetermination through an efficient\napproximation of the complete regularizer.

In this Letter, we will argue that, the quantum speed limit on how\nfast a quantum system can evolve unitarily, when saturating the maximal\ninformation transmission bounds (Pendry's bound and Bremermann-Bekenstein\nbound), will slow down the would-be divergent rate of dynamical black hole\nentropy decreasing at the very end of the Hawking evaporation, during which the\nPenrose inequality from cosmic censorship conjecture is exactly saturated.\nTherefore, an evaporating Schwarzschild black hole is the fastest transmitter\nof information in nature. Further applying the Bremermann-Bekenstein bound on\nthe de Sitter entanglement entropy exactly reproduces the trans-Planckian\ncensorship conjecture, indicating that the would-be-ended inflating de Sitter\nspace is the fastest receiver of information in nature.",

    "abstract": "Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an indispensable task in\nhuman-centered research and has made great progress in recent years with the\ndevelopment of deep neural networks. However, the potential vulnerability and\nanti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this\ngap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for\npedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and\npatch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained\nCLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into\nnon-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a\nprojection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using\nprompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text\nencoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and\ntext tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition.\nBased on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic\nand label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We\nalso design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of\nadversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains\n(i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the\neffectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the\npedestrian attribute recognition.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models have shown unprecedented generative\ncapability, but their ability to produce undesirable concepts\n(e.g.~pornographic content, sensitive identities, copyrighted styles) poses\nserious concerns for privacy, fairness, and safety. {Concept erasure} aims to\nremove or suppress specific concept information in a generative model. In this\npaper, we introduce \\textbf{TRACE (Trajectory-Constrained Attentional Concept\nErasure)}, a novel method to erase targeted concepts from diffusion models\nwhile preserving overall generative quality. Our approach combines a rigorous\ntheoretical framework, establishing formal conditions under which a concept can\nbe provably suppressed in the diffusion process, with an effective fine-tuning\nprocedure compatible with both conventional latent diffusion (Stable Diffusion)\nand emerging rectified flow models (e.g.~FLUX). We first derive a closed-form\nupdate to the model's cross-attention layers that removes hidden\nrepresentations of the target concept. We then introduce a trajectory-aware\nfinetuning objective that steers the denoising process away from the concept\nonly in the late sampling stages, thus maintaining the model's fidelity on\nunrelated content. Empirically, we evaluate TRACE on multiple benchmarks used\nin prior concept erasure studies (object classes, celebrity faces, artistic\nstyles, and explicit content from the I2P dataset).

We first identify a multi-target learning\nconflict in the calibrating process, which arises when optimizing variables\nacross time steps, leading to the underutilization of the model's learning\ncapabilities.

One critical\nchallenge in VR development is the vergence-accommodation conflict (VAC), which\narises due to the intrinsic constraints of approximating the natural viewing\ngeometry through digital displays. Although various hardware and software\nsolutions have been proposed to address VAC, no commercially viable option has\nbeen universally adopted by manufacturers. This paper presents and evaluates a\nsoftware solution grounded in a vision-based geometrical model of VAC that\nmediates VAC's impact on movement in VR.

They either ignore the language semantics or rely on labeled audio\ndatasets that are difficult and expensive to create. Moreover, merely modeling\nsemantic space usually fails to achieve satisfactory performance on music\nrecommendation tasks since the user preference space is ignored. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Hierarchical Two-stage Contrastive Learning (HTCL) method\nthat models similarity from the semantic perspective to the user perspective\nhierarchically to learn a comprehensive music representation bridging the gap\nbetween semantic and user preference spaces. We devise a scalable audio encoder\nand leverage a pre-trained BERT model as the text encoder to learn audio-text\nsemantics via large-scale contrastive pre-training. Further, we explore a\nsimple yet effective way to exploit interaction data from our online music\nplatform to adapt the semantic space to user preference space via contrastive\nfine-tuning, which differs from previous works that follow the idea of\ncollaborative filtering. As a result, we obtain a powerful audio encoder that\nnot only distills language semantics from the text encoder but also models\nsimilarity in user preference space with the integrity of semantic space\npreserved.

While diffusion models have emerged as the dominant\nparadigm for image generation, their impact on remote sensing forgery detection\nremains underexplored. Existing benchmarks primarily target GAN-based forgeries\nor focus on natural images, limiting progress in this critical domain. To\naddress this gap, we introduce RSFAKE-1M, a large-scale dataset of 500K forged\nand 500K real remote sensing images. The fake images are generated by ten\ndiffusion models fine-tuned on remote sensing data, covering six generation\nconditions such as text prompts, structural guidance, and inpainting. This\npaper presents the construction of RSFAKE-1M along with a comprehensive\nexperimental evaluation using both existing detectors and unified baselines.\nThe results reveal that diffusion-based remote sensing forgeries remain\nchallenging for current methods, and that models trained on RSFAKE-1M exhibit\nnotably improved generalization and robustness. Our findings underscore the\nimportance of RSFAKE-1M as a foundation for developing and evaluating\nnext-generation forgery detection approaches in the remote sensing domain.

Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate\nproof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To\naddress this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following\nkey insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality,\nchallenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By\nevaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively\neliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs\nof contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions,\nsuch as SMT 2025 -- published well after model release dates -- demonstrate\nimpressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also\nthe first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On USAMO 2025, even top\nmodels score below 25%, far behind their performance on final-answer tasks. So\nfar, we have evaluated 30 models across five competitions, totaling 149\nproblems.

In\nparticular, O2 combined with a reducing gas is thought to be strong evidence\nfor disequilibrium caused by surface life. However, there are circumstances\nwhere it would be very difficult or impossible to detect O2, in which cases it\nhas been suggested that ozone (O3), the photochemical product of O2, could be\nused instead. Unfortunately, the O2-O3 relationship is highly nonlinear and\ndependent on the host star, as shown in detail in the first paper in this\nseries. We explore the O2-O3 relationship around G0V-M5V host stars, using\nclimate/photochemistry modeling to simulate atmospheres while varying\nabundances of O2 and nitrous oxide (N2O). N2O is of particular importance to\nthe O2-O3 relationship not just because it is produced biologically, but\nbecause it is the primary source of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which fuel the NOx\ncatalytic cycle which destroys O3, and the smog mechanism that produces O3. We\nvary the O2 mixing ratio from 0.01-150% present atmospheric level (PAL), and\nN2O abundances of 10% and 1000% PAL. We find that varying N2O impacts the O2-O3\nrelationship differently depending strongly on both the host star and the\namount of atmospheric O2. Planets orbiting hotter hosts with strong UV fluxes\nefficiently convert N2O into NOx, often depleting a significant amount of O3\nvia faster NOx catalytic cycles. However, for cooler hosts and low O2 levels we\nfind that increasing N2O can lead to an increase of overall O3 due to the smog\nmechanism producing O3 in the lower atmosphere. Variations in O3 result in\nsignificant changes in the amount of harmful UV reaching the surfaces of the\nmodel planets as well as the strength of the 9.6 $\\mu$m O3 emission spectral\nfeature, demonstrating potential impacts on habitability and future\nobservations.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable\nadvancements, drawing significant attention from the research community. Their\ncapabilities are largely attributed to large-scale architectures, which require\nextensive training on massive datasets. However, such datasets often contain\nsensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising\nconcerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to\nrequest the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the\ndevelopment of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific\nknowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these\nadvancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a\nchallenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this\nwork, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning\nevaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and\nfive prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we\nevaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.\nTo explore alternatives beyond prompt-based auditing, we propose a novel\ntechnique that leverages intermediate activation perturbations, addressing the\nlimitations of auditing methods that rely solely on model inputs and outputs.",

Previous studies primarily use\nstatistical models and, more recently, machine learning models to explore the\ndeterminants of travel satisfaction. Both approaches require data from\nsufficient sample sizes and correct prior statistical assumptions. The\nemergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a new modeling approach that\ncan overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods. Pre-trained on extensive\ndatasets, LLMs have strong capabilities in contextual understanding and\ngeneralization, significantly reducing their dependence on large quantities of\ntask-specific data and stringent statistical assumptions. The primary challenge\nin applying LLMs lies in addressing the behavioral misalignment between LLMs\nand human behavior. Using data on travel satisfaction from a household survey\nin shanghai, this study identifies the existence and source of misalignment and\ndevelop methods to address the misalignment issue. We find that the zero-shot\nLLM exhibits behavioral misalignment, resulting in relatively low prediction\naccuracy. However, few-shot learning, even with a limited number of samples,\nallows the model to outperform baseline models in MSE and MAPE metrics. This\nmisalignment can be attributed to the gap between the general knowledge\nembedded in LLMs and the specific, unique characteristics of the dataset.

Here, we present a new set of ABC algorithms based\non Simulated Annealing and demonstrate that they are competitive with ML\napproaches, whilst requiring much less hyper-parameter tuning. For the design\nof these sampling algorithms we draw intuition from non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics, where we associate each summary statistic with a state variable\n(energy) quantifying the distance to the observed value as well as a\ntemperature that controls the degree to which the associated statistic\ncontributes to the posterior.

Querying\napproaches from a vast body of scientific papers is extremely time-consuming,\nand without a well-organized management framework, researchers may face\nsignificant challenges in querying and utilizing relevant approaches.\nConstructing multiple dimensions on approaches and managing them from these\ndimensions can provide an efficient solution. Firstly, this paper identifies\napproach patterns using a top-down way, refining the patterns through four\ndistinct linguistic levels: semantic level, discourse level, syntactic level,\nand lexical level. Approaches in scientific papers are extracted based on\napproach patterns. Additionally, five dimensions for categorizing approaches\nare identified using these patterns. This paper proposes using tree structure\nto represent step and measuring the similarity between different steps with a\ntree-structure-based similarity measure that focuses on syntactic-level\nsimilarities. A collection similarity measure is proposed to compute the\nsimilarity between approaches. A bottom-up clustering algorithm is proposed to\nconstruct class trees for approach components within each dimension by merging\neach approach component or class with its most similar approach component or\nclass in each iteration. The class labels generated during the clustering\nprocess indicate the common semantics of the step components within the\napproach components in each class and are used to manage the approaches within\nthe class. The class trees of the five dimensions collectively form a\nmulti-dimensional approach space. The application of approach queries on the\nmulti-dimensional approach space demonstrates that querying within this space\nensures strong relevance between user queries and results and rapidly reduces\nsearch space through a class-based query mechanism.",

Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial\npolicy model leads to faster RLHF training.

In\na widely-used family of MDPs involving Gaussian control noise and quadratic\ncontrol costs, we show that the stochastic and deterministic policy gradients,\nnatural gradients, and state value functions are identical; while the\nstate-control value functions are different. We then develop a general\nprocedure for constructing an MDP with deterministic policy that is equivalent\nto a given MDP with stochastic policy. The controls of this new MDP are the\nsufficient statistics of the stochastic policy in the original MDP.

While early\napproaches have shown promising performance by focusing on visual features or\nleveraging large-scale pre-training, most existing evaluations rely on rigid\noutput formats and objective metrics, thus ignoring the complex, real-world\ndemands of practical chart analysis. In this paper, we introduce ChartMind, a\nnew benchmark designed for complex CQA tasks in real-world settings. ChartMind\ncovers seven task categories, incorporates multilingual contexts, supports\nopen-domain textual outputs, and accommodates diverse chart formats, bridging\nthe gap between real-world applications and traditional academic benchmarks.\nFurthermore, we propose a context-aware yet model-agnostic framework, ChartLLM,\nthat focuses on extracting key contextual elements, reducing noise, and\nenhancing the reasoning accuracy of multimodal large language models. Extensive\nevaluations on ChartMind and three representative public benchmarks with 14\nmainstream multimodal models show our framework significantly outperforms the\nprevious three common CQA paradigms: instruction-following, OCR-enhanced, and\nchain-of-thought, highlighting the importance of flexible chart understanding\nfor real-world CQA.

Although\nvarious complexity measures for both event logs and process models have been\nproposed in the literature, the relationship between input and output\ncomplexity remains largely unexplored. In particular, there are no established\nguidelines or theoretical foundations that explain how the complexity of an\nevent log influences the complexity of the discovered model.

We study 18\nlog complexity measures and 17 process model complexity measures across five\nprocess discovery algorithms.

The results demonstrate the robust detection of\npopulation-level CO2 trends in both biotic and abiotic scenarios for population\nsizes as small as 30 Exo-Earth Candidates (EECs) and the lowest assessed\nspectrum quality in terms of signal-to-noise ratio, S/N = 10, and spectral\nresolution, R = 50.

However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those\nin psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with\nobjective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on\nsubjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment\nwith human preferences, for which strict \"correctness\" criteria are\nill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce\nmisaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS\nframework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation\nis \"domain alignment\", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined\nend-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain\nprinciples (e.g., empathy in counseling).

Most existing deep learning-based drug repositioning methods\npredominantly utilize graph-based representations. However, graph-based drug\nrepositioning methods struggle to perform effective inference in cold-start\nscenarios involving novel drugs because of the lack of association information\nwith the diseases. Unlike traditional graph-based approaches, we propose a\nbidirectional behavior learning strategy for drug repositioning, known as\nBiBLDR. This innovative framework redefines drug repositioning as a behavior\nsequential learning task to capture drug-disease interaction patterns. First,\nwe construct bidirectional behavioral sequences based on drug and disease\nsides. The consideration of bidirectional information ensures a more meticulous\nand rigorous characterization of the behavioral sequences. Subsequently, we\npropose a two-stage strategy for drug repositioning. In the first stage, we\nconstruct prototype spaces to characterize the representational attributes of\ndrugs and diseases. In the second stage, these refined prototypes and\nbidirectional behavior sequence data are leveraged to predict potential\ndrug-disease associations. Based on this learning approach, the model can more\nrobustly and precisely capture the interactive relationships between drug and\ndisease features from bidirectional behavioral sequences. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark\ndatasets.

A likely $0^{++}$ virtual state is observed below\nthe threshold by 20-40\\,MeV in the ${}^1S_0$ $J/\\psi J/\\psi$ scattering and may\nhave connection with $X(6200)$. In $2^{++}$ channels, the near-threshold\ninteraction for the ${}^5S_2$ $J/\\psi J/\\psi$ scattering is repulsive. The\ndi-charmonium interactions are found to be insensitive to $m_\\pi$ and can be\nconsistently understood in terms of quark rearrangement effects combined with a\none-gluon-exchange mechanism, both of which are supported by our lattice QCD\nresults. Most importantly, we observe a $2^{++}$ resonance in the ${}^5S_2$\n$J/\\psi J/\\psi$ scattering, whose properties are\n$(m_R,\\Gamma_R)=\\big(6544(10),552(34)\\big)$\\,MeV for $m_\\pi\\approx 420$\\,MeV\nand $\\big(6539(13),546(57)\\big)$\\,MeV for $m_\\pi\\approx 250$\\,MeV, which are\ncompatible with the parameters of the fully-charmed broad structure $X(6600)$\n(or $X(6400)$) reported by ATLAS and CMS.",

    "abstract": "In-situ LLM inference on end-user devices has gained significant interest due\nto its privacy benefits and reduced dependency on external infrastructure.\nHowever, as the decoding process is memory-bandwidth-bound, the diverse\nprocessing units in modern end-user devices cannot be fully exploited,\nresulting in slow LLM inference. This paper presents Ghidorah, a LLM inference\nsystem for end-user devices with the unified memory architecture. The key idea\nof Ghidorah can be summarized in two steps: 1) leveraging speculative decoding\napproaches to enhance parallelism, and 2) ingeniously distributing workloads\nacross multiple heterogeneous processing units to maximize computing power\nutilization. Ghidorah includes the hetero-core model parallelism (HCMP)\narchitecture and the architecture-aware profiling (ARCA) approach. The HCMP\narchitecture guides partitioning by leveraging the unified memory design of\nend-user devices and adapting to the hybrid computational demands of\nspeculative decoding. The ARCA approach is used to determine the optimal\nspeculative strategy and partitioning strategy, balancing acceptance rate with\nparallel capability to maximize the speedup. Additionally, we optimize sparse\ncomputation on ARM CPUs. Experimental results show that Ghidorah can achieve up\nto 7.6x speedup in the dominant LLM decoding phase compared to the sequential\ndecoding approach in NVIDIA Jetson NX.",

Existing deep learning methods often suffer from\ninformation loss during downsampling and inefficient global context modeling.\nThis paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework integrating SAM2's hierarchical\nfeature learning with Mamba's selective sequence modeling. Key innovations\ninclude: (1) A Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) for efficient\nnatural-to-infrared domain adaptation via dual-stage selection (token-level\nwith a learnable task embedding and channel-wise adaptive transformations); (2)\nA Cross-Channel State-Space Interaction (CSI) module for efficient global\ncontext modeling with linear complexity using selective state space modeling;\nand (3) A Detail-Preserving Contextual Fusion (DPCF) module that adaptively\ncombines multi-scale features with a gating mechanism to balance\nhigh-resolution and low-resolution feature contributions. SAMamba addresses\ncore ISTD challenges by bridging the domain gap, maintaining fine-grained\ndetails, and efficiently modeling long-range dependencies. Experiments on\nNUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets show SAMamba significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with\nheterogeneous backgrounds and varying target scales.

    "abstract": "Multimodal remote sensing data, including spectral and lidar or\nphotogrammetry, is crucial for achieving satisfactory land-use / land-cover\nclassification results in urban scenes. So far, most studies have been\nconducted in a 2D context. When 3D information is available in the dataset, it\nis typically integrated with the 2D data by rasterizing the 3D data into 2D\nformats. Although this method yields satisfactory classification results, it\nfalls short in fully exploiting the potential of 3D data by restricting the\nmodel's ability to learn 3D spatial features directly from raw point clouds.\nAdditionally, it limits the generation of 3D predictions, as the dimensionality\nof the input data has been reduced. In this study, we propose a fully 3D-based\nmethod that fuses all modalities within the 3D point cloud and employs a\ndedicated dual-branch Transformer model to simultaneously learn geometric and\nspectral features. To enhance the fusion process, we introduce a\ncross-attention-based mechanism that fully operates on 3D points, effectively\nintegrating features from various modalities across multiple scales. The\npurpose of cross-attention is to allow one modality to assess the importance of\nanother by weighing the relevant features. We evaluated our method by comparing\nit against both 3D and 2D methods using the 2018 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest\n(DFC2018) dataset. Our findings indicate that 3D fusion delivers competitive\nresults compared to 2D methods and offers more flexibility by providing 3D\npredictions. These predictions can be projected onto 2D maps, a capability that\nis not feasible in reverse. Additionally, we evaluated our method on different\ndatasets, specifically the ISPRS Vaihingen 3D and the IEEE 2019 Data Fusion\nContest.

In his\nwords \"...therefore it seems that the simple $t-J$ model does not account for\nthe properties of high temperature superconductors\". Over approximately 35\nyears after the initial debates\\cite{debates} much has happened in the field\npertaining to this topic. Even though it is one of the most discussed issue, a\ncomprehensive account and the required resolution are lacking. Connected to the\ndebate over one-band versus three-band models is another discussion: the\none-component versus two-component model for cuprates. The two-component model\nis most strongly advocated by Barzykin and Pines\\cite{bp}. In this article the\nauthor attempts a perspective and a re-look on some of these issues. After an\nanalysis of a large body of literature, author finds that V. J. Emery's\ncriticism of the Zhang-Rice reduction was correct.

In this work, we study holographically the chaos in the\nmatrix models for meson and baryon, which are derived from the\n$\\mathrm{D4}/\\mathrm{D6}/\\overline{\\mathrm{D6}}$ approach as a top-down\nholographic model for QCD. Since these matrix models can be simplified into\ncoupled oscillator models with special parameters, we analyze the chaos in the\nresultant coupled oscillators. In the analysis of the classical chaos, we\ncalculate numerically the orbits on the Poincar\\'e section, the Lyapunov\nexponent as a function of the total energy and derive the large $N_{c}$\nbehavior analytically, then discuss the possible phase structure both in the\nmesonic and baryonic matrix models. These analyses suggest that chaos might\nserve as an order parameter to detect the gauge theory with spontaneous\nbreaking or restoration of symmetry. Besides, in the analysis of the quantum\nchaos, we demonstrate the numerical calculation of the OTOCs and analytically\nderive their large $N_{c}$ behavior by using the perturbation method in quantum\nmechanics. The numerical calculation illustrates there is a critical\ntemperature, as a critical energy scale, that the OTOC begins to saturate,\nwhich covers qualitatively the classical analysis of the Lyapunov exponent. And\nthe large $N_{c}$ analytics indicates the OTOCs are suppressed by the growth of\n$N_{c}$. Overall, the investigation of chaos in this work may be helpful to\nidentify common features shared by the matrix models, hadronic physics, gauge\ntheory, quantum mechanics, and gravity theory.",

One primary challenge to\nbe mitigated is the presence of multiple types of variation in aerial images,\nfor example, illumination and viewpoint changes. These variations result in\nhighly diverse image scenes and drastic alterations in object appearance, so\nthat it becomes more complicated to localize objects from the whole image scene\nand recognize their categories. To address this problem, in this paper, we\nintroduce a novel object detection framework in aerial images, named\nLANGuage-guided Object detection (LANGO). Upon the proposed language-guided\nlearning, the proposed framework is designed to alleviate the impacts from both\nscene and instance-level variations. First, we are motivated by the way humans\nunderstand the semantics of scenes while perceiving environmental factors in\nthe scenes (e.g., weather). Therefore, we design a visual semantic reasoner\nthat comprehends visual semantics of image scenes by interpreting conditions\nwhere the given images were captured. Second, we devise a training objective,\nnamed relation learning loss, to deal with instance-level variations, such as\nviewpoint angle and scale changes. This training objective aims to learn\nrelations in language representations of object categories, with the help of\nthe robust characteristics against such variations.

    "abstract": "Recent studies provide large language models (LLMs) with textual task-solving\nexperiences via prompts to improve their performance. However, previous methods\nrely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each\ntask, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user\nqueries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience\ntransfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive\nintelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to\nnewly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of\nexperience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel\npath for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets\ndemonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs.\nFurthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.",

The RTE is a\ndifferential-integral equation that governs the propagation of radiation\nthrough a participating medium, with applications spanning diverse domains such\nas neutron transport, atmospheric radiative transfer, heat transfer, and\noptical imaging. Our DeepRTE framework demonstrates superior computational\nefficiency for solving the steady-state RTE, surpassing traditional methods and\nexisting neural network approaches. This efficiency is achieved by embedding\nphysical information through derivation of the RTE and mathematically-informed\nnetwork architecture. Concurrently, DeepRTE achieves high accuracy with\nsignificantly fewer parameters, largely due to its incorporation of mechanisms\nsuch as multi-head attention. Furthermore, DeepRTE is a mesh-free neural\noperator framework with inherent zero-shot capability. This is achieved by\nincorporating Green's function theory and pre-training with delta-function\ninflow boundary conditions into both its architecture design and training data\nconstruction. The efficacy of the proposed approach is substantiated through\ncomprehensive numerical experiments.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: Flat Sketch to\nRealistic Garment Image (FS2RG), which generates realistic garment images by\nintegrating flat sketches and textual guidance. FS2RG presents two key\nchallenges: 1) fabric characteristics are solely guided by textual prompts,\nproviding insufficient visual supervision for diffusion-based models, which\nlimits their ability to capture fine-grained fabric details; 2) flat sketches\nand textual guidance may provide conflicting information, requiring the model\nto selectively preserve or modify garment attributes while maintaining\nstructural coherence.

Such a simple yet effective mechanism provides an\nextra degree of freedom, facilitating the learning of cross-LoRA synergies and\nproperly tracking the challenging poor generalization and underfitting issues\nas the number of LoRA grows.

These techniques are\ncomplementary and can be applied simultaneously to achieve optimal performance.\nAdditionally, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to ensure the\nconvergence of the proposed MUD.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel adaptive framework for processing dynamic flow\nsignals over simplicial complexes, extending classical least-mean-squares (LMS)\nmethods to high-order topological domains. Building on discrete Hodge theory,\nwe present a topological LMS algorithm that efficiently processes streaming\nsignals observed over time-varying edge subsets. We provide a detailed\nstochastic analysis of the algorithm, deriving its stability conditions,\nsteady-state mean-square-error, and convergence speed, while exploring the\nimpact of edge sampling on performance. We also propose strategies to design\noptimal edge sampling probabilities, minimizing rate while ensuring desired\nestimation accuracy. Assuming partial knowledge of the complex structure (e.g.,\nthe underlying graph), we introduce an adaptive topology inference method that\nintegrates with the proposed LMS framework. Additionally, we propose a\ndistributed version of the algorithm and analyze its stability and\nmean-square-error properties. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world\ntraffic data demonstrate that our approach, in both centralized and distributed\nsettings, outperforms graph-based LMS methods by leveraging higher-order\ntopological features.",

Here, we propose and\nexperimentally demonstrate a magneto-mechanical frequency comb via the\nthree-wave mixing mechanism, which solely requires the involvement of the\nfundamental mode f0 of a magnetostrictive macroresonator. Two types of combs,\ni.e., the integer-harmonic combs and the half-integer-harmonic combs, are\nobserved in kHz regime with Hz resolution by magnetically pumping the mm-scale\nresonator with near-resonant f0. The integer-harmonic combs are centered at\nlfp, while the half-integer-harmonic combs are centered at (2n - 1) fp/2\nresulting from the period-doubling bifurcation of fp. The tooth spacing of both\ntypes of combs is determined and can be continuously tuned by changing fs from\nHz to kHz. Moreover, the half-integer-harmonic combs can be purposely switched\nwith frequency shifting half a tooth spacing via suppressing period-doubling\nbifurcation. The experimentally observed formation, evolution, and switching of\ncombs can be well understood by introducing the bias magnetical force and\nmodulated linear stiffness into the Duffing equation. Our findings on\nmagnetically manipulated phononic frequency comb could provide a\nmagneto-mechanical platform for potential non-invasive and contactless sensing\nand even antenna for wireless operation.",

Be binary systems are expected\nto represent a key evolutionary stage in hosting BHs. However, while hundreds\nof Be X-ray binaries are known, the only confirmed BH candidate in a Be binary\nremains highly controversial. We report the discovery of ALS 8814, a Be star-BH\nbinary with a moderately eccentric ($e = 0.23$) and wide orbit ($P = 176.6$\ndays), revealed by the radial velocity (RV) measurement of the visible Be star.\nOur analysis, combining flux-calibrated spectra in the Balmer discontinuity\nregion and spectral template matching, yields a mass of $11.2^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$\n$M_\\odot$ for the Be star. The minimum mass of the unseen companion, assuming\nan edge-on inclination ($i = 90^{\\circ}$), is $9.8\\pm 0.7\\,M_\\odot$. We rule\nout the presence of non-degenerate companions in ALS 8814, indicating that it\ncan only be a BH. This discovery represents a robust case of a Be-BH binary,\nidentified purely through precise RV measurements from a single set of lines.\nThe extremely low peculiar velocity of ALS 8814 suggests that the BH is formed\nvia a direct core-collapse with a negligible natal kick, implying an almost\nperfect alignment between the Be star's spin and the orbital plane. In this\ncontext, the binary's inclination angle is estimated to be\n22$^{\\circ}$-49$^{\\circ}$ by analyzing the shallow double-peaked profile of the\nH$\\alpha$ emission line. This inclination range corresponds to a BH mass\nestimate between $15\\,M_\\odot$ and $58\\,M_\\odot$. As the only unambiguous Be-BH\nbinary system known to date, ALS 8814 provides valuable constraints on the BH\nformation in a binary system with a high-mass companion.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography (PACT) is an important imaging\ntechnique for monitoring physiological processes, capable of providing\nhigh-contrast images of optical absorption at much greater depths than\ntraditional optical imaging methods. However, practical instrumentation and\ngeometric constraints limit the number of acoustic sensors available around the\nimaging target, leading to sparsity in sensor data. Traditional photoacoustic\n(PA) image reconstruction methods, when directly applied to sparse PA data,\nproduce severe artifacts. Additionally, these traditional methods do not\nconsider the inter-frame relationships in dynamic imaging. Temporal resolution\nis crucial for dynamic photoacoustic imaging, which is fundamentally limited by\nthe low repetition rate (e.g., 20 Hz) and high cost of high-power laser\ntechnology. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has emerged as a\npowerful deep learning tool for solving inverse problems with sparse data, by\ncharacterizing signal properties as continuous functions of their coordinates\nin an unsupervised manner. In this work, we propose an INR-based method to\nimprove dynamic photoacoustic image reconstruction from sparse-views and\nenhance temporal resolution, using only spatiotemporal coordinates as input.\nSpecifically, the proposed INR represents dynamic photoacoustic images as\nimplicit functions and encodes them into a neural network. The weights of the\nnetwork are learned solely from the acquired sparse sensor data, without the\nneed for external training datasets or prior images. Benefiting from the strong\nimplicit continuity regularization provided by INR, as well as explicit\nregularization for low-rank and sparsity, our proposed method outperforms\ntraditional reconstruction methods under two different sparsity conditions,\neffectively suppressing artifacts and ensuring image quality.",

While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these\nmethods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source\nconsistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\\em FlowAlign}, a novel\ninversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal\ncontrol-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source\nsimilarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother\nand more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our\nterminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment\nwith the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the\ntrajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply\nreversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature\nof the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign\noutperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing\ncontrollability.",

However, contemporary medical AI models often\nadhere to a simplistic input-to-output paradigm, directly processing an image\nand an instruction to generate a result, where the instructions may be integral\nto the model's architecture. This approach overlooks the modeling of the\ninherent diagnostic reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. Such reasoning is\ntypically sequential, where each interpretive stage considers the images, the\ncurrent task, and the contextual information from previous stages. This\noversight leads to several shortcomings, including misalignment with clinical\nscenarios, contextless reasoning, and untraceable errors. To fill this gap, we\nconstruct CXRTrek, a new multi-stage visual question answering (VQA) dataset\nfor CXR interpretation. The dataset is designed to explicitly simulate the\ndiagnostic reasoning process employed by radiologists in real-world clinical\nsettings for the first time. CXRTrek covers 8 sequential diagnostic stages,\ncomprising 428,966 samples and over 11 million question-answer (Q&A) pairs,\nwith an average of 26.29 Q&A pairs per sample. Building on the CXRTrek dataset,\nwe propose a new vision-language large model (VLLM), CXRTrekNet, specifically\ndesigned to incorporate the clinical reasoning flow into the VLLM framework.\nCXRTrekNet effectively models the dependencies between diagnostic stages and\ncaptures reasoning patterns within the radiological context. Trained on our\ndataset, the model consistently outperforms existing medical VLLMs on the\nCXRTrek benchmarks and demonstrates superior generalization across multiple\ntasks on five diverse external datasets.

The COVID-19 pandemic\nhas revealed the limitations of traditional, in-person lung sound assessments.\nTo overcome these issues, advancements in digital stethoscopes and artificial\nintelligence (AI) have led to the development of new diagnostic methods. In\nthis context, our study aims to use smartphone microphones to record and\nanalyze lung sounds. We faced two major challenges: the difference in audio\nstyle between electronic stethoscopes and smartphone microphones, and the\nvariability among patients. To address these challenges, we developed a method\ncalled Patient Domain Supervised Contrastive Learning (PD-SCL). By integrating\nthis method with the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) model, we\nsignificantly improved its performance by 2.4\\% compared to the original AST\nmodel. This progress demonstrates that smartphones can effectively diagnose\nlung sounds, addressing inconsistencies in patient data and showing potential\nfor broad use beyond traditional clinical settings. Our research contributes to\nmaking lung disease detection more accessible in the post-COVID-19 world.",

Although the first solution\nguarantees the detection of the fault exponentially fast, the rate of\nconvergence is fully determined by the motor parameters that, in some cases,\nmay be too slow. The second observer, on the other hand, ensures finite\nconvergence time under the weakest assumption of interval excitation. To make\nthe observers adaptive, we develop a parameter estimator that, in the case of\nisotropic PMSMs, estimates on-line (exponentially fast) the resistance and\ninductance of the motor. It should be underscored that, in contrast with\nexisting observers (including the widely popular Kalman filter) that provide\nindirect information of the fault current, our observers provide explicit one\n-- namely the amplitude of the fault current.

At each round, the principal\nstrategically chooses one of the $N$ arms to incentivize for an arriving agent\nof unknown type. The agent then chooses an arm based on its own utility and the\nprovided incentive, and the principal receives a corresponding reward. The\nobjective is to minimize regret against the best incentive in hindsight.\nWithout prior knowledge of agent behavior, we show that the problem becomes\nintractable, leading to linear regret. We analyze two key settings where\nsublinear regret is achievable. In the first setting, the principal knows the\narm each agent type would select greedily for any given incentive.

    "abstract": "In the era of large-scale training, model merging has evolved into a tool for\ncreating multitasking models efficiently. It enables the knowledge of models to\nbe fused, without the need for heavy computation as required in traditional\nmultitask learning. Existing merging methods often assume that entries at\nidentical positions in weight matrices serve the same function, enabling\nstraightforward entry-wise comparison and merging. However, this assumption\noverlooks the complexity of finetuned neural networks, where neurons may\ndevelop distinct feature compositions, making direct entry-wise merging\nproblematic. We present Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM), a simple yet effective\napproach that leverages Singular Value Decomposition to decompose and\ncoordinate weight matrices into an aligned joint space, where entry-wise\nmerging becomes possible. We showcase the effectiveness of DRM across various\nsettings ranging from smaller encoder-based such as ViT and DeBERTa,\nencoder-decoder-based such as T5, and larger decoder-based such as Llama3.1-8B.\nOur experimental results show that DRM outperforms several state-of-the-art\nmerging techniques across full finetuning and low-rank adaptation settings.\nMoreover, our analysis reveals renormalization as the crucial component for\ncreating a robust and even joint space for merging, significantly contributing\nto the method's performance.",

Extensive experiments on 12\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance\nin both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks. The ablation study\nunderscores the effectiveness of the cross-correlation embedding module.\nAdditionally, the generalizability of this module makes it a valuable plug-in\nfor various forecasting tasks across different domains.

This practice, which we refer to as\nF-screening (since the overall null hypothesis is typically tested using an\n$F$-statistic), is in fact common practice across a number of applied fields.\nUnfortunately, it poses a problem: standard guarantees for the inferential\noutputs of linear regression, such as Type 1 error control of hypothesis tests\nand nominal coverage of confidence intervals, hold unconditionally, but fail to\nhold conditional on rejection of the overall null hypothesis. In this paper, we\ndevelop an inferential toolbox for the coefficients in a least squares model\nthat are valid conditional on rejection of the overall null hypothesis. We\ndevelop selective p-values that lead to tests that control the selective Type 1\nerror, i.e., the Type 1 error conditional on having rejected the overall null\nhypothesis. Furthermore, they can be computed without access to the raw data,\ni.e., using only the standard outputs of a least squares linear regression, and\ntherefore are suitable for use in a retrospective analysis of a published\nstudy. We also develop confidence intervals that attain nominal selective\ncoverage, and point estimates that account for having rejected the overall null\nhypothesis.

First, we prove that using a\nclassical PI control to stabilize a desired equilibrium leads to a very\ncomplicated dynamic behavior consisting of two equilibrium points, one of them\nalways unstable for all PI gains and circuit parameter values. Interestingly,\nthe second equilibrium point may be rendered stable -- but for all tuning gains\nleading to an extremely large value of the circuit current and the controller\nintegrator state. Moreover, if we neglect the resistive effect of the inductor,\nthere is only one equilibrium and it is always unstable. From a practical point\nof view, it is important to note that the only useful equilibrium point is that\nof minimum current and that, in addition, there is always a resistive component\nin the inductor either by its parasitic resistance or by the resistive\ncomponent of the output impedance of the previous stage. In opposition to this\ntroublesome scenario we recall three nonlinear voltage-feedback controllers,\nthat ensure asymptotic stability of the desired equilibrium with simple gain\ntuning rules, an easily defined domain of attraction and smooth transient\nbehavior. Two of them are very simple, nonlinear, static voltage feedback\nrules, while the third one is a variation of the PID scheme called\nPID-Passivity-based Control (PBC).

    "abstract": "An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two\nweak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID),\ngeneralized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by\nparallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the\ncurrent-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical\nfor a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model\npredicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the\nmagnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e.,\nregions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution\nof vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the\nvortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the\ncase of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many\nnanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions\nunder which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\\% supercurrent modulation and\nquantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current\ncurves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model\npredicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which\nthe critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the\nopposite polarity of the bias current.

Existing methods, primarily\noptimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and\nfail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we\npresent GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and\ntemporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos.\nGeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training\ndata and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size.\nTo overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to\nestimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then\nconditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as\nan image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of\ngeometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role\nto focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video\ndatasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and\ngeneralizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the\nchallenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth\nrepresentation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be\nestimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional\naffine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D\nhuman geometry estimation from videos.",

To address this\nissue, we propose BOGC-MML, a Bayesian-Oriented Gradient Calibration method for\nMML to explicitly model the gradient uncertainty and guide the model\noptimization towards the optimal direction. Specifically, we first model each\nmodality's gradient as a random variable and derive its probability\ndistribution, capturing the full uncertainty in the gradient space. Then, we\npropose an effective method that converts the precision (inverse variance) of\neach gradient distribution into a scalar evidence. This evidence quantifies the\nconfidence of each modality in every gradient dimension. Using these evidences,\nwe explicitly quantify per-dimension uncertainties and fuse them via a reduced\nDempster-Shafer rule. The resulting uncertainty-weighted aggregation produces a\ncalibrated update direction that balances sensitivity and conservatism across\ndimensions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.",

New SAR models are proposed to capture these\nnon-Gaussian features. In this project, the spatial error model (SEM), a widely\nused SAR-type model, is considered. Three novel SEMs are introduced that extend\nthe standard Gaussian SEM by incorporating Student's $t$-distributed errors\nafter a one-to-one transformation is applied to the response variable.\nVariational Bayes (VB) estimation methods are developed for these models, and\nthe framework is further extended to handle missing response data. Standard\nvariational Bayes (VB) methods perform well with complete datasets; however,\nhandling missing data requires a Hybrid VB (HVB) approach, which integrates a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler to generate missing values. The\nproposed VB methods are evaluated using both simulated and real-world datasets,\ndemonstrating their robustness and effectiveness in dealing with non-normal\ndata and missing data in spatial models.

This work introduces a machine learning\n(ML)-enabled, high-throughput framework for analyzing grazing incidence\nsmall-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data and atomic force microscopy (AFM)\nimages to characterize BCP thin film morphology. A convolutional neural network\nwas trained to classify AFM images by morphology type, achieving 97% testing\naccuracy.

ML models were\ndeveloped to predict morphological features based on processing parameters such\nas solvent ratio, additive type, and additive ratio. GISAXS-based properties\nwere predicted with strong performances ($R^2$ > 0.75), while AFM-based\nproperty predictions were less accurate ($R^2$ < 0.60), likely due to the\nlocalized nature of AFM measurements compared to the bulk information captured\nby GISAXS. Beyond model performance, interpretability was addressed using\nShapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP analysis revealed that the additive\nratio had the largest impact on morphological predictions, where additive\nprovides the BCP chains with increased volume to rearrange into\nthermodynamically favorable morphologies.

    "abstract": "Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly\nin emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions\nare made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools\nthat combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to\nmake consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the\nclinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply\nthe appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system\ndesigned to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying\nthe most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate\nCDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although\nCDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\\%\n(synthetic) and 8.7\\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM\nbaseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces\ncomputational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent\nnot only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective\nimaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully\nidentifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM\nprompting approaches.

We perform a comparative study of 2D and 3D resistive\nmodels around black holes. We examine accretion flow dynamics considering\nglobally uniform resistivity values, ranging from $\\sim 0$ to 0.1. During the\nsimulation time of $t \\lesssim 1000~t_g$, we find that the mass accretion rate\nis comparable for both the 2D and 3D models.

    "abstract": "Pruning is a widely used technique to compress large language models (LLMs)\nby removing unimportant weights, but it often suffers from significant\nperformance degradation - especially under semi-structured sparsity\nconstraints. Existing pruning methods primarily focus on estimating the\nimportance of individual weights, which limits their ability to preserve\ncritical capabilities of the model. In this work, we propose a new perspective:\nrather than merely selecting which weights to prune, we first redistribute\nparameter importance to make the model inherently more amenable to pruning. By\nminimizing the information entropy of normalized importance scores, our\napproach concentrates importance onto a smaller subset of weights, thereby\nenhancing pruning robustness. We instantiate this idea through DenoiseRotator,\nwhich applies learnable orthogonal transformations to the model's weight\nmatrices. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with\nexisting pruning techniques such as Magnitude, SparseGPT, and Wanda. Evaluated\non LLaMA3, Qwen2.5, and Mistral models under 50% unstructured and 2:4\nsemi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator consistently improves perplexity and\nzero-shot accuracy. For instance, on LLaMA3-70B pruned with SparseGPT at 2:4\nsemi-structured sparsity, DenoiseRotator reduces the perplexity gap to the\ndense model by 58%, narrowing the degradation from 8.1 to 3.4 points.

To further incorporate semantics while avoiding the significant memory\nand storage costs of high-dimensional semantic features, existing methods\nextend this paradigm by associating each primitive with a compressed semantic\nfeature vector. However, these methods have two major limitations: (a) the\nnaively compressed feature compromises expressiveness, affecting the model's\nability to capture fine-grained semantics, and (b) the pixel-wise primitive\nprediction introduces redundancy in overlapping areas, causing unnecessary\nmemory overhead. To this end, we introduce \\textbf{SpatialSplat}, a feedforward\nframework that produces redundancy-aware Gaussians and capitalizes on a\ndual-field semantic representation. Particularly, with the insight that\nprimitives within the same instance exhibit high semantic consistency, we\ndecompose the semantic representation into a coarse feature field that encodes\nuncompressed semantics with minimal primitives, and a fine-grained yet\nlow-dimensional feature field that captures detailed inter-instance\nrelationships. Moreover, we propose a selective Gaussian mechanism, which\nretains only essential Gaussians in the scene, effectively eliminating\nredundant primitives. Our proposed Spatialsplat learns accurate semantic\ninformation and detailed instances prior with more compact 3D Gaussians, making\nsemantic 3D reconstruction more applicable.

Unlike previous studies that primarily evaluate LEMs\nusing data from controlled clinical settings, our work assesses their\napplicability to real-world environments. We train a binary classifier that\ndistinguishes between normal and elevated stress states using resting-state EEG\ndata recorded from 18 graduate students during a class session. The\nbest-performing fine-tuned model achieves a balanced accuracy of 90.47% with a\n5-second window, significantly outperforming traditional stress classifiers in\nboth accuracy and inference efficiency. We further evaluate the robustness of\nthe fine-tuned LEM under random data shuffling and reduced channel counts.\nThese results demonstrate the capability of LEMs to effectively process\nreal-world EEG data and highlight their potential to revolutionize\nbrain-computer interface applications by shifting the focus from model-centric\nto data-centric design.",

To\naddress this question, we propose an Ensemble Learning Method for Named Entity\nRecognition (EL4NER), which aims at aggregating the ICL outputs of multiple\nopen-source, small-parameter LLMs to enhance overall performance in NER tasks\nat less deployment and inference cost. Specifically, our method comprises three\nkey components. First, we design a task decomposition-based pipeline that\nfacilitates deep, multi-stage ensemble learning. Second, we introduce a novel\nspan-level sentence similarity algorithm to establish an ICL demonstration\nretrieval mechanism better suited for NER tasks. Third, we incorporate a\nself-validation mechanism to mitigate the noise introduced during the ensemble\nprocess. We evaluated EL4NER on multiple widely adopted NER datasets from\ndiverse domains.

Current solutions to\nsubpopulation shift involve modifying empirical risk minimization with\nre-weighting strategies to improve generalization. This strategy relies on\nassumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on\ngroup membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead,\nwe propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk\nassociated with subpopulations. Given a feature extractor network, we replace\nits standard linear classification layer with a mixture of prototypical\nclassifiers, where each member is trained to classify the data while focusing\non different features and samples from other members. In empirical evaluation\non nine real-world datasets, covering diverse domains and kinds of\nsubpopulation shift, our method of Diverse Prototypical Ensembles (DPEs) often\noutperforms the prior state-of-the-art in worst-group accuracy.

Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success\nby considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In\nreal-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the\nretrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address\nthis issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context\nrobustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when\npreceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce\nCoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing\ncontext-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge.\nThis method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a\npreceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the\nmodel.

A\nrandomized complete block design was used with six treatments, including\nvarying concentrations of zinc sulphate applied via foliar spraying (0.1%,\n0.25%, 0.5%) or irrigation (4, 8, 16 kg/ha), each applied twice-one and two\nmonths after greening. Results from the first year revealed significant\ndifferences in yield and yield components across treatments. The highest seed\nyield and protein content were achieved with foliar application of 0.5% and\nirrigation application of 8 kg/ . Zinc application enhanced reproductive\nprocesses, including pollen viability and stigma receptivity, leading to\nimproved pod and seed attributes. However, excessive Zn application (e.g., 0.4%\nZn) resulted in reduced plant performance, likely due to phytotoxicity. Leaf Zn\nconcentration was significantly higher with 16 kg/ha applied via irrigation,\nwhile foliar applications at 0.1% also increased Zn uptake efficiently. The\nsecond growing season, however, showed no significant differences in traits\nacross treatments, which was attributed to favorable climatic conditions\nmitigating Zn deficiency. Zn deficiency remains a critical challenge globally,\nparticularly in calcareous and nutrient depleted soils, adversely affecting\nplant metabolism, root development, and nitrogen pathways. This study\nunderscores the importance of optimizing Zn supplementation strategies to\nenhance yield and quality while avoiding toxicity.

Mainstream detection methods\neither identify poisoned samples by analyzing the prediction probability of\npoisoned classification models or rely on the rewriting model to eliminate the\nstealthy triggers. However, the former cannot be applied to generation tasks,\nwhile the latter may degrade generation performance and introduce new triggers.\nTherefore, efficiently eliminating stealthy poisoned samples for LLMs remains\nan urgent problem. We observe that after applying TF-IDF clustering to the\nsample response, there are notable differences in the intra-class distances\nbetween clean and poisoned samples.

    "abstract": "The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has been rapidly\nadvancing in recent years, attracting interest in more fundamental approaches\nthat can reliably enhance their generalizability. This work demonstrates that\nmodel complexity control, conveniently implementable by adjusting the\ninitialization rate and weight decay coefficient, improves the scaling law of\nLLMs consistently over varying model sizes and data sizes. This gain is further\nillustrated by comparing the benchmark performance of 2.4B models pretrained on\n1T tokens with different complexity hyperparameters. Instead of fixing the\ninitialization std, we found that a constant initialization rate (the exponent\nof std) enables the scaling law to descend faster in both model and data sizes.\nThese results indicate that complexity control is a promising direction for the\ncontinual advancement of LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches in unsupervised or self supervised learning for\nskeleton-based action classification have concentrated predominantly on the\ndynamic aspects of skeletal sequences. Yet, the intricate interaction between\nthe moving and static elements of the skeleton presents a rarely tapped\ndiscriminative potential for action classification. This paper introduces a\nnovel measurement, referred to as spatial-temporal joint density (STJD), to\nquantify such interaction. Tracking the evolution of this density throughout an\naction can effectively identify a subset of discriminative moving and/or static\njoints termed \"prime joints\" to steer self-supervised learning. A new\ncontrastive learning strategy named STJD-CL is proposed to align the\nrepresentation of a skeleton sequence with that of its prime joints while\nsimultaneously contrasting the representations of prime and nonprime joints. In\naddition, a method called STJD-MP is developed by integrating it with a\nreconstruction-based framework for more effective learning. Experimental\nevaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKUMMD datasets in various\ndownstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed STJD-CL and STJD-MP improved\nperformance, particularly by 3.5 and 3.6 percentage points over the\nstate-of-the-art contrastive methods on the NTU RGB+D 120 dataset using X-sub\nand X-set evaluations, respectively.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution (HR) remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in a wide\nrange of applications, including urban planning and environmental monitoring.\nHowever, due to limitations in sensors and data transmission links, the images\nacquired in practice often suffer from resolution degradation. Remote Sensing\nImage Super-Resolution (RSISR) aims to reconstruct HR images from\nlow-resolution (LR) inputs, providing a cost-effective and efficient\nalternative to direct HR image acquisition. Existing RSISR methods primarily\nfocus on low-level characteristics in pixel space, while neglecting the\nhigh-level understanding of remote sensing scenes. This may lead to\nsemantically inconsistent artifacts in the reconstructed results. Motivated by\nthis observation, our work aims to explore the role of high-level semantic\nknowledge in improving RSISR performance. We propose a Semantic-Guided\nSuper-Resolution framework, SeG-SR, which leverages Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs) to extract semantic knowledge from input images and uses it to guide the\nsuper resolution (SR) process. Specifically, we first design a Semantic Feature\nExtraction Module (SFEM) that utilizes a pretrained VLM to extract semantic\nknowledge from remote sensing images. Next, we propose a Semantic Localization\nModule (SLM), which derives a series of semantic guidance from the extracted\nsemantic knowledge. Finally, we develop a Learnable Modulation Module (LMM)\nthat uses semantic guidance to modulate the features extracted by the SR\nnetwork, effectively incorporating high-level scene understanding into the SR\npipeline. We validate the effectiveness and generalizability of SeG-SR through\nextensive experiments: SeG-SR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two\ndatasets and consistently delivers performance improvements across various SR\narchitectures.

Wide area surveys detect clusters based on\nobservables, such as the total integrated Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect signal\n($Y_{SZ}$) in the case of Planck. Quantifying the survey selection function is\nnecessary for a cosmological analysis, with completeness representing the\nprobability of detecting a cluster as a function of its intrinsic properties.\nEmploying a Monte-Carlo method, we inject triaxial cluster profiles into random\npositions within the Planck all-sky maps, and subsequently determine the\ncompleteness of the Planck-selected CHEXMATE sample as a function of both\ngeometry and SZ brightness. This is then used to generate 1000 mock CHEX-MATE\ncluster catalogs, and the distribution of shapes and orientations of the\ndetected clusters, along with any associated bias in weak lensing-derived mass\n($M_{WL}$) due to this orientation-dependent selection, denoted as $1 -\nb_{\\chi}$, is obtained. We show that cluster orientation impacts completeness,\nwith a higher probability of detecting clusters elongated along the line of\nsight (LOS). This leads to $1 - b_{\\chi}$ values of $0-4\\%$ for CHEXMATE\nclusters relative to a random population.

    "abstract": "In numerous online selection problems, decision-makers (DMs) must allocate on\nthe fly limited resources to customers with uncertain values. The DM faces the\ntension between allocating resources to currently observed values and saving\nthem for potentially better, unobserved values in the future. Addressing this\ntension becomes more demanding if an uncertain disruption occurs while serving\ncustomers. Without any disruption, the DM gets access to the capacity\ninformation to serve customers throughout the time horizon. However, with\nuncertain disruption, the DM must act more cautiously due to risk of running\nout of capacity abruptly or misusing the resources. Motivated by this tension,\nwe introduce the Online Selection with Uncertain Disruption (OS-UD) problem. In\nOS-UD, a DM sequentially observes n non-negative values drawn from a common\ndistribution and must commit to select or reject each value in real time,\nwithout revisiting past values. The disruption is modeled as a Bernoulli random\nvariable with probability p each time DM selects a value. We aim to design an\nonline algorithm that maximizes the expected sum of selected values before a\ndisruption occurs, if any.\n  We evaluate online algorithms using the competitive ratio. Using a\nquantile-based approach, we devise a non-adaptive single-threshold algorithm\nthat attains a competitive ratio of at least 1-1/e, and an adaptive threshold\nalgorithm characterized by a sequence of non-increasing thresholds that attains\nan asymptotic competitive ratio of at least 0.745. Both of these results are\nworst-case optimal within their corresponding class of algorithms.",

In artificial neural networks, this\nis typically accomplished by conditioning a network upon task context by\ninjecting context as input. Brains have a different strategy: the parameters\nthemselves are modulated as a function of various neuromodulators such as\nserotonin. Here, we take inspiration from neuromodulation and propose to learn\nweights which are smoothly parameterized functions of task context variables.\nRather than optimize a weight vector, i.e. a single point in weight space, we\noptimize a smooth manifold in weight space with a predefined topology. To\naccomplish this, we derive a formal treatment of optimization of manifolds as\nthe minimization of a loss functional subject to a constraint on volumetric\nmovement, analogous to gradient descent. During inference, conditioning selects\na single point on this manifold which serves as the effective weight matrix for\na particular sub-task. This strategy for conditioning has two main advantages.\nFirst, the topology of the manifold (whether a line, circle, or torus) is a\nconvenient lever for inductive biases about the relationship between tasks.\nSecond, learning in one state smoothly affects the entire manifold, encouraging\ngeneralization across states. To verify this, we train manifolds with several\ntopologies, including straight lines in weight space (for conditioning on e.g.\nnoise level in input data) and ellipses (for rotated images). Despite their\nsimplicity, these parameterizations outperform conditioning identical networks\nby input concatenation and better generalize to out-of-distribution samples.\nThese results suggest that modulating weights over low-dimensional manifolds\noffers a principled and effective alternative to traditional conditioning.",

This\ntask becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models\n(LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic\nstructures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address\nthis by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to\nresolve hidden or ambiguous entities.

To address these challenges, we propose\nVerify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and\ncomprehension abilities of LLM agents.

    "abstract": "By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the\nnature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from\nmid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more\nidealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st\ncentury cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual pro-cess theories\nto artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this\nhistory. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from\nexperiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflec-tivism, the\nposition that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is pragmatic\nswitching between intuitive and reflective inference to opti-mally fulfill\ncompeting goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism,\ntranscends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or\nchains of thought, applies to both individual and collective intelligence\nsystems (including human-AI teams), and becomes increasingly actionable as we\nlearn more about the value of intuition and reflection.",

Previous studies have employed statistical methods rooted in\nnetwork theory, including the Gaussian graphical model, to infer networks among\nproteins, identifying hub proteins based on key structural properties of\nnetworks such as degree centrality. However, there has been limited research\nexamining a prognostic role of hub proteins on outcomes, while adjusting for\nclinical covariates in the context of high-dimensional data. To address this\ngap, we propose a network-guided penalized regression method. First, we\nconstruct a network using the Gaussian graphical model to identify hub\nproteins. Next, we preserve these identified hub proteins along with clinically\nrelevant factors, while applying adaptive Lasso to non-hub proteins for\nvariable selection. Our network-guided estimators are shown to have variable\nselection consistency and asymptotic normality. Simulation results suggest that\nour method produces better results compared to existing methods and\ndemonstrates promise for advancing biomarker identification in proteomics\nresearch.

Formal\nverification with model-checking provides guarantees but it may often take too\nlong or even fail for complex models of the environment.

Our new\napproach introduces structural abstraction instead, which we investigated in\nthe context of voxel representation of the robot environment. This kind of\nabstraction leads to abstract voxels. We also propose a complete and automated\nverification workflow, which is based on an already existing methodology for\nrobot applications, and inspired by the key ideas behind counterexample-guided\nabstraction refinement (CEGAR) - performing an initial abstraction and\nsuccessively introducing refinements based on counterexamples, intertwined with\nmodel-checker runs. Hence, our approach uses selective refinement of structural\nabstractions to improve the runtime efficiency of model-checking.

Most models struggle with accurately\ncapturing complex object interactions, often treating some objects as static\nbackground elements and limiting their movement. In addition, they often fail\nto generate multiple distinct objects as specified in the prompt, resulting in\nincorrect generations or mixed features across objects. In this paper, we\npresent a novel training-free approach for multi-object video generation that\nleverages the open world knowledge of diffusion models and large language\nmodels (LLMs). We use an LLM as the ``director'' of object trajectories, and\napply the trajectories through noise re-initialization to achieve precise\ncontrol of realistic movements. We further refine the generation process by\nmanipulating the attention mechanism to better capture object-specific features\nand motion patterns, and prevent cross-object feature interference.

To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged\nmobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise\ncoordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified\nreinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills\ninvolving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and\nstriking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes\nreal-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between\nsimulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors.\nOur method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement\nlearning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification\ntechniques to enhance deployment readiness.

However,\ndue to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on\nisotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data\nmanifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose\nEquivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for\nregularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers.\nEquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and\npenalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new\ndistribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that\nexhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold\nsamples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling\nprocess. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image\nrestoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.",

Notably,\nwhile humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions\nproactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind\n(ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To\naddress this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader\n(ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by\nincorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness\nand analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by\nprompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central\nclaim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to\npredict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully\ndesigned reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to\nanalyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective\narguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B\nparameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative\ngain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora.

    "abstract": "The remarkable growth in large language model (LLM) capabilities has spurred\nexploration into multi-agent systems, with debate frameworks emerging as a\npromising avenue for enhanced problem-solving. These multi-agent debate (MAD)\napproaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine\narguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse\nperspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a\nsystematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods,\nparticularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to\nfill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling\ntechnique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration\ncapabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD\nwith strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning\nand safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of\ntask difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key\nfindings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages\nover self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem\ndifficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little\nbenefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can\nincrease vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations\nfacilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative\nrefinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the\nfuture development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.",

We conduct\nextensive evaluations on different prompting strategies and more than 10 LLMs,\nincluding foundation models, reasoning models and multimodal vision models. The\nresults show that, although current LLMs achieve good performance, their\ncapabilities largely rely on semantic matching rather than principled reasoning\ngrounded in the underlying HSE compliance context. Moreover, their native\nreasoning trace lacks the systematic legal reasoning required for rigorous HSE\ncompliance assessment. To alleviate these, we propose a new prompting\ntechnique, Reasoning of Expert (RoE), which guides LLMs to simulate the\nreasoning process of different experts for compliance assessment and reach a\nmore accurate unified decision.

By\nparameterizing volatility surfaces with the 5-parameter stochastic volatility\ninspired (SVI) model augmented by a one-factor term structure adjustment, we\nfirst generate numerous volatility surfaces over realistic ranges for these\nparameters. From these synthetic market scenarios, we then compute\nhigh-accuracy valuations using conventional methodologies for two\nrepresentative products: the fair strike of a variance swap and the price and\nGreeks of an American put. We then train the Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR)\nto learn the nonlinear mapping from the input risk factors, which are the\nvolatility surface parameters, strike and interest rate, to the valuation\noutputs. Once trained, We use the GPR to perform out-of-sample valuations and\ncompare the results against valuations using conventional methodologies. Our ML\nmodel achieves very accurate results of $0.5\\%$ relative error for the fair\nstrike of variance swap and $1.7\\% \\sim 3.5\\%$ relative error for American put\nprices and first-order Greeks. More importantly, after training, the model\ncomputes valuations almost instantly, yielding a three to four orders of\nmagnitude speedup over Crank-Nicolson finite-difference method for American\nputs, enabling real-time risk analytics, dynamic hedging and large-scale\nscenario analysis.

If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and\nallow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the\ndiscovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and\nthe human design of a suitable search space. The G\\\"odel machine proposed a\ntheoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in\na provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net\nbeneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\\\"odel Machine\n(DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby\nalso improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically\nvalidates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution\nand open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding\nagents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a\nfoundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent.\nThis open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality\nagents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the\nsearch space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding\ncapabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management,\npeer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to\n50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly\noutperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All\nexperiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human\noversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of\ngathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless\ninnovation.",

This analysis revealed that the anomalies\nin both events are of planetary origin, although their exact interpretation is\ncomplicated by different types of degeneracy. In the case of MOA-2022-BLG-091,\nthe main difficulty in the interpretation of the anomaly arises from a newly\nidentified degeneracy related to the uncertain angle at which the source\ntrajectory intersects the planet-host axis. For KMT-2024-BLG-1209, the\ninterpretation is affected by the previously known inner-outer degeneracy,\nwhich leads to ambiguity between solutions in which the source passes through\neither the inner or outer caustic region relative to the planet host. Bayesian\nanalysis indicates that the planets in both lens systems are giant planets with\nmasses about 2 to 4 times that of Jupiter, orbiting early K-type main-sequence\nstars. Both systems are likely located in the Galactic disk at a distance of\naround 4 kiloparsecs. The degeneracy in KMT-2024-BLG-1209 is challenging to\nresolve because it stems from intrinsic similarities in the caustic structures\nof the degenerate solutions.

Each family arises\nfrom unimodular points of an affine variety defined by palindromic polynomials.\nThe families are given as an image of a function that solves the corresponding\nsystem of polynomials on a domain that guarantees unimodularity of the\nsolutions",
