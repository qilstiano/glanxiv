    "abstract": "Amorphous materials offer unique functional characteristics, which are often\nnot observed in their crystalline counterparts. This makes them invaluable for\nmany technological applications, such as diffusion barriers in semiconductor\ndevices. However, the computationally guided search for new functional\namorphous materials with attractive properties represents a major challenge. In\nthis work, we combine theory and experiment to discover and synthesize the\namorphous ternary nitride Y2WN4. We show how computational random structure\nsampling offers a route to robustly identify chemistries which are hard to\ncrystallize. Experiments prove that the predicted nitride is easily synthesized\nin amorphous phase with no detectable precipitates. The material exhibits\nremarkable stability against crystallization at high temperature and as well as\nexcellent oxidation resistance and stability against Cu diffusion. Moreover,\nY2WN4 exhibits a sharp onset of optical absorption and an indirect band gap of\n2.24 eV. These properties make this material promising for the integration in\nelectronic devices as a high-performance diffusion barrier with adjustable band\nedges.",

While current code embedding models have demonstrated promise in\nretrieving code snippets for small-scale, well-defined tasks, they often\nunderperform in more demanding real-world applications such as bug localization\nwithin GitHub repositories. We hypothesize that a key issue is their reliance\non noisy and inconsistent datasets for training, which impedes their ability to\ngeneralize to more complex retrieval scenarios. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce CoRNStack, a large-scale, high-quality contrastive training\ndataset for code that spans multiple programming languages. This dataset is\ncurated using consistency filtering to eliminate noisy positives and is further\nenriched with mined hard negatives, thereby facilitating more effective\nlearning. We demonstrate that contrastive training of embedding models using\nCoRNStack leads to state-of-the-art performance across a variety of code\nretrieval tasks. Furthermore, the dataset can be leveraged for training code\nreranking models, a largely underexplored area compared to text reranking. Our\nfinetuned code reranking model significantly improves the ranking quality over\nthe retrieved results.

    "abstract": "Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-based Fault Localization (FL) techniques\nhave been proposed, and showed improved performance with explanations on FL\nresults. However, a major issue with LLM-based FL techniques is their heavy\nreliance on LLMs, which are often unreliable, expensive, and difficult to\nanalyze or improve. When results are unsatisfactory, it is challenging both to\ndetermine a cause and to refine a technique for better outcomes.\n  To address this issue, we propose LogicFL, a novel logical fault localization\ntechnique for Null Pointer Exceptions (NPEs). With logic programming, LogicFL\nimitates human developers' deduction process of fault localization, and\nidentifies causes of NPEs after logical inferences on collected facts about\nfaulty code and test execution. In an empirical evaluation of 76 NPE bugs from\nApache Commons projects and the Defects4J benchmark, LogicFL accurately\nidentified the fault locations and pinpointed the exact code fragments causing\nthe NPEs for 67 bugs (88.16%), which were 19.64% and 4.69% more bugs than two\ncompared LLM-based FL techniques respectively. In addition, LogicFL can be\nexecuted on a low-performance machine similar to a typical laptop, with an\naverage runtime of 21.63 seconds and a worst-case time of under two minutes,\nincluding test execution and output file generation. Moreover, when compared to\nthe two LLM-based FL techniques using the GPT-4o model, LogicFL was\nsignificantly more cost-efficient, as those techniques required 343.94 and\n3,736.19 times the cost of LogicFL, respectively. Last but not least, the\ndeduction process in LogicFL for providing FL results is fully traceable,\nenabling us to understand the reasoning behind the technique's outcomes and to\nfurther enhance the technique.",

Leveraging their strong generalization and flexibility,\npre-trained vision-language embedding models such as CLIP (Contrastive\nLanguage-Image Pre-training) have been widely adopted and validated in CL. In\naddition to learning new knowledge, we investigate whether the pre-trained\nknowledge in CLIP, can be retained or even enhanced, in CL, while incorporating\nnew knowledge from a data stream. Existing CL methods primarily focus on\ncontinual downstream adaptation using components isolated from the pre-trained\nmodel (PTM), increasing inference complexity and limiting improvements to the\nPTM itself; some also retain knowledge by relying on additional reference data,\nresulting in high training costs. To address these limitations, we propose a\nuniversal and efficient CL approach for CLIP based on Dynamic Rank-Selective\nLoRA (CoDyRA), which directly improves the PTMs while preserving the existing\nknowledge from both pre-training and CL. By analyzing how LoRA rank and\nplacement affect learning and forgetting in CL, we design CoDyRA that\nadaptively performs rank-minimized parameter updates in different modules,\nbased on their importance to the current data. This ensures a balance between\nknowledge acquisition (plasticity) and forgetting mitigation (stability). Our\nmethod operates without explicit domain or distribution prediction and does not\nrely on reference data, enabling seamless task integration while maintaining\npre-trained capabilities. Moreover, CoDyRA preserves the original model\narchitecture and deployment pipeline, introducing no additional inference\noverhead.

However, the use of relatively distinct setups that often lack a sequence\nmodeling nature to them makes it unclear how general the reported insights from\nsuch studies are. Motivated by this, we propose a synthetic sequence modeling\ntask that involves learning to simulate a finite mixture of Markov chains. As\nwe show, models trained on this task reproduce most well-known results on ICL,\nhence offering a unified setting for studying the concept. Building on this\nsetup, we demonstrate we can explain a model's behavior by decomposing it into\nfour broad algorithms that combine a fuzzy retrieval vs. inference approach\nwith either unigram or bigram statistics of the context. These algorithms\nengage in a competition dynamics to dominate model behavior, with the precise\nexperimental conditions dictating which algorithm ends up superseding others:\ne.g., we find merely varying context size or amount of training yields (at\ntimes sharp) transitions between which algorithm dictates the model behavior,\nrevealing a mechanism that explains the transient nature of ICL. In this sense,\nwe argue ICL is best thought of as a mixture of different algorithms, each with\nits own peculiarities, instead of a monolithic capability.

Therefore, mutual coupling has to date been considered a\nvexing nuance that is frequently neglected in theoretical studies and\ndeliberately mitigated in experimental prototypes.

The\npaper makes three main claims: (1) There is a statistically significant\n(inverse) relationship between chemical complexity (quantified as the number of\ndifferent types of molecules present in a given environment) and mass fraction\nfor the successively smaller environments in the hierarchy of cosmic matter\n(extragalactic medium, interstellar clouds, dense cores, planetary systems,\ntheir icy fraction etc.) that is well described by a logarithmic law. (2)\nMinimal chemical complexity of life can be roughly defined, based on existing\nstudies in vitro and in silico, both bottom-up (designing increasingly complex\nchemical systems) and top-down (simplifying minimal organisms). (3) Thus, one\ncan estimate the fraction of the total mass density of the Universe that\nresides in reservoirs of chemical complexity estimated as being minimal for\nlife. This is then translated, through simple statistical models of planetary\nsystems, into the number of planets in a single Milky Way-sized galaxy that\nhave, on their surface, reservoirs of biogenic chemical complexity. Two best\nmodels give the estimates of 1.6 (more complex minimal life) and 1.3e4\n(slightly less complex minimal life) as the predicted upper bound for the\nnumber of instances of life per our Galaxy.",

As slow thermal\ndynamics of extended systems are expected to limit modulation speeds\nultimately, research has primarily focused on steady-state effects. In this\nstudy, we investigate photo-driven TONL in amorphous silicon (a-Si)\nmetasurfaces both under steady-state and, most importantly, dynamic conditions\n(50 kHz modulation) using a 488 nm continuous-wave pump laser. First, we show\nthat a non-monotonic change in the steady-state transmission occurs at\nwavelengths longer than the electric-dipole resonance (800 nm). In particular,\nat 815 nm transmission first decreases by 30% and then increases by 30% as the\nlaser intensity is raised to 5 mW/{\\mu}m2. Next, we demonstrate that TONL\ndecouple the thermal and optical characteristic times, the latter being up to 7\ntimes shorter in the tested conditions (i.e {\\tau}opt =0.5 {\\mu}s vs {\\tau}th\n=3.5 {\\mu}s). Most remarkably, we experimentally demonstrate that combining\nthese two effects enables optical modulation at twice the speed (100 kHz) of\nthe excitation laser modulation. We finally show how to achieve all-optical\ntransmission modulation at MHz speeds with large amplitudes (85%). Overall,\nthese results show that photo-driven TONL produce large and fully reversible\ntransmission modulation in dielectric metasurfaces with fast and adjustable\nspeeds. Therefore, they open completely new opportunities toward exploiting\nTONL in dynamically reconfigurable systems, from optical switching to wavefront\nmanipulation.",

After identifying the host galaxies and collecting\nredshift information, we characterized the radio galaxies in terms of their\nradio morphologies, rest frame radio luminosities, and linear sizes. We\ncalculated residual rotation measures (RRMs) by removing the Galactic RM and\nstudied the variation in the RRMs with redshift and degree of polarization. We\nproduced an RRM grid of the field and compared the positions of the polarized\nsources with those of galaxy clusters and superclusters.

Using available multiband\ncatalogs, we found redshifts for the hosts of all polarized sources in the\nrange of 0.06 to 1.9. Polarized emission is detected mainly from large radio\ngalaxies. The RRM values have a median close to zero, and they appear to be\nindependent of redshift and degree of polarization.

However, it is well-known that FL is vulnerable to manipulated updates\nfrom clients. In this work we study the impact of data heterogeneity on\nclients' incentives to manipulate their updates. First, we present\nheterogeneous collaborative learning scenarios where a client can modify their\nupdates to be better off, and show that these manipulations can lead to\ndiminishing model performance. To prevent such modifications, we formulate a\ngame in which clients may misreport their gradient updates in order to \"steer\"\nthe server model to their advantage. We develop a payment rule that provably\ndisincentivizes sending modified updates under the FedSGD protocol. We derive\nexplicit bounds on the clients' payments and the convergence rate of the global\nmodel, which allows us to study the trade-off between heterogeneity, payments\nand convergence. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation of the\neffectiveness of our payment rule in the FedSGD, median-based aggregation\nFedSGD and FedAvg protocols on three tasks in computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing.

Our method learns two layers of soft tokens as guiding\nprompts: (1) global tokens encapsulating task-level information about\ntrajectories, and (2) adaptive tokens that deliver focused, timestep-specific\ninstructions. The adaptive tokens are dynamically retrieved from a curated set\nof demonstration segments, ensuring context-aware guidance.

This proof-of-concept\nstudy examines the orbital effects of stellar collisions using a semi-analytic\nmodel. Both low and high speed collisions occur in the SMBH's sphere of\ninfluence. We find that collisions can place stars on nearly radial orbits.\nDepositing stars within the tidal radius, collisions may drive the disruption\nof stars with unusual masses and structures: depending on the nature of the\ncollision, the star could be the product of a recent merger, or it could have\nlost its outer layers in a previous high speed impact, appearing as a stripped\nstar. We also find that high speed collisions near the periapsis of an\neccentric orbit can unbind stars from the SMBH. However, dissipation during\nthese high-speed collisions can substantially reduce the number of unbound\nstars achieved in our simulations. We conclude that tidal disruption events\n(TDEs) and ejected stars, even in the hypervelocity regime, are plausible\noutcomes of stellar collisions, though their frequency in a three-dimensional\nnuclear star cluster are uncertain.

Locally amphiphilic structure is characteristic of many\nthermoresponsive polymers, both linear and grafted, which endows them with\nlocal surface activity. Self-assembly of such copolymers exhibits a rich\ndiversity of morphologies, which are analyzed in the present work in the limit\nof high surface activity of amphiphilic dimers with solvophilic/polar pendants.\nDepending on the composition and architecture of the copolymer and sizes and\ninteraction parameters of the solvophilic/polar pendants, we build\nmorphological diagrams of copolymer solutions. Copolymers with small volume\npendants form precipitates or large aggregates with internal voids containing\nthese pendants. For moderate volume pendants, a lamellar structure (or large\nvesicles) is observed at smaller fractions of amphiphilic monomer units in the\nchain and micelles are formed at larger fractions of these units. The sizes and\nshapes of micelles depend on the monomer distribution along the chain, and the\nblocky architecture favors the existence of single spherical micelles or\nspherical particles that constitute compound micelles. For sufficiently large\npolar pendants, copolymers of both types mainly form granular branched compound\nmicelles. The distance at which adjacent hydrophobic and polar groups are\nlocated in a chain determines the size of domains and particles formed by\nlocally amphiphilic blocks or chains. Our predictions explain the existence of\ndense multicore complex micelles consisting of beads of several tens of\nnanometers size and other structures such as disc-shaped micelles.",

This paper argues that existing\napproaches from both the computer algebra and computational logic communities\nare unsatisfactory for systems that consider the satisfiability of formulas\nwith quantifiers or that perform quantifier elimination. To address this, we\npropose the notion of the fair-satisfiability of a formula, use it to\ncharacterize formulas with divisions that are well-defined, meaning that they\nadequately guard divisions against division by zero, and provide a translation\nalgorithm that converts a formula with divisions into a purely polynomial\nformula that is satisfiable if and only if the original formula is\nfair-satisfiable.

In the\npresent article, we extend the different construction steps of samplets to\nfunctionals in Banach spaces more general than point evaluations. To obtain\nstable representations, we assume that these functionals form frames with\nsquare-summable coefficients or even Riesz bases with square-summable\ncoefficients. In either case, the corresponding analysis operator is injective\nand we obtain samplet bases with the desired properties by means of\nconstructing an isometry of the analysis operator's image. Making the\nassumption that the dual of the Banach space under consideration is imbedded\ninto the space of compactly supported distributions, the multilevel hierarchy\nfor the generalized samplet construction is obtained by spectral clustering of\na similarity graph for the functionals' supports. Based on this multilevel\nhierarchy, generalized samplets exhibit vanishing moments with respect to a\ngiven set of primitives within the Banach space. We derive an abstract\nlocalization result for the generalized samplet coefficients with respect to\nthe samplets' support sizes and the approximability of the Banach space\nelements by the chosen primitives.

    "abstract": "Typical dynamic ST data includes trajectory data (representing\nindividual-level mobility) and traffic state data (representing\npopulation-level mobility). Traditional studies often treat trajectory and\ntraffic state data as distinct, independent modalities, each tailored to\nspecific tasks within a single modality. However, real-world applications, such\nas navigation apps, require joint analysis of trajectory and traffic state\ndata. Treating these data types as two separate domains can lead to suboptimal\nmodel performance. Although recent advances in ST data pre-training and ST\nfoundation models aim to develop universal models for ST data analysis, most\nexisting models are \"multi-task, solo-data modality\" (MTSM), meaning they can\nhandle multiple tasks within either trajectory data or traffic state data, but\nnot both simultaneously. To address this gap, this paper introduces BIGCity,\nthe first multi-task, multi-data modality (MTMD) model for ST data analysis.\nThe model targets two key challenges in designing an MTMD ST model: (1)\nunifying the representations of different ST data modalities, and (2) unifying\nheterogeneous ST analysis tasks. To overcome the first challenge, BIGCity\nintroduces a novel ST-unit that represents both trajectories and traffic states\nin a unified format. Additionally, for the second challenge, BIGCity adopts a\ntunable large model with ST task-oriented prompt, enabling it to perform a\nrange of heterogeneous tasks without the need for fine-tuning. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that BIGCity achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across 8 tasks, outperforming 18 baselines. To the\nbest of our knowledge, BIGCity is the first model capable of handling both\ntrajectories and traffic states for diverse heterogeneous tasks.

    "abstract": "Shape completion, a crucial task in 3D computer vision, involves predicting\nand filling the missing regions of scanned or partially observed objects.\nCurrent methods expect known pose or canonical coordinates and do not perform\nwell under varying rotations, limiting their real-world applicability. We\nintroduce ESCAPE (Equivariant Shape Completion via Anchor Point Encoding), a\nnovel framework designed to achieve rotation-equivariant shape completion. Our\napproach employs a distinctive encoding strategy by selecting anchor points\nfrom a shape and representing all points as a distance to all anchor points.\nThis enables the model to capture a consistent, rotation-equivariant\nunderstanding of the object's geometry. ESCAPE leverages a transformer\narchitecture to encode and decode the distance transformations, ensuring that\ngenerated shape completions remain accurate and equivariant under rotational\ntransformations. Subsequently, we perform optimization to calculate the\npredicted shapes from the encodings. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that\nESCAPE achieves robust, high-quality reconstructions across arbitrary rotations\nand translations, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world applications\nwithout additional pose estimation modules.",

We present an integrated workflow combining\ndensity functional theory (DFT) with quantum algorithms through an active space\nembedding scheme, specifically applied to studying 1,2,4-Triazole and\n1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol inhibitors on Al111 surfaces. Our implementation\nleverages the ADAPT-VQE algorithm with benchmarking against classical DFT\ncalculations, achieving binding energies of -0.386 eV and -1.279 eV for\n1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol, respectively. The enhanced binding\nenergy of the thiol derivative aligns with experimental observations regarding\nsulfur-functionalized inhibitors' improved corrosion protection. The\nmethodology employs the orb-d3-v2 machine learning potential for rapid geometry\noptimizations, followed by accurate DFT calculations using CP2K with PBE\nfunctional and Grimme's D3 dispersion corrections. Our benchmarking on smaller\nsystems reveals that StatefulAdaptVQE implementation achieves a 5-6x\ncomputational speedup while maintaining accuracy.

In this study, we investigated the crystal growth,\nmicrostructure, and thermoelectric properties of CdSnAs2. Contrary to\nconventional theory of unidirectional melt growth, CdSnAs2 samples at higher\ncooling rates exhibited better crystallinity, while some cracks were observed\nin samples cooled more slowly. Thermal analyses clarified that a phase\ntransition from sphalerite to chalcopyrite occurred after solidification in the\ncase of slow cooling, leading to dislocations and cracks due to the lattice\nmismatch between phases. The analysis at rapid cooling suggested that\nsupercooling lowers the solidification temperature and produces an appropriate\nmicrostructure. Consequently, the sample grown at the highest cooling rate (7.6\nK/min) achieved an ultrahigh power factor of 3.18 mW/mK^2 at 600 K and a peak\nzT of 0.62 at 682 K.

    "abstract": "Forecast verification plays a crucial role in the development cycle of\noperational numerical weather prediction models. At the same time, verification\nremains a challenge as the traditionally used non-spatial forecast quality\nmetrics exhibit certain drawbacks, with new spatial metrics being developed to\naddress these problems. Some of these new metrics are based on smoothing, with\none example being the widely used Fraction Skill Score (FSS) and its many\nderivatives. However, while the FSS has been used by many researchers in\nlimited area domains, there are no examples of it being used in a global domain\nyet. The issue is due to the increased computational complexity of smoothing in\na global domain, with its inherent spherical geometry and non-equidistant\nand/or irregular grids. At the same time, there clearly exists a need for\nspatial metrics that could be used in the global domain as the operational\nglobal models continue to be developed and improved, along with the new\nmachine-learning-based models. Here, we present two new methodologies for\nsmoothing in a global domain that are potentially fast enough to make the\nsmoothing of high-resolution global fields feasible. Both approaches also\nconsider the variability of grid point area sizes and can handle missing data\nappropriately. This, in turn, makes the calculation of smoothing-based metrics,\nsuch as FSS and its derivatives, in a global domain possible, which we\ndemonstrate by evaluating the performance of operational high-resolution global\nprecipitation forecasts provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range\nWeather Forecasts.",

To reconcile these tensions via late-time\nmodifications to expansion history, various features such as phantom crossing\nin the dark energy equation of state, a negative energy density at high\nredshifts, etc., are favoured. However, these scenarios cannot be realized\nwithin the framework of GR without introducing ghost or gradient instabilities.\nIn this work, we investigate a dynamical dark energy scenario within the\nframework of Horndeski gravity, incorporating nonminimal coupling to gravity\nand self-interactions. We highlight that the model can exhibit novel features\nlike phantom crossing and negative dark energy densities at high redshifts\nwithout introducing any instabilities. For this specific Horndeski model, we\nperform a comprehensive analysis of the background evolution along with the\neffects on perturbations, examining observables like growth rate, matter and\nCMB power spectrum. To check the consistency of the model with the\nobservational data, we employ MCMC analysis using BAO/$f\\sigma_8$, Supernovae,\nand CMB data. While the model does not outperform the standard $\\Lambda$CDM\nframework in a combined likelihood analysis, there remains a preference for\nnon-zero values of the model parameters within the data.

It is able to generalize from small-scale synthetic\nPB examples to large, real-world PB instances. It is able to learn existing\naggregation rules but also generate new rules that adapt to diverse objectives,\nproviding a more nuanced, compromise-driven solution for PB processes. The\neffectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments\nwith synthetic and real-world PB data, and can expand the use and deployment of\nPB solutions.",

We prove that a linear bound with respect\nto the online convex optimization algorithm's dynamic regret is optimal, i.e.,\ncannot be improved upon. Furthermore, for a standard class of online convex\noptimization algorithms, our proposed framework attains a bound on its dynamic\nregret that is linear only in the variation of the cost functions, which is\nknown to be an optimal bound.

It is shown that the corresponding mathematical\nexpressions of conditional ionization cluster size distributions are alike\nthose for the single event frequency distribution of energy imparted,\nparticularly when all tracks are considered which intersect the volume in which\ninteractions of the primary particle can result in energy deposits in the site.\nTrack structure simulations of proton with energies between 1 MeV and 100 MeV\nare used to study how the occurrence of events depends on site size, beam\nradius, and proton energy. The range of impact parameters of particle tracks\nthat contribute to energy imparted in a site appears not to depend on whether\nany energy deposits or only energy deposits by ionizations are considered.\nSince there is no longer a one-to-one correspondence between tracks passing a\nsite and the occurrence of an event, it is proposed to use the fluence for\nwhich on average one event occurs as a substitute for single events. For\nprotons, the product of this fluence and the site cross section or the average\nnumber of tracks necessary for an event shows an interesting dependence on site\nsize and particle energy with asymptotic values close to unity for large sites\nand proton energies below 10 MeV.

SCA has been\nextensively developed and adopted by academia and industry. However, we notice\nthat the modern SCA techniques in industry scenarios still need to be improved\ndue to privacy concerns. Overall, SCA requires the users to upload their\napplications' source code to a remote SCA server, which then inspects the\napplications and reports the component usage to users. This process is\nprivacy-sensitive since the applications may contain sensitive information,\nsuch as proprietary source code, algorithms, trade secrets, and user data.\n  Privacy concerns have prevented the SCA technology from being used in\nreal-world scenarios. Therefore, academia and the industry demand\nprivacy-preserving SCA solutions. For the first time, we analyze the privacy\nrequirements of SCA and provide a landscape depicting possible technical\nsolutions with varying privacy gains and overheads. In particular, given that\nde facto SCA frameworks are primarily driven by code similarity-based\ntechniques, we explore combining several privacy-preserving protocols to\nencapsulate the similarity-based SCA framework. Among all viable solutions, we\nfind that multi-party computation (MPC) offers the strongest privacy guarantee\nand plausible accuracy; it, however, incurs high overhead (184 times). We\noptimize the MPC-based SCA framework by reducing the amount of crypto protocol\ntransactions using program analysis techniques.

    "abstract": "We propose a model of unawareness that remains close to the paradigm of\nAumann's model for knowledge [R. J. Aumann, International Journal of Game\nTheory 28 (1999) 263-300]: just as Aumann uses a correspondence on a state\nspace to define an agent's knowledge operator on events, we use a\ncorrespondence on a state space to define an agent's awareness operator on\nevents. This is made possible by three ideas. First, like the model of [A.\nHeifetz, M. Meier, and B. Schipper, Journal of Economic Theory 130 (2006)\n78-94], ours is based on a space of partial specifications of the world,\npartially ordered by a relation of further specification or refinement, and the\nidea that agents may be aware of some coarser-grained specifications while\nunaware of some finer-grained specifications; however, our model is based on a\ndifferent implementation of this idea, related to forcing in set theory.\nSecond, we depart from a tradition in the literature, initiated by [S. Modica\nand A. Rustichini, Theory and Decision 37 (1994) 107-124] and adopted by\nHeifetz et al. and [J. Li, Journal of Economic Theory 144 (2009) 977-993], of\ntaking awareness to be definable in terms of knowledge. Third, we show that the\nnegative conclusion of a well-known impossibility theorem concerning\nunawareness in [Dekel, Lipman, and Rustichini, Econometrica 66 (1998) 159-173]\ncan be escaped by a slight weakening of a key axiom. Together these points\ndemonstrate that a correspondence on a partial-state space is sufficient to\nmodel unawareness of events. Indeed, we prove a representation theorem showing\nthat any abstract Boolean algebra equipped with awareness, knowledge, and\nbelief operators satisfying some plausible axioms is representable as the\nalgebra of events arising from a partial-state space with awareness, knowledge,\nand belief correspondences.",

    "abstract": "The non-perturbative processes - the internal transverse motion of partons\ninside hadrons, which gives rise to their intrinsic transverse momentum\n(intrinsic-kT) - and multiple soft gluon emissions that need to be resummed,\nare dominant contributions to the low transverse momentum of the Drell-Yan (DY)\npair cross section. Therefore, this part of the DY spectra serves as a powerful\ntool for a better understanding of such processes, which is the focus of the\nstudy presented here. The study is conducted using the Parton Branching Method,\nwhich describes Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) Parton Densitity Functions\n(PDF) and provides a very precise description of DY pair transverse momentum\ndistributions across a wide range of collision energies and pair invariant\nmasses. In contrast to the energy dependence of intrinsic kT observed in\nshower-based Monte Carlo event generators, the CASCADE3 event generator - based\non the Parton Branching Method - has provided an intrinsic-kT distribution that\nis independent of the center of mass energy. Further studies conducted within\nthe Parton Branching Method have sought to understand the origin of this energy\ndependence, indicating that the dependence is mainly a consequence of the\ninterplay between two main processes: internal transverse motion and soft gluon\nemission. The latter has been reduced in shower-based event generators,\nprimarily due to the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor, which is often\nneglected. Since the Sudakov form factor depends on the evolution scale, this\npaper explores this dependence through the interplay of the two processes and\nattempts to explain it. Additionally, since QED final state radiation affects\nthe profile of the DY pair transverse momentum distribution, we investigate its\nimpact in both the high and low DY pair invariant mass regions.",

It deduces relations between aggregate\nproperties of an economy, concerning quantities and flows of goods and money,\nprices and the value of money, without any recourse to microeconomic\nfoundations about the preferences and actions of individual economic agents.\nThe approach has three important payoffs. 1) it provides a new and solid\nfoundation for aspects of standard macroeconomic theory such as the existence\nof market prices, the value of money, the meaning of inflation, the symmetry\nand negative-definiteness of the macro-Slutsky matrix, and the Le\nChatelier-Samuelson principle, without relying on implausibly strong\nrationality assumptions over individual microeconomic agents. 2) the approach\ngenerates new results, including implications for money flow and trade when two\nor more economies are put in contact, in terms of new concepts such as economic\nentropy, economic temperature, goods' values and money capacity. Some of these\nare related to standard economic concepts (eg marginal utility of money, market\nprices). Yet our approach derives them at a purely macroeconomic level and\ngives them a meaning independent of usual restrictions. Others of the concepts,\nsuch as economic entropy and temperature, have no direct counterparts in\nstandard economics, but they have important economic interpretations and\nimplications, as aggregate utility and the inverse marginal aggregate utility\nof money, respectively. 3) this analysis promises to open up new frontiers in\nmacroeconomics by building a bridge to ideas from non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics.

We develop methods for feature\nselection in joint models where feature selection is viewed as a bi-level\nvariable selection problem with multiple features nested within multiple\nlongitudinal risk factors. We modify a previously proposed Bayesian sparse\ngroup selection (BSGS) prior, which has not been implemented in joint models\nuntil now, to better represent prior beliefs when selecting features both at\nthe group level (longitudinal risk factor) and within group (features of a\nlongitudinal risk factor). One of the advantages of our method over the BSGS\nmethod is the ability to account for correlation among the features within a\nrisk factor. As a result, it selects important features similarly, but excludes\nthe unimportant features within risk factors more efficiently than BSGS. We\nevaluate our prior via simulations and apply our method to data from the\nAtherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a population-based,\nprospective cohort study consisting of over 15,000 men and women aged 45-64,\nmeasured at baseline and at six additional times.

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in\nvision understanding, reasoning, and interaction. However, the inference\ncomputation and memory increase progressively with the generation of output\ntokens during decoding, directly affecting the efficacy of MLLMs. Existing\nmethods attempt to reduce the vision context redundancy to achieve efficient\nMLLMs. Unfortunately, the efficiency benefits of the vision context reduction\nin the prefill stage gradually diminish during the decoding stage. To address\nthis problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification\nframework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision\ncontext in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead\nof the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a\ntailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e.,\nprefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of\nMLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by\n$\\sim$75\\% in the prefill stage. Meanwhile, throughout the entire generation\nprocess of MLLMs, Dynamic-LLaVA reduces the $\\sim$50\\% computation consumption\nunder decoding without KV cache, while saving $\\sim$50\\% GPU memory overhead\nwhen decoding with KV cache, due to the vision-language context sparsification.\nExtensive experiments also demonstrate that Dynamic-LLaVA achieves efficient\ninference for MLLMs with negligible understanding and generation ability\ndegradation or even performance gains compared to the full-context inference\nbaselines.

    "abstract": "The decreasing costs of photovoltaic (PV) systems and battery storage,\nalongside the rapid rise of electric vehicles (EVs), present a unique\nopportunity to revolutionize energy use in apartment complexes. Generating\nelectricity via PV and batteries is currently cheaper and greener than relying\non grid power, which is often expensive. Yet, residents in multi-building\napartment complexes typically lack access to fast EV charging infrastructure.\nTo this end, this paper investigates the feasibility and energy management of\ndeploying commercial PV-powered battery storage and EV fast chargers within\napartment complexes in Orlando, Florida, operated by complex owners. By\nmodeling the complex as a grid-connected microgrid, it aims to meet residents'\nenergy needs, provide backup power during emergencies, and introduce a\nprofitable business model for property owners. To address PV power generation\nuncertainty, a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization method\nusing the Wasserstein metric is employed, ensuring robust and reliable\noperation. The techno-economic analysis reveals that EVs powered by PV and\nbatteries are more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than gasoline\nvehicles that EV owners can save up to 100 dollars per month by saving on fuel\ncosts. The results also show that integrating PV and battery systems reduces\noperational costs, lowers emissions, increases resilience, and supports EV\nadoption while offering a profitable business model for property owners. These\nfindings highlight a practical and sustainable framework for advancing clean\nenergy use in residential complexes.",

The analysis\nfocuses on the financial advantages of integrating rooftop photovoltaic (PV)\nsystems, battery storage, and EVs collectively compared to reliance on grid\nelectricity for both existing and newly built homes in Orlando, Florida. By\nleveraging federal incentives like the Investment Tax Credit and considering\nenergy efficiency improvements, residents can achieve significant savings.\nSimulation results show that existing homes with a 9.5 kW PV system and 42.2\nkWh battery are projected to generate positive returns by 2029, while newly\nconstructed homes meet this threshold as early as 2024. Also, rooftop solar\nused to charge an EV can save up to 100 dollars per month for residents\ncompared to gasoline. Combining PV and battery storage not only lowers electric\nbills but also enhances grid independence and resilience against grid outages.\nBeyond individual savings, NZEBs contribute to grid stability by reducing\nelectricity demand and supporting utility-scale renewable applications.

Two pricing mechanisms distribution\nlocational marginal price (DLMP) and average price mechanism are used to\ncomplement each other in facilitating efficient energy exchange. DLMP serves as\na price signal that reflects network conditions and acts as an upper bound for\nbidding in the P2P market. Meanwhile, prosumers and consumers submit bids in\nthe market and agree on energy transactions based on average transaction\nprices, ensuring fast matching and fair settlements. Simulation results\nindicate that during emergency operation modes, DLMP prices increase, leading\nto higher average transaction prices.

Recent studies suggest that the hierarchical distribution of\nSF in nearby galaxies shows a dependence on host galaxy properties. In this\ncontext, we study the nature of hierarchical SF from a few tens of pc up to\nseveral kpc in 4 nearby spiral galaxies NGC1566, NGC5194, NGC5457 & NGC7793, by\nleveraging the large FoV & high resolution FUV+NUV observations from the\nUltraViolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT). Using the two-point correlation function,\nwe infer that the young star-forming clumps (SFCs) in the galaxies are arranged\nin a fractal-like hierarchical distribution, but only up to a maximum scale\n($l_{corr}$) & it ranges from 0.5 kpc to 3.1 kpc. The flocculent spiral NGC7793\nhas $\\sim$5 times smaller $l_{corr}$ than the 3 grand design spirals, possibly\ndue to its lower mass, low pressure environment & lack of strong spiral arms.\n$l_{corr}$ being much smaller than the galaxy size suggests that the SF\nhierarchy does not extend to the full galaxy size & it is likely an effect set\nby multiple physical mechanisms in the galaxy. The hierarchical distribution of\nSFCs dissipates within 10 to 50 Myr, signifying their migration away from their\nbirthplaces over time. Our results suggest that the global hierarchical\nproperties of SF in galaxies are not universal & significant variations exist\nin the local & global hierarchy parameters of a galaxy. This study also\ndemonstrates the capabilities of UVIT in characterizing the SF hierarchy in\nnearby galaxies. In the future, a bigger sample can be employed to further\nunderstand the role of large-scale galaxy properties (morphology, environment)\n& physical processes (feedback, turbulence, shear & ISM conditions) on\ndetermining the non-universal hierarchical properties of SF in galaxies.",

However, in complex road environments, the low latency and high\nprecision requirements could not always be fulfilled due to the high complexity\nof localization computation. To tackle this issue, we propose a road-aware\nlocalization mechanism in heterogeneous networks (HetNet) of the mobile\ncommunication system, which enables real-time acquisition of vehicular position\ninformation, including the vehicular current road, segment within the road, and\ncoordinates. By employing this multi-scale localization approach, the\ncomputational complexity can be greatly reduced while ensuring accurate\npositioning. Specifically, to reduce positioning search complexity and ensure\npositioning precision, roads are partitioned into low-dimensional segments with\nunequal lengths by the proposed singular point (SP) segmentation method. To\nreduce feature-matching complexity, distinctive salient features (SFs) are\nextracted sparsely representing roads and segments, which can eliminate\nredundant features while maximizing the feature information gain. The\nCram\\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of vehicle positioning errors is derived to\nverify the positioning accuracy improvement brought from the segment partition\nand SF extraction. Additionally, through SF matching by integrating the\ninclusion and adjacency position relationships, a multi-scale vehicle\nlocalization (MSVL) algorithm is proposed to identify vehicular road signal\npatterns and determine the real-time segment and coordinates.

Our proposed face detection model achieves an impressive mAP score of\nover 84 in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Furthermore, the\nregression framework demonstrates remarkable performance with a mean square\nerror of 0.18$^{\\circ}$C and an impressive $R^2$ score of 0.96. Our\nexperiments' results highlight the developed system's effectiveness,\npositioning it as a promising solution for continuous temperature monitoring in\nreal-world applications.

    "abstract": "Task-oriented communication presents a promising approach to improve the\ncommunication efficiency of edge inference systems by optimizing learning-based\nmodules to extract and transmit relevant task information. However, real-time\napplications face practical challenges, such as incomplete coverage and\npotential malfunctions of edge servers. This situation necessitates cross-model\ncommunication between different inference systems, enabling edge devices from\none service provider to collaborate effectively with edge servers from another.\nIndependent optimization of diverse edge systems often leads to incoherent\nfeature spaces, which hinders the cross-model inference for existing\ntask-oriented communication. To facilitate and achieve effective cross-model\ntask-oriented communication, this study introduces a novel framework that\nutilizes shared anchor data across diverse systems. This approach addresses the\nchallenge of feature alignment in both server-based and on-device scenarios. In\nparticular, by leveraging the linear invariance of visual features, we propose\nefficient server-based feature alignment techniques to estimate linear\ntransformations using encoded anchor data features. For on-device alignment, we\nexploit the angle-preserving nature of visual features and propose to encode\nrelative representations with anchor data to streamline cross-model\ncommunication without additional alignment procedures during the inference. The\nexperimental results on computer vision benchmarks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed feature alignment approaches in cross-model\ntask-oriented communications. The runtime and computation overhead analysis\nfurther confirm the effectiveness of the proposed feature alignment approaches\nin real-time applications.",

A recent family for these\nimprovements uses diffusion models, which have become essential for achieving\nhigh-quality video inpainting results, yet they still face performance\nbottlenecks in temporal consistency and computational efficiency. This\nmotivates us to propose a new video inpainting framework using optical\nFlow-guided Efficient Diffusion (FloED) for higher video coherence.\nSpecifically, FloED employs a dual-branch architecture, where the time-agnostic\nflow branch restores corrupted flow first, and the multi-scale flow adapters\nprovide motion guidance to the main inpainting branch. Besides, a training-free\nlatent interpolation method is proposed to accelerate the multi-step denoising\nprocess using flow warping. With the flow attention cache mechanism, FLoED\nefficiently reduces the computational cost of incorporating optical flow.\nExtensive experiments on background restoration and object removal tasks show\nthat FloED outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods in both quality\nand efficiency.

We present a new way to find\nsymbiotics that is less biased against directly-detectable accretion discs than\nmethods based on narrow-band H$\\alpha$ photometry or objective prism plate\nsurveys. We identified outliers in SkyMapper survey photometry, using\nreconstructed uvg snapshot colours and rapid variability among the three\nexposures of each 20-minute SkyMapper Main Survey filter sequence, from a\nsample of 366,721 luminous red objects. We found that SkyMapper catalog colours\nof large-amplitude pulsating giants must be corrected for variability, and that\nflickering is detectable with only three data points. Our methods probed a\ndifferent region of parameter space than a recent search for accreting-only\nsymbiotics in the GALAH survey, while being surprisingly concordant with\nanother survey's infrared detection algorithm. We discovered 12 new symbiotics,\nincluding four with optical accretion disc flickering. Two of the optical\nflickerers exhibited boundary-layer hard X-rays. We also identified 10\nsymbiotic candidates, and discovered likely optical flickering in the known\nsymbiotic V1044 Cen (CD-36 8436).

    "abstract": "We investigate holographic complexities in the context of wedge holography,\nfocusing specifically on black string geometry in AdS$_3$. The wedge spacetime\nis bounded by two end-of-the-world (EOW) branes with intrinsic\nDvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (DGP) gravity. In line with this codimension-two\nholography, there are three equivalent perspectives: bulk perspective, brane\nperspective, and boundary perspective. Using both the ''Complexity=Volume''\n(CV) and ''Complexity=Action'' (CA) proposals, we analyze the complexity in\nwedge black string geometry in the tensionless limit. By treating the branes as\nrigid, we find the late-time growth rates of CV and CA match exactly across\nbulk and brane perspectives. These results are consistent with those from JT\ngravity, with additional contributions from the intrinsic gravity of the\nbranes. For fluctuating branes, we find that the late-time growth rates of CV\nand CA match between bulk and brane perspectives at the linear order of\nfluctuation. The CV results exhibit $\\frac{\\phi_h^2}{\\phi_0}$ corrections from\nfluctuations, consistent with the findings in previous work. Moreover, the CA\nresults reveal an additional constant term in the fluctuating branes case. We\nprovide an interpretation of this in terms of gravitational edge mode effects.\nThe distinct corrections arising from fluctuations in the CA and CV proposals\nsuggest that the CV proposal is more sensitive to geometric details.\nFurthermore, we discuss these results in relation to Lloyd's bound on\ncomplexity, their general time dependence, and the effects of fluctuations.",

Using the COSMOS2020 catalog that has half a\nmillion galaxies with high accuracy ($\\sigma_{\\Delta z /1+z} \\sim 0.01$)\nphotometric redshifts, we study the relationship between star formation\nactivities in galaxy clusters and their surrounding environment to test the\nweb-feeding model.

We\nalso investigated the time evolution of the web-feeding trend using the\nIllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. Even though no clear correlation between\nthe quiescent galaxy fraction of galaxy clusters and the significance of LSSs\naround them is found in the simulation, we verify that the quiescent galaxy\nfractions of infallers such as groups ($M_{200} \\geq 10^{12}$ \\SI{}{M_{\\odot}})\nand galaxies ($M_{200} < 10^{12}$ \\SI{}{M_{\\odot}}) is smaller than the\nquiescent fraction of cluster members and that infallers can lower the\nquiescent fraction of clusters.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Surface-Aligned Gaussian representation for creating\nanimatable human avatars from monocular videos,aiming at improving the novel\nview and pose synthesis performance while ensuring fast training and real-time\nrendering. Recently,3DGS has emerged as a more efficient and expressive\nalternative to NeRF, and has been used for creating dynamic human avatars.\nHowever,when applied to the severely ill-posed task of monocular dynamic\nreconstruction, the Gaussians tend to overfit the constantly changing regions\nsuch as clothes wrinkles or shadows since these regions cannot provide\nconsistent supervision, resulting in noisy geometry and abrupt deformation that\ntypically fail to generalize under novel views and poses.To address these\nlimitations, we present SAGA,i.e.,Surface-Aligned Gaussian Avatar,which aligns\nthe Gaussians with a mesh to enforce well-defined geometry and consistent\ndeformation, thereby improving generalization under novel views and poses.\nUnlike existing strict alignment methods that suffer from limited expressive\npower and low realism,SAGA employs a two-stage alignment strategy where the\nGaussians are first adhered on while then detached from the mesh, thus\nfacilitating both good geometry and high expressivity. In the Adhered Stage, we\nimprove the flexibility of Adhered-on-Mesh Gaussians by allowing them to flow\non the mesh, in contrast to existing methods that rigidly bind Gaussians to\nfixed location. In the second Detached Stage, we introduce a Gaussian-Mesh\nAlignment regularization, which allows us to unleash the expressivity by\ndetaching the Gaussians but maintain the geometric alignment by minimizing\ntheir location and orientation offsets from the bound triangles. Finally, since\nthe Gaussians may drift outside the bound triangles during optimization, an\nefficient Walking-on-Mesh strategy is proposed to dynamically update the bound\ntriangles.",

Reliable dynamics simulation relies\non high-quality vascular meshes. Most of the existing mesh generation methods\nhighly depend on manual annotation, which is time-consuming and laborious,\nusually facing challenges such as branch merging and vessel disconnection. This\nwill hinder vessel dynamics simulation, especially for the population study. To\naddress this issue, we propose a deep learning-based method, dubbed as DVasMesh\nto directly generate structured hexahedral vascular meshes from vascular\nimages. Our contributions are threefold. First, we propose to formally\nformulate each vertex of the vascular graph by a four-element vector, including\ncoordinates of the centerline point and the radius. Second, a vectorized graph\ntemplate is employed to guide DVasMesh to estimate the vascular graph.\nSpecifically, we introduce a sampling operator, which samples the extracted\nfeatures of the vascular image (by a segmentation network) according to the\nvertices in the template graph. Third, we employ a graph convolution network\n(GCN) and take the sampled features as nodes to estimate the deformation\nbetween vertices of the template graph and target graph, and the deformed graph\ntemplate is used to build the mesh. Taking advantage of end-to-end learning and\ndiscarding direct dependency on annotated labels, our DVasMesh demonstrates\noutstanding performance in generating structured vascular meshes on cardiac and\ncerebral vascular images. It shows great potential for clinical applications by\nreducing mesh generation time from 2 hours (manual) to 30 seconds (automatic).",

While Transformer-based methods\nhave shown promising results in modeling inter-modal relationships, their\nquadratic computational complexity limits their applicability to long-sequence\nor large-scale data. Although recent Mamba-based approaches achieve linear\ncomplexity, their sequential scanning mechanism poses fundamental challenges in\ncomprehensively modeling cross-modal relationships. To address this limitation,\nwe propose AlignMamba, an efficient and effective method for multimodal fusion.\nSpecifically, grounded in Optimal Transport, we introduce a local cross-modal\nalignment module that explicitly learns token-level correspondences between\ndifferent modalities. Moreover, we propose a global cross-modal alignment loss\nbased on Maximum Mean Discrepancy to implicitly enforce the consistency between\ndifferent modal distributions. Finally, the unimodal representations after\nlocal and global alignment are passed to the Mamba backbone for further\ncross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments on\ncomplete and incomplete multimodal fusion tasks demonstrate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of the proposed method.",

To mitigate the huge\ndomain gaps, we develop a three-stage optimization paradigm to gradually equip\na pre-trained LLM with the capability of understanding event-based scenes. Our\nEventGPT comprises an event encoder, followed by a spatio-temporal aggregator,\na linear projector, an event-language adapter, and an LLM. Firstly, RGB\nimage-text pairs generated by GPT are leveraged to warm up the linear\nprojector, referring to LLaVA, as the gap between natural image and language\nmodalities is relatively smaller. Secondly, we construct a synthetic yet large\ndataset, N-ImageNet-Chat, consisting of event frames and corresponding texts to\nenable the use of the spatio-temporal aggregator and to train the\nevent-language adapter, thereby aligning event features more closely with the\nlanguage space.

While these approaches have made great\nprogress in software defect detection, they still have several limitations in\npractical application, including the low confidence of prediction models and\nthe inefficiency of unit testing models. To address these limitations, we\npropose a WYSIWYG (i.e., What You See Is What You Get) approach:\nAttention-based Self-guided Automatic Unit Test GenERation (AUGER), which\ncontains two stages: defect detection and error triggering. In the former\nstage, AUGER first detects the proneness of defects.

To evaluate the\neffectiveness of AUGER, we conduct a large-scale experiment by comparing with\nthe state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on the widely used datasets (i.e.,\nBears, Bugs.jar, and Defects4J).

In addition, the access to relative states in real\ntime is not achievable due to the onboard hardware constraints of the two\nCubeSats.

While the regular Morse\nfunction captures the nuclear and Coulomb interactions at short and medium\nranges, an inverse Morse function is chosen to obtain the Coulomb barrier that\narises because of the long-range Coulomb interaction. This reference potential\nis representative of a large family of curves consisting of eight distinct\nmodel parameters and two intermediate points that define the boundaries that\nexist between the three regions.

    "abstract": "Animal re-identification (ReID) has become an indispensable tool in\necological research, playing a critical role in tracking population dynamics,\nanalyzing behavioral patterns, and assessing ecological impacts, all of which\nare vital for informed conservation strategies. Unlike human ReID, animal ReID\nfaces significant challenges due to the high variability in animal poses,\ndiverse environmental conditions, and the inability to directly apply\npre-trained models to animal data, making the identification process across\nspecies more complex. This work introduces an innovative keypoint propagation\nmechanism, which utilizes a single annotated image and a pre-trained diffusion\nmodel to propagate keypoints across an entire dataset, significantly reducing\nthe cost of manual annotation. Additionally, we enhance the Vision Transformer\n(ViT) by implementing Keypoint Positional Encoding (KPE) and Categorical\nKeypoint Positional Embedding (CKPE), enabling the ViT to learn more robust and\nsemantically-aware representations. This provides more comprehensive and\ndetailed keypoint representations, leading to more accurate and efficient\nre-identification. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that this\napproach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across\nfour wildlife datasets.

    "abstract": "Underwater optical images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors\nsuch as blurring, low contrast, and color distortion, which hinder the accuracy\nof object detection tasks. Due to the lack of paired underwater/clean images,\nmost research methods adopt a strategy of first enhancing and then detecting,\nresulting in a lack of feature communication between the two learning tasks. On\nthe other hand, due to the contradiction between the diverse degradation\nfactors of underwater images and the limited number of samples, existing\nunderwater enhancement methods are difficult to effectively enhance degraded\nimages of unknown water bodies, thereby limiting the improvement of object\ndetection accuracy. Therefore, most underwater target detection results are\nstill displayed on degraded images, making it difficult to visually judge the\ncorrectness of the detection results. To address the above issues, this paper\nproposes a multi-task learning method that simultaneously enhances underwater\nimages and improves detection accuracy. Compared with single-task learning, the\nintegrated model allows for the dynamic adjustment of information communication\nand sharing between different tasks. Due to the fact that real underwater\nimages can only provide annotated object labels, this paper introduces physical\nconstraints to ensure that object detection tasks do not interfere with image\nenhancement tasks. Therefore, this article introduces a physical module to\ndecompose underwater images into clean images, background light, and\ntransmission images and uses a physical model to calculate underwater images\nfor self-supervision. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model\nachieves satisfactory results in visual performance, object detection accuracy,\nand detection efficiency compared to state-of-the-art comparative methods.",

We also tailor a two-phase model training strategy to make the\nguiding more effective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Oracle4Rec is\nsuperior to state-of-the-art sequential methods.

A major challenge of this task\nis its heavy dependence on labor-intensive annotations for training. Unlike\nexisting works that directly train models on manually curated data, we propose\na novel paradigm to reduce annotation costs: pretraining the model on\nunlabeled, real-world videos. To support this, we introduce Video Moment\nRetrieval Pretraining (Vid-Morp), a large-scale dataset collected with minimal\nhuman intervention, consisting of over 50K videos captured in the wild and 200K\npseudo annotations. Direct pretraining on these imperfect pseudo annotations,\nhowever, presents significant challenges, including mismatched sentence-video\npairs and imprecise temporal boundaries. To address these issues, we propose\nthe ReCorrect algorithm, which comprises two main phases: semantics-guided\nrefinement and memory-consensus correction. The semantics-guided refinement\nenhances the pseudo labels by leveraging semantic similarity with video frames\nto clean out unpaired data and make initial adjustments to temporal boundaries.\nIn the following memory-consensus correction phase, a memory bank tracks the\nmodel predictions, progressively correcting the temporal boundaries based on\nconsensus within the memory. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate ReCorrect's\nstrong generalization abilities across multiple downstream settings.

We study a novel effect of neutrino diffusion sustained\nvia frequent scatterings off DM particles in these regions. We show that for\ntransients occurring within DM spikes or cores, the DM-neutrino scattering can\ndelay the arrival of neutrinos with respect to photons, but this also comes\nwith a suppression of the neutrino flux and energy loss. We apply these effects\nto the specific example of TDEs, and demonstrate that currently unconstrained\nparameter space of DM-neutrino interactions can account for the sizable\n$O$(days) delay of the tentative high-energy neutrinos observed from some TDEs.",

In the first level, HT-HEDL\nuses a single GPU or a vectorized multi-threaded CPU to evaluate a single\nhypothesis. In vectorized multi-threaded CPU evaluation, classical (scalar) CPU\nmulti-threading is combined with CPU's extended vector instructions set to\nextract more CPU-based performance. The experimental results revealed that\nHT-HEDL increased performance using CPU-based evaluation (on a single\nhypothesis): from 20.4 folds using classical multi-threading to $\\sim85$ folds\nusing vectorized multi-threading. In the GPU-based evaluation, HT-HEDL achieved\nspeedups of up to $\\sim38$ folds for single hypothesis evaluation using a\nsingle GPU. To accelerate the evaluation of multiple hypotheses, HT-HEDL\ncombines, in parallel, GPUs with multi-core CPUs to increase evaluation\nthroughput (number of evaluated hypotheses per second).

With the\nrecent advent of exquisite datasets such as XQR-30, many models have struggled\nto reproduce the observed large-scale fluctuations in the Lya opacity. Here we\nintroduce a Bayesian analysis framework that forward-models large-scale\nlightcones of IGM properties, and accounts for unresolved sub-structure in the\nLya opacity by calibrating to higher-resolution hydrodynamic simulations. Our\nmodels directly connect physically-intuitive galaxy properties with the\ncorresponding IGM evolution, without having to tune \"effective\" parameters or\ncalibrate out the mean transmission. The forest data, in combination with UV\nluminosity functions and the CMB optical depth, are able to constrain global\nIGM properties at percent level precision in our fiducial model. Unlike many\nother works, we recover the forest observations without evoking a rapid drop in\nthe ionizing emissivity from z~7 to 5.5, which we attribute to our sub-grid\nmodel for recombinations. In this fiducial model, reionization ends at\n$z=5.44\\pm0.02$ and the EoR mid-point is at $z=7.7\\pm0.1$. The ionizing escape\nfraction increases towards faint galaxies, showing a mild redshift evolution at\nfixed UV magnitude, Muv. Half of the ionizing photons are provided by galaxies\nfainter than Muv~-12, well below direct detection limits of optical/NIR\ninstruments including JWST. We also show results from an alternative galaxy\nmodel that does not allow for a redshift evolution in the ionizing escape\nfraction. Despite being decisively disfavored by the Bayesian evidence, the\nposterior of this model is in qualitative agreement with that from our fiducial\nmodel. We caution however that our conclusions regarding the early stages of\nthe EoR and which sources reionized the Universe are more model-dependent.",

Only recently\nsurface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have emerged as a promising low-loss\nalternative to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Despite this advantage, the\nSPhP-based approach has been underexplored due to the challenges associated\nwith ensuring high crystal quality in the heterostructure when using alloys\nwith different phonon frequencies. In this work, we design a phononic-driven\nNIM using a ZnO/(Zn,Mg)O heterostructure, demonstrating control over its\nhyperbolic behavior through the precise selection of the Mg content and the\nrelative layer thicknesses. Our study shows that increasing the Mg content in\nthe ternary layers enhances the type I behavior, and that the optimal layer\nthickness varies depending on the Mg content. After analyzing the conditions\nfor achieving type I hyperbolic dispersion, we experimentally demonstrate this\nconcept with a sample featuring equal layer thicknesses and a 32% Mg\nconcentration. We characterize the structure by means of polarized reflectance\nspectroscopy and use attenuated total reflectance spectroscopy to report the\npresence of a SPhP mode located within the type I hyperbolic region.

    "abstract": "Continuum damage mechanics (CDM) is a popular framework for modelling crack\npropagation in solids. The CDM uses a damage parameter to quantitatively assess\nwhat one loosely calls `material degradation'. While this parameter is\nsometimes given a physical meaning, the mathematical equations for its\nevolution are generally not consistent with such physical interpretations.\nCuriously, degradation in the CDM may be viewed as a change of measures,\nwherein the damage variable appears as the Radon-Nikodym derivative. We adopt\nthis point of view and use a probabilistic measure-valued description for the\nrandom microcracks underlying quasi-brittle damage. We show that the evolution\nof the underlying density may be described via killed diffusion as in the\nFeynman-Kac theory. Damage growth is then interpreted as the reduction in this\nmeasure over a region, which in turn quantifies the disruption of bonds through\na loss of force-transmitting mechanisms between nearby material points.\nRemarkably, the evolution of damage admits an approximate closed-form solution.\nThis brings forth substantive computational ease, facilitating fast yet\naccurate simulations of large dimensional problems. By selecting an appropriate\nkilling rate, one accounts for the irreversibility of damage and thus\neliminates the need for ad-hoc history-dependent routes typically employed,\nsay, in phase field modelling of damage. Our proposal FeynKrack (a short form\nfor Feynman-Kac crack propagator) is validated and demonstrated for its\nefficacy through several simulations on quasi-brittle damage.

Because graph data does not follow the\nindependently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption, adversarial\nmanipulations or incorrect data can propagate to other data points through\nmessage passing, which deteriorates the model's performance. To allow model\ndevelopers to remove the adverse effects of manipulated entities from a trained\nGNN, we study the recently formulated problem of Corrective Unlearning. We find\nthat current graph unlearning methods fail to unlearn the effect of\nmanipulations even when the whole manipulated set is known. We introduce a new\ngraph unlearning method, Cognac, which can unlearn the effect of the\nmanipulation set even when only 5% of it is identified. It recovers most of the\nperformance of a strong oracle with fully corrected training data, even beating\nretraining from scratch without the deletion set while being 8x more efficient.\nWe hope our work assists GNN developers in mitigating harmful effects caused by\nissues in real-world data, post-training.

    "abstract": "Adenoid hypertrophy stands as a common cause of obstructive sleep\napnea-hypopnea syndrome in children. It is characterized by snoring, nasal\ncongestion, and growth disorders. Computed Tomography (CT) emerges as a pivotal\nmedical imaging modality, utilizing X-rays and advanced computational\ntechniques to generate detailed cross-sectional images. Within the realm of\npediatric airway assessments, CT imaging provides an insightful perspective on\nthe shape and volume of enlarged adenoids. Despite the advances of deep\nlearning methods for medical imaging analysis, there remains an emptiness in\nthe segmentation of adenoid hypertrophy in CT scans. To address this research\ngap, we introduce TSUBF-Nett (Trans-Spatial UNet-like Network based on\nBi-direction Fusion), a 3D medical image segmentation framework. TSUBF-Net is\nengineered to effectively discern intricate 3D spatial interlayer features in\nCT scans and enhance the extraction of boundary-blurring features. Notably, we\npropose two innovative modules within the U-shaped network architecture:the\nTrans-Spatial Perception module (TSP) and the Bi-directional Sampling\nCollaborated Fusion module (BSCF).These two modules are in charge of operating\nduring the sampling process and strategically fusing down-sampled and\nup-sampled features, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce the Sobel loss\nterm, which optimizes the smoothness of the segmentation results and enhances\nmodel accuracy. Extensive 3D segmentation experiments are conducted on several\ndatasets. TSUBF-Net is superior to the state-of-the-art methods with the lowest\nHD95: 7.03, IoU:85.63, and DSC: 92.26 on our own AHSD dataset. The results in\nthe other two public datasets also demonstrate that our methods can robustly\nand effectively address the challenges of 3D segmentation in CT scans.",

    "abstract": "Visual place recognition (VPR) aims to determine the general geographical\nlocation of a query image by retrieving visually similar images from a large\ngeo-tagged database. To obtain a global representation for each place image,\nmost approaches typically focus on the aggregation of deep features extracted\nfrom a backbone through using current prominent architectures (e.g., CNNs,\nMLPs, pooling layer, and transformer encoder), giving little attention to the\ntransformer decoder. However, we argue that its strong capability to capture\ncontextual dependencies and generate accurate features holds considerable\npotential for the VPR task. To this end, we propose an Efficient Decoder\nTransformer (EDTformer) for feature aggregation, which consists of several\nstacked simplified decoder blocks followed by two linear layers to directly\nproduce robust and discriminative global representations. Specifically, we do\nthis by formulating deep features as the keys and values, as well as a set of\nlearnable parameters as the queries. Our EDTformer can fully utilize the\ncontextual information within deep features, then gradually decode and\naggregate the effective features into the learnable queries to output the\nglobal representations. Moreover, to provide more powerful deep features for\nEDTformer and further facilitate the robustness, we use the foundation model\nDINOv2 as the backbone and propose a Low-rank Parallel Adaptation (LoPA) method\nto enhance its performance in VPR, which can refine the intermediate features\nof the backbone progressively in a memory- and parameter-efficient way. As a\nresult, our method not only outperforms single-stage VPR methods on multiple\nbenchmark datasets, but also outperforms two-stage VPR methods which add a\nre-ranking with considerable cost.

In this study, training was carried out on SVMs\nembedded with various quantum kernels on a small number of agricultural product\nimage data sets collected in the company. The quantum kernels prepared in this\nstudy consisted of a smaller number of rotating gates and control gates. The F1\nscores for each quantum kernel showed a significant effect of using CNOT gates.\nAfter confirming the results with a quantum simulator, the usefulness of the\nquantum kernels was confirmed on a quantum computer. Learning with SVMs\nembedded with specific quantum kernels showed significantly higher values of\nthe AUC compared to classical kernels. The reason for the lack of learning in\nquantum kernels is considered to be due to kernel concentration or exponential\nconcentration similar to the Baren plateau.

Fortunately, the countries are trying to overcome the\nsituation by actively carrying out vaccinations. However, like any other\nmassive operation involving humans such as human resource management,\nelections, surveys, etc., the vaccination process raises several questions\nabout citizen privacy and misuse of personal data. In most of the countries,\nfew attempts have been made to verify the vaccination statistics as reported by\nthe health centers. These issues collectively require the solutions of\nanonymity of citizens' personal information, immutability of vaccination data\nand easy yet restricted access by adversarial bodies such as the government for\nthe verification and analysis of the data. This paper introduces a\nblockchain-based application to simulate and monitor the vaccination process.\nThe structure of data model used in the proposed system is based on the IEEE\nStandard for Data Format for Blockchain Systems 2418.2TM-2020. The proposed\nsystem enables authorized stakeholders to share and access relevant information\nfor vaccination process chain while preserving citizen privacy and\naccountability of the system.

    "abstract": "Video deblurring presents a considerable challenge owing to the complexity of\nblur, which frequently results from a combination of camera shakes, and object\nmotions. In the field of video deblurring, many previous works have primarily\nconcentrated on distortion-based metrics, such as PSNR. However, this approach\noften results in a weak correlation with human perception and yields\nreconstructions that lack realism. Diffusion models and video diffusion models\nhave respectively excelled in the fields of image and video generation,\nparticularly achieving remarkable results in terms of image authenticity and\nrealistic perception. However, due to the computational complexity and\nchallenges inherent in adapting diffusion models, there is still uncertainty\nregarding the potential of video diffusion models in video deblurring tasks. To\nexplore the viability of video diffusion models in the task of video\ndeblurring, we introduce a diffusion model specifically for this purpose. In\nthis field, leveraging highly correlated information between adjacent frames\nand addressing the challenge of temporal misalignment are crucial research\ndirections. To tackle these challenges, many improvements based on the video\ndiffusion model are introduced in this work. As a result, our model outperforms\nexisting models and achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of perceptual\nmetrics. Our model preserves a significant amount of detail in the images while\nmaintaining competitive distortion metrics. Furthermore, to the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first time the diffusion model has been applied in video\ndeblurring to overcome the limitations mentioned above.",

    "abstract": "Time series analysis is a fundamental data mining task that supervised\ntraining methods based on empirical risk minimization have proven their\neffectiveness on specific tasks and datasets. However, the acquisition of\nwell-annotated data is costly and a large amount of unlabeled series data is\nunder-utilized. Due to distributional shifts across various domains and\ndifferent patterns of interest across multiple tasks. The problem of\ncross-domain multi-task migration of time series remains a significant\nchallenge. To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel cross-domain\npretraining method based on Wave Quantization (termed as WQ4TS), which can be\ncombined with any advanced time series model and applied to multiple downstream\ntasks. Specifically, we transfer the time series data from different domains\ninto a common spectral latent space, and enable the model to learn the temporal\npattern knowledge of different domains directly from the common space and\nutilize it for the inference of downstream tasks, thereby mitigating the\nchallenge of heterogeneous cross-domains migration. The establishment of\nspectral latent space brings at least three benefits, cross-domain migration\ncapability thus adapting to zero- and few-shot scenarios without relying on\npriori knowledge of the dataset, general compatible cross-domain migration\nframework without changing the existing model structure, and robust modeling\ncapability thus achieving SOTA results in multiple downstream tasks. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we conduct extensive\nexperiments including three important tasks: forecasting, imputation, and\nclassification. And three common real-world data scenarios are simulated:\nfull-data, few-shot, and zero-shot. The proposed WQ4TS achieves the best\nperformance on 87.5% of all tasks, and the average improvement of the metrics\non all the tasks is up to 34.7%.",

Thus, in this paper, we\nfirst clarify the causes of the problem and introduce two sequence optimization\nstrategies: the rule-based static optimization and the score-based dynamic\noptimization. The rule-based approach relies on handcraft priority of\ndependency relation to reorder the context, while the score-based algorithm\ndynamically regulates the contextual sequence by calculating word position\nscores using neural network.

This paper introduces HyperForget, a novel machine unlearning\nframework that leverages hypernetworks - neural networks that generate\nparameters for other networks - to dynamically sample models that lack\nknowledge of targeted data while preserving essential capabilities. Leveraging\ndiffusion models, we implement two Diffusion HyperForget Networks and used them\nto sample unlearned models in Proof-of-Concept experiments. The unlearned\nmodels obtained zero accuracy on the forget set, while preserving good accuracy\non the retain sets, highlighting the potential of HyperForget for dynamic\ntargeted data removal and a promising direction for developing adaptive machine\nunlearning algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces the first framework for reconstructing surgical dialogue\nfrom unstructured real-world recordings, which is crucial for characterizing\nteaching tasks. In surgical training, the formative verbal feedback that\ntrainers provide to trainees during live surgeries is crucial for ensuring\nsafety, correcting behavior immediately, and facilitating long-term skill\nacquisition. However, analyzing and quantifying this feedback is challenging\ndue to its unstructured and specialized nature. Automated systems are essential\nto manage these complexities at scale, allowing for the creation of structured\ndatasets that enhance feedback analysis and improve surgical education. Our\nframework integrates voice activity detection, speaker diarization, and\nautomated speech recaognition, with a novel enhancement that 1) removes\nhallucinations (non-existent utterances generated during speech recognition\nfueled by noise in the operating room) and 2) separates speech from trainers\nand trainees using few-shot voice samples. These aspects are vital for\nreconstructing accurate surgical dialogues and understanding the roles of\noperating room participants. Using data from 33 real-world surgeries, we\ndemonstrated the system's capability to reconstruct surgical teaching dialogues\nand detect feedback instances effectively (F1 score of 0.79+/-0.07). Moreover,\nour hallucination removal step improves feedback detection performance by ~14%.\nEvaluation on downstream clinically relevant tasks of predicting Behavioral\nAdjustment of trainees and classifying Technical feedback, showed performances\ncomparable to manual annotations with F1 scores of 0.82+/0.03 and 0.81+/0.03\nrespectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our framework in\nsupporting clinically relevant tasks and improving over manual methods.",

Motivated by the\nrecently discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we derive a generic\neffective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet\nlocal moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Because of the strong spin-orbit\ncoupling, the effective model turns out to be an extended XYZ model on both\nintra- and inter-dimer bonds. We focus on the dimer phase and show that, in\naddition to the conventional \"singlet\" dimer phase in the Heisenberg limit,\npeculiar \"triplet\" dimer phases can be stabilized by the strong spin-orbit\ncoupling. While the \"singlet\" dimer phase, at certain conditions, could still\nexhibit exact solvability and nearly flat excitations analogous to that in the\nisotropic Heisenberg model, these \"triplet\" dimer phases are generally not\nexactly solvable and exhibit stronger dispersive excitations. We further\ndiscuss the thermodynamical and spectral signatures of these \"triplet\" dimer\nphases that can be experimentally probed, and illustrate that the recently\ndiscovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_{2}$Be$_{2}$GeO$_{7}$ hosts a triplet\ndimer ground state.",

Inner bulge RRabs kinematically align with the Galactic\nbar, while central bulge RRabs show slower rotation with lower velocity\ndispersion. Higher velocity dispersion stars were identified as halo/disk\ninterlopers. Then, orbital analysis of 28,188 APOGEE Red Clump and Red Giant\nBranch stars revealed kinematic properties consistent with RRabs, and the\nchemical abundance distribution displayed a bimodal stellar density pattern,\nsuggesting complex star evolution histories and slightly different star\nformation histories for the inner bulge and central bulge. The differences in\nthe density distribution on the $|\\mathrm{Z}|_{\\text{max}}$-eccentricity plane\nfor the central bulge, inner bulge, and interlopers are clearly detected. It is\nfound that the classification of bulge stars based on orbital parameters,\nrather than solely on metallicity, provides a more accurate population\nseparation. As the inner bulge, which contains the highest fraction of stars,\ntraces the bar formed by the instability of the Galactic disk, our results\nsupport that pseudo-bulge is the primary origin of the bulge.

This paper presents a variety of computational\n(information processing) approaches, including an info-computational approach\nto cognition, where natural structures represent information and dynamical\nprocesses on natural structures are regarded as computation, relative to an\nobserving cognizing agent. We model cognition as a web of concurrent\nmorphological computations, driven by processes of self-assembly,\nself-organisation, and autopoiesis across physical, chemical, and biological\ndomains. We examine recent findings linking morphological computation,\nmorphogenesis, agency, basal cognition, extended evolutionary synthesis, and\nactive inference. We establish a connection to Magnanis Eco-Cognitive\nComputationalism and the idea of computational domestication of ignorant\nentities. Novel theoretical and applied insights question the boundaries of\nconventional computational models of cognition. The traditional models\nprioritize symbolic processing and often neglect the inherent constraints and\npotentialities in the physical embodiment of agents on different levels of\norganization.

Informational structures are properties of the material\nsubstrate, and when focusing on the behavior of the substrate, we discuss\nmorphological computing (MC).

Information and computation are inseparably connected with cognition.\nThis chapter explores research connecting nature as a computational structure\nfor a cognizer, with morphological computation, morphogenesis, agency, extended\ncognition, and extended evolutionary synthesis, using examples of the free\nenergy principle and active inference. It introduces theoretical and practical\napproaches challenging traditional computational models of cognition limited to\nabstract symbol processing, highlighting the computational capacities inherent\nin the material substrate (embodiment).

    "abstract": "Pre-trained large deep learning models are now serving as the dominant\ncomponent for downstream middleware users and have revolutionized the learning\nparadigm, replacing the traditional approach of training from scratch locally.\nTo reduce development costs, developers often integrate third-party pre-trained\ndeep neural networks (DNNs) into their intelligent software systems. However,\nutilizing untrusted DNNs presents significant security risks, as these models\nmay contain intentional backdoor defects resulting from the black-box training\nprocess. These backdoor defects can be activated by hidden triggers, allowing\nattackers to maliciously control the model and compromise the overall\nreliability of the intelligent software. To ensure the safe adoption of DNNs in\ncritical software systems, it is crucial to establish a backdoor defect\ndatabase for localization studies. This paper addresses this research gap by\nintroducing BDefects4NN, the first backdoor defect database, which provides\nlabeled backdoor-defected DNNs at the neuron granularity and enables controlled\nlocalization studies of defect root causes. In BDefects4NN, we define three\ndefect injection rules and employ four representative backdoor attacks across\nfour popular network architectures and three widely adopted datasets, yielding\na comprehensive database of 1,654 backdoor-defected DNNs with four defect\nquantities and varying infected neurons. Based on BDefects4NN, we conduct\nextensive experiments on evaluating six fault localization criteria and two\ndefect repair techniques, which show limited effectiveness for backdoor\ndefects.

However, they generally use predefined network structures to\npredict landmarks, which tends to learn general features and leads to mediocre\nperformance, e.g., they perform well on neutral samples but struggle with faces\nexhibiting large poses or occlusions. Moreover, they cannot effectively deal\nwith semantic gaps and ambiguities among features at different scales, which\nmay hinder them from learning efficient features. To address the above issues,\nin this paper, we propose a Dynamic Semantic-Aggregation Transformer (DSAT) for\nmore discriminative and representative feature (i.e., specialized feature)\nlearning. Specifically, a Dynamic Semantic-Aware (DSA) model is first proposed\nto partition samples into subsets and activate the specific pathways for them\nby estimating the semantic correlations of feature channels, making it possible\nto learn specialized features from each subset. Then, a novel Dynamic Semantic\nSpecialization (DSS) model is designed to mine the homogeneous information from\nfeatures at different scales for eliminating the semantic gap and ambiguities\nand enhancing the representation ability. Finally, by integrating the DSA model\nand DSS model into our proposed DSAT in both dynamic architecture and dynamic\nparameter manners, more specialized features can be learned for achieving more\nprecise face alignment. It is interesting to show that harder samples can be\nhandled by activating more feature channels.

    "abstract": "Humans naturally interact with their 3D surroundings using language, and\nmodeling 3D language fields for scene understanding and interaction has gained\ngrowing interest. This paper introduces ChatSplat, a system that constructs a\n3D language field, enabling rich chat-based interaction within 3D space. Unlike\nexisting methods that primarily use CLIP-derived language features focused\nsolely on segmentation, ChatSplat facilitates interaction on three levels:\nobjects, views, and the entire 3D scene. For view-level interaction, we\ndesigned an encoder that encodes the rendered feature map of each view into\ntokens, which are then processed by a large language model (LLM) for\nconversation. At the scene level, ChatSplat combines multi-view tokens,\nenabling interactions that consider the entire scene. For object-level\ninteraction, ChatSplat uses a patch-wise language embedding, unlike LangSplat's\npixel-wise language embedding that implicitly includes mask and embedding.\nHere, we explicitly decouple the language embedding into separate mask and\nfeature map representations, allowing more flexible object-level interaction.\nTo address the challenge of learning 3D Gaussians posed by the complex and\ndiverse distribution of language embeddings used in the LLM, we introduce a\nlearnable normalization technique to standardize these embeddings, facilitating\neffective learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ChatSplat\nsupports multi-level interactions -- object, view, and scene -- within 3D\nspace, enhancing both understanding and engagement.",

In this process, researchers need to explore a set\nof synthetic reactions to transform starting molecules into intermediates step\nby step until the target novel molecule is obtained.

First, researchers need\nto make decisions among numerous possible synthetic reactions at each step,\nconsidering various criteria (e.g., yield, experimental duration, and the count\nof experimental steps) to construct the synthetic route. Second, they must\nconsider the potential impact of one choice at each step on the overall\nsynthetic route.

Their widespread use, as well as the fact that CLIP\nmodels are trained on image-text pairs from the web, make them both a\nworthwhile and relatively easy target for backdoor attacks. As training\nfoundational models, such as CLIP, from scratch is very expensive, this paper\nfocuses on cleaning potentially poisoned models via fine-tuning. We first show\nthat existing cleaning techniques are not effective against simple structured\ntriggers used in Blended or BadNet backdoor attacks, exposing a critical\nvulnerability for potential real-world deployment of these models. Then, we\nintroduce PAR, Perturb and Recover, a surprisingly simple yet effective\nmechanism to remove backdoors from CLIP models. Through extensive experiments\nacross different encoders and types of backdoor attacks, we show that PAR\nachieves high backdoor removal rate while preserving good standard performance.\nFinally, we illustrate that our approach is effective even only with synthetic\ntext-image pairs, i.e. without access to real training data.

Despite the promising progress made in the field, it remains a\nchallenging and critical problem to generate videos with accurate poses and\nfine-grained facial details simultaneously. Essentially, facial motion is often\nhighly complex to model precisely, and the one-shot source face image cannot\nprovide sufficient appearance guidance during generation due to dynamic pose\nchanges. To tackle the problem, we propose to jointly learn motion and\nappearance codebooks and perform multi-scale codebook compensation to\neffectively refine both the facial motion conditions and appearance features\nfor talking face image decoding. Specifically, the designed multi-scale motion\nand appearance codebooks are learned simultaneously in a unified framework to\nstore representative global facial motion flow and appearance patterns. Then,\nwe present a novel multi-scale motion and appearance compensation module, which\nutilizes a transformer-based codebook retrieval strategy to query complementary\ninformation from the two codebooks for joint motion and appearance\ncompensation. The entire process produces motion flows of greater flexibility\nand appearance features with fewer distortions across different scales,\nresulting in a high-quality talking head video generation framework.

In product aggregation, the bullwhip ratio is analyzed in the\ncontext of products with either uncorrelated or correlated demands and orders.\nSeasonality is also examined to study its effect on the bullwhip ratio.

While existing\nsemi-supervised methods have been successful in image segmentation across\nvarious medical imaging modalities, few have attempted to design methods\nspecifically addressing the challenges posed by the poor contrast, blurred edge\ndetails and noise of echocardiography. These characteristics pose challenges to\nthe generation of high-quality pseudo-labels in semi-supervised segmentation\nbased on Mean Teacher. Inspired by human reflection on erroneous practices, we\ndevise an error reflection strategy for echocardiography semi-supervised\nsegmentation architecture. The process triggers the model to reflect on\ninaccuracies in unlabeled image segmentation, thereby enhancing the robustness\nof pseudo-label generation. Specifically, the strategy is divided into two\nsteps. The first step is called reconstruction reflection. The network is\ntasked with reconstructing authentic proxy images from the semantic masks of\nunlabeled images and their auxiliary sketches, while maximizing the structural\nsimilarity between the original inputs and the proxies. The second step is\ncalled guidance correction. Reconstruction error maps decouple unreliable\nsegmentation regions. Then, reliable data that are more likely to occur near\nhigh-density areas are leveraged to guide the optimization of unreliable data\npotentially located around decision boundaries. Additionally, we introduce an\neffective data augmentation strategy, termed as multi-scale mixing up strategy,\nto minimize the empirical distribution gap between labeled and unlabeled images\nand perceive diverse scales of cardiac anatomical structures.

To measure their\nprevalence, we design a novel automated risk detection framework that leverages\nprogram analysis and natural language processing techniques to automatically\nidentify potential risks in VSCode extensions. By applying our tool to 27,261\nreal-world VSCode extensions, we discover that 8.5% of them (i.e., 2,325\nextensions) are exposed to credential-related data leakage through various\nvectors, such as commands, user input, and configurations. Our study sheds\nlight on the security challenges and flaws of the extension-in-IDE paradigm and\nprovides suggestions and recommendations for improving the security of VSCode\nextensions and mitigating the risks of data exposure.",

In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both\ntwo-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results,\ncalled the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a\nprobability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of\nrandom partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any\nreconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP).\nIn the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency\namong multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high\nlikelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast,\nlow-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards\nnoise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the\niteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results\nusing the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing\nrandom partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that\nthe similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or\nartifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array\nsignals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a\nprerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the\noptimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and\nartifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving\nsparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation\nand real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.",

The poor upper bound on time\ncomplexity makes the algorithm lack robustness when dealing with extreme cases,\nand the inefficient storage structure struggles to balance vertex merging and\nneighborhood traversal operations, leading to poor performance on real-life\ngraphs.

A unified\nequation of state is formulated to describe various phases of quark matter,\nincluding up-down quark matter $(2SC)$, strange quark matter $(2SC+s)$, and the\nColour-Flavor Locked $(CFL)$ phase. By employing a systematic reparametrisation\nand rescaling, the number of degrees of freedom in the equation of state is\nsignificantly reduced. Utilising the Buchdahl-I metric ansatz and a linear\n$f(Q)$ functional form, $f(Q)=\\alpha_{0}+\\alpha_{1}Q$, we derive the exact\nsolutions of the Einstein field equations in presence of the unified\ninteracting quark matter equation of state. For the $2SC$ phase, we examine the\nproperties of quark stars composed of up-down quark matter. For the\n$(2SC+s)$and $CFL$ phases, we incorporate the effects of a finite strange quark\nmass $(m_{s}\\neq0)$. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are numerically\nsolved to determine the maximum mass-radius relations for each phase. Our\nresults indicate that the model satisfies key physical criteria, including\ncausality, energy conditions, and stability requirements, ensuring the\nviability of the configurations. Furthermore, the predicted radii for certain\ncompact star candidates align well with observational data. The study\nhighlights that quark stars composed of interacting quark matter within the\n$f(Q)$ gravity framework provide a robust and physically consistent stellar\nmodel across all considered phases.",

Aiming at accelerating the uncertainty quantification in\nmulti-setup OMA, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based algorithm is proposed\nby reformulating the Hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood function\n(NLLF) as a sum of simplified components corresponding to the complete-data\nNLLF. Matrix calculus is employed to derive these components in a compact\nmanner, resulting in expressions similar to those in the single-setup case.\nThis similarity allows for the reuse of existing Bayesian single-setup OMA\ncodes, simplifying implementation. The singularity caused by mode shape norm\nconstraints is addressed through null space projection, eliminating potential\nnumerical errors from the conventional pseudoinverse operation. A sparse\nassembly strategy is further adopted, avoiding unnecessary calculations and\nstorage of predominant zero elements in the Hessian matrix. The proposed method\nis then validated through a comprehensive parametric study and applied to a\nmulti-setup OMA of a high-rise building.

The X-ray emission of the\nremnant is suspected to show features of overionized plasma, which would\nrequire peculiar evolutionary paths. We report on the first observation of\nSagittarius A East with X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM).\nEquipped with a combination of high-resolution microcalorimeter spectrometer\nand large field-of-view CCD imager, we for the first time resolved the Fe XXV\nK-shell lines into fine structure lines and measured the forbidden-to-resonance\nintensity ratio to be $1.39\\pm0.12$, which strongly suggests the presence of\noverionized plasma. We obtained a reliable constraint on the ionization\ntemperature just before the transition into the overionization state, to be > 4\nkeV. The recombination timescale was constrained to be < $8\\times10^{11}$\ncm$^{-3}$ s. The small velocity dispersion of $109\\pm6$ km s$^{-1}$ indicates a\nlow Fe ion temperature < 8 keV and a small expansion velocity < 200 km\ns$^{-1}$. The high initial ionization temperature and small recombination\ntimescale suggest that either rapid cooling of the plasma via adiabatic\nexpansion from dense circumstellar material or intense photoionization by\nSagittarius A* in the past may have triggered the overionization.",

The\ngoal is to recover an estimate of $S$ from a set of independently drawn traces.\nIn the case that all $p_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ this is the standard trace\nreconstruction problem. We show two complementary results. First, for\nworst-case strings $S$ and any deletion probability at least order\n$1/\\sqrt{n}$, no algorithm can approximate $S$ to constant $\\ell_\\infty$\ndistance or $\\ell_1$ distance $o(\\sqrt n)$ using fewer than\n$2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})}$ traces.

However,\nmanual segmentation of the GTV over the course of therapy is time-consuming and\nprone to interobserver variability. Deep learning (DL) has the potential to\novercome these challenges by automatically delineating GTVs. In this study, our\nteam, $\\textit{UW LAIR}$, tackled the challenges of both pre-radiotherapy\n(pre-RT) (Task 1) and mid-radiotherapy (mid-RT) (Task 2) tumor volume\nsegmentation. To this end, we developed a series of DL models for longitudinal\nGTV segmentation. The backbone of our models for both tasks was SegResNet with\ndeep supervision. For Task 1, we trained the model using a combined dataset of\npre-RT and mid-RT MRI data, which resulted in the improved aggregated Dice\nsimilarity coefficient (DSCagg) on an internal testing set compared to models\ntrained solely on pre-RT MRI data. In Task 2, we introduced mask-aware\nattention modules, enabling pre-RT GTV masks to influence intermediate features\nlearned from mid-RT data. This attention-based approach yielded slight\nimprovements over the baseline method, which concatenated mid-RT MRI with\npre-RT GTV masks as input. In the final testing phase, the ensemble of 10\npre-RT segmentation models achieved an average DSCagg of 0.794, with 0.745 for\nprimary GTV (GTVp) and 0.844 for metastatic lymph nodes (GTVn) in Task 1.

To this end, we carry out a fully quantum simulation\non a classical hardware, of a massive Schwinger model, which well mimics QCD as\nit shares the important properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry\nbreaking. We focus on the real-time evolution of the Wigner function, namely,\nthe two-point correlation function, which approximates quark momentum\ndistribution. In the context of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and\nthe evolution of entropy, our solution reveals the emergence of quantum\nthermalization in quark-gluon plasma with a strong coupling constant, while\nthermalization fails progressively as a consequence of the gradually increased\nsignificance of quantum many-body scar states in a more weakly coupled system.\nMore importantly, we observe the non-trivial role of the topological vacuum in\nthermalization, as the thermalization properties differ dramatically in the\nparity-even and parity-odd components of the Wigner function.",

While several studies have investigated\nthe convergence rates in the strongly-convex-strongly-convex (SC-SC) setting,\nno prior work has proven that a single-loop algorithm can achieve linear\nconvergence. This paper employs a small-gain theorem in {robust control theory}\nto demonstrate that a single-loop algorithm based on the implicit function\ntheorem attains a linear convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\rho^{k})$, where\n$\\rho\\in(0,1)$ is specified in Theorem 3.

We prove that each component exhibits a bounded gain\nand that, with carefully designed step sizes, their cascade accommodates a\nproduct gain strictly less than one. Consequently, the overall algorithm can be\nproven to achieve a linear convergence rate, as guaranteed by the small-gain\ntheorem.

    "abstract": "Rotating the activation and weight matrices to reduce the influence of\noutliers in large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted significant\nattention, particularly in the context of model quantization. Prior studies\nhave shown that in low-precision quantization scenarios, such as 4-bit weights\nand 4-bit activations (W4A4), randomized Hadamard transforms can achieve\nsignificantly higher accuracy than randomized orthogonal transforms. Notably,\nthe reason behind this phenomenon remains unknown. In this paper, we find that\nthese transformations show substantial improvement in eliminating outliers for\ncommon tokens and achieve similar quantization error. The primary reason for\nthe accuracy difference lies in the fact that randomized Hadamard transforms\ncan slightly reduce the quantization error for tokens with massive activations\nwhile randomized orthogonal transforms increase the quantization error. Due to\nthe extreme rarity of these tokens and their critical impact on model accuracy,\nwe consider this a long-tail optimization problem, and therefore construct a\nsimple yet effective method: a weighted loss function. Additionally, we propose\nan optimization strategy for the rotation matrix that involves alternating\noptimization of quantization parameters while employing orthogonal Procrustes\ntransforms to refine the rotation matrix. This makes the distribution of the\nrotated activation values more conducive to quantization, especially for tokens\nwith massive activations. Our method enhances the Rotated LLMs by achieving\ndual free, Outlier-Free and Massive Activation-Free, dubbed as DFRot. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DFRot. By tuning\nthe rotation matrix using just a single sample, DFRot achieves a perplexity\nimprovement of 0.98 and 0.95 on W4A4KV4 and W4A4KV16, respectively, for\nLLaMA3-70B, a model known for its quantization challenges.",

    "abstract": "Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a\ndynamical black hole for an arbitrary theory of gravity obtained from a\ndiffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian via the Noether charge method. We present\nan alternative, pedagogical derivation of the dynamical black hole entropy for\n$f(R)$ gravity as well as canonical scalar-tensor theory by means of conformal\ntransformations. First, in general relativity we generalize Visser and Yan's\npedagogical proof of the non-stationary physical process first law to black\nholes that may not be in vacuum, and give a pedagogical derivation of the\nsecond-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum\nperturbations by considering the second-order variation of the Raychaudhuri\nequation. Second, we apply the derivation for general relativity to theories in\nthe Einstein frames, and then recast the conclusions in their original frames.\nWe show that the dynamical black hole entropy formulae of these theories\nsatisfy both the non-stationary physical process first law and the\nnon-stationary comparison first law via the Einstein frame. We further study\nthe second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum\nperturbations, and observe that the second law is obeyed at second order in\nthose theories. Using the Einstein frame, we also determine the relationship\nbetween the dynamical black hole entropy and the Wald entropy of the\ngeneralized apparent horizon in the original frame.",

    "abstract": "Current theories of diffusiophoresis in porous media are limited to a porous\nmedium saturated with a valence symmetric electrolyte. A predictive model for\ndiffusiophoresis in porous media saturated with a valence asymmetric\nelectrolyte, or a general mixture of valence symmetric and asymmetric\nelectrolytes, is lacking. To close this knowledge gap, in this work we develop\na mathematical model, based upon the regular perturbation method and numerical\nintegration, to compute the diffusiophoretic mobility of a colloid in porous\nmedia saturated with a general mixture of electrolytes. We model the\nelectrokinetics using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations and the fluid\ntransport in porous media using the Brinkman equation with an electric body\nforce. We report three novel key findings. First, we demonstrate that, in the\nsame electrolyte concentration gradient, lowering the permeability of the\nporous medium can significantly weaken the colloid diffusiophoretic motion.\nSecond, we show that, surprisingly, by using a valence asymmetric electrolyte\nthe colloid diffusiophoretic motion in a denser porous medium can be stronger\nthan that in a less dense porous medium saturated with a symmetric electrolyte.\nThird, we demonstrate that varying the composition of an electrolyte mixture\ndoes not only change the strength of the colloid diffusiophoretic motion\ndrastically, but also qualitatively its direction. The model developed from\nthis work can be used to understand and predict natural phenomena such as\nintracellular transport, as well as design technological applications such as\nenhanced oil recovery, nanoparticle drug delivery, and colloidal species\nseparation.",

Its unique structure and\ncharacteristics provide significant advantages in feature extraction. However,\nwith the exponential growth of data scale, classical computing architectures\nface serious challenges in terms of time efficiency and memory requirements. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel quantum convolutional neural network algorithm.\nIt can flexibly adjust the stride to accommodate different tasks while ensuring\nthat the required qubits do not increase proportionally with the size of the\nsliding window. First, a data loading method based on quantum superposition is\npresented, which is able to exponentially reduce space requirements.\nSubsequently, quantum subroutines for convolutional layers, pooling layers, and\nfully connected layers are designed, fully replicating the core functions of\nclassical convolutional neural networks. Among them, the quantum arithmetic\ntechnique is introduced to recover the data position information of the\ncorresponding receptive field through the position information of the feature,\nwhich makes the selection of step size more flexible. Moreover, parallel\nquantum amplitude estimation and swap test techniques are employed, enabling\nparallel feature extraction. Analysis shows that the method can achieve\nexponential acceleration of data scale in less memory compared with its\nclassical counterpart.

Existing\nliterature addresses this challenge for image datasets through vector\nrepresentations jointly trained on natural language and images.

A key\ninnovation lies in its flexibility to select a subset of users for decoding the\ncommon stream, enhancing interference management and system performance. The\nsystem is designed by minimizing the Cram\\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for joint\ndistance and angle estimation through optimized power allocation, common rate\nallocation, and user selection. This leads to a discrete, non-convex\noptimization problem. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the preconfigured beams\nare sufficient for target sensing, eliminating the need for additional probing\nsignals. To solve the optimization problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed\ncombining the quadratic transform and simulated annealing. Simulation results\nindicate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional RSMA\nand space division multiple access (SDMA), reducing distance and angle\nestimation errors by approximately 100\\% and 20\\%, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in producing more human controllable and effective\noutputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection\nproblem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods\nprimarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that\naligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction\ntuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target\ntask. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e.,\ncross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a\nmonotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment\nundermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for\ntask-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a\nnovel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages\npairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for\ntask-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence\nformulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a\nfew-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training\ndata points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5\\% of the\ntraining data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared\nto fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other\nstate-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning.\nOur qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our\nmethod across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.",

However, over-reliance on image\nenhancement, limited high-quality nighttime data, and a lack of integration\nbetween daytime and nighttime trackers hinder the development of an end-to-end\ntrainable framework. Additionally, current ViT-based trackers demand heavy\ncomputational resources due to their reliance on the self-attention mechanism.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel pure Mamba-based tracking framework\n(MambaNUT) that employs a state space model with linear complexity as its\nbackbone, incorporating a single-stream architecture that integrates feature\nlearning and template-search coupling within Vision Mamba. We introduce an\nadaptive curriculum learning (ACL) approach that dynamically adjusts sampling\nstrategies and loss weights, thereby improving the model's ability of\ngeneralization. Our ACL is composed of two levels of curriculum schedulers: (1)\nsampling scheduler that transforms the data distribution from imbalanced to\nbalanced, as well as from easier (daytime) to harder (nighttime) samples; (2)\nloss scheduler that dynamically assigns weights based on the size of the\ntraining set and IoU of individual instances. Exhaustive experiments on\nmultiple nighttime UAV tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed\nMambaNUT achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring lower\ncomputational costs.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in video-large language models (Video-LLMs) have led to\nsignificant progress in video understanding. Current preference optimization\nmethods often rely on proprietary APIs or human-annotated captions to generate\npreference data (i.e., pairs of model outputs ranked by quality or alignment\nwith human judgment), which is then used to train models for video-language\nalignment. This approach is both costly and labor-intensive. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce VideoSAVi (Self-Aligned Video Language Model), a\nself-training pipeline that enables Video-LLMs to learn from video content\nwithout external supervision. Our approach includes a self-critiquing mechanism\nthat identifies reasoning errors in the model's initial responses and generates\nimproved alternatives, creating preference pairs directly from video content.\nVideoSAVi then applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to iteratively\ntrain the model using the preference data, thus enhancing its temporal and\nspatial reasoning for video understanding. Experiments show that VideoSAVi\ndelivers significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, including a +4.2\npercentage point gain on MVBench, +3.9 on PerceptionTest, and +6.8 on the\nchallenging EgoSchema dataset compared to baseline models.

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework for training 3D image-conditioned diffusion\nmodels using only 2D supervision. Recovering 3D structure from 2D images is\ninherently ill-posed due to the ambiguity of possible reconstructions, making\ngenerative models a natural choice. However, most existing 3D generative models\nrely on full 3D supervision, which is impractical due to the scarcity of\nlarge-scale 3D datasets. To address this, we propose leveraging sparse-view\nsupervision as a scalable alternative. While recent reconstruction models use\nsparse-view supervision with differentiable rendering to lift 2D images to 3D,\nthey are predominantly deterministic, failing to capture the diverse set of\nplausible solutions and producing blurry predictions in uncertain regions. A\nkey challenge in training 3D diffusion models with 2D supervision is that the\nstandard training paradigm requires both the denoising process and supervision\nto be in the same modality. We address this by decoupling the noisy samples\nbeing denoised from the supervision signal, allowing the former to remain in 3D\nwhile the latter is provided in 2D. Our approach leverages suboptimal\npredictions from a deterministic image-to-3D model-acting as a \"teacher\"-to\ngenerate noisy 3D inputs, enabling effective 3D diffusion training without\nrequiring full 3D ground truth. We validate our framework on both object-level\nand scene-level datasets, using two different 3D Gaussian Splat (3DGS)\nteachers. Our results show that our approach consistently improves upon these\ndeterministic teachers, demonstrating its effectiveness in scalable and\nhigh-fidelity 3D generative modeling.
